<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>People ask me whether I travel for pleasure or profit, but I
am unable to say.&nbsp; I should make a great deal more money if
I stayed at home, in Pimlico or Putney, writing books about the
Pacific: about places I have never seen; about the people I
should hate to meet.&nbsp; But I do not desire only to make
money, though I desire that passionately enough at times, times
when I feel like a poor relation.&nbsp; If I must work to
live,&mdash;and thank God for the necessity!&mdash;a thousand
thousand times more must I live to work.&nbsp; In addition to
this I am terribly afraid of being hustled off to another world
before I have had time to find the one perfect spot in
this.&nbsp; And is there not always, always the something
more!&nbsp; Perhaps this is why I find myself unable to
rest.&nbsp; There are people who go to the same English seaside
resort every summer of their lives, and they are&mdash;well, that
sort of people.&nbsp; And very nice, truly sane people,
too.&nbsp; Or is it only that their madness lies in some
altogether different direction?</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>For
myself, I am always thinking, &ldquo;There is something better:
other places, other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boredom drives me; the dust and ashes of the easily obtainable
drive me; strangeness draws me like a master hand on my
heartstrings.</p>
<p>And yet I do not know why.&nbsp; I am happy in a house of my
own, or a single room of my own.&nbsp; I love my books, my own
household gods.&nbsp; But there is something else, another
self&mdash;and I would give much to know how many other people
are charmed and tortured by this other self&mdash;which is like a
bird deep within me; deep in some dark and tropical forest, among
trees so high that no wind touches it; nesting quiet beneath the
leaves until something or some one whistles it away out of its
wood.&nbsp; I am drawn by some instinct akin to that which sets
the swallow, while suns are yet warm in England, longing beyond
all denial for Africa&mdash;that glare and glamour and heartbreak
which is Africa.&nbsp; Drawn like a lark from its happy nest in
the grass, aspiring to the skies.</p>
<p>One is not really happy traveling, one is most happy in
remembering.&nbsp; It is, indeed, like hanging one&rsquo;s memory
with a magic web in which one must have done all one&rsquo;s own
weaving, with much hard work, with weariness and many
denials.&nbsp; A web of gold and drab and black and opal tints; a
<a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>web like
the canopy of the Milky Way, with dark patches toward which one
never once looks back.&nbsp; For altogether safe and comfortable
traveling, in which one is surrounded by everything to which one
is accustomed&mdash;and how many people ask, &ldquo;Was it
comfortable?&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Was it
wonderful?&rdquo;&mdash;is nothing to be accounted of.</p>
<p>To live wonderfully, to live adventurously, to live by the
skin of one&rsquo;s teeth.&nbsp; It would be an ill world if
every one were like this, but I cannot help myself, that&rsquo;s
how I am.&nbsp; And, though it is altogether as a shifting magic
web that I look back upon my adventure, I feel it best to leave
the greater part of it in this book just as I wrote it, sitting
in boats or canoes, standing in crowded streets or market-places,
in a native hut or at the door of my tent, as much in the moment
and upon the spot as though I were drawing actual portraits of
places, of people, and of my own impression of them.</p>
<p>The real loss in writing about such a venture lies in the fact
that the scenes, at first so strange, the people, the material of
life itself, one&rsquo;s altogether changed method of meeting it,
become in so short a time a commonplace, that one forgets that
there are still many people to whom it is all glamour or
altogether unknown.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>A
ship so quickly becomes a home, with all the queer little ups and
downs of home life, an endless succession of strange ports no
more wonderful than a succession of strange streets less than a
mile away from one&rsquo;s own doorstep, that, far from
exaggerating, it is with difficulty that one can jerk one&rsquo;s
memory back to the wonder of the first keen impression: the
effect upon one of the first flight of flying-fish, like fine
elfin silver scimitars of the sea, the first fringe of palms upon
a white strand.&nbsp; It is hard to realize that there are many
thousands who have never seen a Portuguese man-of-war, or
nautilus, with all its tiny orchid-like sails set, indomitably
sailing a momentary tranquil, perfectly blue, and yet to
it&mdash;no larger in all its pride and panoply than half a
thumb&rsquo;s length&mdash;unending ocean.&nbsp; Only by an
effort does one remember that there are still, even in these
days, many who have not so much as edged upon the unexplored
desert of the Sargasso Sea; been in the company of a man who has
dined upon his fellows, with relish and without
self-consciousness; consorted with widows who regard it as no
more than a commonplace decency of mourning to blacken themselves
from head to foot, wear an assortment of their husbands&rsquo;
bones slung about their necks, so that the fact of any one of
them choosing to pose for <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>her photograph with the dear
departed&rsquo;s skull clasped in both hands upon her knee seems
no whit more peculiar than that English beauties should be
pictured showing every tooth&mdash;which is, after all, no more
than a sort of bone, made to be decently covered by the
lips&mdash;in an unending and unvarying smirk.</p>
<p>But, then, what an amazing thing is this affair of modes and
morals.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s own quick readaptation.&nbsp; Upon the
Trobriand Islands, for instance,&mdash;where for some happy and
never-to-be-forgotten weeks I reigned as king,&mdash;it was
regarded as in some ways a want of delicacy to allow worms to
devour your dead relatives when you might so well, and with
profit, perform that last office for yourself; whereas in Fiji,
even in the fiercest days of cannibalism, it was looked upon as
the worst sort of form to dish up your own relative, even an
in-law.&nbsp; Again, to show the difficulty there is in
preserving any kind of fixed standard, we have that curious
custom of the people in the Marquesas Islands in which, far from
virginity being counted as a virtue, the bride gains in value, in
consideration, by the number of men of her own village with whom
she has consorted upon the night before her marriage; while one
can imagine no more vile crime in the eyes of any truly <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>moral Marquesan
than the denial involved in taking the veil.</p>
<p>Is it strange, then, that among all these changes one finds
oneself doing quite naturally things which one never could, at
home in England, have imagined oneself as doing?&nbsp; Though
there is still the liability of a sudden, sweeping wonder as to
how you come to be where you are, or if it is, indeed, you
yourself; a longing for the little dog of the nursery rhyme to
prove to you your own identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this be I, as I should hope it be,<br />
I&rsquo;ve a little dog at home and he&rsquo;ll know me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it could but end in one way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Home went the little woman all in the dark,<br />
Up jumped the little dog and he began to bark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember well at one odd little hotel where I was stranded,
waiting for a boat&mdash;a place frequented by gold-diggers,
searchers after osmium-iridium and oil, missionaries,
pearl-buyers, and people who purchased ancient vessels for no
other reason than to insure and wreck them&mdash;getting so tired
of the sound of a violent and noisy quarrel, which went on late
into the night in a neighboring room, sounds which at home in
England would <a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>have scared and shocked me, that, rising in my wrath,
slipping into a dressing-gown, I went off to find out what could
be done to stop it.</p>
<p>I can see that scene now.&nbsp; It was a very small room, full
of men in pajamas or trousers and singlets,&mdash;the latter so
torn open that they did not count,&mdash;beer bottles and
glasses; how the most enraged of them found space to fling up and
down it, I don&rsquo;t know, but he did, while I myself was drawn
by the eddy to a seat on the bed between two other men.</p>
<p>The dispute was upon an affair which really did touch the
striding man&rsquo;s honor, but still there was no necessity to
make such a bellow about it.&nbsp; When I pointed this out, said
that if they would all stop talking at once I might get at
something of the truth, far from telling me to go back to my own
room, mind my own business, they all turned to me, appealed to
me, with a: &ldquo;Look here, you&rsquo;re a woman of the world,
and you know . . .&nbsp; He said . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;He said
. . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;He said . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their eagerness the men beside me caught my arms and tugged
until I got to my feet and, snatching the aggrieved one by the
sleeve, entreated him to cease making an ass of himself.</p>
<p>It was all settled at last by my promise to go <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>out at
seven next morning, the moment the wireless office was open, and
myself, at my own expense, send off a message with a prepaid
answer which would clench the matter once for all.&nbsp; And I
remember how it ended too&mdash;what I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now stop making a nuisance of yourself, and get off
to bed, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was one of the occasions when, returning to my own room,
I found myself wondering if this was, indeed, I.</p>
<p>And again, though a very different setting, this: The dense
black-velvet mask of a moonless and starless tropical night; one
of those nights when you hear the swish of the palms above your
head, the sea at your feet, and see nothing, not so much as the
ghost of a crested wave, the tremor of a pale-gray stem; when the
very fireflies seem abashed into darkness by the immensity of
unilluminated space.&nbsp; At such a time was I carried on shore
upon a strange island, having put off in a dinghy from a cutter,
wind-driven with a force which separated us as entirely from
civilization as though the main and altogether sophisticated
island of the group were the width of the Atlantic away; borne in
the arms of a gigantic native through the water to the shore and
deposited there, with the sound, the gentle stir, of a multitude
of <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>strange, totally unseen people all around me.&nbsp; My
pack, with a few personal belongings which might have helped me
to prove my own identity to myself, with the help of Cash&rsquo;s
woven names,&mdash;though Heaven knows that names which nobody
can read or pronounce, giving no indication of tribe or
&ldquo;pigeon,&rdquo; mean little enough to anybody once you are
off the beaten path and there is nobody to bolster up your
dignity by taking it for granted that you are one of the
so-and-so&rsquo;s of so-and-so,&mdash;was awash in a very
insecurely anchored boat, the best part of a quarter of a mile
out to sea.</p>
<p>But here I am forestalling myself, for this is a tale to be
told in its proper place and at its proper time, more especially
recorded because it was the only time when I ever felt really and
truly frightened.&nbsp; Not that this is any boast or proof of
courage, but rather that, sliding eastward by the West as I did,
everything seemed in its own time and place to be so inevitable,
and so altogether as it should be.</p>

<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">People</span> use Marseilles as a
jumping-off place; but to me it is an enchantment, a hot-pot of
strangeness and beauty and villainies.&nbsp; The door of the
East; the East itself done out, not in the hot colors of oil
paint, but in pastels of infinite softness, hinting and
beckoning, smiling, leering, threatening, enchanting.</p>
<p>The little streets run like outstretched fingers from the palm
of the main streets, clutching the world, with every nationality
and every tongue dripping through them; narrow streets with high
white and cream-colored buildings on each side and green and blue
outside shutters; incredibly narrow alleys with bister-colored
houses, and rags of washing fluttering across them; but at the
end of each the beauty of the hills or the sea, the harbor with
its crowded shipping, its forests of masts and funnels, its quays
with men of every shade and color thick upon them, the romances
and <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>horrors
of a whole world written upon their faces.</p>
<p>Everywhere there are plane-trees; bare now, with a delicate
lace-like web of twigs against a sky which has been an unclouded
soft blue, that same pastel-like blue, throughout the three days
which have passed since I came rushing down to the South, clear
away without a break from the London fogs, to catch my boat,
which is late in arriving from Bordeaux.</p>
<p>The fishermen&rsquo;s church, La Dame de la Garde, stands high
upon its rocky jag of mountain.&nbsp; I can see it from my
bedroom window at the Hotel Terminus, set like the crowning point
of a tiara, at the end of half the aspiring streets of
Marseilles; most lovely in the evening when the sky is the color
of the skies in very old Chinese prints.</p>
<p>At that time the streets are crowded with promenaders, as are
the caf&eacute;s which debouch upon them every few yards, crowded
with, for the most part, staid revelers: little families;
husbands and wives; young men with their sweethearts; groups of
young men; groups of business men&mdash;all eating and drinking,
moderately enough and yet with a relish, a delight, which is
strange to us.</p>
<p>It seems to me, indeed, like a series of f&ecirc;te-days
coming one on top of another, those days when one laughs at
nothing in particular, drinks the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>health of every one, and no one in
particular.&nbsp; But in reality it is nothing of the sort; it
goes on just the same from day to day.&nbsp; It is the everyday
life of the South, the sort of life which, whatever it may be, is
most emphatically not English; infinitely far removed from the
drinking of beer in frowzy bars, noisy men, furtive or bold-faced
women in men&rsquo;s caps, babies in prams upon the pavement
outside.</p>
<p>The whole of the front of one large draper&rsquo;s
shop&mdash;displaying wax ladies of an almost incredible
loveliness, standing tiptoe in wages-of-sin sort of
undergarments&mdash;is aglow with an innumerable number of
rose-pink electric lights.&nbsp; In front of this shop, and
bathed in the pink lights, are flower-stalls piled high with
narcissi, carnations, mimosa, hyacinths, and violets.</p>
<p>Fresh from the hands of the hairdresser at the Hotel Terminus,
I sit on the open veranda of one of the caf&eacute;s and sip my
coffee.&nbsp; The dressing of my hair was in itself a prelude to
adventure, a sort of sloughing off of the skin of everyday
life.&nbsp; My request was for a simple and inexpensive shampoo,
and that was all I was charged for.&nbsp; But the artist, an
artist with a soul, plump as a rather overgrown Cupid, with large
ox eyes, a brosse of dark hair, deprecating and persuasive
hands,&mdash;an <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>artist with, evidently enough, an eye for
antiques,&mdash;was totally unable to leave it at that.</p>
<p>After washing my hair he tied up my head tight in a white
towel, so that I looked like a <i>religieuse</i>, and massaged
me, first with cream that smelt of lavender, then with three
different sorts of powder.&nbsp; He was very short and fat, and I
am very tall and thin.&nbsp; When he had almost finished he made
me stand up and tilted my face this way and that, as though it
had been nothing human, to get the light upon it at every
angle.&nbsp; Never in my life have I seen any one so completely
absorbed.&nbsp; As I was obliged to stoop, the whole effect,
repeated in the manifold mirrors around the room, was odd beyond
words; but like all true artists, this one was completely lacking
in the faintest sense of humor.</p>
<p>His last touch was the most wonderful of all; for with some
scented liquid on the tip of his forefinger he swept up the
eyelashes on the upper lid of each eye and left them
curling.&nbsp; Heavens above! and to think that I am now a
middle-aged woman and never before have I had curling eyelashes;
never before have I realized that my eyelashes were capable of
curling.&nbsp; So many, many things come to one altogether too
late in life.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>A man
with a wooden leg is sitting under the trees beneath my window at
the hotel.&nbsp; It makes no pretense of being anything but a
wooden leg, for there is a stump at the end of it, faintly
Panlike&mdash;so easy to notch into a hoof!&nbsp; But this very
dapper gentleman has not done that; instead, he has padded it
where the ankle should be, and wears the upper part of a very
neat&mdash;oh, but very neat!&mdash;patent-leather boot to match
the one upon his other foot, the eyelets rimmed with white and
laced with white silk ties.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To-night I dined with a man I met in London, who is also
awaiting his boat, at Le Grand Restaurant Basso, famous for its
bouillabaisse.&nbsp; I lived too dreadfully long and intimately
at one time of my life with people who guzzled bouillabaisse as
nothing else on earth can be sucked and gobbled, to go there for
that; but there were many other things at Basso&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
went, indeed, for the company and the delight of dining in the
upper room with its glazed veranda, so like the upper deck of a
ship, giving straight on to the lights of the harbor.&nbsp; The
dinner, minus bouillabaisse, was beyond criticism and very
carefully thought out: <i>Soupe de Petit Marmite</i>; a mixture
of shellfish cooked <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>with creamy white sauce in large flat shells and
deliciously named <i>Coquille de Fruit de Mer</i>; pigeons;
<i>petit pois</i>; <i>Peche Melba</i> banked round with chopped
ice, and coffee&mdash;such coffee, redolent of all the perfumes
of Araby!&nbsp; A dinner which rounded off to perfection my three
days in Marseilles.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To-day</span>, the day of my first
embarkation, dawned gray and very chilly; all the magic for the
time being gone from out Marseilles, bedraggled drab of a drunken
sailor.</p>
<p>I gave myself an hour to get to my ship, ten minutes&rsquo;
drive at most.&nbsp; But I had forgotten: cargo-boats are things
apart, &ldquo;nothing accounted of&rdquo; in Marseilles; and
though the porter at the hotel and the taxi-driver assured me
that they knew exactly where mine started from, they knew nothing
whatever about it, while I myself had been perfectly casual.</p>
<p>Quays, quays, quays!&nbsp; Search for an inconsiderable French
cargo-boat among the quays of Marseilles and the whole world
seems to be overrun with them, thick as a spider&rsquo;s
web.&nbsp; For what seemed like an eternity we rushed up and down
quays in clouds of dust; threaded tangles of quays; lost them
altogether; were caught in the hem of the town, tore ourselves
loose and raced shrieking from it; got back to our quays and were
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>no better
off; drew up innumerable times to make innumerable inquiries of
wildly excited and gesticulating men, who knew all about
everything; were held back by innumerable open bridges while the
ships of the entire world, or so it seemed, trailed their way
with a calculated and malicious slowness between the draws.&nbsp;
And all the time bells rang, whistles shrilled; steam-sirens
pierced the air with screams, every one of which I took to be the
signal for the departure of my own special ship, while I myself
stood up in the taxi exhorting the driver, in execrable French,
to pull himself together.</p>
<p>The ship, <i>El Kantara</i>, was to sail at ten o&rsquo;clock
and the representative of the Messageries Maritimes Company, to
whom she belongs, was to be there at half-past nine to introduce
me to the captain.&nbsp; It was, however, precisely three minutes
to ten when we at last sighted her, and hurtling the length of
the last quay, the taxi making such sounds as though it were the
only taxi in the world, I scrambled out of it and on board,
finding the agent, exquisitely polite&mdash;and still
polite!&mdash;waiting for me with the captain by his side.&nbsp;
A shortish, stoutly built man, this captain whom I was to find so
good a comrade, with a short, bright-brown beard, merry
bright-brown eyes, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>and a bright color; a man in whom every line and every
tint, every movement spoke of a life at sea.</p>
<p>There are some twenty first-class passengers on
board,&mdash;one Englishman and the remainder French,&mdash;with
a few more in the second class.&nbsp; But they do not really
count, so entirely is the ship built and fitted for cargo.&nbsp;
The alleyways past the cabins and beneath the central deck are
flush and open, with the crew passing to and fro unchecked; while
all decks are free to me.</p>
<p>The lower decks are crowded with live stock: cocks and hens,
loudly quacking ducks, and geese; sheep in pens, and large, mild
dun-colored oxen.&nbsp; There are soldiers being carried out to
New Caledonia, with no one apart from a petty officer over
them.&nbsp; The crew are of all nationalities and colors; in the
evening long trestle tables, decently laid, are set out on deck
for their dinner, which begins with soup, goes on to other
courses just as ours does, and ends with black coffee and
cigarettes, while bottles of wine stand all along its
length.&nbsp; As I look over the rail of the upper deck on this
first evening more than one man raises his glass to me, for they
all seem entirely friendly.&nbsp; There is a continual flow of
talk and laughter and loud argument, but they do not seem to
grumble, and I do believe that other nations vent that spleen <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>which
embitters ours by loud shouting and excited gestures leading to
nothing whatever.</p>
<p>On going down to my cabin to wash my hands for dinner I find
it lighted by two candles, for the electric light is out of
gear.&nbsp; So steady is the boat, so smooth the sea, that they
stand upright without so much as a dab of wax to fix them,
reminding me of a Spanish hotel in Tetuan at which I was staying
last year.</p>
<p>In this hotel, where there was rather fine imitation Jacobean
furniture, I noticed that all the tables and flat arms of the
chairs were covered with tallow, the reason for which was shown
to me that evening when the electric light gave out and the
incredibly shabby little waiter, wearing a dress suit which was
an epic in descent, coming round with a handful of candles,
poured yet more wax upon every convenient spot and dabbed a
lighted candle down upon it.&nbsp; That was a hotel
which&mdash;proudly advertising fitted basins and hot and cold
water in every room, with bath-rooms&mdash;used the baths as
dust-bins, while there was nothing beyond the mere basin in any
room; no plumbing of any sort; a bucket beneath to catch the
water when one pulled out the cork, and a battered enamel jug
standing by its side.</p>
<p>The boat is thick with the grime of ports, her <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>decks foul
with the trampling of many feet; while the aft decks are packed
high with those iron rods which&mdash;sent aboard her at the last
moment at Bordeaux&mdash;necessitated the shifting of much cargo
to balance her, the re-rating of the chronometers which so much
iron threw out of gear, thus accounting for her late arrival at
Marseilles.&nbsp; For a ship is like a woman in love: it takes
very little to upset her when there is nothing serious in
hand.</p>
<p><i>El Kantara</i> is by far the steadiest boat I have ever
been on, pursuing her somewhat slow way with such placidity that
whenever I think of her I think of a motherly brown hen brooding
over her young.&nbsp; To-day, however, the third day out, she
took a sea&mdash;or rather the sea took her&mdash;most uncivilly,
right across her starboard bows.</p>
<p>I was still in my bunk when a steward came running to tell me
that I must not go on deck, while the saloon, very far forward,
was so full of water that I couldn&rsquo;t go there,
either.&nbsp; At this I remembered the bridge, which the captain
had made free to me.&nbsp; Dressing hurriedly, I made my way up
there, and stood, holding to the rail, torn by the wind, the rain
running in torrents from off my oilskin; while then only, for the
first time, the full delight of the sea got me, the weariness of
land was sloughed away from me.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>We have
already passed Gibraltar.&nbsp; The coast of Morocco is dim in
the rain at one side of us, Spain less than two miles away upon
the other.&nbsp; There are steamers upon each side, pitching too
terribly, but all this while we are steady; at least quite steady
enough.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The name of the colored steward who waits upon me is Chocolat;
he has a very great deal of gold set round his white teeth,
reminding me of Solomon&rsquo;s throne, all gold and ivory.&nbsp;
I like that.&nbsp; I like the fact, also, that despite the
passengers whom I had not expected and who at first rather
appalled me, this is, indeed, a cargo-boat where one need not
spend one&rsquo;s time feverishly dragging out boxes from under
one&rsquo;s bunk, dressing and undressing, sitting with
one&rsquo;s hair in curlers, or clamoring at the
hairdresser&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>We pass Madeira at night.&nbsp; There must be some festival in
progress at Funchal, for the town glitters with lights; the
hillside is looped with them, but little less remote than the
stars.&nbsp; More remote, indeed, when I come to think of it, for
the stars are our friends, our guides, while the ephemeral lights
of land are left behind us, forgotten for a month at least.&nbsp;
The weather grows warmer each day, the sun gains in power, and <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>with the salt
and wind and sun comes that delicious languor of the sea, so that
one can sleep in a moment and wake in a moment.&nbsp; For hours
upon end the soldiers play at dominoes and draughts and cards,
with other odd games which I have not yet mastered, upon the
lower decks; while the members of the crew who are not on duty
lounge about and watch them or take a hand.</p>
<p>The warmest place on board is on the long narrow slit of upper
deck in front of the saloon, and here I love to lean over the
flat woodwork of the rail and watch the life going on beneath me,
feel the sun upon my back.</p>
<p>To-day, during the first half of the dog-watch, there was a
thick ring of backers around two men who were boxing: a tall
negro, thin, weak-looking, and hollow-cheeked, who reminded me of
the nigger of the <i>Narcissus</i>, and a small, strongly built
Frenchman, with bright black eyes, hard red cheeks, and a waxed
mustache, quivering with life and energy.&nbsp; At the first
go-off the negro seemed half asleep; his chin appeared to loll
forward on his breast; he moved his muffled hands vaguely, almost
as though he were massaging his own person as certain insects do,
swaying gently from side to side; while the Frenchman danced
around him on the tips of his toes, nimble as a cat, with <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>swift
lightning punches up at his antagonist&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I had no idea how the negro defended himself.&nbsp; To my mind
he just lolloped from side to side; but somehow or other he did
it, while all the other man&rsquo;s clean and, as it seemed,
beautifully timed blows slid aside from him.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, so suddenly that I heard myself cry out, the
negro woke to life.&nbsp; That sort of gray pallor which comes
over colored people when they are wearied or bored passed
away.&nbsp; It is certain that he grew blacker, black and shiny;
with a fierce left-hander he got the Frenchman on the jaw just as
he was stepping back, and over the little man went; but he was up
in a moment and at it again like a spirited cock-sparrow, bent
beneath a perfect hurricane of two-handed blows.&nbsp; His eyes,
bright and scared, full of astonishment, ran to and fro, putting
him completely at the mercy of the negro, whose somnolent gaze
never for a single moment left the other&rsquo;s face, while,
though drops of sweat sprayed out from him in the sunshine, he
was still entirely unexhausted.</p>
<p>The fight was interesting, but more interesting still were the
spectators.&nbsp; A lank blackguard in a red-and-white striped
singlet, with but one tooth in his head and that in the very
center of the top <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>jaw, long and yellow, kept on throwing flirtatious
glances up at the poop where I stood leaning over the rail, as if
to say, &ldquo;All this is done to please you.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
apache with inordinately long hair plastered back from his
forehead, who was painting stanchions with red lead, seemed to be
hung upon a string between his interest in the match and his
work, to which he was jerked back by the ferocious stare of the
<i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;equipage</i>, who was walking to and fro
by me, jerking his chin in my direction, as if to say: &ldquo;Did
you ever see the like of that!&rdquo;&nbsp; An efficient person
with a commanding presence, large and heavily built, florid and
bearded and fierce; so challenging that at first when I spoke to
him I thought he intended to be insolent.&nbsp; I found later on
that his manner, curt, independent, and fierce, was precisely the
same with the captain as with me; that he was in reality full of
kindness, though intolerant of idlers.&nbsp; He had been on the
ship for nineteen years&mdash;ever since she was built, indeed,
save for one short break.</p>
<p>Throughout the evenings the lower decks, both fore and aft,
are like scenes in old Dutch pictures.&nbsp; Then one hears the
thin, piercing note of mandolin and zither, while men of every
shade of color, from the fair-haired Norman soldier to the
full-blooded negro,&mdash;though there are more of the warm <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>chocolate-brown of the Malagash than any
other,&mdash;sprawl under the great lamps which hang beneath the
awnings, casting all their light downward in an umber-tinted glow
upon the sleepers, the loungers, the musicians, and the
gamblers.&nbsp; These last are now, for the most part, possessed
by a passion for a game of which I have not yet mastered the
name, played with small, round counters upon little boards
showing numbered squares; the man who holds the bank shaking a
bag unceasingly, picking out numbered counters at random,
shouting out the numbers in a loud monotone which seems to go on
thoughout the entire night.</p>
<p>The negro who is now the acknowledged champion boxer of the
<i>Kantara</i>, and is to fight another ship&rsquo;s champion in
Martinique, sits motionless hour after hour, meditatively
caressing his vast and shining biceps, while every little Jack
Sparrow among the crew spars at him jocularly, in passing, and
the stowaway&mdash;an elderly man with a rascally empurpled face
and incredibly incongruous collection of garments&mdash;earns his
tucker and tobacco, all the scraps thrown to him, by a perpetual
and ornate stream of blasphemous humor.&nbsp; I myself am liable
to fine and imprisonment when we reach Pointe-&agrave;-Pitre, for
tossing him occasional packets <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of rank French cigarettes which I
purchase from the <i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;equipage</i>, for,
after all, he is a merry rascal and little more coarse, I
suspect, than an aforetime king&rsquo;s jester.</p>
<p>When night has once really fallen, men strew the deck in every
direction.&nbsp; An hour ago, pacing a narrow slip which edges
the saloon, I as nearly as possible stepped upon a sleeper
stretched out upon bare boards; I drew back my foot just in time,
warned by nothing more than the sudden realization of two curving
rows of white teeth in an invisible face immediately beneath
it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The moon is four days old.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock this
evening it was half-way up the sky, lying upon its back in a
perfect crescent, with the fiery sun dipping to the sea beneath
it, and Venus, diamond clear, immediately above.&nbsp; The sea
was a deep peacock blue, every small ripple tipped with
gold.&nbsp; As the sun set, all was clear indigo, sea and sky
alike, the moon and that one lovely planet a shining gold, such
as could scarcely be imagined in more temperate climes.&nbsp; The
sight of it is well worth an eighteen-days&rsquo; voyage, even if
we were only to turn and go back the way we have come.</p>
<p>Every evening I go up to the fore peak and watch the sunset
with all that magnificent panoply <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of purple, silver, and gold clouds
which are part of the pageant of the trades.</p>
<p>The time is infinitely long and yet short.&nbsp; It seems as
though I could never have been anywhere else than upon this ship;
that Marseilles, indeed, is farther away than my childhood.&nbsp;
And yet each individual day slides by like light, though I am up
on deck at seven, having my coffee in my dressing-gown, while the
captain walks the deck with quick, short steps.&nbsp; He paces
thus for hour upon hour each day, wheeling back every now and
then&mdash;for he never thinks of it until he is past me&mdash;to
recount some ridiculous, amorous, or dangerous adventure; such
adventures as would make a whole book in themselves.</p>
<p>I see very little of the other passengers.&nbsp; All the
morning I work in the captain&rsquo;s own little saloon, high up
on the bridge, and in the afternoon every one else is
asleep.&nbsp; For the time being, however, there is nothing on
earth that I desire so little as human companionship; while the
voyage is so uneventful, so quiet, that the days stream out
behind me like a long, indefinitely shaded, blue-and-gray
scarf.</p>
<p>What is real is that I am writing short stories to finish a
series, of which I left the first part at <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>home; that
the food is good, and there is good red wine served at every
meal; that the captain is a good comrade when I want one, brave
and honest, the other officers pleasant and friendly, the bridge
quiet and infinitely restful.</p>
<p>It is an occasion when we all get into white
clothes,&mdash;the first epoch-making event, indeed,&mdash;and it
means a lot.&nbsp; One feels cleaner, fresher, and saner with the
sun and the air upon one&rsquo;s skin, stretching oneself in it,
breathing it all in; lazier also, for more and more often the
captain and his officers lounge at the open door talking to me,
while more and more often I put down my pen and go out upon the
open bridge, to look at&mdash;what?&mdash;the sea and the
sky.</p>
<p>There are twenty cats on board, but only one has the run of
the bridge; she sees to this for herself.&nbsp; Every morning,
when the steward brings the captain a cup of coffee, the cat
brings the captain a dead rat, fruit of a night&rsquo;s hunting,
and lays it upon the deck beside his bunk.</p>
<p>Up to now she has spent the entire day sleeping in an
arm-chair, save when, arching her back, stretching and yawning,
she aroused herself sufficiently to come down and eat and drink
what the obsequious steward had placed ready for her.&nbsp; <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Now, however,
she lies, like a tiger, stretched out upon her side upon the open
deck in front of the chart-house, and when you stoop and stroke
her you find that her fur is deliciously hot, every hair alive
with electricity.</p>

23</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the sea-gulls, if by nothing
else, I should know that we were nearing land.&nbsp; For weeks
the sea has been empty of them, but during the past two or three
days there have been thousands upon thousands, flashing white
against a flawless deep-blue sky, and early this morning we
passed the island of D&eacute;sirade,&mdash;which was among the
many islands sighted by Columbus,&mdash;a long, flat wedge upon
the very edge of the horizon.&nbsp; We make Guadeloupe soon after
midnight.</p>
<p>Pointe-&agrave;-Pitre as I saw it this morning, backed with
its panoply of mountains, is a poor place, a veritable black
man&rsquo;s town, and it is necessary to drive a good twenty
miles out into the country to get any real idea of the beauty of
the island, when it comes upon one with a sense of something like
enchantment after one has crossed the bridge at Salt River, which
is in reality a narrow strip of sea dividing the kidney-shaped
island toward the southern half.</p>
<p>Beyond this division the road begins to mount up and up in a
series of sharp hair-pin bends <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>among innumerable sugar-cone
mountains thick to the very top with vegetation, while the
scenery unrolls itself behind one like a broad and brilliant
ribbon, an endless shining pattern of bright-blue bays and
scattered isles and deep gorges; of small villages, gold and
brown like the wings of a moth, and scattered huts&mdash;the
meanest, a single room roofed with palm-leaves, set in its own
gem-like garden.&nbsp; Poinsettias; purple and rose-pink
Bougainvillea; rose and scarlet crotons; hibiscus and plumbago;
orange-trees laden with fruit; bananas with their immense banners
of shining enamel-like green leaves overhung by the glossy
foliage of breadfruit, more like shining metal than anything
else.</p>
<p>The Englishman from off the boat, with whom I maintain a
curious sort of armed neutrality,&mdash;for quite plainly he
dislikes me as much as I dislike him, and yet at times we are
glad to talk to each other in our own language,&mdash;was with
me; and for that day, at least, so great was the enchantment of
the place, we were almost friends.</p>
<p>Some fifteen miles from town we passed the cleared open place,
the pedestal and bust which mark the spot where Columbus landed;
and soon after this we came to an immense archway of gray dressed
stone, magnificent in its conception, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>giving on to a long drive bordered
with the tallest cocoanut palms that I have ever seen, towering
and perfectly upright, silver-gray stems.&nbsp; An avenue
designed to lead to something very magnificent in the way of
palace or city, but leading here, in this place,&mdash;with
&ldquo;all the glades&rsquo; colonnades,&rdquo;&mdash;to nothing
more than a rougher track, a deeper bush, a greater exuberance of
nature.&nbsp; An arch erected during the proud days of Louis XIV,
with Heaven only knows what visions of a semi-royal
colonization.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Fifty kilometers out from the port we drew up at the Hotel des
Bains for lunch, and there saw the first white faces which we had
chanced upon since starting: a couple of very slightly shaded
young French girls in delicate muslin frocks; an old man; the
French proprietor and his wife.&nbsp; Here, too, we discovered
what is of all things the most precious, the rarest and most to
be desired in life: a place where those who are sufficient to
themselves may find peace and escape from the perpetual colds,
the unutterable drab dreariness of an English winter; a place
where one might, indeed, taste the almost forgotten joy of living
within one&rsquo;s income,&mdash;or, without any great
uneasiness, upon one&rsquo;s overdraft,&mdash;living at ease in
mind and body.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>For
Monsieur Dole&rsquo;s Hotel des Bains is cheap, almost given
away, indeed, with the franc as it is: full board with wine,
thirteen to fifteen francs a day; the extravagance of a
sitting-room and wide stretch of veranda, the equivalent of one
and twopence a day in our money; board and lodging for a maid,
one and sixpence a day, for a chauffeur, one and ninepence a day;
garage accommodation for a car, twopence; with, actually, a
reduction on all this for any long stay.</p>
<p><i>D&eacute;jeuner</i> for three of us, my companion and
myself in the large, clean, open dining-room&mdash;with the
forests dipping like green-velvet mantles to the edge of the
sea&mdash;and the chauffeur somewhere in the back regions, cost
fifteen francs; roughly, four shillings.&nbsp; A salad of tomato
and onions, eggs in butter, Jerusalem artichokes in white sauce,
fresh tongue served hot with salad, a dish of wild
raspberries,&mdash;of a finer grain, harder, and brighter than
ours,&mdash;a bottle of claret apiece, iced water, and
coffee&mdash;such coffee too, freshly roasted and ground and of
the country.&nbsp; Could any one wish for anything better?&nbsp;
The whole expense increased, as was explained to us when we went
round to the back of the hotel to order the car and saw nothing
of the chauffeur,&mdash;apart from a pair of feet clad in bright
blue socks <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>hanging out over the door, while he took his siesta on
the floor,&mdash;by the fact, as one might have suspected, that
he had ordered an iced rum-punch.</p>
<p>Some day, I promise myself, I will come out to Guadeloupe
again and spend two or three months in this hotel, a perfectly
ideal place to work in.&nbsp; The beauty of the position and the
cheapness are not all there is to it, either; for five minutes
farther up the mountainside are the natural warm-water baths
after which the hotel is named: three great square pools overhung
with immense plumes of bamboo, mahogany trees hung with creepers
showing between them as though in a dark frame, the intense azure
patches of the sea far below them; pools of graduated depths, so
that one may sit or stand with the water to one&rsquo;s
chin.&nbsp; There were, indeed, a few native women sitting there
with the odd effect of black heads and shining teeth set upon a
clear metal platter of shining green, so deep was the shade; in
water that is of an unchanging warmth, so near to the temperature
of the skin that as I dipped my hand in it I could scarcely feel
it&mdash;the same temperature at midnight, at dawn, and at
midday.&nbsp; Think of that, you at home in England, with the
kitchen stove, the hot-water supply, and the cook&rsquo;s temper
forever at odds!</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Yet,
even here, where one pictures oneself with old Andrew Marvell,
&ldquo;Annihilating all that&rsquo;s made to a green thought in a
green shade,&rdquo; sorrow has found its way,&mdash;albeit the
sort of sorrow which wears a feather in its cap,&mdash;for over
the door of one of the little dressing-rooms some swain has
written these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Le c&oelig;ur est porcelaine qui se brise, mais
qui ne se raccommode pas.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Sign&eacute; Duquor: Juillet,
1923.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the hotel we drove on another fifteen miles to
Basse-Terre, down a succession of steep bends between groves of
cocoa-trees and high palms.&nbsp; Basse-Terre is a far better
town than Pointe-&agrave;-Pitre.&nbsp; In the upper part of it
are immense solid old gray-stone buildings, houses and barracks
and forts of the same period as the arch and the cocoanut avenue,
and right on the edge of the sea are modern wooden houses and
shops with brilliantly painted red-and-white and green-and-white
striped and checked and starred and spotted shutters, closed
during the heat of the day.&nbsp; In the center of its little
place is a real merry-go-round&mdash;prancing wooden horses with
flowing manes.</p>
<p>On the way back to the port we punctured a <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>tire, and
while a new one was put on we waited in an old cottage with walls
close upon three feet in thickness, where we were regaled with
mandarin oranges from a high old tree just outside the door,
dragged down by the weight of the golden fruit.&nbsp; A cottage
of one large single room, very cool and full of soft umber
lights, belonging to an old negro and his wife who showed us
photographs of their daughter married to a Frenchman and living
in Paris with her husband.&nbsp; In the beautiful, soft,
round-syllabled French used by the negroes they told us about
their other children, widely scattered throughout the world, and
at parting presented me with two treasured beans of vanilla
wrapped in newspaper which looked as though it were stained with
blood from the sweet, perfumed juice which exuded from them.</p>
<p>We were obliged to stop again on our way back, to water our
engine at a little garage over which was posted the delicious
sign of <i>Au Gracieux Sourire</i>,&mdash;think of that for a
motor-garage, with its smells!&mdash;and reached our boat with no
more than a bare five minutes to spare before she sailed.&nbsp;
Not that I myself should have greatly minded had I missed her,
provided I could raise so much as a tooth-brush in the town, with
a memory of the Hotel des Bains still fresh in my mind.</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Guadeloupe</span> grows upon one slowly,
in its insidious loveliness; but Martinique flashes upon one like
a great live emerald, catching one&rsquo;s breath with its
beauty, its greenery, which is like nothing else I have ever
seen, could ever have imagined; every shade of green on
earth,&mdash;apart from that of the cool, gray-green English
willows,&mdash;deep to black, and yet a shining black, in its
shade, brilliant as a parrot&rsquo;s wing in the sunshine.</p>
<p>We arrived there this morning, Sunday, the great market-day of
the week, and Fort de France, the port and capital, was all abuzz
with life.&nbsp; The town is clean and well kept, with tall brick
or color-washed houses, roofed with wooden slats or red tiles;
with wide verandas massed with flowers, the brilliant plumes of
bamboos and purple and rose-pink Bougainvillea waving above the
garden walls, and clear water running in a deep conduit on each
side of the street; more houses and shops, built of wood
brilliantly painted and flush with the street.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page31"></a><span

</a></p>
<p>Everywhere was color, the market-place a kaleidoscope of
color: gowns and turbans of scarlet and crimson, vermilion and
pink, crimson and orange, sky-blue, royal-blue, and peacock-blue,
green and yellow, the turbans tied with two smartly twisted ends
erect like ears, one on each side of the head and in violent
contrast to the color <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of the gowns; stalls heaped with
oranges and red and bright-green and vermilion peppers and purple
egg-fruit, a few mangoes, though it is not yet the season,
pumpkins cut open to show their luscious rose and crimson
centers, pomegranates with their thick red-and-yellow rinds slit,
displaying their ruby-like centers; eggs and fowls, and <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>fish of every
color, and white and gray rabbits.&nbsp; The colors shifted,
mingled, and broke like waves as the people moved among the
stalls&mdash;people who are in themselves more beautiful than
anything else; women holding themselves like empresses,
deep-breasted and upright in their immensely full, starched print
gowns.</p>

<p>For the Martinique negroes and negresses are surely the most
splendid in all the world, their skins a clear and perfect black,
their teeth flawless, while the great muscles of the men move
like snakes beneath the skin.&nbsp; All alike are fresh and
untired, though many have walked as much as thirty miles this
morning, over the mountains, with their heavy baskets on their
heads.&nbsp; And the laughter and talk are like the sound of the
sea in a cave, so deep and soft and mellow.</p>
<p>Three of us, the Englishman, a French lady <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>who is
another passenger on the boat,&mdash;a tall and magnificently
made woman with just enough of Tahitian to mellow the French
blood in her veins,&mdash;and I, took a motor and drove out over
the mountains to St. Pierre, the real capital of the island,
which was totally destroyed by an eruption of Mount Pel&eacute;e
in 1902.</p>
<p>For some twenty-three miles the road mounts and mounts, and
never in my life have I seen anything like the splendor and
richness of the vegetation on each side of it: foliage, flowers,
fruit.&nbsp; For the greater part of the way it passes along an
immensely high and ever-rising ridge, with a deep ravine and
silver thread of river far below, to right and left, running down
to the great bay.&nbsp; Three miles from tip to tip of each horn
and four miles in depth, the bay lay beneath us like a small
platter of pure turquoise, the little islands and ships growing
ever more toy-like as we looked back between the arching bamboos
which edged the road, with ravine and hillside, deep in
tree-fern, below them.&nbsp; The road twists so sharply that upon
each short reach the next turn is completely lost to sight.</p>
<p>Here were little villages of very clean color-washed houses,
and churches which looked as though they were made of colored
cardboard, so <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>crowded that a greater part of their congregations
debouched on to benches outside.&nbsp; Magnificently starched and
colored and flounced congregations they were, though every now
and then in front of some cottage we came across a group of
laughing children at play, colored and shining like black pearls,
naked as the day they were born&mdash;and not out of poverty,
either, for it is impossible to imagine anything of the sort in
this luxuriant land, but from sheer wanton delight in air and
sunshine.&nbsp; And at one spot, beneath a hibiscus tree with
brilliant hanging flowers shaped and colored like scarlet corals,
sat an old man clad in little more than a tightly curling white
beard.</p>
<p>About eighteen miles from St. Pierre the ground begins to
drop.&nbsp; There were high walls of shining canes on each side
of us, and presently we came across one house which had survived
the catastrophe of 1902; and again the road twisted, bringing us
within sight of the sea, and we dropped to the
burial-place&mdash;or, rather, the dead bones&mdash;of what had
once been a thriving town, with university and schools, a
cathedral and a convent, many shops and many private houses, the
most prosperous town in all the French West Indies.</p>
<p>To-day, when we visited it, we found forty or <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>fifty
jerry-built wooden houses, a pathetic attempt at a market-place,
a handful of grown people and children; a new town devoid of
grandeur save for its surroundings.&nbsp; And yet, with all this,
a place in which one was conscious of a brooding spirit that
could have been nothing less than the spirit of death; a
dry-boned and sultry, brooding death which stood with folded
wings over the town where it had reaped so great a harvest.</p>
<p>There was one little caf&eacute; where we took our
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, a rickety wooden affair facing the
sea.&nbsp; The meals were served in an upper room which stretched
the whole width of the house; beneath it was a sort of open hall
with a tiled floor packed with barrels, bottles, and benches,
where chickens wandered about at their own free will.&nbsp; Back
of this were the kitchen and outhouses.&nbsp; In the whole place
there could be no possible space for any other rooms, and yet the
card which the bowing proprietor handed to me before I left reads
like this:</p>

<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>In the
upper room four more than brunette Frenchmen were playing
dominoes, splitting a bottle of wine among them.&nbsp; Two more,
whose mothers, even more obviously, had &ldquo;drunk too much
coffee,&rdquo; one with a wooden leg and both very smartly
dressed in large-check tweeds and flowing silk
ties,&mdash;twanging loudly upon their guitars, decorated with
bright-pink ribbons,&mdash;sang French love-songs.&nbsp; All this
did nothing whatever to diminish that indescribable feeling of
the immutability of everything on earth: a depression which
flattened the good rum-punch, the claret, the simple country
meal&mdash;brawn and tiny pasties the size of pennies, cold fish
with a piquant sauce heavy in garlic; rabbit and
<i>pur&eacute;e</i> of peas; wild raspberries and coffee.&nbsp;
Even the sight of the small black pig and pullet which slept in a
fond embrace upon the floor was powerless to lighten my
gloom.</p>
<p>An old negro gave me a wonderful and graphic description of
the eruption,&mdash;or, rather, what he saw of it from the other
side of the island, for no <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>one now lives who was in it, or can
tell exactly how it came upon the town.&nbsp; In the whole town
there was but one man left alive: a man who had been imprisoned
for murder the night before, shut up in a deep underground
cell.&nbsp; Four days later his frenzied screams attracted
attention, and he was found to be raving mad, scorched and
blistered from head to foot.</p>
<p>The great eruption took place on the morning of May 8th.&nbsp;
But for days before that there had been a sound like the
continual roar of cannon inside the mountain, while a fine
powdering of ashes had fallen over the town, lying so thick in
the streets that the people moved about silently, like ghosts;
and all the singing and laughing in the caf&eacute;s, all the
joking upon the quay, came to an end, beaten under by a weight of
foreboding.&nbsp; The people went about their business
white-faced and tight-lipped, refusing to leave the town which
they so greatly loved&mdash;&ldquo;the darlingest little town in
the Antilles,&rdquo; as Lafcadio Hearn called it, with all its
streets of seventeenth-century houses, its yellow walls and green
hanging balconies, its cathedral and universities, its many
shops,&mdash;for was it not rightly named the Paris of the West
Indies?&mdash;its theaters and caf&eacute;s; La Place Bertil, the
pride of Martinique, with its many fountains, its <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>gardens so
thronged in general by happy strolling citizens, overrun by
laughing children; for of all the islands in the world this
island of Martinique, with its mixture of French-negro blood,
shows most strikingly what the true mating of different races can
be like at its best, breeding women who are, indeed, unmatched in
the whole world.</p>
<p>One can see it as it lay during those days, edged with the
blazing sea, beneath a sunshine which is like the clear white
light of electricity, with all its palm-fringed streets and
gardens, its mountains and many streams, its wide and shining
river, its <i>mouillage</i>, or landing-stage, its many flights
of steps leading to the upper part of the town which must have
made it so like Italy.&nbsp; The lovely capital of an altogether
lovely island.</p>
<p>On May 5th the sound of cannonading within the mountain
gathered to one continuous roar, while a suffocating wind blew
from it and a stream of boiling mud,&mdash;which some one speaks
of as &ldquo;Mount Pel&eacute;e bleeding black like a dying
octopus,&rdquo;&mdash;bursting forth, rolled down the side of the
mountain, spreading out for many acres, moving at the rate of a
mile a minute along the bed of the Rivi&egrave;re Blanche,
carrying away a great sugar-factory in its course, dashing at
last into the sea, throwing up fantastic fountains of steam <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>as though
boiling lead had been poured into it.</p>
<p>Upon this night a very few people began to slip away as though
ashamed of being seen leaving by daylight, jeered at by their
fellows, who, with their own nerves all on edge, terrified and
defiant, bitterly resented the very idea of any one being so
mean-spirited as to forsake the town.</p>
<p>The night of May 7th was stiflingly hot.&nbsp; Early in the
evening the Italian ship, <i>Orsolino</i>, steamed away; for the
captain, who knew Naples, realized what was brooding over the
fated town.&nbsp; At daylight next morning, however, the Quebec
boat, <i>Roraima</i>, came cheerfully to anchor, to be gutted,
charred, burnt to the water&rsquo;s edge in less than two
hours.&nbsp; For at eight o&rsquo;clock an explosion came like
the bursting of a mine, cutting short a message which was even
then being sent over the telegraph wires to Fort de France, and
of which the one word to reach it, prelude to Heaven only knows
what, was curiously and pathetically enough, <i>Allez</i>.&nbsp;
It was the last word of a doomed city.&nbsp; A city which was in
another moment devastated by a cyclone of red-hot dust and flame;
a hurricane of sulphur before which the men in the streets were
swept headlong, with clothes and flesh alike torn from them.</p>
<p>That was at eight o&rsquo;clock, and, at that time, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>people upon
the far mountain summit declared that they saw a violet-gray
cloud, luminous and shot with fire, belch forth from the torn
crater like a charge from a cannon, striking the town and
spreading to the sea, with the flames eddying and twisting like
live things within it.&nbsp; In another moment the mountain
itself, the blazing city, hills, and bays, were blotted out by a
dense cloud of smoke and ashes which covered the entire island
and spread to many of the nearer ones.</p>
<p>In this disaster there was no fall of lava, and it was
altogether from the poisonous gases and the falling buildings,
the flames which swept the town like a scythe, that the people
died,&mdash;between twenty and thirty thousand of
them,&mdash;while so terrible were the fumes which hung over the
dead town for at least three days that those who ventured near it
were found later, dead among the dead, with blackened and
protruding tongues.</p>
<h2><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Colon</span> is ugly and attractive and
amazing.&nbsp; It is, indeed, more like an insect than a
town.&nbsp; A long, low, scurrying, super-insect.&nbsp; A Robat
among insects.</p>
<p>The coaling station is a creature apart: an immense, quickly
running black spider with legs and arms which are beyond
counting.&nbsp; In sober fact, the whole place is hideous; and
yet it is so efficient, so powerful, with all its apparatus at
once so slender and so strong, that it has that sort of beauty
appertaining to anything altogether right for its purpose.&nbsp;
In the glow of the setting sun it is, indeed, wonderful, with its
immensely high, fine cranes, its network of aerial railways; no
longer like an insect, but rather a piece of fantastic music,
scrawled large, with many small blots, wild erasures, across the
pure, clean gold of the sky.&nbsp; And above it all, this
evening, three aeroplanes dip and circle, while solitary
frigate-birds dip and circle with precisely the same motion, and
so much nearer that they appear to be of the same size.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
compound which holds the offices of all the great shipping-lines
visiting Colon is very attractive, with its large white
buildings, deep-arched verandas, gardens, and palm-trees.&nbsp;
But once out of this, real life begins with an endlessly long
street, which is Panama Republic and &ldquo;wet&rdquo; on one
side, United States Canal Zone and &ldquo;dry&rdquo; on the
other; not that it matters much, for it is only, as the charwomen
say in London, a matter of &ldquo;just slipping across the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet there is a difference, an amazing difference, in what
one hears, what one sees, and, above all, in what one
feels&mdash;the very atmosphere.</p>
<p>As night falls the American town of Cristobal is dull and
dark, and most uncommonly furtive; while Colon is glaring and
noisy and picturesque, openly disreputable, cheerful, drunken,
amorous.</p>
<p>Here on the &ldquo;wet&rdquo; side of the road are children
laughing and screaming, spilling over the sidewalk in such masses
that one is driven into the gutter.&nbsp; Here are green parrots
and scarlet and yellow macaws at every window, in every doorway;
rubbishy Indian shops with rubbishy souvenirs and silks, far
dearer than in England, and Panama hats and stuffed
crocodiles.&nbsp; One wonders who on earth can be found to buy a
stuffed crocodile.&nbsp; In the doorway of one little shop a
small antelope <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>and a monkey are tied to one string, like the pig and
the pullet at St. Pierre.&nbsp; There is an endless succession of
drinking shops, and shops where liquor may be bought and carried
across the road to the snugly closed shops and houses out of
which men peer, with heads which look as though a barber,
intending to shave them, had started upon the backs of their
heads in mistake for their faces.</p>
<p>I really intended only to stay and dine at the Hotel
Washington, but the editor of the <i>Star and Herald</i>, a paper
printed in Spanish and English, with whom I dined, kept me
enchanted, by his descriptions of the proud Spanish families who
live but just back from the Canal Zone, until it was too late to
return to the boat for the night.&nbsp; These families live
exactly as they have lived for centuries past, coming into town
at long intervals, by a series of trails cut through the
primitive forest or pampas, with an endless procession of
pack-and saddle-mules.</p>
<p>I am writing now at seven in the morning, feeling all the
better for a good sleep in a real bed, in a cool, airy room high
up on the third floor, with the leaves of the cocoa-palms
swishing and rustling like rain outside the window.</p>

<p>The wind is sweeping straight off the Atlantic and right
through the hotel, with its every door <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and window wide open.&nbsp; And, to
my mind, one of the joys in reaching the real tropics is to be
able to sit in a strong draft and feel the air racing through
one&rsquo;s thin muslin garments.&nbsp; And what a wind it is,
too!&nbsp; One sits and thinks: &ldquo;How cool!&nbsp; How
delicious!&nbsp; How can any one complain of the heat
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet with the least exertion, so little as
stooping to pick up one&rsquo;s scattered papers, one is
dripping.&nbsp; I am so languid as to be thankful that I have no
luggage to bother about; concerned as to whether it will be
possible for me to gather energy to call for my bill, mount one
of the funny little zone carriages, with its orange-and-white
striped umbrella, and make my way back to the boat.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal does not run from east to west as one expects
it to, but due south from Limon Bay on the Atlantic side to the
widest part of Gatun Lake, where it twists sharply to the
east.&nbsp; It is not, indeed, a canal at all, but a bridge of
water eighty-seven feet in height.</p>
<p>It has six locks: three at the entrance to Gatun Lake, one at
Pedro Miguel, which lowers Pacific-bound ships to the level of
Lake Miraflores, and two between Miraflores and sea-level.&nbsp;
Each lock is double, so that ships going in opposite directions
may pass one another.&nbsp; All the machinery of the <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>canal is run
by electricity, while the Gatun dam and spillways serve to keep
the water in the lake level, allowing for dry seasons and
evaporation.&nbsp; The dam itself is one and a half miles long at
its crest.</p>
<p>I believe that I am right in these details, but anything may
be, in truth, just the opposite of what I have said.&nbsp; My
mind has a way of suddenly spinning round on its own pivot over
facts, and the only fact of which I am always altogether certain
is the way in which anything new impresses itself upon me.&nbsp;
After all, any more definite, scientific, or practical knowledge
of the canal can so easily be come by at any public library.</p>
<p>To me it seems that the Panama Canal is something alive,
uncanny, and quite suddenly created: the outcome of a whim of
some demigod having nothing whatever to do with the pale,
set-looking men whom one sees&mdash;appearing so small,
inadequate, and fumbling, with an air of somehow being left
behind and very badly scared&mdash;about the margin of it.&nbsp;
More than anything else I have ever known, the silence of it all
impresses me: the perfectly noiseless, relentless motion of every
atom of machinery, with its air of stealing a march upon
humanity.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The
entrance to the canal is flat, desolate, terribly
depressing.&nbsp; The air is like the taste of flat soda-water
upon one&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s limbs drag; one&rsquo;s
lungs feel as though they had been ironed out with a hottish iron
and a damp handkerchief; one&rsquo;s skin is moist and sticky to
the touch; and there is an odd smell in the air, the smell of a
close tailor&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>To my mind there is nothing in the world so desolate as
mangrove swamps, and I wonder how many men they have, in truth,
driven to despair, madness, suicide: the gloom and damp mists and
the fever-specters of them; the grotesque and sinister figures of
the roots at low water.&nbsp; Here, now, on each side of us, are
mangroves and ragged acacias.&nbsp; Upon the low, half-hearted
hills of the landward horizon are gray wooden and concrete
houses, two or three twisted palm-trees; eternal hieroglyphics of
cranes, electric cables, and standards scrawled across the
sky.</p>
<p>It all looks like the very end, the last shunting station of
the hopes of man.&nbsp; Instead of this it is the beginning of
something so wonderful, so altogether and confidently
presumptuous that one goes through it in a state of panic.&nbsp;
Not on one&rsquo;s own account, but because of what one feels
might happen to the world if things like this went on; <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the chance of
its slipping entirely out of gear.</p>
<p>At the top of the first lock of the three which will raise us
into Gatun Lake, is a large mail-steamer which looks as though
posed upon a wall, while small squat engines of blue and yellow,
shaped like tanks and worked by electricity, dumb and dreadfully
concentrated, run up the slope to this height and disappear over
what might very well be the end of the world.&nbsp; As the
mail-steamer drops from sight, six of these beetle-like creatures
take us in tow.&nbsp; Two run on in front with ropes from each
side of the bow; two, with more ropes amidships, keep us off from
the walls which rise high above us; and two more hold us
back.&nbsp; Despite all precautions there are accidents.&nbsp;
One little engine still lies derelict, having been plunged into
the water by a ship which rushed away too impetuously under her
own steam as she left this lock, making for the Atlantic;
breaking through the chain fenders which in general allow no ship
that is not moving at its staid and proper pace, to
&ldquo;bullock&rdquo; through them.</p>
<p>We pass into the lock through an immense gateway from which
steel gates have rolled silently back into the sides of the
canal; the gates close, and an amazing process begins.</p>
<p>In reality, of course, the water rushing in from <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>culverts
rises, taking us with it.&nbsp; But that is not in the least what
it seems like.&nbsp; Rather, the walls of the lock, the top of
which has been on a level with the crow&rsquo;s-nest, appear to
sink very slowly down and down, drawn under the water by some
force which leaves us high on a level with the top of it,
paralyzed with wonder.&nbsp; The whole effect is so keen and
piercing that one is perfectly prepared to see the causeway, the
little engines, the slack-looking men who seem so entirely,
blindly indifferent, ultimately disappear beneath the waters;
while we and our ship, all the impedimenta and furniture and
stores and machinery and funnels and fuel, all the people, crew
and passengers, with all their petty strivings, engrossments,
generosities, and jealousies, their families and boxes and
chairs&mdash;the whole caboodle are shot up heavenward, amazing
Peter; along with that god upon earth who sits at the top of the
center lock,&mdash;before him a flat working model of every wall
and gate, every scrap of machinery,&mdash;and, himself alone,
throws out the switches, controlling every operation, every
movement of the waters, and of the ships upon the face of the
waters.</p>
<p>It seems as though a lifetime had passed in this amazing
process, while the barometer in the captain&rsquo;s cabin sinks
beneath one&rsquo;s eyes, with a <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>heavier weight of air.&nbsp; And yet,
from the moment the great steel gates close behind us, to the
moment the second pair above opens to admit us, is no more than
thirty minutes in all.&nbsp; Not the least surprising part of the
whole affair is the fact that no one appears to be doing anything
whatever, apart from the pilot, who walks up and down the topmost
bridge, barking out an occasional order.</p>
<p>If I were down upon the lower deck, which I now regard as a
sort of dog-shelf, I could see next to nothing, the whole advance
being hidden by the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle.&nbsp; But from my proud
position upon the bridge I see the whole play opening before me;
while as we are raised to the highest level of the last Atlantic
lock, Gatun Lake (made from the deepening and widening of the old
bed of the Chagres River; eighty-seven feet above sea-level,
twenty miles long, and covering an area of one hundred and sixty
square miles) is unfolded like a picture laid flat upon a table,
while the clean, fresh air blowing across it fills one&rsquo;s
lungs so that one feels almost like a real person again.</p>
<p>Close to the entrance into the lake is a large village,
housing some of the three thousand white men and five thousand
colored people employed by the Canal Zone Company.&nbsp; We see a
series of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>tennis-courts at one side, and at the other golf-links
with men in white clothes wandering rather limply across
them.&nbsp; The whole village seems less significant than a
bee&rsquo;s nest hung upon the bough of a tree at the entrance to
an unexplored forest; for I cannot get over the idea that, as a
whole, humanity has had nothing whatever to do with all this.</p>
<p>It is a misty day, and I think that the shoreless lake seems
all the lovelier for this, as we rise to it and see it dotted
with innumerable islands, which are in reality the tops of
one-time hills; every island a tight bouquet of intensely green
palms, hung with vivid green creepers.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the afternoon the sun comes out, not
brilliantly, but in a flattened golden sheen, while the air is so
damp that it seems as though everything were covered with a
fine-meshed gray gauze, cut by the close-pressed wedges of wild
duck, which are forever crossing and recrossing it with the sun
upon their backs.</p>
<p>At the end of the lake the little islands thicken and gather
to mountains upon each side of us; until we slide in between the
high cliffs which men are still cutting away&mdash;standing as
casually as any suburban householder hosing his garden of an
evening after business hours&mdash;with a pressure <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of water so
intense that the walls of the cliffs fall, flatly and almost
silently, unbroken like slices of cut cake.</p>
<p>In between these cliffs we pass to the Gaillard Cut, six miles
in length, among mountains which tower peak upon peak, almost
perpendicularly upon each side of us.&nbsp; Of all the wonders of
the canal, in the main constructive, this vast and utilitarian
work of destruction which formed the Gaillard Cut&mdash;the one
&ldquo;man-made&rdquo; ca&ntilde;on in the world&mdash;is the
greatest.&nbsp; For here is no quiet canal, wending its way
through flat meadows, but that bridge of water still continued at
the same height as Gatun Lake, cutting in among the mountains of
the Great Divide.&nbsp; Of all the heartbreaking difficulties
which the Americans encountered in their task, there can have
been none like those encountered here.&nbsp; The land-slips or
slides which in a few moments destroyed the work of months or
even years, and others even more devastating which continued with
dreadful certainty at the rate of two or two and a half feet a
day, for months upon months on end, must have dragged the very
heart out of the idealists who had evolved from their dreams this
wonder of the world, breaking into the will of the desert with
that strength which is indeed the child of dreams, overthrowing
mountains and gorges, rivers and jungles; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>vanquishing,
even, that dreaded Cucaracha Slide which, having turned the
French aside from their path, broke out afresh with savage
vehemence the moment that the Americans laid their hands upon its
territory, shooting across the entire canal prism.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Here, now, as though in radiant triumph, the
scenery&mdash;like a woman of the Sabines scarred and torn, and
mantled only in her own hair&mdash;is wild and wonderful beyond
all words.&nbsp; For where the garments of forest trees and
creepers are slashed away from them, the scarred cliffs show pink
and purple, lovely in the last level rays of the evening sun;
streaked with great masses of greenery, toppling trees and
trailing creepers which the fall of soil has dragged away with
it.&nbsp; In one place a huge perpendicular cliff of absolutely
clear vermilion, topped with green, rises against the clear
greenish sky in front of us.</p>

</a></p>
<p>By the time we reach the single lock of Pedro Miguel the whole
scene is aflame with the setting sun, like the brief but gaudy
transit of some Oriental magnate, crossing the street with all
the panoply of one who sets out to war.</p>
<p>As we enter the first of the two remaining locks a train
running between Colon and Panama comes <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>out from among the mountains and
stops at a little station upon our right.</p>
<p>All through the day, so long that it has seemed altogether
unconnected with time,&mdash;for I have not even gone down to the
meals which in general punctuate it,&mdash;the whole scene has
been like the gigantic setting for some Titanic drama.&nbsp; Now
the play itself comes upon us, pathetic because it is so small,
infinitely touching as is every aspect of man in the desert;
ridiculously inadequate for the setting&mdash;and yet, within it,
holding the material for a hundred little plays in little
theaters.</p>
<p>Across from the station, on the opposite side of the lock,
there is a group of dilapidated cars and mule-carts, and the
American soldiers who tumble out of the train on their way back
from some race meeting or other (for it is a f&ecirc;te-day in
the real world) make a dash to reach them before the gates open
to let us through.&nbsp; We are sinking quickly now, going down
and down instead of up and up as we did at the entrance from the
Atlantic, and the men running across the narrow wall above us
look like nothing more than a host of neutral-tinted ants, with
their twinkling legs.&nbsp; Those who are alone get over <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in time; but
there are many more with women and children who find themselves
cut off and, standing along the sides of the lock, wait for us to
go through.</p>
<p>The sun has almost set by now and sky and water and steep
wooded hillside, the color of spilt wine and purple fuchsias, are
reflected upon the hard white wedge-like faces of the men, very
lean and standing very upright, as though nerving themselves
against being overborne by the heavy brooding silence of the
place, the sullen forests, the hot suggestive twilight: as though
they were saying to themselves, setting their jaws over it,
anxious and unsmiling, &ldquo;It looks as though it might get us,
but&mdash;gee-whiz!&mdash;we won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The yellow-faced babies which so many of them hold in their arms,
the children who cling to them, the half-caste wives who lean
against them&mdash;full-breasted and voluptuous, as curved as
their husbands are angled, waving a languid and indifferent hand
to us, with passionate dark eyes raised to their
husbands&mdash;have got them far more certainly than any
wild.</p>
<p>Night has closed in before we pass the second of the
Miraflores locks and drop to sea-level: a perfectly clear
greenish-indigo night with a full <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>moon overhead.&nbsp; As I look back
over the length of the ship, the sight is extraordinarily
fairylike, fantastic, and unreal.</p>
<p>Backed with high-peaked mountains, the causeways to the locks,
shortened and broadened by perspective, show like the top of an
immense Christmas cake, the tall white concrete pillars with
their lights, clusters of five hundred wax bulbs under concrete
shades, like candles set above them.&nbsp; The little engines
with their bright crimson lamps add a still more fantastic note
of decoration to the scene.&nbsp; It is an appropriate finish to
the transit through an isthmus in itself fantastic beyond all
words, worked to their own ends by men who, as it seems, could
scarcely have realized the magnitude of their own powers.</p>
<p>Take it all in all, the whole effect of the Canal Zone is
theatrical.&nbsp; The islands are not islands at all, but the
tops of mountains pushing up through the water; the mountains
themselves are cut to pattern, placed just so; the green of the
vegetation is more than a trifle overdone, as are the exaggerated
madder and vermilion of the cliffs.&nbsp; The machinery of the
gigantic transformation scene left lying about, with the pathetic
remains of the heroic failure of Lesseps, suggests the idea that
it has all been brought there by <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>trolleys, small enough because of the
primal flatness; that the valleys which open between the
mountains are mere wings leading to the green-room, with nothing
whatever at the back of them.&nbsp; We have the feeling that it
all must come to an end when the last of the lights go out, and
the electrician, forsaking his engines, goes home to supper and
bed, leaving the night watchman seated on a little camp-stool in
the center of this vast stage, his elbows on his knees, his chin
cupped in his hands, staring out in front of him and wondering
what on earth has been the good of it all, thinking over those
days when he himself took a part in the great play, wore the
crown of a king, or saw himself as one with God, outdoing God,
for the amusement or convenience of a gaping world.</p>
<p>We stop at Balboa for water and some necessary repairs to the
engine; but I am too tired to go on shore, while it is far too
late to drive out to Old Panama.&nbsp; Besides, I spent so much
money at Guadeloupe and Martinique and Colon that I am beginning
to get a little scared at to what will happen when I get to
Tahiti, unless my agents have meanwhile sold something for me,
either in America or England.&nbsp; Not that I should bother
over-much about ways and means, for one <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>can always
get where one means to go, unless I were dead beat by a heat so
enervating that I have been obliged to tie a towel round my neck
while I stooped over my work.&nbsp; It is best to leave all
one&rsquo;s money worries upon the knees of the gods&mdash;the
only knees I have ever altogether trusted.</p>
<p>The moonlit quay at Balboa is deserted, apart from a few
policemen negligently swinging their &ldquo;love sticks&rdquo; in
one hand, with the other hand stuck in a trouser-pocket, who
wander on and off the ship in pursuit of their express duty of
seeing that the prohibition regulations are fully carried
out.</p>
<p>I am terribly troubled as to how I am to register and post a
packet of manuscripts; still more troubled when, having entrusted
it to one of these gentlemen, I hear from the captain how many
brandies he has consumed.&nbsp; My one comfort is that a
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; American is probably as well seasoned to liquor
as any other man on earth.</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> night we have been going dead
slow so that we may avoid reaching the tangle of the Tuamotu
Archipelago&mdash;the Dangerous Isles, as we English call
them&mdash;at night.&nbsp; Now we are in the midst of hundreds
upon hundreds of atolls lying level with the sea, broken rings of
coral a few hundred&mdash;or less than one hundred&mdash;feet
broad, with wide-open lagoons inside them and cocoanut-palms on
the northwest side, away from the prevailing winds.&nbsp; Rings
of coral and scanty sand, simmering in an eternal haze of damp
heat, overhung by a thick cloud of mosquitos which looks like a
mist about them.&nbsp; Islands where sane or specially courageous
white men may yet be found to make their homes.&nbsp; Amid these
islands&mdash;some of the largest of which are less than two
miles one from another&mdash;we must now steer our course.</p>
<p>It is late afternoon when we reach Tahiti, and I tremble with
excitement at the first sight of it, as something which I could
never have imagined.&nbsp; I had thought Martinique green, as I
once thought <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Ireland green, but they are drab in comparison with
this.&nbsp; It seems, indeed, as though there were no other color
in the world which could ever again matter in the slightest
degree; as though one not only saw it but was shot through and
through with it, permeated with it, so that one&rsquo;s every
thought was green, reflecting the glitter of the shining, opaque,
enamel-like leaves which cast back the light like mirrors, of the
fine transparent leaves, the fern-like foliage.&nbsp; I am old
enough now to have schooled myself not to expect much, but I
could never have expected anything like this, excelling all
expectation, full in the blaze of the late afternoon sun.</p>
<p>One end of the island runs up from the sea in a sharp wedge,
and then come mountains.&nbsp; Mountain upon mountain, rocky,
gray-blue, purple-blue, indigo, and a blue which is close upon
black; peaked and jagged; with more faraway mountains the precise
shade of faded harebells.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image60" href="1600651h-images/p60.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The highest peak of all, Aorai&mdash;and it is these vowels
that make the Tahitian language so lovely&mdash;has her head in
the lead-gray and silver of cumulus clouds, but the Diadem, the
pride of Tahiti, with her seven piercing peaks of deep indigo, is
flung across with no more than the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>lightest scarf of that mist which
lies thick among the innumerable ravines.&nbsp; The foot-hills
and lower slopes are of that same vivid and indescribable green,
with&mdash;and here is an extravagance of beauty&mdash;a broken
rainbow arched above the town.&nbsp; The white wooden buildings
and toy churches are embowered and almost lost in trees deeply
green as the velvet of a huntsman&rsquo;s coat, splashed in
places with the clear fervent scarlet of the flamboyant, not yet
in its full glory.</p>
<p>There is no ugly quay to mar Papeete, the one town and port of
the island; no chimneys, cranes, and blackened buildings, the
cloven hoof of most seabound towns.&nbsp; The small wooden
landing-stage, this afternoon, resembles the tulip-beds at
Hampton Court, with a breeze-blown parterre of girls in the
lightest of muslin and thin silk gowns,&mdash;straw-colored and
daffodil yellow and white and pink and rose, mauve and fuchsia,
gray and blue of every shade,&mdash;the most of them flounced to
the waist.&nbsp; Girls with broad-brimmed hats or with flowing
wavy hair falling far below their waists, wreathed with flowers;
and mingled with these, young men and old men in white suits or
shirts and <i>par&eacute;us</i>.&nbsp; For the whole island takes
holiday at the incoming of the French boats.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Right
opposite to Papeete, seemingly so near that its reflection almost
touches us (though it may be in truth twelve or fifteen miles
away) lies the island of Moorea, all its many peaks pure
amethyst, filmed over with gold in the light of the setting sun;
the shadows a deeper purple cut with gold, the water in the
little lagoon deep olive.&nbsp; Though mountain and water are
alike black&mdash;the mountain black velvet, the sea a shimmering
satin, before I can get away from the ship.&nbsp; For the young
French officers insist upon my drinking to what they call our
&ldquo;friendhood,&rdquo; in a glass of sweet champagne; while
the murmur of voices from the landing-stage beneath us, slurred
syllables, soft vowels, lap like small waves on a sandy
shore.</p>
<p>It is Saturday night and mercifully the customs officer has
started celebrating it in good time, being so altogether
&ldquo;market ripe&rdquo; that seeing two boxes for every one of
mine he shakes his head in despair and allows me to go my way
without so much as a tentative offer of keys, along the shore to
&ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnny&rsquo;s is the only
place in which any one with any sort of soul can stay in Papeete,
though there is a pretentious hotel in the heart of the town
where you can put your body when you have nothing better <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>to do with
it, and eat your meals.&nbsp; At Johnny&rsquo;s nothing is
supplied beyond the rooms and the <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i>;
actually supplied that is, for how infinitely more there is to
it!</p>
<p>First Johnny himself, or Paree, as he prefers to be called,
the son of the fattest woman and most famous cook in the Pacific,
the friend of innumerable wanderers, the last refuge of
innumerable derelicts.&nbsp; Johnny himself is round and fat and
cherubic, with the forehead of a dean.&nbsp; One can see him
wearing a round black shovel hat and a bishop&rsquo;s apron or
wreathed like Bacchus in vine-leaves, his smiling mouth smeared
with grape-juice.&nbsp; As it is, he is attired in a dark silk
<i>par&eacute;u</i> and white singlet.&nbsp; He is kind and
smiling, and beyond belief glad to see one; so altogether and
artlessly charming that it is little wonder to me that in
speaking of Tahiti every one I have ever met who came from here
has spoken of Johnny first.&nbsp; And this is not all there is to
it, either, for his house is immediately opposite the sea, and
from my latticed veranda&mdash;which forms in reality a second
room&mdash;I look down upon it, through a tapestry of solid green
and scarlet, to where the lanterns of the fishermen flicker like
fireflies along the reef.</p>
<p>I have just come back from eating my dinner <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>at an
unorthodox little restaurant facing the quay.&nbsp; It is kept by
a Frenchman and an Irishman, who, dripping with heat in their
singlets and white trousers, serve the most delicious food
imaginable, helped by one small bronze boy beautiful as a
statue.</p>
<p>The tables are on a veranda debouching on the road; and here
were officers of all grades from the boats; young Frenchmen and
other young men of every gradation of shade with their Tahitian
friends, dark beauties with flower-bound hair and pale
flower-like silk dresses; four black cats with brilliant green
eyes, all precisely alike, which sprang up on every side of one
like the creatures of a dream.&nbsp; Laughter and light, the
twang of a guitar; salad and grilled chicken and omelette and
good red wine with friendliness.</p>
<p>I was happy there and I am happy now, back at Johnny&rsquo;s,
wandering about my room,&mdash;grandiloquently designated
&ldquo;the countess&rsquo;s room,&rdquo;&mdash;which is
fantastically hung with scarlet and white
<i>par&eacute;us</i>.&nbsp; I revel in that sense of space which
makes the end of a voyage almost as good as the beginning.&nbsp;
It is one of the many delightful reactions of life, such as the
unsung joy of falling <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>out of love, with its delightful
sense of altogether fresh possibilities.</p>
<p>There seems to be nothing more than a bottom sheet on my
bed,&mdash;of course no blankets,&mdash;and trying to attract the
attention of a maid of some sort I am reassured by a distinctly
masculine, friendly American voice on the other side of the thin
wooden partition, informing me that I shall find a top sheet
folded across the foot.&nbsp; An informal little introduction
which seems to warrant my protesting against the rattle of a
typewriter close against my head, spoiling the beat of the surf
in my ears; apart from which there is no sound save the murmur of
voices as barefooted people pad softly by in the dusty road, the
whisper of lovers along the strip of green between it and the
sea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I was up at five o&rsquo;clock this morning, to visit the
market.&nbsp; But there was nothing whatever interesting in it,
though I enjoyed meandering back to Johnny&rsquo;s along the
waterfront, where the families aboard the tiny ketches and
schooners and cutters anchored there were making their morning
toilet in a bland, leisurely way, regardless of the long hiatus
which occurred between <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>discarding their night wear, hanging
it out among the rigging to air, and getting into their best
Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes.</p>
<p>There were rolls and butter and coffee, and paw-paw and
bananas and melon on the veranda at Johnny&rsquo;s when I got
back.&nbsp; All of Johnny&rsquo;s boarders were there: two
American men, the Englishman who came over on the same boat with
me, a Russian, and an American married couple in their
dressing-gowns, talking and laughing, wandering off to the
bath-room,&mdash;a large, cool stone tank, walled round and
roofed over, with an immense shower,&mdash;and reappearing,
picking up the conversation where they had dropped it, with their
hair still dripping.&nbsp; These Americans had evidently been in
Tahiti long enough to have all their country&rsquo;s irritable
restlessness buffed off them.</p>
<p>I have an idea that my veranda will be a very good place to
write in; at least so I tell myself, though at the back of my
mind I know better.&nbsp; I know that it is, indeed, a place in
which to dream, leaning back in a long chair or opening one of
the small lattice shutters and lolling over the rail, exchanging
pleasantries with passers-by whom one has never seen
before.&nbsp; In my room at the back of the veranda the serving
maid is sweeping the <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>floor.&nbsp; She wears a bright
pink-silk dress flounced to the waist, with purple violets
embroidered upon the low and sleeveless bodice; her wavy hair,
flowing to her waist, is wreathed with flowers, and she is
smoking a cigarette.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another maid comes into the room to talk to her.&nbsp; This
girl, who is dressed in pale lemon-colored muslin, has a guitar
in her hand and the two of them chat together,&mdash;chat, chat,
chat,&mdash;discussing <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the tune which she picks out upon it,
and love and lovers.&nbsp; What a place, what a place for me to
find myself in!&nbsp; I who am in general ravaged by
activity.&nbsp; A place where time melts like the mist upon the
mountains, and is no more to be caught or woven to any useful
end.</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> come for a long, long drive
into the country with one of the young officers from the steamer,
a French boy of good family who had an Irish ancestress in some
way remotely connected with myself.&nbsp; We had bespoken a tin
Lizzie, yesterday, to call for us at half-past six, but it was an
hour later when we did get off, what with the coffee being late
and the amount of melon that we ate for our <i>petit
d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and the something or other that had happened
to the chauffeur and the car.&nbsp; Still, it was heavenly when
we once got started.&nbsp; Rain had fallen throughout the greater
part of the night, and the island was a thing of perfume and
glitter, with the drops still showering down from the trees, and
rainbow clouds above Moorea, the sea inside the reef showing
flattened streaks of pale and dark opal.</p>
<p>To begin with, our way lay along the sea, here and there on
the very edge of the sand, through cocoanut groves and colonies
of small white and pink and yellow wooden houses, with wide <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>verandas like
dolls&rsquo; houses.&nbsp; They were hedged off from the road
with brilliant scarlet and crimson and green crotons and such
hibiscus as I have never seen, an infinite variety of it.&nbsp;
There were blossoms with soft double petals like large hollyhock
flowers, of the very palest yellow and pink and white; large
single blossoms of a deep ruby and scarlet, and blood-red with
fringed and pointed petals; rounded blossoms of vermilion,
orange, pink, rose-pink, blush-pink, and that magenta-like color
which edged the lengths of flannel used for petticoats in my
nursery days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image70" href="1600651h-images/p70.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Pandanus tree"
title=
"The Pandanus tree"
 src="1600651h-images/p70.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>In some
places the mountains rose sheer on one side of us, cut by deep
ravines filled with an amazing vegetation, not in the least like
ordinary trees and shrubs.&nbsp; There were green and pale-yellow
striped leaves shaped like the spear-heads of gods; glossy green
leaves like immense fans; the fronds of ferns brown and hairy as
Pan&rsquo;s hock; the long pale leaves of wild bananas; the tall
straight stems of what is called here the mapau tree, with
immense flanged roots like folds of stiff silk upright above the
ground, and fluted trunks like Ionian columns.&nbsp; In the sea
at the other side of us, which was perfectly smooth, clear, and
shining, fishermen waded up to their waists, dragging their nets
through the water, so clearly reflected that each man seemed like
the upper half of two men welded together.</p>
<p>At one spot the side of the mountain was hollowed out by an
immense cave, hundreds of feet high, almost completely dark, with
the unimaginably long roots of trees hanging down within it, and
a continual drip of water into the dark and ominous pool which
paved it.</p>
<p>More and more I feel that this island is not a place in which
to paint.&nbsp; There are too many strong primal colors; it is at
once too artless and too passionate.&nbsp; The vegetation is too
like the <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>packed hothouse of a millionaire.&nbsp; The background
of sky and mountain is purposely set for the life drama of an
artless, material, and yet primitive people.</p>
<p>Among the rocks in the ravines are many skeletons, for the
people once hid the bodies of their departed chiefs there so that
their enemies might not get at them.&nbsp; Thus any wanderer
up-country in Tahiti may be confronted by death grinning out upon
him suddenly amid bowers of ferns, the spurt and spray and
whisper of those innumerable waterfalls which flow with an
outward curve like flying-buttresses from the top of high,
in-curving cliffs; finishing touch to those dark figures of dread
and melancholy which step hand in hand with love and beauty
through the slow and silent dance of tropic days.</p>
<p>I am scribbling as best I can upon my knee while we rattle
along.&nbsp; The air is full of scents: the smell of guavas, like
warm flannel, of mangoes, daturas; of dust and a depth of damp
vegetation untouched by the sun; of plants like animals; of sweet
ginger-flower and wild gardenia, or <i>tiare</i>, the national
bower of Tahiti, of lantana, with the stuffy odor of nettle beds
at home in England; of seaweed and stagnant salt-water
pools.&nbsp; And the sibilant <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>secret <i>hush-hush-hush</i> of
palms, the pat of small waves on the shore are forever in the
ears.</p>
<p>Two tall bronze colored boys, on the edge of manhood, run out
of the sea, and, vaulting upon a white horse and a chestnut
horse, dash up the narrow steep slope of sand and across the road
in front of us.&nbsp; Fine spray, gold with sunshine, showers out
of their hair as they go, and silver drops stream down their wet
bodies.</p>
<p>Something stirs against a garden hedge as we pass it&mdash;a
hedge behind which grow balsams and zinnias of every shade,
jasmines, crimson and yellow crotons, crimson and yellow
cannas&mdash;and we see a youth leading a white heifer, white as
a transparent silk stocking on a woman&rsquo;s leg, against the
flaming hibiscus bushes.&nbsp; The boy, wide-eyed with terror
lest we dash into him and his charge, presses back into the
shrubbery, out of our way.</p>
<p>Girls run out of the cottage gardens and throw flowers into
our car; others leap upon the steps and hang garlands&mdash;which
they must have had in readiness for any chance
passer-by&mdash;around our necks.&nbsp; They have not the
slightest air of expecting anything in return, these laughing
girls with flowing hair and white teeth.</p>
<p>The island is roughly divided in two by a wide <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>causeway and
banks of trees, close upon forty miles out from Papeete.&nbsp;
Just before crossing the causeway we stop at the house of a
Tahitian friend of my friend, who comes out to be introduced to
me.&nbsp; He promises to have luncheon ready for us when we
return, for we are going on still farther.</p>
<p>We cross the causeway between an inland lagoon and the
sea&mdash;water clear as glass without so much as a ripple to
break the reflection of unnumbered islets; bays curving so
sharply that they look like islands&mdash;and enter a series of
deep woods, broken by clusters of houses with their gardens, and
pass along a road so narrow that the masses of hibiscus growing
upon each side of us are pressed back like wall hangings of
brilliant patchwork.</p>
<p>We come to a space which is a little more open.&nbsp; On one
side of us is the sea, on the other, a hundred yards back from
the road, are immensely tall cliffs with waterfalls streaming
down them at the distance of every quarter of a mile or less,
silver threads and silver ribbons, and widths of silver tissue
hung with mist.</p>
<p>When we get back to Maou-u&rsquo;s he protests that had we
only let him know earlier he would have had a better meal ready
for us, more for us to <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>eat.&nbsp; At this my companion turns
to me, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only wait and see,&rdquo; he
says.</p>
<p>Maou-u has a little guest-house across the road, and on the
veranda of this our luncheon is served to us.&nbsp; We are waited
upon by one of the girls who live with the family, not at all a
servant, but more like a lady in waiting.&nbsp; She is a tall,
deep-breasted creature with great dark eyes swimming with
passion, love, and melancholy; the offspring of some American
captain&rsquo;s stray fancy for a girl of the race to which
Marcaline, despite her assertion to the contrary, so plainly
belongs.</p>
<p>More to eat!&nbsp; How would it be possible?&nbsp; Marcaline
brings us an immense dish piled with fresh oysters, five dozen of
them; a savory omelette; fried chicken and some sweet, succulent
beanlike vegetable; fried plantains, black coffee.&nbsp; To all
of which we do such justice&mdash;think of it, five dozen oysters
between two of us!&mdash;that it seems impossible that we should
ever again be able to rise from the low chairs into which we have
sunk.&nbsp; We lie back without a word, perfectly content to
watch our cigarette smoke rising up against the dark green of the
trees, just sufficiently awake to realize our entire contentment,
no more.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>When we
do at last take our departure Maou-u&rsquo;s wife and three
children, Marcaline and another girl, with Maou-u
himself&mdash;stout and smiling, utterly refusing to accept
anything in return for his hospitality, delighting me with an
invitation to come out and stay at his guest-house&mdash;and two
shy smiling youths, gather to see us into our motor, already
piled with ripe cocoanuts, a basket of guavas, a bunch of fresh
plantains.&nbsp; The girls hang round our necks garlands of white
and yellow ginger-flowers, the heavily perfumed cups of the
pandanus fruit, gardenias, and pink and crimson roses.&nbsp;
Every word they say, every glance of their dark eyes, is full of
kindliness toward me, more than kindliness for the handsome young
Frenchman, a boy altogether so delightful that there is nothing
that I should like better than to own him as my son.</p>
<p>To be kind, to be happy, to love and be loved; to find oneself
surrounded by beauty and perfume and sunshine and sea-air, blest
with an infinity of leisure.&nbsp; Is it to be wondered that many
men forget that there is anything else left in life to be
desired?</p>
<p>The <i>Kantara</i> is sailing early to-morrow morning, and a
couple of officers come to make their adieux over a last
glass&mdash;though that &ldquo;one last <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>glass&rdquo;
is a merely formal way of putting it&mdash;of Johnny&rsquo;s iced
rum-punch glowing with golden fruits.&nbsp; Surely it is one of
the most enticing drinks imaginable!</p>
<p>It is after nine o&rsquo;clock, for they have been extra busy
with the cargo, and we are out on the narrow slip of crab-ridden
grass opposite the house, between the sea and the road, while the
whole entertainment is of the sort impossible for any
England-bound English man or woman to imagine.&nbsp; The
housemaid and parlor-maid&mdash;I use the only words I can find
to describe the nymphs who bring out the punch&mdash;have changed
into even brighter silks than they have worn during the day,
combed out their long hair, and placed hibiscus blooms behind
their ears&mdash;and it is the left ear for the girl who wants a
lover and the right ear for the girl who is contented, or vice
versa; I can never quite remember which.&nbsp; Not that it
matters, for they themselves make certain of not being left in
the lurch, wearing a bloom behind each ear.</p>
<p>The girls have their guitar with them, and sitting down upon
the grass at our feet, or upon the benches at our side, sing to
us&mdash;love-songs and that strange haunting Tahitian song of
which the only words seem to be, &ldquo;How happy I am! oh, <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>how happy I
am!&rdquo; set to the tune of an old French Baptist hymn.</p>
<p>Apart from the singing and playing, low notes and low crooning
voices, the night is almost silent.&nbsp; What sounds there are,
beyond the shrilling of the cicadas&mdash;striking upon the ear
as though a myriad wires vibrated between the ground beneath
one&rsquo;s feet and the star-strewn sky&mdash;is dulled by love
and languor.&nbsp; Young men and girls in muslins with flounced
skirts pad softly by, whispering to one another.&nbsp; Large,
majestic women with straight white cotton dresses to their feet
sail past with a flotilla of small children about them; and there
seem to be more children in Tahiti than I have ever seen before,
for whatever the admixture of blood may do in other directions,
it very certainly does not lead to sterility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love and languor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words swim gently
through my mind as the keynote to Tahiti, or rather to the full
understanding of it, for I do not believe that it is of the very
faintest use to expect any full-blooded, warm-hearted people to
be moral with so much time on their hands and in a climate like
this, among girls so gentle and smiling, so much more kind than
immoral.&nbsp; As to working hard or continuously, it is out of
the question.&nbsp; Never in all my life have I taken so <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>long to dress
and undress; never have I wandered about my room with such
vagueness, such long pauses in everything I happen to be doing,
though goodness knows it would be impossible, with decency, to
wear fewer clothes than those which I put on and take off
me.&nbsp; The fact is that one never can keep to one thing at a
time.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s brain is so full of all sorts of odd
quotations, odd ideas, impulses to do something altogether
different.&nbsp; One is, indeed, in a continuous sort of pleasant
swoon.&nbsp; I am convinced that if I lived here I should get
into the habit of reading nothing whatever beyond
anthologies.</p>
<p>Merely looking out of my window, or leaning over my balcony
rail, takes much time.&nbsp; To begin with, I am absorbedly
interested in what the people in the next house are doing, waving
hands to the domestics who sweep a little, smoke a little more,
and make love a great deal&mdash;all precisely as they do here,
and yet, as ever, the house next door is more interesting than
one&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; Then in the front there are the land-crabs
to beguile me, so like stout city gentlemen bolting down into the
Underground on their way home at night, running in and out of
their holes, forever in a prodigious hurry.&nbsp; There are the
amazing ways of the sun and moon and the clouds; the rain which
comes <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>down
in sudden terrific sluices as though the sky had opened overhead;
and, above all, the ways of the wind which, rising suddenly in a
terrible passion, sweeps through the house, carrying everything
with it, setting every door and window banging.</p>
<p>Really, when I come to think of it, the only thing I ever do
with decision here is getting up in the morning,&mdash;the
antithesis of my way at home,&mdash;for the mornings are heavenly
and I do not sleep very well; the mosquito curtains remind me of
the refrain which a Spanish lover sang to his mistress:
&ldquo;Neither with thee nor without thee have I any
peace,&rdquo; for with them it is too stuffy for words, while
without them it is impossible to rest at all.&nbsp; I scalded one
arm rather badly on the boat, and the new skin, young, tender,
and childlike, is so tempting that the mosquitos literally jostle
one another gourmandizing upon it.</p>
<p>To-night two large wreaths of roses and gardenias hang one
upon each post at the end of my bed.&nbsp; By whom they were sent
I know not, though I suspect the housemaid, for there is no
mosquito curtain here.&nbsp; Yesterday I pointed out to her that
it should be taken down and washed.&nbsp; She took it down this
morning, declaring that it would dry in less than no time, would
be up again long <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>before I was ready for bed.&nbsp; But, of course, it is
not there.&nbsp; No one can find it; no one knows where it is,
and I find myself obliged to fit up, with the help of three
giggling maids and the sacrifice of the tapes out of two
petticoats, the curtain belonging to my own camp equipment, so
small that it lies like a veil against my face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>And this is so like these people.&nbsp; They could take
infinite trouble over those wreaths and feel themselves utterly
unable to grapple with that curtain&mdash;even if they knew where
it was, which they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Three days later the curtain is found, I myself spying it on a
line at the far end of the back garden and going out to fetch
it.&nbsp; It has stormed with rain for close upon twenty-four
hours; but for one hour the sun has shone and the curtain is
almost dry.&nbsp; Taking it off the line and wandering round the
back veranda, seeking some safe place to finish it off
in,&mdash;for the sky is as black as ink,&mdash;I come upon two
of the maids ironing their own innumerable, brilliantly colored
pong&eacute;e silk dresses.</p>
<p>A large ironing-sheet and blanket are spread upon the floor,
where they sit in their chemises with their legs stretched very
far apart, ironing between them.&nbsp; There is a great deal of
giggling <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>when I come upon them with the curtain, of which they
deny any knowledge whatever.&nbsp; But in this island the girls
are always giggling, the older women gazing out to sea, deeply
melancholy.</p>
<p>There is one elderly looking woman, though goodness knows she
may not be more than five and twenty.&nbsp; She appears to live
on the veranda of the house next door, and she greatly intrigues
me.&nbsp; For whatever time in the morning I happen to look
out,&mdash;and it has been as early as four,&mdash;I see the
outline of her face and figure by moonlight or in the gray dawn,
with her chin propped in her hand, gazing out to sea in the
precise attitude of the Minotaur in Watts&rsquo;s haunting
picture.&nbsp; Now, while I write, there is a man upon the bench
across the road, gazing, gazing with precisely the same air of
desperate resignation, far and away beyond despair.&nbsp; I
wonder what it is that, without hope, they long for.&nbsp; It may
be some sort of subconscious yearning for the land from which
their race once came; or it may be that they are forever trying
to follow with their eyes those sailing-ships which come and go
above the horizon, bearing away, away their loved ones.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is Sunday and we are picnicking
in the country.&nbsp; I got up at half-past six o&rsquo;clock, as
we were supposed to start at seven.&nbsp; But innumerable
difficulties intervened, so that it was close upon ten before we
got away; actually past nine before the giver of the
picnic&mdash;a Russian with an air of inviolate melancholy, who
buys many bad pearls in the hope of finding one good
one&mdash;comes out of the bath-room, which smells intoxicatingly
sweet with festive wreaths made overnight and hung there to keep
fresh in the spray from the shower-bath.&nbsp; Johnny emerges
from the kitchen, where upheld by unlimited supplies of
planter&rsquo;s punch he has been wrestling throughout the entire
night with the preparation of a multitude of dishes.&nbsp; Not
that it matters when we start, for the morning is still of a
heavenly freshness, and there is always, here in Tahiti, an
amplitude of what Charles Lamb called &ldquo;estates in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, hung with thick wreaths, we lounge under the palms upon a
little point between the mouth <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of the river and the sea, in a bay
some six miles out from the town, with immense curving waves and
sheets of white foam.&nbsp; Here the water is narrowed to a mere
strip between this island and Moorea, with the full force of the
Pacific waves rushing into it.</p>
<p>Our party consists of seven: our Russian host, an Englishman,
a young American, Johnny Paree, his sister and his
niece,&mdash;an exquisite slender creature of fifteen with a
dreamy, faraway look in her eyes,&mdash;and myself.</p>
<p>The fire is lighted among the cooking-stones, for the
breadfruit; the ground spread with white woven mats for us to lie
upon; an enamel-like stretch of shining banana leaves laid as a
tablecloth.</p>
<p>We are all smoking, as one must to keep away the
mosquitos.&nbsp; In front of us is an immense green glass
demijohn of punch&mdash;rum and ice and soda-water, with all the
glowing fruits of the Goblin Market floating within
it&mdash;forming, as the sun shines through it, a centerpiece
worthy of the banquet of gods.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the river two men in scarlet-and-white
<i>par&eacute;us</i> stand fishing.&nbsp; On the opposite side of
the river are groups of young men and women.&nbsp; The men are in
scarlet <i>par&eacute;us</i> and white <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>shirts, for only the middle-aged men
are supposed to wear yellow and red, and there are none of these
in Tahiti, where one childhood slips into another.&nbsp; They are
beautiful as bronze statues.&nbsp; The women, in white, their
long flowing hair decked with flowers, are playing the guitar and
singing together.&nbsp; The air is like the scented petal of a
sun-baked blossom against one&rsquo;s cheek, at once warm and
cool, and there is no wind whatever.</p>
<p>Johnny Paree is mixing the salad of raw fish&mdash;which has
been soaking in vinegar, amid peppercorns and spices, for
twenty-four hours&mdash;with every kind of delicately shredded
vegetable and a sauce made of cocoanut cream and lime-juice and
gin and salt.&nbsp; The young American, attired in a white shirt
and scarlet <i>par&eacute;u</i>, resembling some strange bird
with his long-pointed beak-like nose and dark-rimmed glasses,
sits upright upon a stone and sings to us as we drink the punch
out of long tumblers.</p>
<p>The <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> is ushered in with Martini
cocktails, also in tumblers: then comes raw fish&mdash;of which
the sauce is so delicious that we all finish it by lapping, for
there are no spoons, no knives and forks&mdash;steaming hot
breadfruit as mealy as the best Irish potatoes, cold chicken,
tender young <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>pork with stuffing, and Russian salad.&nbsp; With all
this is white wine, followed by a great deal of champagne, for
which no one seems in the very least the worse.</p>
<p>The natives upon the opposite side of the river dive into the
water; not as we dive, but jumping, and alighting sitting.&nbsp;
They swim out into the sea, breast the waves, shouting and
singing, and are driven back into the shore by a great sweep of
surf.&nbsp; All our party, excepting the Englishman and me, jump
up from the immense meal with cries of delight, run behind the
bushes to get into their bathing-clothes, then into the sea.</p>
<p>I lie upon a white woven mat in the shade and try to
sleep.&nbsp; But it is too hot; besides, I am too happy, too well
entertained watching the bathers.&nbsp; The Englishman, however,
draws apart and really does sleep, with a handkerchief over his
face.&nbsp; After a while a little black pig goes and lies down
at his side, snuggles against him, and sleeps also.</p>
<p>It is a good two hours before our friends come out of the
water, get into their clothes, and move away to a bungalow a
little back in the bush, from which, after a while, the
long-drawn notes of the &ldquo;Boatman on the Volga&rdquo; played
by the gramophone, come to me.&nbsp; I sit alone on the sands, my
knees clasped in my arms, and gaze across the <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>narrow strip
of sea toward Moorea, incomparably beautiful, done out in shades
of amethyst against a pale-gold sky.</p>
<p>The Russian joins me; he talks of his own early life, his own
tragic country, the beauty of everything in Tahiti, and
weeps.&nbsp; But after a little while he moves off to the
bungalow, and when I follow him later, through the scented dusk
hung with fireflies, I find him dancing to the strains of the
gramophone, with a rapt and passionate air, clasping in his arms
a Chilian lady, the wife of the owner of the bungalow.&nbsp; Her
hair, which flows loose, reaching below her waist, is still
dripping with sea-water, from her swim.</p>
<p>A Czecho Slav, who is of the party, comes and sits on a little
sofa by me, and we talk together in villainously bad French, the
only two of the party who are not dancing.&nbsp; An hour or so
later we drive back to Johnny&rsquo;s along roads which are
intoxicatingly sweet with the heavy scent white datura gives off
after sunset; and when we get back, far too tired to start out
again to dinner, cajole our host into feeding us in the kitchen,
dimly illuminated with three candles which cast a windblown light
across our faces, leaving the rest of the queer, untidy place,
umber-brown and black with smoke, deep in shadow.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>I had
fully made up my mind to go from Tahiti to Samoa and the Tongan
Islands by schooner; had created the actual schooner in my own
mind, before I left London.&nbsp; The people here, however, tell
me that it is out of the question; that never, never in the whole
history of the island has there been any schooner taking that
route.</p>
<p>I do not altogether feel that I am beaten; but as an
alternative I think that I may go to Cook Island.&nbsp; Hearing
that there is a schooner laid up on the island, being fitted with
a new boom, and that she is shortly going on there, I have this
morning been out to see her.&nbsp; Such is the languor of the
place that, though she lies in a little backwater less than half
a mile away, I cannot bring myself to walk there; I must hire a
motor, for which I am charged an altogether exorbitant sum.</p>
<p>To board the schooner I had to walk one of the longest planks
I had ever crossed, and even when I got there my errand seemed in
vain.&nbsp; She is very trim and neat, and is in charge of a
friendly Danish captain, but there are only two berths on board
and those are in the saloon.&nbsp; Though both of these are
taken, the captain seemed to think there was a chance that one of
them might be given up at the last moment, but when one has
sampled the heat of that saloon and remembers the <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>constant
relay of meals on any boat, the trip does not strike one as
altogether inviting.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Ten days ago I went into a Chinaman&rsquo;s shop to buy a
camphor-wood chest into which to put the few warm clothes which I
am keeping for the homeward journey; for it is a weariness to the
flesh to have them in the same boxes with my light tropical
things.</p>
<p>These camphor-wood boxes smell delicious, and so do the
clothes which are kept in them, free from all danger of
moth.&nbsp; My chest is three feet long by about a foot and a
half broad, and the same depth.&nbsp; It is clasped with brass,
with a brass lock, and is, I fully believe, going to be the pride
of my life.</p>
<p>The Chinaman from whom I bought the box is round like a
globe-fish and sleek as a cat.&nbsp; He was very anxious that I
should buy a pearl instead of a box, feeling very certain, I
should imagine, that even with the pearl I should still find
myself unable to do without the box.&nbsp; The pearl did, indeed,
look a far more tempting trifle for immediate purchase, lying
upon a scrap of black cloth in the palm of my hand.&nbsp; I have
been to the shop several times since, once to buy a pair of straw
shoes for the bath-room, and once to buy a little <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>bowl out of
which to drink my tea.&nbsp; I intended to get one bowl only, but
this the Chinaman would not have, declaring that nobody ever
could, or ever would, drink tea without company, and forced me to
take two.</p>
<p>When I got home I discovered that one of the bowls was cracked
and I had to go back next day to change it, as I believe he fully
intended that I should do; whereupon the pearl was once again
pressed upon me, at a greatly reduced price.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To-day I walked very slowly past the shop, for I must say that
pearl draws me, so that I find my footsteps continually turning
in that direction.&nbsp; Seeing me as he stood peering out of his
dark shop, the proprietor beckoned me in, looking very sleek and
sly; and when I got up to the counter he was <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>behind it,
holding the pearl upon his finger, as though it were set in a
ring.</p>
<p>I took it from him and he made a pretense of hunting for the
little piece of black material upon which to show it off,
apparently distracted when he could not find it.&nbsp; As it
happened, I had in my bag a powder-puff with a black satin
cover.&nbsp; I laid the pearl upon this and walked to the door so
as to catch the light, returning at once in a great rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same pearl,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>His eyes met mine blankly for a moment; then he smiled very
sweetly, and, curiously enough, with the greatest satisfaction,
really liking me for having found him out.&nbsp; Unlocking a
drawer, he took out what I called my pearl, twisted in a tiny
screw of newspaper.&nbsp; It seemed to me, however, that I had
found some basis for refusing to buy it, bolstering up my
strength of mind, and with great dignity I walked out of the
shop, declaring that I should never come near it again.&nbsp; Yet
I know in my own heart that this particular Chinaman and I shall
go on playing the same game for so long as I remain in
Papeete.</p>
<p>There are dozens and dozens of Chinese shops here, the most
intriguing of all being those of the Chinese druggists.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>To-night I have dined in the largest and most important
of the Chinese restaurants.&nbsp; The whole of the ground-floor
is a store, while above this is one large room, one smaller
room,&mdash;which pretends to be set apart for white
people,&mdash;and a few little semi-private rooms like
bathing-boxes, with muslin curtains across the empty doorways,
and a veranda set with tables.</p>
<p>It is Saturday and the whole place was crowded with people,
many of whom had evidently come in from the country, for they all
were crowned with fresh flowers.&nbsp; A few children lay on the
floor at their parents&rsquo; feet, sleeping.&nbsp; There were
men of every color there.&nbsp; No collars were worn even by the
white men, while one&mdash;an Englishman, I found out
later&mdash;was in nothing more than a bathing-dress and a very
great deal of tattoo.&nbsp; The noise was terrific: if shouting
failed to bring a Chinaman, or one of his Tahitian waitresses,
the people took up their chairs and banged them on the floor,
while all the time an agonizing admixture of many different tunes
was strummed upon innumerable guitars, and concertinas mingled
with the sounds of a gramophone braying out jazz music&mdash;or
so-called music.</p>
<p>The Tahitian waitresses, with their flowing hair, moved
superbly, and altogether aloof, <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>bearing their heavy trays in front of
them.&nbsp; All the ladies of the town were there.&nbsp; There
was one, very ugly and badly dressed, but with such an air, such
a beckoning assurance that every man in the place turned to look
at her as she walked down the room with her breasts thrust out,
her shoulders squeezed up high and tight, swinging her hips in
the way in which they all do.</p>
<p>I had a chop-suey of shredded chicken with shrimps, and
shredded vegetables and red pepper&mdash;an immense heaped plate
of it served with a bowl of rice and a doll&rsquo;s saucer of
piquant sauce, and China tea to follow.</p>
<p>Coming back along the waterside I found a great number of
little schooners and ketches anchored there, pulling at their
ropes with a soft whimper, for the tide was going out,
endeavoring to draw them with it.</p>
<p>In the stern of one boat some one was playing a guitar and men
and women were singing.&nbsp; This serenade was broken into by
the most appalling, long-drawn shrieks as I passed the bows,
growing louder and louder, more and more piercing, until they
ended in one long, horrid gurgle.&nbsp; A sound which made it
plain to the meanest imagination that a little pig&mdash;and all
boats carry them, running about the deck&mdash;was being killed
for the Sunday <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>dinner, while, likely enough, one of the swains chanting
such melodious love-songs was himself doing the job, without so
much as turning a hair over it.</p>
<h2><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> morning I came out to stay at
Taravao with Maou-u and his family.&nbsp; An artist from Papeete
arrived at the same time, and wanted to be put up, greatly
embarrassing Maou-u, for he had promised the guest-house to
me.&nbsp; Being, however, fundamentally unable to refuse anything
to any one, he ended by giving the artist a bed in his own
house,&mdash;one immense room like a dormitory, with eight beds
set with snowy sheets and mosquito curtains, where he and his
wife and three children, and the two maids of honor sleep; for by
Tahitians it would be considered altogether gross and
&ldquo;uneducated&rdquo; for any two people, even a husband and
wife, to share a bed.&nbsp; All the meals were taken on the
veranda outside, the cooking done over a fire, or, best of all,
in a hole in the ground among hot stones, a little distance
away.</p>
<p>The artist is to have his meals with me on my veranda.&nbsp; I
do not greatly care for the look of him; still, it can&rsquo;t be
helped, and I am too altogether full of contentment to be easily
put out by anything.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>I lay
down in the guest-house after <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, but I did
not sleep.&nbsp; In reality I was too happy to sleep.&nbsp; A
tiny, pale, gold-skinned boy came and squatted on his hunkers on
the floor, gazing up at me as I lay upon my bed.&nbsp; He fitted
in with the general scheme of coloring, for the walls of the
guest-house are made of a basketwork of fine, split, goldy-tinted
bamboo, and there is a high-peaked roof of plaited palm-leaves
bleached to a pale biscuit tint.&nbsp; There are three windows
and three very wide doorways.&nbsp; From one of these doorways
you look down up the inland lagoon and the causeway; from another
upon the great sweep of bay with its islands; the third gives
into the garden with its pink and scarlet and rose cannas,
crimson and yellow crotons, multi-tinted zinnias, roses and
palms.&nbsp; Every scene, hung like a magic curtain across the
doors and windows, is so altogether beautiful that upon whichever
side I turn I find myself unable to keep my eyes shut.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock this evening Maou-u&rsquo;s wife, the
two girls, the three children and I go down to bathe in the river
a quarter of a mile away, while Maou-u himself follows us
later.</p>
<p>We make our way along the road for a little, then turn off
through deep bush to a bend where <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the river flows, swiftly swirling,
beneath a high bank overhung with trees, whose long roots hang
like snakes down to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The three children climb up into the trees, a height full
forty feet above the water, and dive, dropping in a sitting
position, crossing their legs as they touch it.&nbsp; Armani,
aged nine; Spole, aged seven; and Charlie, only four but tall as
a child of six.&nbsp; Both the little girls have long, flowing
straight hair, and it is delightful to see them
swimming&mdash;racing beneath the water, like small fishes, their
hair streaming out beside them like fine, elongated,
semi-transparent fins.&nbsp; They are totally without fear,
though the water is at least ten feet deep.&nbsp; All three
children are swift and supple, finely made and fair as golden
shadows, for their mother has Alsatian blood and is a beautiful
woman with blue-gray eyes.</p>
<p>Maou-u joins his children in the deep water, but we four women
go on farther to a place where there is a beach of round
pebbles.&nbsp; Maou-u&rsquo;s wife does not bathe, as there is
another baby on its way, but the rest of us go into the water in
our petticoats.&nbsp; Following the directions of the others, I
have brought a cake of soap, a clean dress, and a princess
petticoat with me.&nbsp; I bathe in the petticoat I have on; then
when I come out of the water <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>I put on my fresh things and wash
those that I have been wearing, as do the other women.&nbsp; And
this, it seems, is the rule of the day, to change your clothes
twice and bathe twice,&mdash;then at night to bathe your feet the
last thing before getting into bed.</p>
<p>The three children come running up, and, seeing that I have
not yet finished dressing, immediately turn their backs, sitting
like three small gold-tinted statues motionless upon the stones
at the edge of the water until I am once more presentable.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is only five in the morning, but I could sleep no longer
and am sitting on my veranda, waiting for the sunrise, which
begins with a silver-gilt diffusion of light over the entire
scene.&nbsp; The fish are once more leaping high in the inner and
outer lagoons, as I could hear them doing up to twelve
o&rsquo;clock last night.&nbsp; I see Marcaline&rsquo;s figure
out upon the causeway and she calls to me, her hands rounded to
her mouth, telling me that the sun is about to rise.&nbsp; From
the exultation and joy in her voice one might think that such a
thing had never happened before.&nbsp; By the time I join her,
the outer and inner lagoons are like sheets of gold with crimson
roses reflected upon them; the mountains at the back glow with
purple and gilt, while <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>in a cleft of the mountains to the
right of us the sun comes up, as it seems, with a rush.</p>
<p>Already the children are bathing in the inner lagoon, laughing
and shouting, splashing golden drops around them; they bring a
small fish to show to me, flat and broad and of the color of
brilliant blue enamel shot with violet.&nbsp; For a few minutes
they play about around me, then run back into the water, catching
fish in their hands and throwing them up to their two pet
frigate-birds, which swoop and swirl above them, mount so high
that they are lost to sight, then swoop down again.</p>
<p>I am wearing nothing more than my nightgown and the thinnest
of kimonos, but I paddle down to the edge of the water and join
the children, watching them with delight as they gaze upward,
throwing the fish as high as they can, calling out the names of
their birds in long-drawn syllables: &ldquo;Chacco-o!&nbsp;
Chacco-o!&nbsp; Chacco-o!&nbsp; T-i-t-i!&nbsp; T-i-t-i!&nbsp;
T-i-t-i,&rdquo; perfectly sure as to which is which, while they
are so far overhead that I myself am unable to see them.</p>
<p>The children have in general lovely manners: never once since
that first afternoon, when Charlie came and sat upon my floor and
gazed at me, have they come near me or into the garden when I
might be dressing or resting.&nbsp; Directly I begin to <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>eat, they
move away, however absorbed they may be in their games upon my
veranda, and if, when we are out walking, I stop to speak to any
one, they walk out of ear-shot at once.&nbsp; All alike, however,
detest the artist, whom Marcaline and the other native girls call
&ldquo;Mam&rsquo;selle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Spole has two French words,
&ldquo;<i>savez</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>no savez</i>,&rdquo;
though there is little enough that she does not know,&mdash;the
native names and habits of all the birds and fish, flowers, and
trees, being perfectly familiar to her,&mdash;while her English
consists of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;no good,&rdquo; into
which she throws a wealth of meaning.&nbsp; Thus when she speaks
of the artist she wrinkles up her minute nose until it is nothing
more than a series of creases upon her small thin face, turns
down her thumb, and with the greatest disgust ejaculates,
&ldquo;No good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is, indeed, exasperating.&nbsp; This morning he had his
&ldquo;little breakfast&rdquo; on my veranda with
me,&mdash;coffee, fresh cocoanut cream, bananas, and oranges
still gleaming with dew,&mdash;and all the while he grumbled and
peeved, declaring that he had lost a silver spoon which he had
brought with him; that he had been unable to sleep because of the
snoring of his host, the coughing and fidgeting of children; that
the cocks and hens awoke him at dawn; that he would be sure to
get elephantiasis, <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>sleeping among natives.&nbsp; All this in face of
Maou-u&rsquo;s wonderful hospitality disgusted me so, spoiled my
early morning blaze of joy to such an extent that I am glad now
to be out in the canoe with the children and Maou-u&rsquo;s best
boy to paddle us.&nbsp; For the winds get up so suddenly here
that it is not safe to venture far without some one with a strong
arm, and we have set our hearts upon getting out to the reef.</p>
<p>The canoe is so narrow that only the smallest child can really
sit in it: others must perch upon a little board laid across it,
or overstride it like a horse.&nbsp; The children hop in as light
as birds, but for me, a trifle lame as I am, it is more
difficult.&nbsp; Spole, for all her seven years no bigger than
Charlie at four, is as careful of me as though I were a child,
supporting me with her minute, wiry person, absorbedly
anxious.</p>
<p>I sit cross-legged over the narrow canoe, scribbling upon my
knee, wearing nothing more than a cotton dress and petticoat,
with a bath towel hung over my shoulders to keep off the
sun.&nbsp; If I held up a parasol we should certainly go over,
and I am, indeed, growing so used to this bath-towel arrangement
that when I leave it off I shall feel as naked as one does when,
in London, one makes one&rsquo;s first appearance without a
fur.&nbsp; For <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>coolness nothing could be better, as I dip it
constantly into the sea, wring it out very slightly, and sit with
the drops from it trickling down my spine.</p>
<p>The water is as clear as glass.&nbsp; In some places it is so
shallow that the children jump in and out of the canoe and push
it in front of them.&nbsp; As we near the reef they sit perfectly
still, for here the sea is full of currents, dangerous, and
deep.&nbsp; Below us are gardens of coral and trees of coral, of
every shade of pink and pale mushroom; great flat tables of coral
and fairy fine forests of seaweed, green and rose at the bottom
of it, shot through and through with small brilliant blue
fish.</p>
<p>The frigate-birds, which have followed us out, whirl and plane
overhead with a sound like weeping; a sound so penetrating that
it pierces the roar of the waves, which arch their great necks
above us at the farther side of the reef, dropping in a mass of
foam upon it, racing toward us in deep, greedy ripples which rock
the canoe violently from side to side.</p>
<p>It is seven o&rsquo;clock by now, and so hot that we put back
toward the shore.&nbsp; After landing the boy, who is anxious to
be back at his work, the children take me in at the mouth of the
river and on up it.&nbsp; The trees on each side are immense,
dark, sullen, and threatening, as is so much <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>tropical
vegetation.&nbsp; Here are tall and slender mapau trees, with
their extraordinary flange-like roots, and trees of a heavier
build with large, round, brilliantly green leaves, thick as
metal, which the children call <i>hotu</i>.&nbsp; From all alike
hang long beards of lichen and a brilliant green parasite like
bunches of long satin ribbons; while some of the trees are so
thick with the ferns that it is impossible to tell which is fern
and which is tree.</p>
<p>The frigate-birds, overcome by boredom as we turn in among the
trees, where they can no longer display their swooping, leave us
and go back to the shore, where, too lazy to catch fish for
themselves, they will, supposing no one goes out in the canoes,
sit mewing and complaining throughout the entire day.&nbsp; In
their place, however, clouds of shining white birds the size of
pigeons, only more lightly built and with fine curved wings,
hover round us with a loud fretful cry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>E-t-a-t-ae</i>,&rdquo; the children call to them, and I
write it as they say it, every letter separate and distinct.</p>
<p>There is another bird, half as large again as a thrush, pale
greenish brown, and very slender, with a long curved bill like
that of a humming-bird, the smooth aristocratic air of a person
whose clothes are very beautifully made by the best tailor.&nbsp;
This the children seem to call &ldquo;<i>a-u-u</i>,&rdquo; with
the <i>a</i> <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>wide as in the Italian; but then again, or so it seems
to me,&mdash;though I cannot be sure that it is the same
bird,&mdash;they call to it as &ldquo;<i>Au-ta-a</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Au-ta-a</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In parts of the river there are deep pools, black, without a
ripple; in others the water eddies over such shallows that the
canoe can scarcely pass, and the children jump in and out of it,
pushing it, chasing the fish.&nbsp; There are cries of
&ldquo;<i>Pou-e-e</i>! <i>pou-e-e</i>!&rdquo; and they tumble out
in such haste after an eel, which they fail to catch, that both
paddles go with them, are recaptured with difficulty, much
laughing and shouting.</p>
<p>I should like to draw the mapau trees with their sinister and
fleshly roots; but the mosquitos settle upon my hands so thickly
that it is impossible; while both my hands and ankles are already
so swollen out of shape that we are driven into the open.</p>
<p>Coming out of the mouth of the river, caught by the wind, the
canoe swings atop of the water so airily that it seems that it
might take wing and sweep upward to join the frigate-birds which
have come out to meet us, bitterly complaining.&nbsp; I, who
cannot swim at all, find it difficult to take it as gaily as the
children, who are like fish in the water.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Mam&rsquo;selle grows to be a more and more unmitigated
nuisance; throughout the whole of dinner this evening he has
grumbled.&nbsp; When Marcaline says, at the end, in her pretty
way: &ldquo;I hope the dinner was good?&rdquo;&mdash;the dinner,
mind you, for which Maou-u would never accept so much as a
penny&mdash;he snaps out, &ldquo;The coffee is cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To escape from him and the mosquitos I go out in the canoe
with the children.&nbsp; Armani, who is all moods, is in a fit of
the blues, and the other two, who love teasing&mdash;as all these
people do&mdash;torment her so that she at last retreats to the
extreme stern; sits there with her back turned to us, her fingers
in her ears.</p>
<p>We go a long way up the coast by innumerable bays, past
innumerable islets.&nbsp; The hills are black, the water shining
like mother-of-pearl in the moonlight.&nbsp; And all the time we
are out, when they are not baiting Armani, the two younger
children sing to me in their soft treble voices.</p>
<p>When we get back to the causeway Maou-u calls for me to come
up to the house and hear his gramophone, playing songs and airs
from the grand operas, which he passionately loves.&nbsp; The
whole party is sitting under the palm-leaf lean-to, which takes
the place of dining- and sitting-room.&nbsp; <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Marcaline
has a new pale-pink flounced muslin dress and patent-leather
shoes, which she very soon kicks off.&nbsp; She appears to have
quite forgotten the irritation aroused by Mam&rsquo;selle and
must be dreaming of love, aching with love, from the look of her,
the expression in her face, as she sits with her chin upon her
clasped hands, gazing out to sea.</p>
<p>Maou-u takes Spole on his knee and presses his cheek to
hers.&nbsp; Of the three children, both he and his wife have
always seemed fondest of this small pale and spiritual creature;
now to my surprise I hear her speak of &ldquo;My real
papa,&rdquo; and find that Maou-u is, indeed, no more than the
&ldquo;papa who gives me bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; For these people
have strange ways with children.&nbsp; They look upon it as a
sort of grossness to be overfond of their own, differentiating
between them and others.&nbsp; They are, indeed, equally fond of
all children, treating them with a passionate tenderness.&nbsp;
If a woman is expecting a child and a friend begs that she may
have it when it is born, she will not be refused and another
child is taken in its place; so there may be in one family many
children of different parentage, though it is impossible to tell
the difference between them.</p>
<p>Mam&rsquo;selle has been upsetting Maou-u&rsquo;s wife so, <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and she in
a state of health where she must not be upset, that Maou-u came
to me this morning and asked whether his bed could be put on my
veranda.&nbsp; It is an intolerable nuisance, but how was it
possible to say no when Maou-u&rsquo;s own hospitality is
unbounded?&nbsp; Fortunately, when I get back to my house this
evening, though it is no more than nine o&rsquo;clock, he is fast
asleep under a mosquito curtain which I had in my pack and lent
to him.&nbsp; There is no other place for his bed save directly
against the openwork bamboo wall, at the other side of which
stands my washing-stand, and I am rather afraid that he may awake
while I am performing my ablutions.&nbsp; Fortunately, however,
despite his assertions of insomnia, he sleeps on, even snores;
and after all, come to think of it, it doesn&rsquo;t greatly
matter one way or another, seeing that he is a landscape and not
a figure painter.&nbsp; But&mdash;Heavens!&mdash;what a setting
for a romance!&nbsp; Never, never, or so it seems, were
Browning&rsquo;s wonderful words: &ldquo;Never the time and the
place and the loved one altogether,&rdquo; more apt.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The end has come.&nbsp; At his &ldquo;little breakfast&rdquo;
this morning, the artist was in an altogether intolerable humor,
and the veranda was a disgusting sight with his unmade bed and
all his untidy <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>belongings.&nbsp; I was the offender this time&mdash;I
under whose mosquito curtain he snored, and snored.&nbsp; I had
disturbed him with my fidgeting.&nbsp; My temper broke and I
turned upon him, bidding him, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, shut
up!&rdquo; and informing him that, as I had come there for rest
and quiet and not to be bothered by anybody, I should be glad if
he would stop complaining.</p>
<p>Upon this he turned on me like a cat, hissing and screaming,
stuttering with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;You damned civilized women
oughtn&rsquo;t to be allowed in the place, spoiling
everything!&rdquo; he cried, at which I laughed, for it was
really too funny in the face of all his fussing, his silver
spoon, his nerves.&nbsp; As to my civilization, what was there to
be said for it, considering my costume, a rough-dried dress, my
bath-towel over my shoulders, my hair in a plait?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! that&rsquo;s very good!&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Civilized&rsquo; from a man whom every
native girl in the island knows as
&lsquo;Mam&rsquo;selle.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; An answer which did
nothing whatever to turn away his wrath, for he rushed off down
the garden and across the road to Maou-u&rsquo;s house, where I
heard him shrieking curses, declaring that he would no longer
take his meals with &ldquo;that damned woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this was the end of it, for Maou-u was furious,
declaring that he would not have the <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>creature in his house, though he
himself was too much of a gentleman to send him off in the heat
of the day.&nbsp; Thus, all this morning, while the children and
I have been paddling around the shallows, in the canoe, we have
seen him sulking under the trees where he was ultimately given
his <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;with the dogs,&rdquo; as
Maou-u put it, adding, &ldquo;A cannibal have better
manners,&rdquo;&mdash;lying down there to rest until the
motor-lorry which takes bananas, sugar-cane, vegetables, and
passengers to Papeete each day came past.</p>
<p>Now he is safely off the premises and we all go down to bathe
together with a new sense of peace in our hearts.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, almost worth having had him here to realize the relief of
his going: the old game of the swings and the roundabouts.</p>
<p>It is after eight and we are all sitting upon the edge of the
causeway, with dangling feet, while Maou-u plays very softly upon
his concertina.&nbsp; The after-sunset sky is the color of honey;
the moon is honey-like; so is the sweetness of the air.&nbsp;
Four more days remain to me out here&mdash;four entire days and
four nights bland with sweetness and pure air: hours like honey
distilled drop by drop.</p>
<p>Heaven be thanked that I am old enough to <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>realize
what happiness is, a gift denied to youth; to savor the rareness
of it, to miss nothing, to blur nothing.&nbsp; I am happy now;
and throughout four more days and nights I intend to be happy,
for no letter can reach me, and whatever may come later I shall
have had this: a joy free from rivalry and striving, the fever of
love, the strain of triumph; hours like the song of a bird in my
heart.</p>

111</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little schooner for Cook Island
has departed without me, no single one of the passengers having
changed his mind or been translated to a better world, as I so
fondly hoped.&nbsp; And yet I don&rsquo;t know that I have felt
altogether disappointed, for, at the back of my mind, I have been
conscious of a fear that in changing my plans I might be
upsetting the decrees of that fate which forever makes difficult
things easy, and easy things difficult, to me; so that, if I set
my heart upon anything which seems well-nigh impossible, I
usually get what I want.&nbsp; It is, indeed, the commonplace,
the ordinary, the everyday sort of luck which fails to flow my
way, and to such an extent that there has never been any real
sequence in my life.</p>
<p>Upon a map in Fleet Street I planned out my voyage among the
Pacific isles and onward round the world, as confidently as
though it were the littlest cross-country journey in England,
though if it had been that, everything would have gone wrong and
I should have missed every connection <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>that it was possible to miss.&nbsp;
I picked it off with the point of a
hat-pin,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there, and there, and
there,&rdquo;&mdash;embarking in spirit upon a journey of
hundreds upon hundreds of miles, among islands which seemed to
me, in my ignorance, as easy to dodge about among as the
close-set hamlets of an English county.&nbsp; I planned it all
quite regardless of distance, the difficulties of connections;
the truth being that, if I am perfectly determined to do
anything, I dare not look too closely into it.</p>
<p>What I said was: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go by cargo-steamer as far
as Tahiti; then I&rsquo;ll pick up a schooner of some sort and
make my way to Samoa and Fiji.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reiterated my intention during the voyage, and people who
knew the Pacific laughed at me as a maniac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no schooner going that way once in
four years, so you had better put that idea out of your head,
once and for all,&rdquo; was what they said.</p>
<p>All the same, I persisted stubbornly in face of their careful
explanation&mdash;the sort of explanation which one does give to
an idiot&mdash;that the only possible course for me would be to
take the New Zealand Shipping Company&rsquo;s mail-steamer to
Wellington; train from Wellington to Auckland, <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and try
there for another steamer to Fiji; though it was more than
likely, or so they said, that I should be obliged to go over to
Sydney to get one.</p>
<p>Only look at the map, and imagine what I should have felt had
I taken this seriously; the time, the money involved.&nbsp; But I
simply could not take it seriously.&nbsp; It was like an
inoculation which has no effect whatever upon one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I must be able to pick up something,&rdquo; was
what I said, and stuck to it, adding: &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll
give myself six weeks in Tahiti, and if I don&rsquo;t hear of
something by that time I may begin to think about the
mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, however, I have met with an amazing bit of good fortune,
and my belief in the easy attainment of the apparently
unattainable is justified, for when I arrived back from
Maou-u&rsquo;s I found a four-masted schooner lying up against
the wharf.</p>
<p>Upon inquiring about this schooner, however, I was told very
definitely that she was bound for Noumea and never took any
passengers.&nbsp; That seemed the end.&nbsp; Not that I was
balked by the idea of any one really standing out against
passengers, but that I did not greatly care for anything I had
heard about New Caledonia.</p>
<p>Nevertheless during the week that followed I found myself
constantly loitering upon the wharf, <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>staring at the schooner with that
longing, that pulling at my heart-strings, which sailing-ships of
almost any kind bring to me.</p>
<p>She had the air of a boat that is run for nothing but
business.&nbsp; Battered by storms, bedraggled by three months at
sea, she had not so much as a single inch of clean paint or
unrusted iron about her.&nbsp; Despite the fact that she was
sailing under the flag of the Panama Republic, for the single
reason that she was carrying such a cargo, stored in such a way,
as no other country would have tolerated, she hailed from San
Francisco.&nbsp; Her holds were crammed with gasolene and
dynamite, the decks packed so high with timber that one could
walk level from the poop-deck to the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle
head.&nbsp; A queer build of boat, altogether, for I was used to
schooners with flush decks, fore and aft.</p>
<p>Still I was drawn to her, so drawn that I questioned every one
I came across.&nbsp; And yet I could hear nothing.&nbsp; There
seemed something elusive about her.&nbsp; The captain and
officers must have come and gone in the town, but I could never
get hold of them, and though some of the crew, for the most part
Loyalty Island boys, were in the Port Restaurant almost every
evening, they were usually fighting drunk.&nbsp; And that is what
the <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Loyalty Islanders are like.&nbsp; There are no better
workers at sea, but once they get on shore with liquor in their
heads, and the evil tempers of shores raging in their hearts,
they are ill to meet.</p>
<p>Now, this morning, when I came down to <i>petit
d&eacute;jeuner</i> at seven, some one told me that the schooner
had moved away from the quay to make room for another vessel, and
that she was sailing to-day, touching at Samoa and Fiji before
she went on to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>At this I was off like an arrow from a bow.&nbsp; Racing
upstairs to get my hat and put on some shoes&mdash;for at
Johnny&rsquo;s one breakfasts barefooted&mdash;I made for the
port.</p>
<p>Looking in at the first Chinaman&rsquo;s store I
passed,&mdash;for the Chinamen always know everything,&mdash;I
found out what company the schooner was consigned to, and raced
on there.&nbsp; By this time it was after seven, and the sun
seemed to be literally shooting up into the heavens.&nbsp; Every
moment it grew hotter; my clothes melted around me, and it was a
long walk.&nbsp; When at last I arrived at the offices of the
company I had been told of, I found that it was true that the
<i>Monterey</i> was leaving that same day, at twelve
o&rsquo;clock, I was informed, bound not only for Fiji and Samoa,
but for the Friendly Islands also, which <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>made me
keener than ever; more absolutely determined to force fate.</p>
<p>There was, however, or so it was said, no sort of
accommodation for passengers.&nbsp; When I persisted, declaring
that I was no sort of a passenger, as passengers were generally
understood, the head of the company&mdash;who had come into the
outer office to see what was afoot&mdash;shrugged his
shoulders.&nbsp; Of course the skipper could take me if he
wished, the company had nothing whatever to do with a matter of
this sort; he was a perfectly free agent, part owner, they
believed, and they themselves were merely acting as the
consignees for so much of the cargo as was being unloaded in
Tahiti.</p>
<p>The best thing I could do was to go and see the skipper
myself, he added, and very obligingly sent a clerk to show me the
way to the new anchorage.</p>
<p>I found the schooner swinging out in the stream so as to allow
room for the stern of an American tourist boat, fattened with
Philistines, and hailed her.</p>
<p>A negro came up onto the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle head and I asked
if the captain was aboard, but was told that he had gone ashore
ten minutes before.&nbsp; I had an idea that I might find him at
the Port Restaurant, but I was just three minutes too late
there.&nbsp; I then <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>enquired at the nearest stores, and
in two of them found that he had been just before me.&nbsp; It
was, indeed, like following a leaf upon a stream of running
water, and every moment I grew hotter and hotter, more and more
fiercely determined.</p>
<p>At last I harked back to the company&rsquo;s offices, where,
to my surprise,&mdash;for the chase had gone on so long that any
end to it seemed impossible, the whole affair had the texture of
a dream,&mdash;a clerk whom I met crossing the yard pointed to a
man talking to two others in white and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the skipper of the <i>Monterey</i>;
he has just this moment come up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went up and stood by the three of them.&nbsp; It was not
good manners, but when you want anything very badly you
don&rsquo;t seem to care for manners.</p>
<p>The two tall, heavily built men in white sun-helmets, drooping
a little from the tropics, stood with their backs to me.&nbsp;
But the captain was facing me: a small wiry, gray-haired man in a
gray suit, with a straw hat a little on one side; a small gray
moustache; very square shoulders, a look of great activity, and
the most intelligent, the clearest and cleverest, the most
sympathetic and mirthful hazel eyes that I have ever seen.&nbsp;
These eyes met mine and we stared straight at each other, into <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>each other,
while the conviction that we were to be shipmates came to me.</p>
<p>Still they went on talking.&nbsp; When they came to a pause,
however, it was to him alone I spoke&mdash;straight out, with no
idea whatever of an introduction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I want you to let me have a passage on your
schooner to&mdash;&rdquo; I was going to say Samoa, but my mind
leapt on to&mdash;&ldquo;Samoa and the Friendly
Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his bright gaze still full upon me, smiling, showing a
set of the very whitest teeth imaginable, he answered, and I was
sure it was with reluctance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, but it is quite impossible.&nbsp; You see,
we have no sort of accommodation for passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words sounded definite enough; but I persisted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not an ordinary passenger; I am used to all sorts
of boats.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want a cabin, I can sleep on
deck.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sign on as one of the crew.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care what I do; all I want is to get the
passage.&rdquo;&nbsp; I heard my own voice passionately eager,
knew that what I was saying hit home.</p>
<p>For a little while longer we talked together; then the skipper
said that he had things to see to; that <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>he would go
back to his ship, find out whether anything could be arranged,
and, returning to the office, telephone me at Johnny&rsquo;s,
though, of course, there was very little time, for they were
sailing at twelve.</p>
<p>I knew that I might be making a fatal mistake in letting him
out of my sight, but there seemed nothing else for it.</p>
<p>Directly I was away from him my heart began to fail me.&nbsp;
I was not so sure of the passage as I had been.&nbsp; Devastated
by racing about in the heat of the day, I felt my will-power
weakening, and, realizing this as fatal, as if to clinch it I
forced fate&mdash;went straight to the bank and drew out all the
money I had there; then to the post-office, where I ordered all
my letters forwarded to Wellington, to await there further
instructions.&nbsp; After this I went on to the Chinese laundry,
where I paid my bill and took away my bundle of
linen&mdash;fortunately washed and dried, though
unironed&mdash;telling myself that now everything was in train I
should certainly get my passage upon the schooner.</p>
<p>I then went back to Johnny&rsquo;s; tried to find Johnny to
ask what he had been charging for my room.&nbsp; I met with no
success, and began packing.&nbsp; By this time it was eleven
o&rsquo;clock, and my heart <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>was in my boots, though I could not
have said why.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the telephone-bell rang.&nbsp; When
I answered it&mdash;with death in my heart&mdash;I found it was
one of the clerks from the shipping-office, ringing up to tell me
the captain had just been in and declared that it was quite
impossible to take me.</p>
<p>At this I was mad, and so wound up that, feeling it would be
impossible to stay on tamely where I was, I started off again, in
all the dust and heat, to the far end of the town, to the offices
of the representatives of the Phosphate Company of Makatea.&nbsp;
There I took a ticket for a little tin-pot steamer leaving that
afternoon; for it is only some eighteen hours&rsquo; journey to
the island of Makatea, and I thought I would stay there four or
five days; then come back in hopes that something else would have
turned up by that time.</p>
<p>On the way I ran into the captain of the schooner, and once
again we looked each other very straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you won&rsquo;t have me, Captain,&rdquo; I
said, and, he answering that he was sorry too, we passed on our
ways, with nothing more between us, for the heart was clean gone
out of me.</p>
<p>On my way back from the Phosphate <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Company&rsquo;s offices I turned
into the Port Restaurant for <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> and, finding
there the Englishman who had come over on <i>El Kantara</i> with
me, sat down at the same table and told him my troubles.&nbsp;
This only made me feel worse, for he said it was the sort of
chance that could come to any one only once in a lifetime.&nbsp;
The two keepers of the restaurant added that it would be
impossible for me to find a better skipper, comforting me but
little by the declaration that they would miss me sorely if I
went.</p>
<p>After a little while the captain himself came past the veranda
where we were sitting and paused at my table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! oho!&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;you would not do
that if you really wanted to be shut of me,&rdquo; and,
introducing him to my friend, I remarked that if he would not
take me on his schooner he might at least sit there and have a
drink with me, which he did.</p>
<p>He would like to take me, he said, &ldquo;like it fine,&rdquo;
but there was no room whatever.</p>
<p>It was then twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The time of sailing
for the schooner had been put off for two hours, so that it would
leave at two, the same time as the steamer for Makatea, which I
knew would be punctual.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>By
this time I was as excited as a gambler.&nbsp; I praised myself
like a Cheap Jack, extravagantly and without shame: there was no
sort of sea that I minded; I could cook; I could darn socks.</p>
<p>Coming down off the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle head in the dark a
couple of days earlier the captain had fallen into the small
hatch at the bottom of the companion and broken three ribs.&nbsp;
He told me about this, pathetically, like a child, with his hand
upon his side; told me that there was nobody on board who so much
as knew how to wind a bandage, and in this I seemed to find my
chance.&nbsp; To hear me, you would have thought that there was
nothing on earth that I could not do; that no ship, no hospital
on earth, was complete without me.</p>
<p>By this time I was perfectly determined against Makatea, able
to sit up and take some solid nourishment, in which the captain
joined me.&nbsp; The upshot of the whole thing was the suggestion
that I might, anyhow, come on board and see her; satisfy myself
that there was no sort of room.</p>
<p>The two mates looked at me very wryly when I stepped on
board.&nbsp; The very small amount of deck in any way clear was
filthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one possible place where you could
sleep,&rdquo; said the captain, and showed it to me: a tiny
triangular store-room right in the <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>stern of the boat, stinking to
heaven, terribly hot and literally heaving with
cockroaches.&nbsp; Nothing on earth would have induced me to
sleep there, but when the captain turned to me and said,
&ldquo;You see, it is perfectly impossible,&rdquo; I protested
stoutly that, on the contrary, it would suit me very well.&nbsp;
I thought the question of sleeping on deck might well be fought
out later.</p>
<p>Up on deck again, we went over the whole thing afresh.&nbsp; I
felt him giving in, and at last with a long-drawn sigh he
capitulated&mdash;and for the quaintest of reasons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to take you, I see
that&mdash;have to take you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t refuse you
anything,&rdquo; he said; and added with a cock of his head, a
long-drawn roll of his &ldquo;r&rdquo;: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
fair crazy about skinny women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled it.&nbsp; Still, for me to go as a passenger was
against all regulations, and I must sign on as one of the
crew&mdash;stewardess on a vessel where there never was, had
been, never would be any other woman to attend to.</p>
<p>Within half an hour I had collected all my goods and chattels,
bade an almost tearful farewell to Johnny and Johnny&rsquo;s, and
got my luggage over to the schooner.&nbsp; I left my possessions
heaped together on the poop-deck, met the captain at the <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>port
office, and signed on&mdash;for a year, if it were so required of
me.</p>
<p>I am now back on the schooner and part of her.&nbsp; I have
got my deck-chair open and am sitting writing, feeling as
completely at home as though I had never been anywhere
else.&nbsp; There is auxiliary steam, and the engineer is trying
to get the engines going, but without much success, as it seems,
though every now and then a dense puff of smoke laden with soot
belches forth from a tin chimney belonging to the donkey-engine,
immediately above my head.</p>
<p>I write a little and sleep a little, write a little more and
sleep a little more, thickly peppered over with smuts.&nbsp;
Somebody brings me a mug of black coffee.&nbsp; There is still a
great deal of coming and going of cargo: two o&rsquo;clock, three
o&rsquo;clock, four o&rsquo;clock pass, and there seems no
prospect of getting away.&nbsp; Not that it matters in the
least.&nbsp; Here I am, here I stay.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There is no wind, and as our
engines refuse to do anything beyond smoking, a small tug comes
and draws us out to a fresh anchorage between the Quarantine
Island and the shore.</p>
<p>This little island is now a green black; Moorea, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>an
orchid-purple; the sea, a pale gold shot with purple.&nbsp; The
tourist steamer lying against the wharf shows a hundred
lights.&nbsp; There are scattered lights along the shore, among
the trees, in the Port Caf&eacute;&mdash;infinitely far removed,
aeons away from the time when I last took my
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> there.</p>
<p>Here, on board the schooner, the last meal of the day is over:
pea-soup, meat and vegetables, and strong black coffee.&nbsp; As
usual on this sort of boat no one at table spoke, unless to growl
out some request.&nbsp; There are two Swedish mates, the elder
stolid, fat, and middle-aged, the younger morose-looking until he
smiles, when his whole deeply tanned face, his blue eyes, light
up like a child&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There is also an American engineer
who strikes me as being permanently dyspeptic, and very near
permanently disgruntled by the ways of the strange contraption
for which he is responsible.</p>
<p>Though it was still so early, daylight had gone from the
little skylight atop of the saloon, and the hanging lamp was
lighted.&nbsp; In the galley, which opens out of it, a blue-robed
Chinaman hovered over gleaming copper pots, while another
Chinaman waited at table.</p>
<p>The captain did not come down, for he is suffering so much
from his broken ribs that the steep companionway causes him the
intensest anguish.&nbsp; <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>He is, oddly enough, a Swiss, who
since his boyhood has ranged up and down the West Coast of
America, north and south.&nbsp; He has an engaging accent, half
American, half French, and is amazingly like a bright-eyed bird,
interested in everything.&nbsp; Even now, when his face is
constantly twisted with pain, he is eager and alert; more alive
than any man I have ever met.&nbsp; He tells me that he does not
go down to his cabin at night, as he has been unable to lie down
since his accident; sleeps as best he can sitting upright upon
the tiny settee in the little wheel-house, or easing the pain by
standing with his arms folded, almost level with his chin, atop
of the locker.&nbsp; So, if I like, I can have his cabin until
the store-room, in regard to which I am perfectly silent, can be
cleared out.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have been lying down, trying to sleep upon the
captain&rsquo;s bunk, but it was so stiflingly hot with the
single port-hole no larger than a soup-plate that I went up on
deck at twelve.&nbsp; I found the captain, in the wheel-house,
standing with his head down upon his arms.&nbsp; He was groaning
a little, but the moment he heard me he glanced up with his
indomitable smile.</p>
<p>The first mate was on watch and I sat for a long <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>time in my
deck-chair, talking to him.&nbsp; The sky overhead was thick with
stars and so clear that it seemed as though one looked through
and through it, back and back into it, like a magic mirror or
black pool; while the air on deck was delicately fresh, like
young damp grass against one&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I went below again, and lay upon the bunk, spreading a grass
mat upon it for coolness.&nbsp; But sleep was impossible, and
coming up on deck again, I slept like the dead, rolled in a
blanket on the bare deck, until close upon four o&rsquo;clock,
when I was awakened by the catting of the anchor.</p>
<p>I sat up, clasping my hands round my knees, and tipping back
my head, fed upon the beauty of the Milky Way almost immediately
above me.</p>
<p>There was in the air a delicious smell of freshly roasted
coffee, and the second mate, who was on watch, fetched me a
mug&mdash;for it was baking-day, when the Chinese boys are astir
before two, making coffee and lighting the stove.</p>
<p>The air was delightful beyond words; the second mate and I
smoked and talked of Sweden, where I was staying last
summer.&nbsp; How odd life is!&nbsp; It came over me with a gust
of mirth&mdash;the extreme oddness of its ups and downs.&nbsp; To
think that I should be squatting on the deck of a <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>soot-black
schooner in the Southern Pacific, smoking and drinking coffee, at
an hour when most sane or insane people are tucked in their beds,
in box-like rooms, inclosed in box-like houses more or less
hermetically sealed until morning.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> board this boat one eats and
drinks everything one ought not to&mdash;meat three times a day
and lashings of black coffee.&nbsp; It does not seem that one is
likely to sleep overmuch.&nbsp; Last night&mdash;the first night
really at sea&mdash;I could not bear the thought of being below,
and had a mattress on the poop-deck right against the stern
rail.&nbsp; A long chair was rigged up for the captain to try if
he could not lie down, half reclining.</p>
<p>We passed Raiatea at sunset.&nbsp; The sky was pale green with
mists of cloud, the color of red-hot iron, above the island,
which showed out in front of it as though perfectly flat, a
uniform slate-gray with its many peaks.&nbsp; Just before
darkness fell, the sky was barred with perpendicular bands of
cloud above it, black and strangely menacing like prison
bars.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour after I first lay down, the wind
changed, and the spanker had to be shifted.&nbsp; I was awakened
by the first mate, whose watch it was, and staggered into the
wheel-house, <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>where I sat until they had finished, for the boom ran
clean across the place where I was lying.</p>
<p>Through the open door I could see the dark figures of the
half-naked men moving against a sky closely sifted over with
stars&mdash;men who looked as primitive as though they were part
of the Zodiac, working with and in among the constellations.</p>
<p>Venus is still upon our bows, as she was on the French
boat.&nbsp; Back upon my mattress now, lying flat on my back, I
can see the great spanker in front of me swinging against the
Milky Way, which seems to flow around the truck of it, parting
like water; while the whole heaven races to meet us, as we sway
and dip, going westward; curtsying our way among the stars.</p>
<p>The next thing is that it begins to rain.&nbsp; The mate calls
me, but I am more than half asleep, and snapping at him,
&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; turn and tuck my head more deeply into my
pillow.&nbsp; In another moment or so, however, the rain is
falling in a solid sheet and I am driven to the wheel-house,
where I sit drooping miserably, half dead with sleep.&nbsp;
However, it is soon over, and the benevolent mate finds me a dry
blanket and packs me up afresh.</p>
<p>The night seems endless, for we settled down at eight.&nbsp; I
have had another move since the rain, <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>for the spanker has had to be
shifted again, but even now it is barely midnight.</p>
<p>For the first time since I came on board, the captain is
asleep, the sky is clear, and it really does seem as if we may at
last be starting the night in earnest.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is impossible to work on deck, for the wind catches my
paper and the smuts smother me; while the two mates and the
engineer take it in turns, during those rare moments when the
captain is busy with something else, to talk to me.&nbsp; No one
of them will speak a single word in front of the others.&nbsp;
These men have, indeed, been so long at sea that, apart from the
usual taciturnity of sailors, they are acutely on one
another&rsquo;s nerves, can scarcely bear the sight of one
another.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The engine is really a little devil.&nbsp; It never seems to
do anything but rain down greasy soot,&mdash;though this in no
way diminishes the hopes of all concerned that each day it will
be better,&mdash;such soot that it is no good trying to wash
one&rsquo;s face in the ordinary way, and one must take a
nail-brush to do it.&nbsp; I have been just forty-eight hours on
board and already my neck is raised up in large water-blisters
from the sun, for there <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>are no awnings; while the backs of
my arms are like raw beef.</p>
<p>All the same I am happy, and Heaven only knows why.&nbsp;
Happy in a way that I am never happy in any other sort of place;
for at sea, upon a boat like this, I have somehow or other the
sensation of being at home among people who like me, whom I
understand and who understand me.&nbsp; I am altogether in my own
element, translated by my freedom from what most people call the
ordinary life&mdash;to me so extraordinary that it misfits me
like badly made clothes, stiff and ungainly, in which I never
fail to feel an ass.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is getting hotter and hotter.&nbsp; At breakfast this
morning&mdash;and seven o&rsquo;clock, mind you&mdash;it was 112
degrees Fahrenheit in the saloon.&nbsp; The sweat pours off us
all in a constant, profuse stream, mingling with the soot; so
that though I scrub all over every morning and again in the
middle of the afternoon, put on everything fresh twice each day,
I never feel clean.&nbsp; No one can eat, but the Chinese boys go
on stolidly and indifferently cooking food and putting it before
us.</p>
<p>After all, the heat and discomfort can be nothing to us in
comparison with what it is to the captain, in constant pain as he
is.&nbsp; There is absolutely <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>no even moderately cool spot on deck
except under the boom of the mainsail.&nbsp; There one may lie on
the top of the timber and get the draft; but it is impossible for
him to clamber across to it, and there is no place out of the sun
where he can sit, excepting in the sweltering little wheel-house
with the steersman, one or other of the Loyalty Island boys.</p>

<p>I found him asleep this afternoon with the sun from one of the
windows blazing full upon his face.&nbsp; Getting a bit of
curtain out of my pack, I hung one end to a hook in the wall and
was near to bringing catastrophe upon us all&mdash;putting the
entire magnetism of the ship out of gear&mdash;by driving in an
iron nail to hold up the other.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, the captain
opened one eye, just then, saw what I was doing, and let out a
bellow such as I should never have thought him capable of.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock this morning the captain came out of
the wheel-house and advised me to shift myself, as the wind was
about to change and I was likely to get a bucket of soot over me
from the chimney of the donkey-engine.&nbsp; Stubborn and sleepy,
however, I did no more than grunt, refusing to move, and in
another hour was well paid out for my folly by feeling something
like a thick <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>blanket over my face.&nbsp; Stumbling to my feet,
rubbing my sleepy eyes, I found that I was deluged in soot.</p>
<p>Having moved my mattress and blankets to the leeward, though
too late to be of much use, I crept through the
wheel-house&mdash;for not for anything in the world would I have
had the captain see me&mdash;and stumbled blindly down to the
saloon, where the second mate was having coffee.</p>
<p>The expression upon his face as he saw me, his slow,
&ldquo;Gee-whiz but you have got it this time!&rdquo; was
enough.&nbsp; Going into the captain&rsquo;s cabin, looking in
the glass as best I could,&mdash;for I was more than half
blinded,&mdash;I discovered that I was as black as though I had
been cleaning a chimney with my head and hands.</p>
<p>The Chinese boy got me some hot water, while the mate held a
mug of coffee to my lips and broke off some bread for me, for I
could not touch anything.&nbsp; It took seven buckets of hot
water and a whole pot of Selfridge&rsquo;s best massage
cream&mdash;and I would have given anything to have had the
lovely young lady who served me with it see to what uses it was
being put&mdash;to get me even moderately clean.&nbsp; I greased
and scrubbed every inch of my body, and each fresh bucket of
water was thick with scales of black.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Now,
since breakfast, I have been busy washing my kimono, nightgown,
and pillow-covers, with an accumulation of dresses and
petticoats, for we are well off for soft water after the
rain.</p>
<p>I sit upon a box on the poop-deck with a bucket between my
knees and wash in true sailor fashion&mdash;for soldiers squat at
their washing, rubbing it on a board on the ground or deck, while
sailors sit and rub it between their hands.&nbsp; The first mate
carries water for me and hangs out my clothes on a rope along the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle head, and the captain wrings out my heavier
gear, for my hands are so feeble with too much writing that I am
a hopelessly bad wringer.</p>
<p>We are now in latitude forty-two south, longitude one hundred
and fifty-nine, fifty-three west, and every afternoon for three
or four days the same thing has happened.&nbsp; It grows suddenly
and terribly hot, as though some inner oven of hell were opened
upon us, and a dense gray cloud shoots up in the east, lying like
a hand close pressed down above the horizon, which shows a vivid
green line.&nbsp; At the same moment it seems as though another,
and this time unseen, hand throws up a roll of carpet, the color
of old lead, over the eastern edge of the world, with so much
impetus that it rolls out and out, on and on for <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>miles,
though it is no more than a bare half mile in width.&nbsp; The
sea on each side of us remains the same pinkish mauve, for it is
by now almost immediately before sunset.&nbsp; Then, in another
moment, with a slap as though some one above us has overturned an
enormous bucket, the rain begins to fall, pouring down upon us in
one solid sluice.&nbsp; The wind swings round with a wrench that
shakes us from stem to stern, and all the sails have to be
re-shifted.</p>
<p>There is a Frenchman on board, a sort of semi-passenger, on
his way back to New Caledonia.&nbsp; He used to be mate of this
ship before she was sold to the present owners, of whom the
captain is one.&nbsp; We all dislike him intensely, for he has a
way of behaving as though the schooner belonged to him, coming in
and out of the wheel-house and glancing at the charts and sailing
directions.&nbsp; There is also one Englishman, who is supposed
to help with the engine, and of whom I am not particularly proud;
and a Russian among the otherwise entirely native crew.&nbsp;
Everybody is quarreling; each in turn comes to me with some
complaint or other, and when I look at the log I cannot wonder;
for the boat has been over three months out, was two months later
than she should have been in reaching Tahiti.&nbsp; Throughout
the entire <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>voyage one thing after another has gone wrong.&nbsp;
She had, indeed, to put back to San Francisco, ten days after she
left, for some repairs or other.</p>
<p>There are continual rains now and it is very difficult to
work.&nbsp; At this moment the first mate and I are cheek by jowl
on two upturned soapboxes at the chart-table in the wheel-house,
I typing and he working out his calculations.&nbsp; The captain,
who seems to have been in less pain the last couple of days, is
propped up on the little settee, deep in my copy of &ldquo;Moby
Dick,&rdquo; with his feet upon another soap-box.&nbsp; (For we
each have a soap-box of our own, about which we are very
fussy.)&nbsp; An immense and gravely absorbed Loyalty Island boy
stands at the wheel, dressed in his red
<i>par&eacute;u</i>.&nbsp; All this in a place smaller than the
smallest bath-room.</p>
<p>I begin to think that the officers would be better if they had
a little more variety in the way of food, and have started making
them blanc-manges, treacle tarts, etc., as a sort of treat,
though it is too grilling in the galley to attempt to remain
there long at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some places, as there are
some people, which are unresponsive to us and to which we
ourselves are unresponsive; while others affect us so that the
merest trifle, such as the way in which the light falls across
the trunks of a group of trees, a flower, an aspect of the dawn,
endears them to us forever, and, forgetting every discomfort that
we have ever encountered there, we remember this alone.</p>
<p>Now, I find it impossible to write fairly about
Upolu&mdash;which in speaking of Stevenson, people choose to call
Samoa, as though it, alone, comprised the whole
group&mdash;because from the very first moment I set my eyes upon
this island, which I had so greatly longed to see, it was
altogether dead to me.&nbsp; Dead and deadening the heavy green
of the mountains, lacking the fine piercing peaks of Tahiti; dead
and deadening the dark and uniform masses of growth, with their
impression of a scene painstakingly done out in Berlin wool by
those Germans who were so long in possession.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Deadening, too, was my first sight of the bay, with its
wreck of an old German ship which came to grief there as long ago
as 1889; deadening the almost incredibly slovenly beach, the once
magnificent cocoanut plantations, gray with disease and tightly
netted over with that convolvulus-like parasite commonly known as
&ldquo;A-Mile-a-Minute,&rdquo; which stifles everything on which
it sets its cruel fingers; dead the hotel, or, rather, the
pretense of a hotel,&mdash;dead, and dusty with death.</p>

<p>It is not that the island is not beautiful, for it is indeed
very beautiful.&nbsp; The road up to Vailima is perfectly lovely,
with its green spillways to the sea, the tree-clad heights of
Vaea, the sharp dipping valleys of the Vai-Singano, the
swift-running water-courses and waterfalls, the deep pool shaded
with orange-trees where Stevenson used to bathe; though even here
what attracted me more than anything else, the only thing which
has, so far, really touched me in the whole island, <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>were the
groups of native houses that I passed on my way up to
Vailima.&nbsp; And these are like nothing which I have ever seen
before, in their fitness and charm, in the cleanliness and
delicacy of their surroundings, with their little lawns smooth as
pigeons&rsquo; breasts, shorn by hand with long knives, their
flower-beds thick with roses, cannas, balsams, and zinnias of
many colors.</p>

<p>The Samoan native house carries all the enchantment of the
dream houses of my childhood days; the Perfect House in the
Perfect Wood which not even Barrie himself has been able
altogether to reconstruct for me; the house of happiness and joy
and plenty and beauty, full of song and laughter, familiar to
fairies and a veritable part of the woodland itself.</p>
<p>The Samoan house has the smoothness and glint of the wing of a
golden-tinted butterfly.&nbsp; It is very large, comprising one
room only, and round or oval in shape.&nbsp; The immensely high
roof of dried and plaited sugar-cane&mdash;arched over with
slender semi-circular laths of wood, <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>crossed by heavier beams, for all
the world like the inside of an overturned boat&mdash;is upheld
by two upright posts in the oval houses and one in the round; the
whole being fastened together with elaborate plaitings of black
and red-brown and biscuit-colored twine worked into an infinitude
of geometrical patterns.&nbsp; There is not a single nail in the
building.&nbsp; All the wood in these houses is of delicate
shades of biscuit and cinnamon.&nbsp; The sides have open
cinnamon-colored blinds of plaited sugar-cane, ready to let down
if the sun is too hot or the rain beats in too fiercely from one
side or the other.&nbsp; The carpet, raised a couple of feet
above the level of the ground outside, is formed of the finest
transparent black pebbles smoothly raked.</p>

<p>For furniture there are a table, a few cedar-wood boxes, piles
of finely woven and patterned mats, and a number of white-covered
pillows.&nbsp; By the fineness and number of his mats is a
man&rsquo;s wealth known.&nbsp; Some are so rare, so fine, that
you can crunch them up in your hand like a piece of silk.</p>
<p>To-day I have been sitting in the house of a chief,&mdash;or,
rather, lying lazing upon a pile of mats fully four feet by six
in size, fringed round with brilliantly colored
wools,&mdash;looking out upon <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>a pleasant green lawn with other
houses dotted round it, and flower-beds and borders, like silken
patches and gay ribbons, running down to a lake-like inlet from
the sea.&nbsp; I drank fresh cocoanut milk and smoked a cigarette
of pungent home-grown tobacco, like a thin black ribbon, wrapped
in a strip of dried and shredded banana leaf.&nbsp; While I
talked to my host and played with the baby, the little wife, who
had no English, sat by, nodding and smiling; and the retainers,
men and women from the other little houses in the
village,&mdash;who do all the work of the chief&rsquo;s house,
the sweeping and drawing of water,&mdash;gathered upon the outer
fringe of the pebbled floor, smiling too, full of interest and a
fine courtesy.&nbsp; And the air flowed coolly through the open
house and around us.</p>
<p><i>Talofa Ali</i>&mdash;love to you, O Chief!&nbsp; Will you
ever, you people of Samoa, by your dignity and repose, by the
cleanliness and order of your dwellings, shame the strangers in
your land out of that queer apathy which seems to hang around
them, so that it is impossible to walk along the foreshore of
Apia without being reminded of Kipling&rsquo;s lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>All along of dirtiness, all along of mess,<br />
All along of doing things, rather more or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>It is
devastatingly hot, so hot that one cannot move without everything
that one wears being wet through in a moment; while a sort of
misty heat hangs over the whole scene, punctuated by clouds of
mosquitos.&nbsp; I take a motor and drive a couple of miles out
of town and, sending it away, move a few yards into the bush and
sit on a log, to watch the building of a great house which is
being put up for one of the chiefs.&nbsp; A round house with one
immense center pole.</p>
<p>This pole is formed of the trunk of a perfectly straight and
very tall tree, stripped of its bark and quite smooth.&nbsp; Over
seventy men haul at the ropes, which are fastened to the top of
it, as to a May-pole.&nbsp; Logs are pushed in under the lower
part of it to give it a start, and slowly, very slowly it is
raised.&nbsp; The butt of it is fitted into a hole already
prepared, into which more men, running forward, roll
stones.&nbsp; While one swarms to the top and hangs by his knees,
fixing the smaller cross-beams, others mount half-way.&nbsp;
Still others, sticking temporary posts into the ground, mount
them and cling to them with their knees, stretching out their
hands to uphold the smaller cross-beams while these are being
fastened.</p>
<p>The workers wear nothing but their lava-lavas, strips of white
material worn round their waists <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>like petticoats or kilts, shorter
than the Tahitian <i>par&eacute;u</i>, and always, it seems,
perfectly clean.&nbsp; In work like this, when the men pull their
lava-lavas up and fasten them between their legs, one realizes
the perfectly symmetrical patterning of the tattoo spread like
fine black lace over the upper part of their legs and thighs and
enwrapping their bodies, with a curved line below the breast like
a woman&rsquo;s stays.</p>
<p>The old chief for whom the house is being built sits beside
me, upon the trunk of a fallen tree, with other white-haired men,
gentle and courteous, who talk to me of houses they have seen
built, in the past.&nbsp; In a sort of chant they describe
them,&mdash;the length and height of them, the manifold patterns
enwoven around the pillars and beams,&mdash;those wonder-houses
of former days.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We are four days out from Apia, having left in a deluge of
rain which seems to have extinguished the sun completely, for the
sky is a still leaden black, split by incessant lightning.</p>
<p>It is very hot; but at the same time there is a chilly
dampness in the air.&nbsp; All the port-holes have to be closed,
and down below one could cut <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>the air with a knife.&nbsp; The
fumes from the donkey-engine make it almost unendurable.</p>
<p>Up on deck the masts stand bare; the starboard engine is
throbbing very faintly, and we scarcely move.&nbsp; The port
engine is altogether out of gear, as it has been almost every day
since the schooner left San Francisco.&nbsp; The deck is flooded;
every now and then a heavy shoot of water slides off from the one
scrap of awning which we put up with such joy in Apia.&nbsp; As
it is impossible to stay out on the open deck, my only refuge is
in the wheel-house.&nbsp; And here, at night, it is impossible to
have any light apart from that above the binnacle, where the
steersman stands naked to his waist; immovable as a bronze
statue, save for the motion of the hands which grasp the spokes
of the wheel, the sidelong glances of his eyes showing the
whites; so immovable that one jumps when he raises his hand to
strike the bell above his head.</p>
<p>The last meal of the day is at five o&rsquo;clock, and it is
dark by six.&nbsp; After this there is nothing to be done save to
sit on the minute settee, with one&rsquo;s feet on a soap-box to
keep them out of the wet, until one has gathered sufficient
courage or is sufficiently drugged with fatigue to go below and
sleep.&nbsp; For now that the deck is impossible I am <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>using the
captain&rsquo;s cabin, my conscience lulled by the fact that
though he stayed in a hotel at Apia, he was still obliged to sit
up in a chair all night.</p>
<p>It is a nice cabin with a good bunk; but there are a great
many, too many, cockroaches and copra-bugs.&nbsp; Seven
cockroaches and innumerable bugs fell out of my hairbrush only
this morning.&nbsp; They do not bite, but they are disgustingly
soft and squashy, and have a passion for perambulating all over
one&rsquo;s person.&nbsp; With the heat, the prevailing damp, the
smells, and the insect life, it is for the time being anything
but pleasant on board.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The schooner rolled so last night that the heavy electric fan
which the second mate fixed for me in Apia rolled off the table
with a tremendous crash, awakening me to the conviction that we
must at last have struck a rock.&nbsp; Not that I was in a mood
greatly to care, one way or another.&nbsp; Fortunately it stopped
raining between three and four, and&mdash;feeling as though a
thick blanket of fugginess had been laid across my face, my heart
stifled in its beat&mdash;I wrapped myself in a blanket and went
up on deck, where I slept in snatches, curled up in my
deck-chair, with the water rushing to and fro under it at each
roll of the ship.</p>
<p>It is raining again now, and I rather wonder <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>why I ever
came to sea.&nbsp; But I have felt like that before, in short
spasms, and I know the feeling will soon pass.&nbsp; It is not,
and never will be, in the least like the constant nostalgia
induced in me by shores.</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are moving very slowly&mdash;for
the starboard engine is now out of gear and the wind is
light&mdash;among the Vavau group of the Tonga Islands.&nbsp;
These islands are entirely different from anything I have yet
seen in the Pacific, with cliffs from two to four hundred feet in
height, splashed with bright-red soil, and tufted with trees
wherever trees can find a foothold.&nbsp; Many of them are so
straight up and down, so small and symmetrical, that they look
like cakes freshly turned out of a tin.</p>
<p>As we enter the narrows which give to the largest island,
small isles are so thick upon each side of us that it is
difficult to steer our way through the strips of deep-blue water,
with their white-topped waves.&nbsp; Clouded spray and tens of
thousands of sea-birds are about the base of every cliff, around
every peaked rock.</p>
<p>Vavau itself is like an octopus, with chains of lesser islands
running off in every direction for tentacles.&nbsp; Here the
cliffs shelve above dark <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>hollows and deep black caves, while
the vegetation topping the island, patching the cliffs, is so
fresh and light that the whole thing might be torn out of the
side of the Devonshire coast.&nbsp; It is a brilliant day, and we
are facing the sunrise for the first time since I left England,
having taken a complete turn in order to make the port which lies
at the south of the island.</p>
<p>Last night when I went to bed it was Saturday; but now, to the
growling disgust of every man on board, it is already Monday
morning, for we start here upon Australian time and have
completely missed out Sunday.</p>
<p>Neiafu, the one harbor of Vavau, is on the south side of the
principal island, opposite the northeast coast of Pangai
Motu.&nbsp; As we get up to it, the quay is crowded with men,
very clean in white lava-lavas, so long that they reach to their
ankles, exactly like the fold-over skirts of the day.&nbsp;
Miserable things to work in, one would think; but the Tongans do
not work, save a very little upon their own plantations, while
the trading companies have to import labor to load and unload
their ships.&nbsp; Here in front of the harbor there are no
cliffs, but green park-like land dotted with great clumps of
trees running down to the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; At the back
of them the island seems no <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>more than a tight bouquet of trees,
upright upon the cliffs, with the foam of the reef like the frill
of an Early Victorian posy around them.</p>
<p>The Burn Philip Company, to whom we are here consigned, have
lent me a launch, and run me out, now while the dawn is still
fresh, away among the islands to a cave in which the water is the
most astounding blue I have ever seen, shot through and through
with hundreds of thousands of minute blue and black fish, so
thick that they jostle one another.&nbsp; The base of the inner
wall of the cave is a madder pink, the arching roof ochre and
blue.&nbsp; As we came along the coast we passed reach after
reach of deep-golden sand, where people were bathing or fishing,
and deep hollows beneath the higher cliffs, of the clearest blue
I have ever seen.&nbsp; But returning we break away from the
shore altogether, dodge along among innumerable little
islands.</p>
<p>Back on shore, I walk about the tiny township.&nbsp; The boys
and girls from a missionary school&mdash;what I suppose might be
called a finishing school, for many of the pupils are as much as
eighteen or nineteen years old and very mature for their
age&mdash;are gathered in a ring round a half-witted man who is
sitting on the ground under a banyan tree.&nbsp; The young people
are singing at the tops of their <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>voices, a sort of loud chant that
might be a marching song, breaking into sudden discordant,
startling shouts, which they assure me make the poor creature
&ldquo;feel good,&rdquo; though I should doubt it.&nbsp; When I
give the fool a shilling one of the boys ties it up in the corner
of his lava-lava for him, upon which the man sings a song of
thanks to me&mdash;the same swinging sort of marching chant that
I heard from the boys and girls.&nbsp; He breaks into the same
shouts, and massages both ears so hard with both hands all the
while that I am afraid he will rub them off.</p>
<p>Going over to the school-house, I see one little imp of a girl
with tight, coal-black curls,&mdash;many of the Tongans have hair
that is more red than black,&mdash;dancing, wriggling her hips,
and posturing, making strangely Eastern gestures with her
hands.&nbsp; A native schoolmaster is standing near, making a
great pretense of reading out of a very large book, to impress
me.&nbsp; When I ask him to tell more of the girls to dance, he
shouts to them; but only one, a fattish girl of about seventeen,
steps forward.</p>
<p>After a few minutes some of the elder boys come and stand
near, laughing and staring.&nbsp; The dancing girl catches hold
of first one and then another, to try to persuade them to dance
with <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>her, but they cuff her aside.&nbsp; At last one, who is
in reality a man, steps into the little ring and begins to dance;
standing sideways to the girl, with his knees bent out sideways,
and his arms and hands held upright from the elbow, palms
outward.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>At
first the two of them merely posture; then the dance becomes
faster and faster, though they scarcely move their feet, and
frankly sensual in every gesture.&nbsp; They roll their eyes at
each other, pouting their lips, and every now and then the man
breaks into loud shouts, showing all his teeth in a mirthless and
horrible grin.&nbsp; The teacher&mdash;Wesleyan
trained&mdash;stands by, smiling smugly, though he must know what
it all means.</p>
<p>The missionaries here are as thick upon the ground as they
were in Samoa, and I wonder that the country can support
them.&nbsp; The competition for pupils is great, and the boys and
girls are kept at school so long that they are never much use for
anything else afterward.&nbsp; Here are men from the London
Mission, Seventh-day Adventists, Methodists, Wesleyans, Mormons,
Roman Catholics, and almost everything else you can think of,
though the natives have and try to hold to a Free Tongan
Church.&nbsp; All the finest houses and plantations belong to
missionaries.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the afternoon I hire a sulky and take the captain for a
drive.&nbsp; It is a great cavalcade.&nbsp; The mare I drive is
almost incredibly thin; the reins are too short to be managed in
any other way than separately, at the extreme length of my arms;
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>while a
four-months-old colt follows behind, and a man in a purple
lava-lava rides on in front to show us the way to where an
underground river comes out into a deep lake in a cave, half-way
down a steep cliff some three miles from the port.</p>
<p>As we pass through the villages, cutting across wide green
lawns, girls and children come running out, juggling with
oranges, keeping five or six in the air at once.&nbsp; Then,
throwing wreaths over our heads they run away, laughing.</p>
<p>We pass through deep bush in which every tree is hung with
parasites and lichen, broken by open patches of cocoanuts far
more healthy-looking than the ones I saw in Samoa.&nbsp; There is
no sign of vanilla or cocoa, and the greater part of the land is
waste.&nbsp; The pool of the underground river is an uncanny
place; the air above it dank and chilly.&nbsp; It is reached by a
small opening in the face of the cliff, through which men and
women slip and swim about like fish in the ice-cold water beneath
an absolutely black arched roof.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The mosquitos are almost unbearable upon the schooner, lying
up close against the shore as it does, and after dinner to-night
I walked away from the little town, up a steep slope, and among
the trees, through a series of native villages.&nbsp; <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Dipping
again, I came at last to a cemetery on the edge of a wide lagoon,
where the graves were covered with very finely powdered white
coral and decorated, here and there, with glass bottles intended
for ornaments.&nbsp; Here I sat down to watch the moon rise over
the water.&nbsp; Two natives came up in their canoes and, getting
out, waded toward me, pulling it after them.&nbsp; Squatting on
their hunkers, quite close to me, they regarded me
without&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;so much as a wink, for the
best part of half an hour.&nbsp; My flesh literally crept, for I
have no great belief in cannibalism being altogether obsolete,
but at last they got into their canoes and paddled away, and I
returned to the ship, where the mosquitos were still making night
horrible.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The captain is the most untidy man I have ever seen.&nbsp; I
ironed his one shore-going suit before we reached Vavau.&nbsp;
When we left he changed into his usual kit, shirt and trousers,
flinging his suit over the edge of the bath (which has to be used
for storing fresh water, so that one washes in a tin pail,
usually with a scrubbing brush), where I found it this morning,
sopping wet.&nbsp; His watch and all his money, fallen from his
pocket, lay at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Now
he has been using my typewriter and left it balanced on the very
edge of the chart-table.&nbsp; When I take it up, very sweetly,
with a Fairchild-Family smile, and, putting it in its case,
remark, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it lives,&rdquo; his only reply
is that he reckons it&rsquo;s like the rest of us, and must
&ldquo;get used to locations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is virtually no wind, and we are rolling horribly, with
a heavy swell, among deep-troughed waves.</p>

157</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scattered isles of the Haapai
group of the Tonga Islands stretch for fifty miles in a
north-easterly direction, and Haapai is the heart of it; the warm
beating heart of all the Tongans, or so it seems to me, though
Nukualofa, in the Tongatabu group, is the head which wears the
crown.</p>
<p>From here in Lifuka, the principal island of the Haapai, came
the greater part of the old brave warrior blood which pulsed out
through the Pacific; of those Argonauts of the Pacific who
penetrated so far afield that even in Santa Cruz, or La Perouse,
the natives built their huts under the cocoanuts, daring the fall
of nuts and boughs so that they might be able to run like monkeys
up into the trees at the approach of their enemy.&nbsp; To this
very day they frighten their children with the cry: &ldquo;The
Tongans are coming!&nbsp; The Tongans are coming!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And to this day the Samoans are known as &ldquo;the fowls that
roost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifuka is a garden of glades, three quarters of a mile to a
mile in width and less than ten miles <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in length, facing west and east, so
that it is steeped in sunrise and sunset, perfectly flat, hemmed
round with white sands.</p>
<p>I do not know why it thrilled me so, but it did, and of all
places I have visited it is that in which I long most to
stay.&nbsp; For there is a heart and soul in Lifuka: it is old,
old, and yet forever panting with youth, filled with warm pulsing
blood, all the aspirations and inspirations of youth.</p>
<p>The people in Lifuka are tall and finely made, and beautifully
courteous; their complaint against the stranger is that he comes
to the island and passes them without salute, with no appeal to
the God who means so much to them, with whom they are in daily
communion, to bless them.&nbsp; For the religion of the Tongans
of Haapai, who own their own church and belong to no other
denomination, is the most vital that I have ever come across.</p>
<p>There is one tiny town,&mdash;or, rather, one little
street,&mdash;called Pangai, with a handful of brightly painted
stores and shops.&nbsp; Through this and running the length of
the island is one wide road, from which, fifty yards or so apart,
wide, brilliantly green, smooth grass avenues lead back into the
island.&nbsp; These avenues are bordered with breadfruit and
mangoes and cocoanut palms, and <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>the feathery growth of ironbark;
while every little group of native huts stands upon its own
sward.</p>
<p>Every man or woman or child you meet in Lifuka greets you with
the words: &ldquo;<i>Ma lo laa</i>,&rdquo; (&ldquo;It is good to
be alive&rdquo;).&nbsp; If it is a chief, he raises his right
hand in returning your salute.&nbsp; Many of the people, half
past you, will turn, smiling, to add to their greeting the words:
&ldquo;<i>Afa atu</i>,&rdquo; (&ldquo;Love to
you&mdash;health&rdquo;).</p>
<p>It is at Lifuka, in an open glade close against the sea, where
the great wooden drums&mdash;hollowed trunks of trees beaten once
to summon the people to battle, beaten now to summon them to
prayer,&mdash;stand upon the very spot where the Great Ones, the
Heroes, landed.</p>
<p>Before ever the Fijians were known in Fiji they came here; and
the place where they knelt, thanking the God of the Jews for
their safety and prosperity&mdash;men with hooked noses and
full-lipped mouths and curling hair, more red than black&mdash;is
still shown beneath the spreading roots of the banyan tree which
forms the roof of the meeting-place of the city fathers of
Haapai.&nbsp; The meetings are presided over by a descendant of
the same chief who bade Cook welcome, a proud and stubborn man
who refused to come out of his hut upon the occasion of the last
visit of the queen&mdash;<a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>for no other reason than that the
train of tapa worn by the aide-de-camp whom she sent to summon
him, was not in his eyes sufficiently long, flowing, and
ceremonious.</p>
<p>The Taufaa Hau&mdash;the Great Ones&mdash;brought with them
the high priests and the priestesses, all the rituals of the
ancient Jewish religion.&nbsp; Though no one up to this time
knows rightly who they were, or whence they came, or how they
came.&nbsp; One thing is sure: that in bringing their religion,
they brought the sword with them.&nbsp; Whatever one may say in
praise of the Tongans, up to this very day, no one could so
dispraise them as to call them meek.</p>
<p>When the great George Tubou, the great-grandfather of the
present queen, embraced Christianity and imposed it upon his
people, he went to them with a club in one hand and a Bible in
the other, giving them their choice between the two.&nbsp; He
spoke of it afterward with a splendid audacity as &ldquo;the time
when I Christianized Tonga with a club.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a very
little later, when he began to grow old and the people set
themselves against him, pretending that he was mad, he swept
through the island again, like a hurricane; destroyed the sacred
groves, burned the idols, to which they had returned, and slew
the priestesses.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>To
the last and greatest of all the priestesses he went, demanding
the greatest of the gods, Haehaetahi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone for a journey,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we wait for him, you and I,&rdquo; replied the
king, sitting down at her side.&nbsp; The two waited, drank kava
together&mdash;the priestess with Heaven only know what of fear,
or maybe real hope, in her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a long time coming, this god of yours,&rdquo;
said the king; and then again, and yet again: &ldquo;He is a long
time coming&rdquo;; laughing, staring into her face; terrorizing
her so that she fell at his feet, told him where she had hidden
the image of the god.&nbsp; Upon which he hanged the two of them
together, up among the rafters of the temple, as a symbol of
things to be despised, as a sign of the end of all
foolishness.</p>
<p>In the old days, the days before the greatest and the
best-abused of all missionaries brought Christianity to George
Tubou and the Tongans, all the people in the islands were
serfs.&nbsp; They could own nothing: if they gathered cocoanuts
or caught fish, they must bring them to the king, lay them at his
feet, so that he could take what he wanted of them.&nbsp; One of
the tyrant kings of Haapai, indeed, a man named Tugahau, cut off
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the
right hands of all the young men; the left arms of all the old
women; three fingers of the left hand of all the old men; put a
taboo on all the cocoanut trees, so that the people
starved.&nbsp; He himself was, in the end, murdered by one of the
heroes,&mdash;if one can use such a word as murder for so
righteous an act,&mdash;who was, in turn, assassinated by the
stepson of the king; who was in his turn slain by his own son,
King George&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; And this was how things were in
Haapai before the days of Christianity.</p>
<p>There are still high priests and priestesses in the island,
ranking with those of royal blood.&nbsp; The son of a high priest
can marry no one of lesser rank than the daughter of a
king.&nbsp; It is, however, possible for both priests and
priestesses to adopt others into their families; one of the three
daughters of that first missionary,&mdash;who are still living in
the island,&mdash;is a high priestess, adopted daughter of the
last high priest.&nbsp; She is the only one allowed to enter the
sacred inclosure of his grave, the only person permitted to
attend to the tomb, save on special occasions when she needs help
in the garden, and then she must prepare a ceremonial feast, with
roast pig, for her helpers.</p>
<p>With this adopted priestess, followed by an <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>illegitimate son of the high priest to keep off devils
from the back of me, I myself was permitted to enter the
inclosure, to see the tomb.&nbsp; It is six feet long, formed out
of solid rock cut by the slaves from the coral reef, overhung
with pink hibiscus and spraying asparagus fern.</p>
<p>The arms of Tonga show three swords, signifying the three main
groups of islands, and three stars, with a cross and a dove of
peace.&nbsp; The name of Haapai, with its three islands of
Lifuka, Foa, Haano, means, &ldquo;Hands uplifted in
supplication.&rdquo;&nbsp; The flag of Tonga is white with a red
cross; the red signifying a people who have never known a master;
the white, peace; the cross being the Cross of Christ.&nbsp; And
the lovely name that the Tongans have given to heaven is Lagi,
&ldquo;The place where the shadow of the Almighty&rsquo;s image
lives forever.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I walked under the shade of the trees, along the flesh-white
sands, to the house where the three remaining daughters of the
missionary live.&nbsp; The sun was blazing hot; the glare and
glitter on the shining, metal-like leaves of the palms blinding;
the shade beneath the more thickly growing trees grateful beyond
words.&nbsp; Looking across the road to the wide open glades,
with their narrowing <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>perspective, I saw boys and men with
their lava-lavas flowing, galloping on horseback without bridle
or saddle, guiding their horses with their feet, sitting as
though one with the animals&mdash;an enchanting sight.&nbsp; And
enchanting, indeed, was all this day in Haapai: the cool stir of
wind in the shadows; the pleasant people who greeted
me,&mdash;the men all in white, the women in those thin black
muslin gowns over white slips which all the women in all the
islands, even the queen, wear; girded now with fine mats fringed
and torn, pulled and twisted out of shape as a symbol of mourning
for the loss of a still-born prince.</p>
<p>I sat on the veranda and talked to the three soft-voiced and
gentle daughters of the friend of George Tubou.&nbsp; One of
these is a hopeless cripple, sitting all day in a wheel-chair;
for several years ago she was thrown out of a cart and had both
her legs broken; and, as there was no boat at that time running
to Fiji, on account of the war, it was impossible to set
them.&nbsp; Another of the sisters, badly gored by a cow which
she was milking, is almost altogether an invalid.&nbsp; So that
upon the slender and fragile shoulders of the third&mdash;the
high priestess by adoption&mdash;all the care of this little
family rests.&nbsp; And not that alone, either, for every living
man, woman, and child <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>in Haapai looks to her for help in
time of trouble.</p>
<p>Up to quite lately there was another sister, a helpless
invalid ever since the time when, close upon forty years ago, she
threw her own body&mdash;the body of a young girl of eighteen and
rarely beautiful, to judge from the photograph which I was shown,
with large startled eyes which held in their depths, even then,
or so it seemed to me, a premonition of suffering&mdash;between
the gun of an assassin and her father.</p>
<p>Very, very early in the morning of the day she died, all the
people of Haapai who could come so far gathered upon the strip of
sand in front of the house and sat there, perfectly silent,
waiting for the end.&nbsp; They had seen&mdash;or so they
swore&mdash;seen the Spirit Canoe with its Spirit Paddler top the
horizon, just before the moon set.&nbsp; Some declared that even
then, in the pinky-gray mists of dawn, they could see it
hovering, waiting, ready to bear away the woman they loved.&nbsp;
She died but very shortly after sunrise, sitting up in bed and
holding out her arms toward the lagoon.</p>
<p>The surviving three sisters live alone in Haapai, and must, so
it seems, live thus till they die.&nbsp; With few books and still
fewer papers, they seem to be able to discuss every topic of the
day, are as charmingly courteous and at ease as though <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>constantly
moving in society.&mdash;But, then, who could be anything but
courteous, living among the Tongans?&mdash;Never in my life have
I met three people whom I more wish to meet again.&nbsp; For
never have I been greeted with a simpler and more whole-hearted
hospitality: an easy-chair; a palm-leaf fan; a glass of lemonade
made from lemons freshly gathered in the garden which reaches to
the sea; home-made cakes and halved paw-paw fruit with the seeds
scooped out of it, the hollows filled with chopped banana, the
juice of passion-fruit, lemon, and sugar.&nbsp; Of one thing I am
certain: that back in the world again, amid the stress and
bustle, the noise and infinite fatigue of London life, there is
no place on earth that I shall more long to visit than
this&mdash;a <i>lagi</i>, indeed, upon earth.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> hated leaving Lifuka, for I
don&rsquo;t know when any place has appealed to me like this tiny
island, so full of enchantment and romance&mdash;that
<i>something</i> which winds itself about our heartstrings; a
mysterious something having, indeed, nothing to do with its white
sands, its glades and avenues, its kind and courteous people, but
altogether of the spirit, appealing to the spirit, and never to
be forgotten.</p>
<p>It is only about an hour&rsquo;s run to Tongatabu, past the
volcanic islands of Kao and Tofua, sending out great gusts and
pillars of smoke which rose high in the still air as we passed
them.&nbsp; In every direction were islands and a network of
shoals.&nbsp; We saw the wreck of a schooner which had been
broken in half, its bow and stern sticking up so like two
sharp-pointed rocks that the captain, not finding it upon his
chart, had me make a sketch of it before we realized what it
was.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To reach Nukualofa from the east one has to go almost entirely
round the island and in through <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>a series of narrows where we are
supposed to wait at least five miles out from the port for the
pilot.</p>
<p>We reached this spot at seven this morning and waited until
eleven.&nbsp; But there was no sign of any pilot, and by this
time the wind had risen; the shallow water was swept with
ripples, opal and pale gold above the sands; the air fresh with a
wonderful cleanliness in it; the scene unrivaled in its variety
and beauty, coral reefs and green islands.</p>
<p>The captain walked to and fro continually, through the
wheel-house to the port rail, and back to the starboard; firm and
square, and quiet, with a look as though he were tightly buttoned
up inside him.&nbsp; And this is, I think, one of the most
remarkable things about him: he is so full of life and fire and
yet so altogether able to control himself.&nbsp; Never once have
I seen him go off the deep end, though when he is annoyed, his
mouth shuts like a rat-trap over those white teeth of his, his
bright eyes grow brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>Every moment I expected him to break out into curses, abuses,
at the very least growlings; for time is money to the
<i>Monterey</i>, already three months late, and this delay means
an end to all chance of getting any work done before
Sunday.&nbsp; But he made no sort of fuss; there was not a <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>word such
as, &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t come soon I will&rdquo; do this or
that, or &ldquo;I have a good mind to&rdquo; do this or that,
such as a weaker man might have braced himself up with.&nbsp; So
I was startled and thrilled when, quite suddenly, the starboard
engine&mdash;which is still the only one of any use to
us&mdash;got up full steam, a sort of hum ran through the
schooner from end to end, as though everything in it were being
tightened up, and I realized that the Old Man was actually going
to run us into port on his own.</p>
<p>And nothing I can ever say can give any real idea of our
route.</p>
<p>Our passage was, indeed, more like a bending race with polo
ponies than a ship&rsquo;s course.&nbsp; A swift and madly
swerving passage among a tangle of islands and sand-banks and
coral shoals; through channels in many places no more than three
times the breadth of the schooner; all completely strange to the
captain, who has never been over this side of the world
before.</p>
<p>He took it gallantly, however, at a hand gallop, as it were; a
gallop so altogether exhilarating that it seemed as though my
blood had never before run so quickly through my veins; that I
was in the midst of a life so altogether vital that it
revitalized me; that, if a thing like this could go on <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and on
throughout the years, it would be impossible for any one ever to
grow old, tired, or disillusioned.</p>
<p>There is no bridge to the schooner, and ordinarily the pilot
stands upon the unrailed top of the wheel-house; passing his
instructions down to the captain, who, in his turn, passes them
on to the man at the wheel.&nbsp; To-day, however, the captain
himself went up there with his megaphone, glasses, and chart,
weighted down upon the deck with anything he put his hand
upon.&nbsp; For the day, which began in pale pastel tints, was by
then a clear blue and white, with that tearing wind which upon
the Pacific seems always to go with such colors.</p>
<p>A Loyalty Island boy&mdash;who could not understand a word of
English, though he knew enough French to steer by&mdash;was at
the wheel; while the first mate was stationed at the break of the
poop, the second at the foc&rsquo;s&rsquo;le head,&mdash;these
two understanding no single word of French, so that the procedure
was thus&mdash;and thus.&nbsp; I, myself, standing at the door of
the wheel-house, translated the captain&rsquo;s orders to the
steersman.&nbsp; It was by no means so simple a task as it
sounds, for the order to &ldquo;port&rdquo; or
&ldquo;starboard&rdquo; in French means exactly the opposite to
what it does in English.&nbsp; <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>In the one language if you say
&ldquo;port&rdquo; you mean that the wheel has to be moved so
that the nose of the ship goes to port; in the other it is the
wheel which has to be turned to port, while the nose of the ship
goes to starboard.&nbsp; In addition to this, it was perfectly
impossible to steer altogether by the chart, for in these seas
the sand-banks are always shifting.&nbsp; And the man conning on
the foremast was the only one who could catch the glint of coral
beneath the clear water.</p>
<p>Our ramshackle little old engine poured out clouds of black
smoke; while the water roared round us, cutting up into ridges of
white foam as we turned; and every moment it seemed as though the
sharp ridges of coral, spits of sand, so clearly seen below the
shallow water, were actually darting forward to meet us.</p>
<p>The ship was alive with shoutings&mdash;French, English, and a
medley of native lingoes.&nbsp; I could even hear the Russian
bellowing in his own language, out of sheer excitement, without
the slightest expectation of being understood.&nbsp; The only
person on board who took no interest in anything, did nothing,
was the Englishman, whom we had tried to get rid of in Samoa, but
to whom the authorities refused permission to remain in the
islands.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>As
the household cat, at times, gets under one&rsquo;s feet, driving
one mad at every step, this man loitering about the deck, and,
for goodness knows what purpose, in and out of the wheel-house,
exasperated me until I was able to bear it no longer.&nbsp;
During one sudden rush from the wheel&mdash;where I had been
repeating something the steersman had failed to hear&mdash;out of
the narrow door, to scream a question up at the captain, I ran up
against the man, loitering before me, and I did, before I well
realized it&mdash;or almost did&mdash;an unforgivable thing:
well, precisely the thing that one does do to the cat.&nbsp; I
saw my own foot raised in the air, realized his amazed face as he
turned and saw what was upon him.</p>
<p>But this is what comes of living altogether among men for so
long.&nbsp; The only chance for me when I do get back to England
will be to immure myself in a women&rsquo;s club, as I did
several years ago after a visit to Albania, where I never saw a
woman unless she were veiled from head to foot; had my meals at
the one European hotel in Durazzo, crowded&mdash;so crowded that
one had to scramble one&rsquo;s way over the beds in the hall to
get to the dining-room&mdash;with between sixty and seventy men
of every nationality, speaking every known language.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>I am
supposed to have left the schooner with all my bag and baggage
and to be waiting in Nukualofa for the next steamer to take me on
to Fiji.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that a ferment of
discontent and insubordination has been seething through the
boat, the engineer having put the lid on it all by being missing
at Vavau, keeping us all waiting, and being brought back in the
end very drunk and loudly abusive.&nbsp; The Old Man is spoiling
for a row, which he feels it impossible to get himself well into,
heart and soul as he would like, so long as I am aboard.&nbsp; My
one prayer now is that the storm may burst with a vengeance
within the next few days, clearing the air so that I may go on
with them again.&nbsp; For, though I have only been twelve hours
away, I am already sick for the ship; thankful to remember how
altogether taken aback the men were when they heard that I was
leaving it.&nbsp; I cherish the second mate&rsquo;s assertion
that he would keep my chair aboard, &ldquo;so that it will kind
of seem as though you were coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here in Nukualofa there is no hotel, but a boarding-house
colloquially known, throughout the whole of the Pacific, as
Smith&rsquo;s; the oddest place I have ever seen, with sixteen or
seventeen rooms all opening out of each other.&nbsp; The greater
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>number
of these rooms have no outside windows whatever, while I myself
have been given an angle cut off from the front veranda which
serves the other boarders as sitting- and smoking-room, where the
belle of the boarding-house&mdash;a typist with one of the
business firms&mdash;spends her entire spare time manicuring her
nails and flirting with the young men: clerks and cable men and
salesmen from the stores.&nbsp; The room is so lightly screened
from the rest of the world by a muslin curtain that I did not
dare to burn a light when I was undressing last night, lest I
provide a perfect silhouette show for the company already very
freely discussing me.&nbsp; The doors to the two rooms,
men&rsquo;s rooms, opening into mine, not only do not lock, but
will not even keep shut; they fly open at any sudden gust of wind
or if any one shakes the rickety wooden building by walking too
heavily across the floor or sitting down too suddenly.&nbsp; Both
of them were wide open this morning, so that when I sat up to
drink the cup of tea the native girl had put down at my side, two
tousled heads were raised, two men sat up to drink their tea, and
a friendly conversation followed.&nbsp; Thus I now know exactly
which is the one who snores, and which is the one who mutters in
his sleep; who it was who lost a collar stud this <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>morning,&mdash;finding a very great deal to say about
it too,&mdash;and who cut himself shaving.&nbsp; Not that it
matters, for the Pacific is, indeed, a world of nothing-matters,
almost as much as it is a world of to-morrow.&nbsp; And the
kindness of the people who run the boarding-house, the real
authentic Smiths with their two delightful boys, the beauty and
courtesy of the native serving-girls, overbalance the ingenious
inconvenience of the building.&nbsp; There is compensation for
everything, indeed, save the frightful and unparalleled voracity
of the mosquitos; the tumult of the native village just outside
my window; the multitude of pigs and dogs, ever at odds; the
night made hideous by squealings and yappings, the wild rush of
pursued and pursuer.</p>
<p>In Nukualofa is the seat of monarchy.&nbsp; All along the
sea-front is a wide double avenue of ironbark trees, with that
delicate and feathery growth which is such a relief after the
heavy opaque foliage of eternal palms.&nbsp; To one side of it,
the royal palace and chapel of white-painted wood, with as many
frettings and scrollings and pinnacles as though it were playing
at being Milan Cathedral in a German toy sort of a way.</p>
<p>At first sight the island strikes one as disappointing, for it
is so altogether flat that there <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>is very little to be seen.&nbsp; But
once get away from the town, back a little into the country, and
the enchantment of it all catches you: the wonderful variety of
foliage, the inland salt lake, the villages, the people.&nbsp;
From every curve of the shore one sees a fresh panorama of
islands&mdash;island upon island upon island, with sailing-boats,
of every sort of rig, skimming the glassy surface of the sea like
butterflies.</p>
<p>I am sitting now on the sands, scribbling.&nbsp; A little
light ketch has just come in from one of the islands, laden with
people in holiday dress and wreathed with flowers.&nbsp; They
bring with them nine great turtles, and half a dozen pigs, which
they unlade in the most callous way possible, dragging the
turtles up the steep slope of sand&mdash;on their backs, with
wildly waving flappers and altogether insulted air, terribly
reminiscent of stout old ladies being carried out of church in a
fit.&nbsp; These turtles are eaten by the people and the shells,
regarded as nothing more than mere useless lumber, are thrown
away; and a wild scheme for at last making a fortune by
collecting turtle-shells in Tongatabu simmers gently through my
mind: a scheme which I know perfectly well will never be carried
out, will be put off till <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>to-morrow, and to-morrow.&nbsp; For
there is no doubt whatever that the Pacific has got me, once and
for all, with what seems like the constant repetition of the same
dream&mdash;which is yet never altogether the same, for the
spirit of every place we touch at is delicately yet altogether
different.</p>

<p>On Tongatabu, which a casual tourist might pass by as yet
another island with the eternal sameness of all tropical islands,
the whole spirit, light and joyous and forever youthful, is the
spirit of play.&nbsp; So that in talking over my wanderings, as I
shall do, as we all do,&mdash;though no one really cares to
listen and we know it, fully realizing that there is nothing more
than a personal stimulus and delight in saying, In this place it
was like this or that, the people so-and-so or
so-and-so,&mdash;Tongatabu will remain forever the playground,
the people of Tongatabu the playboys, of the Pacific isles.</p>
<p>For here there is no need for any one to work.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, an earthly paradise, where all alike have a few cocoanut
trees and a few fowls and many pigs; where each boy upon reaching
the age of eighteen is given half an acre of land in his own
village and three acres of bush land; where if any one needs
kerosene or a new lava-lava or a <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>little money to pay the
infinitesimal taxes, no more exertion is required than that
necessary to gather a few nuts, dry and sell a little copra.</p>
<p>For the rest, the people dance and sing, strumming softly upon
their guitars, feast, and play at football, tennis, and cricket
upon the smooth green and park-like glade in the center of every
little hamlet, for, however small the gathering of huts, there is
a cricket-pitch of concrete where the people play with English
cricket bats and balls, and a roughly marked-out tennis-court
with a fishing-net hung across it.&nbsp; If in the evening you
drive through a village where the people are laughing and singing
and calling to one another in soft-syllabled words, it is as
though a garden f&ecirc;te were in progress.&nbsp; As for
feasting . . . !&nbsp; The queen, who has been away in the
country, only nine miles distant, for two or three weeks, came
back to her capital yesterday, for no more than a couple of days,
and there was feasting throughout the length and breadth of it,
with ceremonial lengths of tapa and festive mats laid out under
the trees and a tremendous cooking of pigs and yam and
breadfruit.</p>
<p>I myself&mdash;the <i>papalagi</i>, or stranger of the
hour&mdash;am to-day being f&ecirc;ted.&nbsp; The occasion will
forever live in my memory, like a clear picture painted <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>upon
metal&mdash;or, rather, an enamel run out upon metal in brilliant
greens and purples and blues with gold and silver dust&mdash;a
picture which nothing can destroy.&nbsp; In looking back upon my
life I shall be able to say, whatever happened before this,
whatever happens after, I shall have had at least this one
brilliant and unspoiled day.</p>
<p>A planter, half Swiss and half Tongan, arranged the feast, at
which the captain of the <i>Monterey</i> was the only other
European guest, and to which we drove some twelve miles in a
motor; going past the Queen&rsquo;s Garden and the Resting Place
of Kings, a raised platform of stone beneath a vast banyan
tree.</p>
<p>Passing Mua, the queen&rsquo;s country retreat, I saw that she
was there again, sitting on the ground in front of the house,
which is altogether a native one, among her women.&nbsp; Begging
the others to wait for me, I got out of the motor and crossed the
glade to speak to her.</p>
<p>She signed for me to sit down by her, and we talked together,
for she has been at school in New Zealand and speaks perfectly
good English.&nbsp; She and all the other women, who sat in a
semicircle at a little distance from her, were dressed in the
same way, in a thin black muslin dress over white chemise and
petticoat, while none of them wore <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>shoes or stockings.&nbsp; But for
all that she stood out above all of them in her dignity and
serenity; an immense young woman, no more than twenty-four years
of age, six foot four in height and already too fat, though
magnificently made.</p>
<p>There has of late been trouble among the Tongan Islanders in
regard to their own Free Church.&nbsp; The prince consort, who is
a good many years older than the queen, has great power over her,
or so it is said.&nbsp; He holds as strong a hand as any man can
well do, being not only prince consort, but Minister of Education
and Minister of Customs, and he dominates the young queen, Salote
Tubou, to such an extent that she is becoming very
unpopular.&nbsp; The last straw is that he has persuaded or is
persuading her to force the people to give back their church to
the Wesleyans, to whom he belongs.&nbsp; I saw him yesterday and
he promised me that nothing would be done without the full
consent of all the people; and yet, immediately afterward, that
very afternoon, there was an unexpected and unannounced meeting
of the council, with scarcely any one there, and the measure for
the transference passed.</p>
<p>To-day the queen&rsquo;s women, a vast kava bowl in front of
them, were making kava, wringing out the roots in their
hands.&nbsp; They brought the queen <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>the polished half of a cocoanut
shell from which she drank, afterward throwing the shell far away
from her, as is the custom.&nbsp; They then brought me a shell of
kava, but I was out of temper and would not drink, telling the
queen very plainly what I thought of her; expressing it as my
opinion that if she persisted in her course in regard to the
people&rsquo;s religion she would end by losing her
kingdom.&nbsp; With the placidity of all very fat <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>people,
however, she kept perfectly calm under my onslaught, reiterating
the words, &ldquo;You must ask my husband about that . . .&nbsp;
You must tell my husband about that . . .&nbsp; I leave all that
to my husband,&rdquo; until, out of all patience with her, I got
up and flung back to the motor, without so much as the semblance
of an obeisance or good-by.</p>

<p>The f&ecirc;te to-day, which takes the form of a picnic, is
held at the base of a steep cliff toward which, some twelve miles
out from Nukualofa, we turn, through by-roads so thick with
greasy mud that again and again we stick and, rounding our hands
to our mouths, shout for natives to come and haul us out with the
ropes which we carry.&nbsp; At the end of the motor drive there
is a walk through grass of a height above my shoulders for close
upon half a mile, a scramble down the steep sides of a cliff,
thick with undergrowth, and we come upon the scene set for our
little play: a curve of cream-tinted sand round a small bay; a
strip of purple-blue lagoon, and pale-jade and lapis-lazuli
breakers with white crests upon the reef.</p>
<p>I have wandered along the shore and paddled through the water
into another bay, silent and <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>fresh and clean as at
creation.&nbsp; I bathed in a deep pool in the coral under the
hanging cliffs, then, getting back into my clothes, with my skirt
pulled up to my knees, my shoes and stockings hung over my arm,
waded out to the reef, where I am sitting.&nbsp; I came past
brilliant pools of madder and purple and vivid-green rocks; pools
as clear as jewels, with pink branching corals and feathery
brilliant green seaweeds, and jeweled fish and sea-anemones, and
jellyfish, like delicate lengths of silk puffed out with water,
thick within them.</p>
<p>Now, upon the reef, the roar of the waves is tremendous as
they raise their green throats high as temple arches above me,
threaten terribly, then drop in a smother of white foam, with a
sound like laughter.&nbsp; The people on the shore call and
beckon to me.&nbsp; The table-cloths of palm-leaves&mdash;woven
with fingers which move as swiftly as small dark fish sporting in
a pool&mdash;are already laid.&nbsp; Some of the guests are
seated about this cloth, others are bent over holes in the ground
filled with hot stones, taking out of them the cooked food.&nbsp;
The hair of some of the men measures two feet across the top, is
smooth and massive as a clipped yew hedge, and singed into shape,
so that no single hair stands a fraction higher than <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>another, by
women with red-hot stones.&nbsp; The girls&rsquo; hair falls
loosely and is decked with flowers and maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>For the feast there are two almost full-grown pigs and four
fowls, with a pile of breadfruit as big as a road-mender&rsquo;s
heap of stones by the roadside: all of which we finish
completely, washing it down with kava drunk from halved and
polished cocoanut shells.&nbsp; The pigs and fowls are all
deliciously stuffed with herbs and lemon and mashed sweet
potatoes.&nbsp; The leader of the feast has a large knife with
which he cuts the thick skin about the throat of each pig, then
tears it, and we eat it with our teeth and fingers&mdash;for
there are no other knives and no forks&mdash;holding our salt in
the hollow of our hands.</p>
<p>After the feast is over we lie in the shade and rest a
little.&nbsp; Then, though the sun is still high in the heavens,
two girls and two men draw apart in opposite directions to make
themselves ready for the dance.&nbsp; An older woman attends upon
the girls, oiling them all over, dressing them in grass mats as
fine and soft as silk, appliqu&eacute;d with patterns of black
velvet, and hanging them with ferns and green creepers.&nbsp; The
men, taking off their lava-lavas, oil themselves, don a very
short pair of cotton shorts, and wreathe themselves with <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>garlands of
brilliant green weed from off the rocks.</p>
<p>The sun is still high in the heavens, but now the two couples,
coming forward and meeting each other, begin to dance upon the
hard white sand at the edge of the water, with the opal of the
lagoon, the wall of foam upon the reef, the solid blue of the
afternoon sky, as a drop sheet behind them, and to the right a
dark arched cave of every shade of purple and deep madder.&nbsp;
Every movement of these dancers&mdash;their advancing,
retreating, beckoning&mdash;is infinitely luring, full of the
suggestions of passion and love.&nbsp; They are so altogether
Egyptian that they seem to have stepped out of an Egyptian
frieze.</p>
<p>There are two guitars to which the players sing in deep,
monotonous tones; while we others, sitting along the sand upon
our heels, swing our bodies to and fro, at first slowly then more
and more quickly, clapping our hollowed palms, following the
quickened movement of the dancers; breaking off a little as they
pause, posing, as motionless as statues, then beginning again;
faster and still faster, swung not so much by our volition as by
the allurement, the excitement of their movements.</p>
<p>As I squat here upon the sand, clapping my <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>hollowed
palms together, swinging my body to and fro, quite
suddenly&mdash;as though the slides were unexpectedly changed in
a magic-lantern&mdash;my mind goes back to the last dinner I was
at in London: a large literary dinner overborne by the eternal
complacent sameness which overwhelms all people of one craft
gathered together in a mass.&nbsp; I wonder what on earth the
other guests would think of me if they could see me now, without
shoes or stockings, my wet hair dripping down my back.&nbsp; Or
if they could have seen me eating pork and <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>chicken
with my fingers.&nbsp; But it only shows how quickly one can drop
into anything on earth, may ultimately drop into anything above
or below it, while manners are, like morals, the merest matter of
latitude and longitude.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have come out for a drive with the elder of the two Smith
boys, a lad of fourteen, who knows everything there is to be
known about the customs and superstitions of the people here, the
birds and flowers.&nbsp; We have driven for some twelve
miles,&mdash;in a buggy with an ancient white horse, and harness
rather inadequately tied up with string, which the half-caste
Swiss planter has lent me,&mdash;past the one spring of natural
water in the whole island, to this spot where I am now
writing.&nbsp; And picture it if you can: a group of brilliant,
glossy-leafed trees with immense blackened trunks; and beneath
their shade a number of elderly men sitting round a kava bowl,
drinking and smoking with an air of the deepest serenity.</p>
<p>Away from this shaded spot runs a clear, wide open glade
covered with short smooth grass, with an immense spread of tapa,
two hundred fathoms in length, laid out upon it.</p>
<p>Tapa-cloth is made of a certain bark, wetted and pulped and
beaten into flat sheets, then glued <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>together so skilfully that there is
no join to be seen.&nbsp; It is white and soft as silk&mdash;so
soft that one can crumple it up in one&rsquo;s hand without
creasing it.&nbsp; Upon a sheet of white tapa the women of these
islands make patterns, nearly all geometrical and perfectly
symmetrical, in black or brown, using in place of paint-brushes
small three-cornered pieces of slate or stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

 src="1600651h-images/p188.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This length of tapa laid out in the glade was already nearly
finished, though at the farther end there were at least fifty
women at work upon it.&nbsp; Along each edge there was a fine
pattern of red-brown, with diagonal stripes and diamonds.&nbsp;
Against this there were <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>half-diamonds of solid black, two
broad black stripes, a line of checks, a broad band of groups of
four wings like aeroplanes, another stripe, a zigzag of black and
white, and a strange cubist-looking design of elongated
diamonds.&nbsp; The same pattern was repeated from the other side
until the two of them met.&nbsp; No rough sketch is drawn in with
charcoal, and yet there is not one single mistake in the entire
length and breadth of the strip.&nbsp; Only imagine the accuracy
implied in such work!</p>
<p>We sit for a while among the men, talking to them, the Smith
boy translating all that they say.&nbsp; Here the shadows are
like gray velvet, the patches of light which fall between the
leaves of the trees a brilliant golden green; the air is like a
caress, the touch of a cool petal of a sweet-scented flower
against one&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The first time I drank kava I
hated it, thought that it tasted like nothing so much on earth as
stale soap-suds; but now there is no drink to be found in
tropical countries that I should prefer, and I drink with
gratitude what the men offer to me, throwing my cup as far as
possible after I have drunk.&nbsp; We get up and, walking along
the length of tapa, join the women at the end of it.&nbsp; There
is less than a yard to be done now and as they ask me to add
something to it, I put my initials and a prancing horse in <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>one corner
of it, witness throughout centuries to come&mdash;as this tapa is
virtually indestructible&mdash;to the ineptness of a European
working with tools to which she is unaccustomed; for there is
nothing, apart from the point of a triangular piece of wood, to
serve me as a brush.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The boy and I have come on through an avenue of ironbarks to
the shore, and are now sitting at the top of the terraces, half
cliffs, of white coral, serrated into a thousand spikes and
hollows, with rounded pools and semi-terraces.&nbsp; Here we
watch the great plumes and towers of water which come up through
the blow-holes; for the Pacific breakers rush in with all their
force, under these terraces, and up through the holes, scattering
in lofty columns of foam and spray far, far overhead, against the
brilliance of the unclouded midday sky; driven by the wind back
inland over the cocoanut groves, mingling with the spray-like
foliage of the ironbarks.</p>
<h2><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all, I am back on the
<i>Monterey</i>, sitting in that very chair which I left as
hostage.&nbsp; I am filled with delight at the reception I
received; for the two mates and the captain, standing together,
with the engineer, as though there had never been so much as a
hint of misunderstanding between them, were at the top of the
gangway to greet me with the words, &ldquo;Welcome
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible to express my intense
satisfaction at finding myself aboard again, despite the fact
that the copra-bugs and cockroaches seem to have taken entire
possession.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The actual and spiritual atmosphere alike have cleared, and we
ran before a fair wind, with all sails set, that devil of an
engine unregarded, &rsquo;twixt a blue sea and a bluer sky
flecked with light mackerel clouds.&nbsp; Throughout the entire
ten days which it has taken us to reach Suva, each day has ended
in a blazing sunset and slipped into a <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>moonlight
night so clear that one could see to read on deck.</p>
<p>Suva, the capital of Viti Levu, and the seat of government of
the Fiji Islands, is on a great bay surrounded by mountains far
enough away not to overshadow the town, of an inconceivable
number of shades of delicate blue&mdash;blue of bluebells and
partly opened harebells, harebells paled of summer suns, and
ghosts of harebells.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There is an out-of-the-way good hotel where I am staying until
I can find out some means of getting up-country; for I find the
town itself a very dreary place where people play at being in
London&mdash;a little on the outskirts, perhaps, but still very
select, elaborately dressing for dinner each night.&nbsp; Indeed,
in Suva two things strike me more than anything else: the
splendid appearance of the native Fijians, with their immense and
symmetrical heads of hair,&mdash;who walk like princes and are so
superior to the imported East Indian, with his poor physique and
curiously furtive air,&mdash;and the dress of the European women,
delicately fresh and forever new, or so it seems.</p>
<p>I went down to the port office this morning, to meet the
captain and get my formal discharge <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>from the <i>Monterey</i>, though it
breaks my heart to think that I must leave.&nbsp; But the
schooner is not staying here long enough to give me time to see
the islands.</p>
<p>For some whim, I dressed all in my best, in a delicate
pale-gray embroidered muslin, large black hat, and, as an
exaggeration of affectation, long white suede gloves, and nothing
has ever amused me more than the faces of the officials waiting
ready to make out the papers of the ex-stewardess of the little
schooner&mdash;small, bedraggled, rakish as a rough-haired
fighting terrier, one ear cocked, the other torn down&mdash;which
lies against the wharf, discharging cargo with a good deal of
language upon every side.</p>
<p>The certificate of discharge, with an American twenty-five
cent piece, as there must be some pretense of wages, lie before
me on the table, back in my room where I sit writing, after a
luncheon at which the captain and I drank each other&rsquo;s
health with many pretty compliments, with many true regrets at
parting.&nbsp; Really, it is altogether ridiculous to think that
I am going to leave a boat to which I am far more mated than most
men to their wives.</p>

<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>What
altogether mistaken ideas people have about the women of the
Victorian age!&nbsp; While resting and gathering myself together
before I start off on my expedition up-country, I have talked a
great deal with two elderly maiden ladies who are staying in the
hotel at Suva and they leave me absolutely gasping at the things
which they, and their mothers before them, seem to have taken for
granted.&nbsp; Their attitude is in strong contrast to that of
the young married women of to-day, with their complaints of it
all, the loneliness of the places to which their husbands&rsquo;
business takes them, the dullness, the fear for their own health,
the nerves and general sensitiveness.</p>
<p>Years ago, when these two elderly ladies were small children,
their father and mother came to Fiji upon a schooner, the
<i>Dancing Wave</i>, having been told that the Wainimala, right
on the edge of the cannibal country, if not in it, would be a
good place in which to settle and plant coffee.</p>
<p>They brought with them, from New Zealand, six children, a
white woman-servant, a Maori man-servant, several
horses&mdash;among which was a beautiful gray stallion, killed
within a few days by a native&rsquo;s poisoned
arrow&mdash;cattle, rabbits, fowls, pigeons, and all their
household stuff.&nbsp; The <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>eldest boy was at that time sixteen
and the youngest child five.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The mother was so ill on the voyage that, when they reached
Levuka, they decided to stay there for a few days, anchoring the
schooner and going off in a boat to the shore.&nbsp; They were
quickly driven back by the sight of the trussed-up limbs <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>of a man,
openly carried through the little town to a place where the fires
were already lighted for a feast, and by the sound of firing,
though of this they were told, quite casually, that it was
nothing more than the hillmen fighting the lowlanders.&nbsp;
Anyhow, they did not attempt to go on shore again, for all their
sickness and fatigue, until Wainimala itself was reached.&nbsp;
There they seemed to have settled down quite placidly, despite
the fact that when the whole family went to take lunch with the
Burns family, their nearest neighbors&mdash;the first and last
occasion, for a very few weeks later the Burnses were all
murdered&mdash;the little new-comers, running out to the native
lines to play with the Burns children, were struck by the sight
of a row of poles with the immense fuzzy heads of some half-dozen
of the highlanders stuck upon them.&nbsp; The highlanders
themselves had already been cooked and eaten.</p>
<p>They spoke of it quite placidly, these sweet white-haired old
ladies, sitting, with white folded hands, in the lounge of the
hotel.&nbsp; When I asked if their mother was frightened, if
there had been any talk of her leaving her husband and taking her
children away with her from such a place, they seemed surprised,
though this affair of the Burns family&mdash;and they themselves
had seen <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>fragments of their playfellows floating down the river
past their house&mdash;had by no means been the end.&nbsp; Out in
a canoe with their father and brother, a very little while later,
they met a man in a canoe, fleeing from the scene of the murder
of Mr. Mackintosh and Mr. Spiers.&nbsp; They themselves had
already passed Mrs. Spiers&rsquo;s house, and, returning as
quickly as they could, they took the unfortunate wife back with
them to their own house, after which the father and his young
son, both fully armed, went up the river again, to the place
where the murder had been committed.&nbsp; There they saw the
trunks of the two murdered men&mdash;with the heads, arms, and
legs cut off them, already prepared for the feast&mdash;propped
against a tree.</p>
<p>They told me too, these gentle ladies, of how their
mother,&mdash;and in what we consider the most mushy period of
Victoria&rsquo;s reign,&mdash;when her husband was away from home
on business, one day heard a great palaver going on upon the
river brink, among a group of gesticulating natives.&nbsp; She
went down alone, and apparently without the slightest qualm, to
find her friendly lowlanders dragging a highlander, riddled with
bullets but still alive, along the ground; disputing how they
could best get him to the other side of the river, <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>where their
store of wood was stacked, so as to finish killing him and cook
him.</p>
<p>Queer&mdash;to think that there are now at home in England, at
Oxford, at Balliol, even, grandsons of these old cannibals,
finishing their education.&nbsp; Though, after all, there are far
worse things in life than murder or cannibalism.&nbsp; The moral
standards of almost any European man would have brought a blush
to the cheek of these warriors, with whom incontinence in the
young man before marriage was regarded, not as something manly,
but as the sign of a feeble, weak-minded person, a sin certain to
be followed by the loss of health if not by the loss of life
itself.</p>
<p>These old ladies in the hotel told me of the murder of the
missionary Mr. Baker.&nbsp; Some of the natives themselves
implicated in the murder recounted to them&mdash;with shame over
having been so uneducated and provincial&mdash;the fact that, not
realizing that his boots were detachable, they had boiled, and
boiled, and reboiled his feet in despair of ever getting them
tender.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am writing now from the tiny island of Mbau, the native
metropolis of Fiji; for Suva is altogether European, the Putney
of the Pacific.&nbsp; This is by far the most romance-haunted
spot&mdash;the spot <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>which almost speaks, and groans in
speaking, of what is past&mdash;in all the islands.&nbsp; It is
the center of all that was dreadful in the wild days of the old
Fiji; the home of kings and chiefs, the shrine of
cannibalism.&nbsp; Mbau the beautiful, Mbau the terrible.</p>
<p>Ratu Pope, the premier chief of Fiji, invited me to stay
here.&nbsp; The invitation was received through the introduction
of a young Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society with whom I
have made friends, and who is, for the time being, teaching in
the principal boarding-school for the sons of chiefs.&nbsp; In
Fiji, all the chiefs send their sons to boarding-school as we do
in England, receiving them home but once a year.</p>
<p>Ratu Pope Seniloli, Na Gone Turanga ni Vunivalu (&ldquo;Child
of the Root of War&rdquo;), himself came down to the
water&rsquo;s edge to meet us, as we disembarked from the canoe
which he had sent across to the main coast for
us,&mdash;navigated by a host of small boys, who perched like
birds along the wide-spreading wing-like bows of the
outrigger.&nbsp; Though he is in some disfavor with the English,
he is as fine an aristocrat as Fiji can show.&nbsp; For Fiji is a
land where at a single glance, though all dress alike, one can
discriminate between the noble and the commoner; where the <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>aristocracy
is so fiercely maintained that any young noble might as well cut
his own throat as marry the daughter of a commoner.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We have come to the guest-house, which Ratu Pope has prepared
for us, past the council house which now stands in the place of
one of the old temples, upon the same terrace formed of great
blocks of stone&mdash;many of them as much as ten feet in height
and more than half that width across&mdash;which were brought to
Mbau by canoe in the days of its grandeur.&nbsp; There, also, are
the great and sacred gate-posts stolen from Kadavu and brought to
Mbau, stolen again by the men of Rewa and brought back, stolen
and brought back again, and yet again, with God only knows what
bloodshed; gate-posts between which <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>unnumbered British sailors, lured to
the island and sacrificed upon the terraces, were dragged.&nbsp;
I saw the site of the Temple of the Human Being Fishermen, with
its two gigantic, hoary banyan trees, still so sacred that no
single twig can be cut from them without a great feasting and
offering up of roast pigs.&nbsp; It has terraces like those of
the other temple, less than sixty years ago soaked with
blood.</p>

</a></p>
<p>If only I could put it all into words which could adequately
picture it, give my whole impression of it, this minute kingdom
of Mbau, with its immemorial customs; the atmosphere of something
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>powerful, great, and dreadful which still hangs round
it, so that the sighing of the wind among the trees, the whisper
of the waves along the shore, are like the sighing and the
whispering of those who once knew themselves about to perish upon
it.&nbsp; It is a place where ghosts walk, and sigh and whisper
throughout the entire night; a place inhabited by hundreds whom,
without seeing, one can feel about one.</p>
<p>At home in England, men stand at attention before their
superiors; but here, as we walk along the narrow strip of coast
and through the village edging the sea, men and women alike squat
upon their haunches, for it is forbidden to stand upright before
a chief.&nbsp; At lunch the man and two girls who wait upon us,
in general magnificently erect,&mdash;one of the girls, Maopa Tui
Rewa, the daughter of a chief, and lady-in-waiting to Ratu
Pope&rsquo;s wife, I have already seen crossing a glade with the
swiftness and swing of a panther,&mdash;move crouching, bent
almost double, round the table, kneel to serve their chief, and
in asking him any question, kneel behind his chair,
whispering&mdash;not because the thing is secret, but because one
must not raise one&rsquo;s voice in the presence of the Great
One.&nbsp; Even the boy who takes away my wet shoes, to dry and
clean, brings them back to me <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>crouching, and kneels as he hands
them to me.</p>
<p>I have a house to myself, with a sitting-room and large
bedroom in which is a wooden bed spread with finely woven mats
fringed with scarlet and bright green and black wool.&nbsp; The
bedroom has two doors and two windows, one window and one door
opening on to a yard-wide strip of grass, with the low sea-wall
beneath it, the other giving into a large sitting-room in which
we all take our meals: that is, the chief and his little son of
twelve, Ratu George Kadavulevu, or Prince Kadavu, myself, and my
companion; for the women of the family do not in general dine
with the men.&nbsp; In addition to this is another building where
my traveling companion and George sleep, and a separate
kitchen.&nbsp; There is, indeed, nothing it is possible to think
of that has not been done for our comfort and entertainment,
nothing which we could possibly fancy to eat which is not offered
to us; as is only natural in this part of a country where there
are special invocations made over a child immediately after birth
to save it from that worst of all vices, stinginess.</p>
<p>Each night during those faint and mysterious hours when the
strength of man is at its lowest, the chief gets up and walks
round his island, then goes back to bed until five or six
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; And <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the island is like this: It is half
a mile in circumference, within the middle of it a flat-topped
hill like a haystack with the graves of chiefs upon it.&nbsp;
Upon three sides there is nothing more than a narrow strip of
land between the hill and the sea; on the fourth is a stretch of
smooth open green in front of the old temples, and a few sacred
trees, and, at the farther side of it, the village, which runs
along the edge of the sea, stretching from the green to the
inclosure of the house of the chief, who is not only Lord of
Mbau, but Lord of all the Isles.&nbsp; Although the island is so
small, there are twelve wells upon it, with fresh water in them
as close as six feet from the edge of the sea.</p>
<p>The widowed sister of Ratu Pope lives in the village.&nbsp;
Almost the first thing he asked us upon our arrival was that we
should go and call upon her, and this evening I have been
spending an hour and more sitting in her house, talking to
her.&nbsp; She is a woman whom one must recognize at a single
glance as the sister and child of a chief, with her pride of
bearing, her fine skin, her almost Greek features, her hair more
wavy than fuzzy, lying in the smooth waves of the modern shingle,
her fine, slender, quiet hands, her grave and sincere gaze.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>In
every way Ratu Pope thinks of and for his sister, Adi&mdash;the
Princess&mdash;Cakobau, with the greatest devotion and
tenderness.&nbsp; But he cannot speak to his own sister, for that
is forbidden to any man of high rank in Fiji; nor can he enter
her house, for that also is against the etiquette of a country
which is ruled by etiquette.&nbsp; And yet, if this sister of his
had had a son and Ratu Pope a daughter, these would inevitably,
in the old days, have been husband and wife without the necessity
of any ceremony; though if Ratu had a son, it would be an
abomination for him to mate with his cousin, the daughter of his
father&rsquo;s sister.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Ratu Pope&rsquo;s own house consists of one immense
sitting-room and a small bedroom.&nbsp; All the pillars and beams
in the large room are decorated with geometric patterns, formed
by the black and russet-brown and pale biscuit-colored twine
which holds them together, for no nails are used.&nbsp; There are
many beams and many pillars, for the roof is high, so that,
sitting at one end of the house, one <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>looks down an elaborate vista, with
not two patterns alike.&nbsp; The entire floor is covered with
one immense mat of white woven pandanus leaf, patterned in
black.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Seated at the doorway of my house with Adi Torika, Ratu
Pope&rsquo;s wife, and the girl, Tui Rewa, <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>I have been
telling them of the sciatica or arthritis or whatever it is
torturing my left leg, which has been twice broken.&nbsp; They,
in their turn, immensely concerned, have tendered me a great deal
of advice as to the use of certain leaves, the co&ouml;peration
of the fairies, gravely doubtful as to whether dwarfs&mdash;whom
they picture as we have always pictured them: squat, malevolent
creatures with bald heads and long gray beards&mdash;may not have
something to do with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or an enemy,&rdquo; suggests Tui Rewa, gazing at me
with her great shining dark eyes, so full of life and
intelligence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can find your enemy, Marama,
and cut a little piece off his dress, or the mat he has been
sitting upon, then roll it up with earth and grass and seaweed,
so as to make a little figure of him, and get the magic man to
say magic words over it, then take your enemy&rsquo;s
water-bottle and put the image in it and bury it in the ground,
it is certain that your enemy will die, Marama, and the pain in
your leg be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adi Torika has a sad face; as Tui Rewa chatters on, she sits
with her hands folded in her lap, gazing out at sea through the
open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adi Torika,&rdquo; I say to her, &ldquo;what will you
do when your son goes back to school?&nbsp; You will be very
lonely without him.&nbsp; You, Adi Torika, and <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Ratu Pope,
ought to have more children so that the world may know how fine a
thing the children of chiefs can be; what is one son to people
like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment the words were out of my stupid mouth, I could have
bitten off my tongue; for the tears came into her eyes and she
turned her head aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she angry?&rdquo; I questioned Tui Rewa.</p>
<p>But Rewa shook her head, and Adi herself, flashing me a
reassuring smile, turned to Rewa and laying her hand upon her
knee, spoke to her in her own language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Princess Torika wants me to tell you,&rdquo; said
Rewa, &ldquo;that she can have no more children, for she and her
husband, Ratu Pope, broke all the laws of etiquette and propriety
by not going to stay a month with her father and mother after
Ratu George Seniloli was born.&nbsp; And that is why she is
always sad.&nbsp; Seeing that they refused this homage to her
parents, it is forbidden to them to have more children, and day
and night she dreams of them and longs for them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Of all the people in the island of Mbau, the one I have most
longed to meet is the Chief of the Tribe of Human
Fishermen,&mdash;or, <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>rather, &ldquo;Fishermen for Human
Beings,&rdquo;&mdash;but that has been hard to come by, for very,
very early each morning he goes out fishing alone in his canoe,
remains out for hours on end; then, when he comes back and I go
to his house, I am told that he is eating or sleeping, and he
sleeps much, for he is a hundred years old.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Small Morning&rdquo;&mdash;the hours between
four and six&mdash;I saw him push off from the shore.&nbsp; An
intrepid figure, in that pale and brilliant moonlight seen
immediately before sunrise and at that time alone, lean and
upright, with a thatch of white hair; standing erect in the teeth
of a wild gale, paddling his canoe toward the mainland.</p>
<p>Soon after nine o&rsquo;clock he came back to sleep, but now
it is &ldquo;The Afternoon is Near&rdquo;&mdash;the three hours
between twelve and three o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;and, answering the
summons of his overlord, he has come to talk to me, sitting on
the floor before me.&nbsp; An old man with an eagle-keen face,
large hooked nose, the sort of profile which might belong to any
old and distinguished general at home in England.</p>
<p>This Chief of the Fishers for Human Beings has eaten human
flesh, remembers the wild and bloody rites at the temple of his
tribe, when the brains of the captured were dashed out against
the great stones which still support the terraces.&nbsp; He <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>assures
me&mdash;this handsome, alert centenarian, so keenly smiling,
bright-eyed, and courteous&mdash;that he did not like the taste
of the flesh of white people, even when most delicately cooked,
with <i>mboro ndina</i>, or the true spinach, which is used only
with human flesh, any more than he liked the flesh of <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>the people
of the Carpenter Tribe, both alike being tough and tasteless.</p>

</a></p>
<p>He tells me, also, so vividly that I seem to see it, of the
strangling of the widows after the death of the father of the old
King Cakobau; how he saw them being led by other women along the
green margin of the island between the hill and the sea, oiled
and garlanded and wrapped in their finest tapa; peeping out at
them from a hiding-place he had contrived for himself, so as to
escape having his finger cut with an ax, as was done with all the
male members of the tribes at the death of the king.</p>
<p>With Ratu Pope translating, he tells me, and his still strong
voice singsongs out the tale like a saga, in soft rounded
syllables&mdash;and in Fijian every syllable ends in a
vowel&mdash;which run stream-like, gently, then with the sound of
a rushing river: of the revolt of the people of Kaba; of the
carrying off of the women of Mbau; of the coming of the first
Tongans, with the first missionary, who offered to help them if
they would become Christians; for this was in the reign of King
Cakobau, during the latter part of the reign of King George of
Tonga.&nbsp; Tells of their return with ten great canoes and of
the review of the <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>united troops upon the reef, the island being too small
for the vast number of men gathered together to spread out upon
it.&nbsp; Tells of how the men of the Lasekau Tribe had been sent
on to the reef before them, toiling slave-like by hundreds across
it, to cut away all the sharp points of coral, throw aside all
the poisonous fish stranded there, lest the warriors should have
their feet injured, and so be unable, not so much to march as to
pursue.&nbsp; Tells of the favorable augury of the Ghost of the
Sacred Trees of the Fishers of Human Beings, which had been given
to them before they went; of their great victories and the
pursuit of <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>their enemy with their war-cry of &ldquo;<i>W-we . .
.&nbsp; W-we . . .&nbsp; Uway&mdash;Uway-y-y-y</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is our last night in Mbau, and I wander backward and
forward through the village, overcome by a feeling of utter
misery, weighed down by the inevitability of that fate which
forces me forever to leave the thing that I most love.&nbsp; The
preparations for a great feast are going on in the kitchen of the
chief&rsquo;s house, overlooked by Adi Torika and her maidens,
who are cooking and stuffing chickens.&nbsp; Just outside the
kitchen there is a hole in the ground where among hot stones,
covered with many layers of leaves, fish and breadfruit and
pigeons are roasting.&nbsp; There are altogether in the kitchen
three women and a youth.&nbsp; When they are tired or when there
is any interval in their labor, they spread mats and lie down
upon the floor to rest, for no one drives any one to work in this
country, and there is no pretense of being busy when one is not
busy.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have come to my room, for the feast is over, and all the
ceremonies and good-bys past.&nbsp; This night, in our special
honor, one of the most stringent rules of etiquette has been
relaxed, and Adi Cakobau the princess and her sister-in-law, Ratu
<a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Pope&rsquo;s wife, dined with us, sitting in a circle
upon the floor; with the old Chief of the Fishermen for Human
Beings and the buli, or lesser ruler, of the village a little
distance away.&nbsp; At the end of the feast, which began with
oysters, we drank healths: drank the king&rsquo;s health sitting,
as a mark of the highest possible respect, drank the health of
all we loved.</p>
<p>There were two lamps on the floor, but the room was large and
full of shadows; the sound of wind and sea seemed almost
deafening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Ratu Pope, &ldquo;we will drink
the health of Marama, the lady, Dauvolavola, the one who is
always writing; drink to the health of Vavalagi, the foreigner;
drink to the health of The One Who is Always Sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This with a sly glance at my companion, who has passed the
entire afternoon in slumber, to which he responds, jumping to his
feet with his glass in his hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to the health of Dauboge, the one who is always
walking about at night, the one who is always up to some mischief
or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still there are more healths to be drunk,&rdquo;
said Ratu Pope, when the laughter which followed this sally had
died away.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will drink to the health of the son of
the Marama, and to the health <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>of the captain of the ship who
brought her here.&nbsp; We will, indeed, drink to the health of
every one we know, of all whom we can think of without
knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the feast was over there were good-bys to be said, for we
were leaving at dawn next morning, and, going out into the fresh
air which cleared our heads a little, we made the round of the
village, sitting for a long time in Adi Cakobau&rsquo;s house,
overcome by sadness; hung round&mdash;at once depressed and
gladdened&mdash;by all the kindness and courtesy of our hostess
and her guests, men in white sulus (akin to the lava-lava of the
Samoans) and girls in white gowns, who sat round and sang to
us.</p>
<p>There were so many mats on the floor that it was soft to lie
upon, being high above the ground, and we lay on our sides with
white pillows under our heads, smoking.&nbsp; Tui Rewa had
brought us fire for our cigarettes, a smoldering stick of wood
cut at one end to the shape of a halved triangle, of which the
lower half can be laid on the ground, and the upper point lighted
without fear of its setting fire to anything.&nbsp; Our
cigarettes were of native tobacco rolled round in a thin pandanus
leaf.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>There
was one lantern on the ground at the back of us; for the rest,
the great house was in darkness, the figures of the singers,
shadowy.&nbsp; The sound of their songs, far away and melancholy,
mingled with the wind, which to-night is sweeping in like a
cannonade of great guns from the sea, with tearing sheets of
rain.&nbsp; Adi Cakobau was wearing a blouse like a man&rsquo;s
tennis-shirt, open at the neck, and a dark skirt.&nbsp; From
where I was lying, I could see her fine face and head edged with
the light, dark against the golden-brown walls of her house.</p>
<p>The men and girls sang hymns, &ldquo;Abide with Me&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lead, Kindly Light,&rdquo; then with a splendid sort of
gusto, rolling it out, &ldquo;Onward, Christian
Soldiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I and my companion gave one of the girls
some money, so that kava might be drunk, and matches bought at
one of the ridiculous little stores of the metropolis; and when
the kava had been brewed the whole company gathered close around
it, drinking it, drinking to our health.</p>
<p>I came back to my house soon after eleven and went to bed and
to sleep.&nbsp; But a little after two I was awakened by the
silence, for the storm had suddenly dropped.&nbsp; Then came a
great splashing <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>against the sea-wall immediately beneath my window;
and, when I got up and went outside, I found the moon clear and
full in a sea of light, mid islands of umber clouds.</p>
<p>The great bull of the island, two heifers, a cow and a tiny
calf were walking round this small jutting point of sea-wall to
the next strip of sloping shore.&nbsp; The water was high and the
cow and the calf walked together in front of the heifers, with
the bull leading.&nbsp; At one spot, however, close to my house,
the water was so deep, the waves so high, that the calf refused
to go farther and stood pressing against the wall.&nbsp;
Whereupon the cow mooed to the bull, attracting his attention, so
that he returned, and pushing the cow aside, placing his own
solid body between the waves and the youngster, coaxed the tiny
creature on with delicate touches of his shining wet muzzle
against its neck.</p>
<p>I cannot sleep and am sitting writing.&nbsp; With a sudden
fierce slap in the face of the island, the wind has again risen;
a cloud slams across the moon, and the rain is driven inland in a
solid sheet.&nbsp; A bad outlook for to-morrow, when we have to
go in a canoe and flag the little steamer which passes on its way
to the north of the main island somewhere about dawn.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page219"></a><span

</a></p>
<p>We have actually made the steamer.&nbsp; It was very cold
coming out to her.&nbsp; There was a wild wind blowing, the sky
was heavy and leaden with great clouds, the gray sea torn with
white-topped waves.&nbsp; But Ratu Pope had lent us his heaviest
canoe and his strongest boys to paddle us.&nbsp; Looking back as
we came away from the island, we <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>saw our host and his son and wife
waving to us, with his sister standing farther off, in the green
street of the village.&nbsp; My heart ached as it had never ached
since I saw my own son go away from me, and I was glad that the
day was gray; that the rain, which had ceased to fall in sheets
as it did last night, wept solitary spots, heavy as tears.</p>
<p>I was very much concerned as to how I should ever get on board
the steamer when I saw it come, plowing its way through the deep
troughs of the sea, while we went to meet it, our own canoe like
a leaf upon the water.&nbsp; For I am no good whatever at
anything like a jump.</p>
<p>Luckily, the lower deck of the steamer was very low, and with
hoisting from below and pulling from above I tumbled on to
her.&nbsp; She is twenty-five tons and there are close upon two
hundred passengers aboard her, crowded upon the upper and lower
decks so closely that it seems as though, should one of them
sneeze, the greatest number must go overboard, for it has no
rail.&nbsp; The width of the deck round the deck-house is no more
than four feet.</p>
<p>We go north, close in against the coast with its interminable
mountains, peaked and jagged mountains showing that queer twist
at the top which I have seen nowhere save in Fiji; rounded <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>hills, and
steep cliffs as much as three hundred feet in height, hung with
long creepers falling like green waterfalls in unbroken streams
from top to bottom of them; and innumerable bays, the names of
half of which are unknown to the captain.&nbsp; If any of the
passengers wish to go on shore, however, he is obliged to stop
the steamer and send them off in the boat which we drag behind
us, while the little steamer itself&mdash;more like a
stage-property vessel than anything I have ever seen
before&mdash;spins and twists like a leaf in the wind.&nbsp; This
process is repeated every half-hour or so during our passage from
Mbau to Viti Levu Bay, a distance of but sixty-four miles,
costing each of us thirty shillings: surely the most expensive
sea-voyage per mile in the whole world, though maybe the charges
are in relation to the nine hours which it takes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When we at last reached our journey&rsquo;s end, Epeli Gavidi
Ganilou, Roku Tui Ra and Buli of Viti Levu Bay, came down to the
shore to meet us, out of sheer courtesy, as he would have come to
meet any stranger, and I handed him a letter of introduction from
the Colonial Secretary.&nbsp; He seemed, however, to think very
small beer of that, looked at us proudly and distantly, but when
my <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>companion followed it up with a note from Ratu Pope,
his whole demeanor changed, and it seemed that he could not do
enough for us, sending messengers to his house with our luggage,
telling them to ask his wife to make ready for us.</p>

<p>We are staying with Ratu Epeli now, in his house high on a
terraced hill above the village, looking down on the great
sweeping Viti Levu Bay with its island, and landward at each
side, on range upon range of mountains, betwixt every two peaks a
paler and more distant range, and between these other ranges,
swept and hung with veils of mist crossed with the continual
broken arcs of rainbows.&nbsp; The fresh cool air is filled with
the scent of honeysuckle, falling in thick wreaths from the trees
around the wide smooth grass terrace in front of the house, which
is more European than Ratu Pope&rsquo;s, with a wide veranda, a
central sitting-room, and two bedrooms.&nbsp; In the larger room
I sleep with Ratu Epeli&rsquo;s wife and baby, while my
fellow-traveler, of much the same age as <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>my own son,
and amazingly wise in all the ways of the Fijians,&mdash;wise and
grave as only the very young can be, the most perfect companion
in that he is the quietest,&mdash;shares the other bedroom with
our host, with whom in the quiet of the evening we have great
talks and discussions.</p>
<p>The Labor Government is in power in England, and Ratu Epeli,
who takes a keen interest in European politics&mdash;a chief and
the son of a chief of an unbroken line of chiefs, an aristocrat
to his backbone&mdash;is entirely amazed that we should submit to
such a thing.&nbsp; To his mind it seems incredible that warriors
and chiefs should sink so low&mdash;or so he regards it&mdash;as
to allow themselves to be dictated to by commoners.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I got up very early this morning, and walked round the garden
and am now sitting in the veranda, writing.&nbsp; The moon is
still up and it is very cold, but the wind has ceased and the bay
lies like a sheet of glass beneath me.</p>
<p>The ground falling away from the terraces dips so sharply that
there is no slope to be seen, nothing beyond the feathery tops of
ironbark and cocoanut palms, and one large bush of coral
hibiscus, its deeply serrated petals, its long streamers and
tasseled pistil hung with dew.&nbsp; Far below <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>me I look
down into the brown-roofed village where the fires are beginning
to be lighted, thankful to think that we have made arrangements
to stay here for this entire day, waiting for the horses which
the one Englishman in the district, who runs a cattle ranch some
fifteen miles away, is sending over to meet us.</p>
<p>An old man, with but two teeth left in his head, has been
sitting on the veranda recounting to me, in a sing-song voice,
one of those interminable epics of great fights which have all
the swing of pages straight out of Homer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all the wars there are five sorts of men needed:
first, the <i>Vunivalu</i>, or <i>Tui</i>, the Root of War, and
Chief of the Ruling Tribe; secondly, the <i>Santuraga</i>, those
who see to it that reverence is paid to the chiefs; thirdly, the
<i>Bete</i>, or Priest&mdash;the priests being of the tribe of
those who are all priests&mdash;with their long beards; fourthly,
the <i>Matanivanua</i>, or spokesmen; fifthly, the <i>Bati</i>,
or Warriors.&nbsp; Before the people make war they must lay <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>their
purpose before the <i>Bete</i>, meeting him if possible upon the
<i>Nakauvadra</i>, or Sacred Mountain. <a
name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the war between Natauya and Nalawa, Marama, many
were killed; the chief of the Naroko, he also was killed; I
myself saw it.&nbsp; The fighting swept up the hill here, swept
up it like a raging sea, and many men were killed, for Ratu
Pope&rsquo;s grandfather had sent a boat bringing rifles and
powder.&nbsp; Also many of the Sesse were killed.&nbsp; Those who
were captured were put in a house, and the house was burned, and
they burnt with it; I myself saw it, Marama . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment or so the old man broke off, puffing at his
cigarette, a black ribbon of tobacco and twisted pandanus leaf,
gazing out before him with fierce old eyes, re-hearing God only
knows what sounds, re-seeing, re-tasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people that were burnt in the house were eaten,
Marama, for it was in the bad old days, when there were
cannibals.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave me a sly sidelong glance as he
said this, speaking of the bad days, though I could almost swear
that the old villain licked his lips as he said it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was another fight later on, Marama, a small and <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>unconsidered fight, with the people up the coast.&nbsp;
We brought back one of them bound hand and foot, and slew him; we
took off his legs and his arms and took out his
entrails,&mdash;for these were in the bad days, Marama, the days
before we were educated,&mdash;and filled him up with taro, and
baked him in hot stones for two hours, and cut him up and ate
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ratu Epeli and my friend and companion are on the veranda with
me.&nbsp; We have a bowl of kava in front of us and other men of
high caste gather round it; all together they talk of witchcraft,
and the ritual of Luve-Ni-Wai, the practice of which is now
forbidden, any man found practising it being punished and liable
to six months in jail.</p>
<p>We speak in a low voice, almost whispering, not because we are
afraid of being overheard, but for the reason that terror and
mystery hang about the very name of Luve-Ni-Wai (&ldquo;Child of
Water&rdquo;), a devil no more than three feet in height and yet
so powerful that all alike tremble before him, even the <i>Dau
Vakadrauni Eua</i>, or witch doctor, into whom Luve-Ni-Wai
himself enters, and who is fated to die if he fails in the least
iota to follow all the rules set out for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to practise the ritual <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>of
<i>Luve-Ni-Wai</i>, you must go into the bush, taking a
<i>yangona</i> (kava) bowl and a cup made of <i>ai-bo</i> with
you,&rdquo; said Ratu Epeli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what you must do,&rdquo; repeated the others,
&ldquo;and find the banyan tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must find the banyan tree,&rdquo; said Ratu
Epeli; &ldquo;a wide-spreading banyan tree in an open space in a
wild and secret place.&nbsp; Then having prepared your
<i>yangona</i>, you must make a litany to Luve-Ni-Wai, a
<i>kerekere</i>, or request, that he will be good enough to allow
two or more to be chosen to help you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this, if Luve-Ni-Wai approves, he will take
possession of two of your companions; if he enters into them by
the feet, their feet will tremble so it is with difficulty they
can keep upright on the ground, while, if he enters into their
heads, their heads will tremble so that it seems as if they would
shake off from their bodies; after which, Luve-Ni-Wai himself
begins to speak, expounding the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to this we have all sat perfectly silent, almost
breathless, weighed down by the oppressive sense of something
dreadful drawing close to us, listening to what we are saying,
hanging over us with a hot fetid breath, for the wind has ceased
and there is not the slightest stir among the trees, <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>while the
almost full moon hangs right above us, ringed and distorted by
some queer twist of clouds.</p>
<p>Ratu Epeli, as though half forgetful of what he was saying, or
frightened of saying more,&mdash;sitting with his hands pressed
down against his knees,&mdash;drops to silence, while the old man
takes up the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night after this, the one who is being initiated,
he with the desire, and his two companions, must take themselves
to this lonely spot.&nbsp; During this time he must touch no
woman, nor must he drink any strong drink.&nbsp; But once that
the devil has appeared to him and spoken to him he has this
power.&nbsp; He can take any woman and no one can know; he can go
into a house or a store and steal anything he wishes, and though
it is full of people no one will see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If during this time,&rdquo; said the old cannibal,
weightily, nodding his head, &ldquo;anybody cuts off his head,
the Luve-Ni-Wai will put it on again, and there will be no harm
done to him.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The talk went on from tale to tale.&nbsp; Ratu Epeli told me
of Koro, the island where you can go up on to a high cliff and
call three times to the Turtle-ghost, who will come up and answer
you.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he does not answer you at first you call
into the bush, <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>for he may be planting, and upon that he will come down
into the water where his attendants are waiting for him, with the
big shark which is his guard, and, rising to the surface, listen
to what you have to say to him, answering your question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some say,&rdquo; put in the old cannibal, who seemed to
act as a sort of Greek chorus to all that Ratu Epeli told us,
&ldquo;that at one time some men caught the Turtle-ghost and made
a fire with stones in a hole in the ground and put him in there
to cook him; but when they opened the fire they found nothing
there but one stone.&nbsp; And these are the words they call to
the Turtle when they wish him to come to them, <i>&lsquo;Tui
Naikasi</i>, <i>Ko iko ha Vie Viei</i>, <i>vio iko na
eguege</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran on and on with the soft-syllabled Fijian words, in a
sort of chant which might, indeed, have conjured the fish out of
the water; so that I seemed to see them ranging up in rows, as
St. Francis saw them, around the magic turtle.</p>
<h2><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have, indeed, had the most
monstrous day.&nbsp; This morning, soon after nine o&rsquo;clock,
the Englishman who owns the cattle ranch, half-way between where
I am now writing and Ratu Epeli&rsquo;s village, sent over two
horses for us.&nbsp; It was pouring with rain, had been all
night, the rain coming down in solid sheets as it can in this
country where it has been known to rain just under a yard in
twenty-four hours, and I can imagine nothing worse than the
road&mdash;or, rather, bridle-path&mdash;through the bush, which
we had to follow.&nbsp; In some places the soil was washed away
at each side, running off in an almost perpendicular slope,
leaving the road like a sharp knife-edge of soapstone, upon which
it would have been impossible for the horses to keep their
footing at all had they been shod.&nbsp; In the dips of the path,
though the actual foothold was better, the water was again and
again up to our saddle girths.</p>
<p>Some years ago I had malaria so badly that I was paralyzed
down one side, and since then I have broken the leg on that side
twice over.&nbsp; <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>Gaily I had planned the first twenty miles or so of our
ride from Ratu Epeli&rsquo;s, but I had not been on a horse for
more years than I can say and could never have imagined what
agony the sitting astride could be; while my horse, which was a
perfect wonder and as agile as a cat, had a trick of jumping
every place which was at all jumpable, with a sharp jerk which
pained me so that I thought I should faint.</p>
<p>The first part of our ride lay through flat country with
myrtles and tree-ferns and crimson ginger, growing like gigantic
gladioli, upon each side of us, to a height above my knee; while
every tree was hung with long trails of creepers; though my
companion who led the way and kept looking back at me&mdash;with
the rain running down my back, soaking through my mackintosh
cape, sopping the bath-towel which was, as usual, elegantly
draped round my neck&mdash;assured me that the vegetation was
very poor, owing to the fact that we were on the &ldquo;dry side
of the island&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The Englishman, the one other white person we had seen for ten
days or more, or were likely to see for another ten, lived upon
the top of a hill which was like the side of a house; so steep
and slippery that, as our horses plunged up through the fern and
undergrowth, the only thing for it <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>was to leave the reins absolutely
loose and fling ourselves forward upon their necks, hanging on by
the saddle to keep from slipping off backward.&nbsp; The hillside
had by no means been improved, as we heard a little later, by the
fact that three hundred head of cattle had been driven down it
only the day before.</p>
<p>It is amazing how horses are left to fend for themselves in
this country.&nbsp; When we did at last reach the estate house
the saddles and bridles were simply taken off these fine,
well-bred creatures, which were left out to graze while we went
in to lunch; staggering up the veranda steps, feeling like
nothing on earth, absolutely drenched to the skin, the water
streaming off us as though we had been dipped in a river.&nbsp; I
hardly gave myself time to greet my host before demanding dry
clothes: &ldquo;Anything on earth, so long as they are
dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, there were no women&rsquo;s things, but he showed
me into an empty room, and as I threw out my wet clothes threw me
in a set of flannel pajamas.&nbsp; Never, never have I been so
thankful for anything as for the touch of that coarse, dry
flannel against my skin; though Heaven only knows what I must
have looked like when, having thrown a sheet round my shoulders
for the sake <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>of extra warmth&mdash;for it was very high up and
bitterly cold&mdash;I entered the dining-room; barefooted, for my
shoes had been full of water and were in the kitchen with
everything else drying.</p>
<p>We started off again at four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon;
for, though I would have given anything on earth to stay, our
boys had gone on to our next stopping-place with our packs.&nbsp;
Besides, there was only one bed, and nowhere could I see any
extra blankets.</p>
<p>I clung to the pajama jacket, for my own jumper was still
sopping wet, wearing my own skirt, which was warm though not dry,
and wrapping the pajama trousers tightly round my waist under
everything else, so that I might have the prospect of at least
one dry garment at the end of the day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp;
Having become accustomed to some such decoration, my treasured
bath-towel being perfectly hopeless, I bore off the sheet also,
swearing to post it back with the rest of the things, wearing it
draped over my shoulders under the mackintosh cloak which I had
bought in Suva, and which leaked like a sieve.</p>
<p>The first part of this second lap of our journey was nothing
to make any fuss about, and we were extremely gay after our good
meal, a great deal of hot tea well laced with brandy, which in
our <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>old
hunting days used to be known as &ldquo;brown cream.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Very soon, however, the path ran into a mere swamp through which
the horses plunged up to their girths in mud, so that it was with
the very greatest difficulty that we could get them on at
all.&nbsp; The darkness gathered more and more thickly, and the
rain, which had ceased for a time, poured down as though a sluice
had been opened in the heavens above us.&nbsp; The climax was
reached when in almost complete darkness I saw my companion, who
was riding in front of me, drop out of sight.&nbsp; When I myself
got on a little farther, I found that his horse, half the time on
its tail, was sliding down a steep bank at least sixty feet in
height, and so thick with scrub that one could see no ground
whatever, though a wide lead-colored streak in the darkness
beneath me, the loud roar of a river in flood, told me, and no
doubt about it either, what was in store for us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I was so much frightened as rebellious
at this.&nbsp; We had come so far, I was so wet and cold, in such
an agony of pain that I could have sobbed, at the same time
actually afraid that I might faint and fall off my horse.&nbsp;
Though all that was nothing to my indignation at the thought that
my companion, hard as all young people are, could ride on ahead
without so much as a word of <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>pity or encouragement, without so
much as a glance back at me, stuck there on the top of the hill;
for there was no need to draw rein, my horse being fully as
terrified as I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, we must stop here!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
impossible to go on; I can&rsquo;t face it, I&rsquo;m scared to
death; I simply can&rsquo;t face it,&rdquo; I shrieked down after
him; though all the while, despite these laments, something in me
more courageous than myself compelled me to kick my heels into my
horse&rsquo;s side, force him over the brink of the
hill,&mdash;cliff, rather,&mdash;press him, slithering down, with
the thorny undergrowth tearing at my legs.&nbsp; I reached the
bottom just in time to see my companion drive his own horse into
the river; get it across, drifting and struggling and swimming,
somehow or other to the farther bank; then drive it up a slope
every bit as steep as that down which we had come.</p>
<p>With death in my heart and yet with more of rage than death;
furious with him, with the state of the river, most of all with
the pitiless and exasperating rain, I pushed my own horse into
the water; felt him lose his footing again and again underneath
me, swimming a little, catching a sort of foothold upon higher
ground, and swimming again, nearly beaten by the current, which
ran like a wild animal against us, high above my <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>knees,
until we at last reached the opposite shore.&nbsp; Leaning
forward, lying flat along his neck, I caught my fingers in his
mane and somehow or other drove him up such an ascent I should
have thought impossible for any horse.&nbsp; I found my companion
at the top, dismounted and with his hat off, wiping the sweat
from his face, and realized in the chill twilight that he was
every bit as white and sheepish as I myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might at least have looked back,&rdquo; I remarked
bitterly, conscious that I was trembling from head to foot: upon
which he turned and grinned rather shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had once looked back you would never have dared to
come on,&rdquo; he said, showing an amazing knowledge of feminine
nature, for one so young, an instinct for managing women which
may stand him well in the years to come.&nbsp; The next moment he
himself confessed that he had never been in such a funk in his
life, and scarcely thought it was possible for us to get
through.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though,&rdquo; he added gravely, &ldquo;we
couldn&rsquo;t have gone back, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I agreed, for to me, of all deadly things in life,
far worse than death itself, is anything in the nature of a going
back.</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>The
man with whom we had lunched had sent one of his boys on with us
to bring back the horses next day; and after a pause this boy
also got through the river, and came struggling up the bank,
trembling and shivering, trotting close at our heels as we
turned, determined not to be left alone in such a spot.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another five miles, going at the slowest possible
pace,&mdash;for our horses were absolutely exhausted and there
was no road or track of any sort to be seen,&mdash;and we heard
in front of us the loud, incessant roar of yet another river, to
which the sound of the last had been nothing more than the cry of
a puling child: a roar so deafening that while we were yet about
half a mile away it seemed as though we must be at the very edge
of it.&nbsp; When we did reach the margin&mdash;for it ran flat
through high marshland&mdash;we realized that here we were at
last beaten.&nbsp; It was in wide flood, the water flecked with
yellow foam, running like a mill-race, filled with the trunks of
trees and broken boughs, swirling round and round in it.</p>
<p>It was impossible even to think of crossing upon horseback,
and queerly enough my one feeling was that of an intense relief;
for by this time I had reached a state of mind akin to that of
Sir Roland upon first sight of his Round Tower, thankful for any
sort of an end.&nbsp; As I slipped <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>from my horse and plumped down upon
the swampy ground, the mere fact of being out of the saddle, of
even a momentary cessation from the stab of pain in my leg, was
all I asked for; though goodness knows that by this time the
outlook was dark enough, dark as the fading day, for it was as
impossible for us to turn back as it was for us to go on.</p>
<p>The moon had by now risen, appearing and disappearing between
scuds of clouds, and the rain had ceased.&nbsp; Not that that
mattered, not that anything on earth mattered, for by this time I
had no inclination for life left, felt a little contemptuous of
my companion and the black boy, who stood on the edge of the
river, which we now knew to be the Wai-ni-buka, with their hands
rounded to their mouths, endeavoring, childishly as it seemed to
me, to shout down the flood, pitch their voices toward the unseen
village, which the native boy declared to be Little Nausori,
lying within a fold of the hill, almost immediately opposite to
us.</p>
<p>So altogether fatalistic was my attitude of mind, indeed, that
I could scarcely believe my ears when loud shouts were returned
to us, and looking far up the stream we saw men pushing off in
two large canoes, guiding them with their <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>paddles and
allowing them to drift down to where we stood out upon a spit of
land, having dully and indifferently enough taken the saddles and
bridles off our horses, tethered them, and left them where they
were when we saw the canoes coming.&nbsp; Two beautiful,
well-bred, and well-trained horses whose owner must have known
that this was the only way in which they could pass the night,
after a long day with two complete strangers who might well have
broken their knees or given them a sore back.&nbsp; And here,
indeed, you have <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>an epitome of the most complete hospitality in the
whole world, the hospitality of the horsey man willing to lend
his horses.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As my companion and I crossed the river in one canoe, and the
native boy, who was to take back the two horses the next morning,
in the other, they spun like leaves upon the water, whirling
round and round as the stream drove them, making land upon the
far side close upon half a mile farther down, so that we had all
that distance to scramble back through the bush.&nbsp; I, for my
part, made my way up the steep hill to the village&mdash;and all
Fijian villages are, if possible, built upon hills, to keep them
clear of the flood&mdash;more or less upon my hands and knees;
for the moon was already hidden behind clouds, and such a path as
there was no more than a steep slide of mud.</p>
<p>When we did at last reach the village we found to our surprise
that it was in complete darkness, while the people who came out
to stare at us, holding their lanterns high and peering into our
faces, plainly had no idea who we were or whence we came.</p>
<p>Directly the buli came out of his house to welcome us,
however, we discovered why.&nbsp; The note sent on by our boys
from Ratu Epeli had been so sopped with rain that it was
unreadable, so that <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>he had no idea whom the baggage
belonged to, from which direction the owners of it were coming,
or when they were to be expected.&nbsp; Not that this greatly
mattered, for in any case we should have been given the best
which the village afforded.</p>
<p>I am writing now in the village council chamber, the biggest
native house I have ever seen; I have just stepped it, and make
it roughly seventy feet in length.&nbsp; Large fires had been
lighted and new mats laid down.&nbsp; The buli himself has
carried off my companion to his own house, to change into such
dry clothes as he can lay hands upon; while the buli&rsquo;s wife
and some of the other women have helped to get me out of my
dripping garments, clinging round me like an eelskin, and into an
old jumper which I have found dry in the heart of my pack.&nbsp;
I unwound the pajama trousers, still mercifully dry, from my
waist, and got into them, to the surprise of the feminine
community.&nbsp; They raised their hands and their eyes, glancing
from one to another with loud clucks of astonishment: for though
they have never seen a white woman here before, apart from the
fourteen-year-old daughter of a doctor who once passed through
here with her father,&mdash;were thrown into transports of
amusement and fear when I drew off my <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>sopping gloves and threw them on the
ground, running toward them, touching them with the very tips of
their fingers or toes, running away again, clinging together,
laughing and screaming,&mdash;they realized at once that my
costume was not at all what it should be.&nbsp; They described me
among themselves, with all sorts of curious conjectures, as being
half a woman and half a man, christening me at once as &ldquo;The
One with Shells in Her Ears,&rdquo; on account of the small stud
pearl ear-rings which I always wear.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My traveling mate and I are sitting on the floor now beside
the fire upon which fowl and yams are being cooked for our
supper.&nbsp; Or, rather, I am sitting cross-legged with my
writing-pad on my knee and he is lying upon his side
smoking.&nbsp; At the back of us, far away in the dim distance, I
have hung up my mosquito curtain over the little platform which
is to serve as a bed, while my pillow is propped up in front of
the fire to dry; and all our clothes are hung on strings across
the room.</p>
<p>It is close upon ten o&rsquo;clock and I am drunk with sleep;
but as yet there is no prospect of supper, for the fowls here
take an inordinately long time cooking,&mdash;and even then one
can, in general, only <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>drink the broth in which they are
stewed, mingling it with the yams,&mdash;while a <i>meke</i> is
in progress, especially arranged in our honor.</p>

<p>There is one lantern on the ground at my side and the red
twinkle of the fire beneath the cooking-pot.&nbsp; In addition to
this there is the <i>buke</i> (fire) for our cigarettes,
twinkling like a small red eye between us.&nbsp; For the rest the
vast room is in darkness, though every now and then as the fire
springs up one realizes from the flash of white teeth, the
turning white of an eye, that the walls are lined with people
silently <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>watching us, utterly spellbound and scarcely
breathing.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of us and not more than four yards away a
line of young girls, almost naked, wreathed with green
creepers,&mdash;which hang round their bodies and are braceleted
round their wrists in long streamers like ribbons,&mdash;their
bodies freshly oiled and shining, are seated, swaying to and fro,
moving their bodies as though dancing, with expressive
Egyptian-like gestures of their hands, with the mimicry of
paddling a canoe, of beckoning, of embracing, of repulsing.&nbsp;
As they dance they turn their heads from side to side, throwing
them back so that one sees no more than a line of smooth throats
in the oasis of gold and umber light cast by the
hurricane-lantern immediately before them; enwrapped in the
rapture of a dance in which they never once rise to their feet;
in which the hands and bodies, arms, neck, and head, alone are
occupied.&nbsp; And all the time that they dance they make songs
for us: songs of Russia and France,&mdash;these girls who have
never been away from their own village, who have never before
seen a white woman,&mdash;songs of the war and of Germany; songs
of battle-ships and steamers coming and going; songs of the
climbing of mountains and the swimming of rivers and the passage
of rapids in canoes.&nbsp; <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>One after another starts upon a
fresh theme, and the whole party of girls catch it and carry it
on, tossing it as though it were a ball, from one to another,
throwing it over their shoulders, their heads thrown back, to the
long line of men who kneel to their dancing behind them.</p>
<p>The buli sits by my companion&rsquo;s side and talks to him;
he cannot understand how we ever crossed the mountains and rivers
to come so far in such weather, along such a terrible road.&nbsp;
Above all he is overcome with what he calls my courage.&nbsp; He
himself is a young man, thirty at most, but with the utmost
gallantry&mdash;glancing sideways at me as I sit nodding over my
writing-pad, looking like nothing on earth&mdash;he remarks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an old, old man, and she is but a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems to me that the <i>meke</i> will go on and on
forever.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a day of eternities; the ride
itself was an eternity; it is more than an eternity since we left
the shelter of Ratu Epeli&rsquo;s house; and it seems to me that
now we have, indeed, reached a point at which nothing ever ends;
that the fire will go on burning forever and the food cooking,
the <i>meke</i> dancers swaying to and fro in dreadful
monotony.&nbsp; An added note of inevitability is to be found in
the fact that the rest of the audience, who at first gathered
around the <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>walls, are now ringed around us, line upon line of
them, lying flat upon their stomachs with their elbows on the
ground, their chins cupped in their hands, perfectly
immovable.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A sort of end has at last come, but only a sort.&nbsp; We have
eaten the yams soaked in broth, and drunk all that remained over;
the great house is cleared of men, and my companion has gone off
to the buli&rsquo;s own private dwelling, while I myself am lying
with half the mats on my bed pulled over me,&mdash;for the
blanket in my pack is still sopping wet,&mdash;shivering with
cold and trying to sleep, with but poor success.&nbsp; For though
all the men have been turned out of the room, the women and
children are still here, talking, talking, and talking and
talking, as the Fijians can, and do, talk throughout the entire
night.&nbsp; The rats rustle and squeal in the loose straw
beneath my bed, and a horse crops the grass so close against my
head that I can hear its heavy breathing, catch an occasional
puff of warm breath through the openwork bamboo wall.</p>
<p>At last I can bear it all no longer, and rising in my majesty
of very large borrowed pajamas, walk the length of the room
toward the staring women.&nbsp; Demonstrating by every possible
sign that is <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>known to me that I am longing for sleep, that it seems
a good thing that they also should rest, I seem to have reduced
them to, at least, temporary silence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The night has passed: it is five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The rain
has ceased; but the mountains and valleys around us, the river
below us, still yellow and turbulent, are hung in a veil of light
silvery mist.</p>
<p>This village, with its goldy-brown thatched roofs, is set upon
a series of very smooth green sugar-cone-like hills.&nbsp; The
children and grown people come and go around me, bringing in
wood, carrying up water from the river, taking very little notice
of me sitting on the doorstep writing.&nbsp; They appear to have
got entirely used to me, as well they might; for throughout the
entire night&mdash;after I was supposed to have settled to sleep,
did, indeed, sleep in short, heavy spells&mdash;it seemed as
though the whole village came and went through the great room,
men and women, boys and children.&nbsp; I was conscious of a
continual whispering, a rustling, apart from the rats; the
flicker of a little taper floating upon oil, breaking through the
sleep into which I sank back and back, as though drugged; while
every now and then some small portion of me was picked up between
<a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>the
finger and thumb by some more daring explorer, determined to find
out whether I was altogether real or not&mdash;a liberty which I
was too dead with sleep to resent by anything more than a grunt,
a half-hearted twist aside.</p>
<h2><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have said good-by to every one
at Little Nausori, for it seemed that the entire village flocked
down to the water&rsquo;s edge to see us off; shaking hands till
my hands are so swollen that I can scarcely hold a pencil.</p>
<p>Now, for hours and hours, as it seems, we have been sitting in
a canoe, with a deafening swirl and thunder of water in our ears,
shooting innumerable rapids.&nbsp; To begin with, my heart was up
in my throat as we rushed toward what looked like inevitable
destruction against the jagged sides of great rocks; but I am now
completely at my ease, realizing that the two men standing at the
bow and stern of the canoe, with poles or paddles, will manage
somehow or other to steer clear.</p>
<p>How far it is to Wainimala nobody can tell us, for &ldquo;Only
the white man knows that,&rdquo; is what they say.&nbsp; Not that
it greatly matters so long as we get there some time to-night, or
to-morrow night, or the night after.&nbsp; For the sun is
shining; <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>the chill mists melting, rising in light wisps to the
tops of the trees&mdash;orange-trees and myrtles, immense plumed
bamboos, and innumerable, unknown forest trees, springing up from
a thick undergrowth of tree-ferns and wild bananas.&nbsp;
Although Wainimala is the nearest village where there is a buli,
or anything definite in the way of accommodation certain, there
are plenty of villages on each side of us, perched high on green
hills down which the people run with that polite questioning,
that interest in the doings of others, without which the Fijians
would look upon themselves with disgust as a mannerless and
uneducated people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sa lako evei</i>?&nbsp; <i>Sa lako evei</i>?&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;)&nbsp; They follow up their
salute with all sorts of scraps of news which seem to them,
immersed in their own little world, as the news of the universe
itself.&nbsp; In front of one village we are hung up for some
time to listen to every intimate detail of the death of a man
&ldquo;with something bad in his stomach&rdquo;; while the women
washing clothes, the men bathing, the small naked boys astride
logs of trees or in rickety canoes, the many more streaming in
from every direction, over the hill and down the river, are all
agog to see the <i>Valagi</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We are a day late, but we have at last reached Wainimala, just
before sunset, toiling up a steep hill to the little village, at
the farther side of which is a deep ravine filled with the
tree-ferns and myrtles edged with brilliant crimson and yellow,
green and spotted crotons.&nbsp; Around it are more cone-like
little hills, each with its cluster of three <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>or four
pale-brown houses and a few wind-twisted cocoanut trees.&nbsp;
Beyond and below these are the river valley and mountains of
every shade, the more distant a clear pale gold against the clear
pale-gold sky.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We have come steadily downhill during our journey, not only
actually but socially; starting with the highest chief in Fiji,
going on to a lesser chief, then to the most important buli, then
to a lesser buli.&nbsp; It is always to the buli&rsquo;s house
that any visitors, whether expected or not, are shown.&nbsp; New
mats are laid out, or the best the village owns in the way of
mats, a fire lighted and water <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>and yam boiled upon the very first
sight of any newcomer.&nbsp; We are now the guests of a man who
is in reality a commoner, and, though he has not yet appeared,
the difference in his house shows plainly enough the lowness of
his rank.</p>
<p>There are a great many girls in the village, and they gather
round us as we sit on a bench at the gate of the buli&rsquo;s
house, openly wooing my companion, making eyes at him, laughing
and joking; tall, finely developed girls with clean, smooth brown
skins and very white teeth, wearing skirts of different colors
and thin muslin bodices, very negligently open in front and in
any case showing every curve.</p>
<p>The buli and his wife are very late coming back from the
fields, where they are planting out their yams, and we have our
supper, yams and tea and the remains of a tin of salmon, out upon
the bench, with a nearly full moon, deep gold like an apricot,
rising almost immediately above us.</p>
<p>It is close upon ten o&rsquo;clock before our host and hostess
get back.&nbsp; They do their best for us, but there is no spare
house in the village, and so, for the first time, I have to sleep
with the entire family, though they hang up a mat to screen me as
much as they can from the public gaze.&nbsp; Bed, however, is out
of the question, for the present at <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>least, for it seems that the buli, a
rather surly peasant, having penetrated as far as Suva some
months back, has returned with a sewing-machine for his wife; a
machine which he must have imagined to be possessed of some
gnome-like quality of doing everything that was required of it
without any human aid whatever, for neither he nor any one else
in the village has the faintest idea of how to work it.&nbsp;
Half dead with sleep, I am required to lie flat on the front of
myself, upon the none too clean mat, tinkering with the wretched
thing by the light of one miserable lamp, half blinded with the
smoke, for the buli&rsquo;s wife is cooking the supper for
herself and her family inside the house itself&mdash;the first
time I have seen such a thing done.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It has been a perfectly horrible night.&nbsp; There was an
open doorway just opposite the end of my platformed bed.&nbsp;
When I shut it I was almost choked by the smoke and the smell of
the many people, talking and eating and drinking throughout the
entire night, crowded together in the hut; leaving it open, I was
chilled to death by the damp, cold mist which drifted in so that
even my hair was wet and I thought I should die until the idea
came to me of getting under the two upper mats <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of my bed
instead of lying on them.&nbsp; Upon getting up this morning I
bitterly regretted not having taken my clothes in with me, for
when I dressed, between five and six, I could have wrung the damp
out of them.&nbsp; However, the sun is now shining, growing every
moment hotter and hotter, so that I and my companion send out
great puffs of steam.&nbsp; Our boatmen, who were gray with
cold,&mdash;dulled and colorless, as all bronze men when they are
not feeling well, or are depressed,&mdash;glow and darken and
shine, breaking into songs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The sun is immediately overhead, the river like molten lead,
colorless and shining; all the moisture has gone out of both us
and our clothes, and I feel as though I might literally crackle
with dryness.&nbsp; We have finished all the water we brought
with us and all our food save a few cold yams, morsels of which I
turn round and round in my mouth, finding myself unable to
swallow.&nbsp; It is ridiculous for any one to say that when you
are really hungry you can eat anything, the fact being that you
get to a stage when without fat or any form of grease you find
such food as yams, so like moist wood, impossible to swallow.</p>
<p>It seems now as though we have been traveling for half a
lifetime.&nbsp; I am not unhappy, I don&rsquo;t <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>want to go
back, and not for one single moment do I wish that I hadn&rsquo;t
come; but, for all that, I&rsquo;ve reached a state where time is
absolutely non-existent, and I rather wonder if other people are
like that, losing all sense of time, realization of
place&mdash;at least any place apart from that in which they
happen to be at the moment, seeing even that through a
haze&mdash;when they are really hungry or absolutely
exhausted.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am altogether myself again, for I have eaten and
drunk.&nbsp; A couple of hours ago a twist in the river showed us
a small red-brick house, with outhouses and grazing cattle, on
the top of a bank a quarter of a mile or so above us.</p>
<p>As the ground at the edge of the river was a swamp of black
mud, my companion volunteered to go up to the house and see what
he could get.&nbsp; But he seemed to be so long gone, and I was
so frantic with hunger and thirst, that I tumbled out of the
canoe, plumping into the mud over the tops of my shoes, and
clambering up the hill,&mdash;for the most part on my hands and
knees, too completely done to battle with the achieved habits of
humanity,&mdash;flung myself down upon the veranda of the strange
house.&nbsp; I offered no explanation whatever to the owner of
the place,&mdash;an <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>elderly one-eyed Dane who came round
from the back and stood over me, stolidly staring down at
me,&mdash;nothing on earth beyond a hoarse and piteous
beggar&rsquo;s whine:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake give me some
bread.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>For this is what it had come to after days and days without
the staff of life; the very thought of <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>bread
blocking out the sky, smothering my horizon, no other idea in my
mind, no other desire in my heart.</p>
<p>Now we have had bread and coffee and cheese,&mdash;hard,
yellow cheese, of which I have eaten what would at any other time
have seemed an impossible quantity,&mdash;with lashings of fresh
butter; for by some happy accident we have chanced upon a dairy
farm, and are sitting waiting for a letter over which the Dane is
laboring, and which he wishes to send on by us to meet the launch
which we shall pick up in a few hours.&nbsp; Meanwhile his only
companion, a half-caste Maori, one of the most completely
villainous creatures I have ever seen,&mdash;just the sort of man
who might have stepped right out of one of Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s
books, and fully capable, to judge by the look of him, of
murdering his white companion,&mdash;sits and brags to us, with a
living stream of lies.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am back again in the hotel at Suva.&nbsp; A very gay and
cheerful Suva, for the fleet is in and the whole town <i>en
f&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; This morning I&rsquo;ve had an experience I
would not have missed for anything.&nbsp; For all the Fijian
chiefs sent out their war canoes to meet the incoming
ships,&mdash;canoes so large that it takes twenty men to launch
them,&mdash;and Ratu <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>Pope allowed me to go out in his,
the greatest and leading canoe,&mdash;with George Seniloli and
his chief boatmen,&mdash;the only European, apart from a couple
of boys, in the whole flotilla.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image259" href="1600651h-images/p259.jpg">
<img alt=
"The canoe of a Fijian chief"
title=
"The canoe of a Fijian chief"
 src="1600651h-images/p259.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>These canoes have one great three-cornered sail made of mats,
woven out of palm-leaves and sewn together.&nbsp; There is a mast
and a swinging boom, and another boom down the farther bunt of
the sail,&mdash;at least that is the only way that I can find to
express it,&mdash;the junction of these two booms being held
jambed against the small cross-beam on <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>the
taffrail either at the stern or bow.&nbsp; When the sail is
shifted, one of the boatmen,&mdash;and it must be a feat which
calls for the greatest strength,&mdash;lifts it and, taking the
whole weight of the sail with it, runs along the extreme edge of
the canoe and drops it into the V-shaped junction of the two
curved beams against the ledge of the opposite side.&nbsp; The
canoe is balanced by an immense outrigger, formed of long slender
beams running at right angles out from the canoe to what is
virtually the trunk of a tree&mdash;across which we all had to
hurl ourselves when the wind heeled over the canoe, bringing it
down with a slap upon the water.</p>
<p>All these mat sails are a pale golden brown, and what the
fleet of canoes must have looked like from the land I cannot
say.&nbsp; But we were leading,&mdash;for though we started last,
we very soon shot ahead,&mdash;and as I looked back at them they
seemed to me like nothing more than a fleet of shining brown
butterflies, driven sideways by the wind, not in the water at
all, but just scudding over it, light as air.</p>
<h2><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a queer thing the spirit of
adventure is&mdash;and for once it seems that the word
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo; is used rightly.&nbsp; It is not of the
soul, which is religion; though it is also a religion, the
religion of those who are forever searching after the best in
beauty and keenness of perception.&nbsp; It is not of the mind,
for, though the mind evolves it, it is most often without reason;
common sense has nothing whatever to do with it; gain has less
than nothing to do with it.&nbsp; It is as unreasoning as the
upward flight of the lark.&nbsp; It is untouched by the
elements&mdash;revels in them, indeed.&nbsp; You cannot call it
bravery, for it does not know fear.&nbsp; It is of the
spirit&mdash;that spirit which is like a bright and shining
fountain rising above the clay of the body; a flashing sword,
clean from its sheath.</p>
<p>All this to explain why, having returned to Suva thinking that
there was nothing on earth I wished for more than to remain in a
comfortable hotel, within easy reach of a hot bath, to eat
well-served, well-cooked meals, sleep in a comfortable <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>bed,&mdash;for I am subject to the delusion that I
should like to try the lap of luxury before being hurtled on to
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom,&mdash;I found after three days that there
was nothing I desired less.&nbsp; The very desire itself was no
more than the soft, overripe fruit of an immense fatigue.&nbsp;
Thus it is that I now find myself, driven by that ruling spirit,
living in the greatest possible discomfort out at Navua, for no
other reason than that it is from this place alone there seems to
be the faintest chance of getting to Bega, the one island in the
group which I was most earnestly warned against visiting without
some companion or other.&nbsp; Bega is only fifteen miles from
Suva, and that shows what traveling in this part of the world
means.</p>
<p>I came here upon a shockingly overcrowded little
steam-launch,&mdash;for there are no roads,&mdash;having caught
her by the skin of my teeth.&nbsp; Though she usually leaves
three quarters of an hour after the scheduled time, she chose
upon this occasion, for some whimsy or other, to leave a quarter
of an hour earlier than she should have done; so that I only just
managed to scramble on board her as she was leaving the
wharf.</p>
<p>She was a shallowly built abomination, but for all that the
water in the reef was so shallow that we continually stuck upon
the coral, so that all the <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>passengers had to herd upon one side
or the other, back into the stern or forward into the bows, to
clear her; while, once she was in the open sea, the waves broke
clean over her at every forward plunge.</p>
<p>Not for one single moment during the whole trip&mdash;which
took rather over four hours&mdash;did it cease to pour with rain,
so that it was impossible to remain on deck, and I was forced to
languish, half suffocated, down in what was grandiloquently
called &ldquo;the first saloon&rdquo;!&nbsp; It was separated
from the second and third by nothing more than the back of a
seat, over which a large number of the vociferously and
dramatically seasick Indians, with whom it was packed, draped
themselves.</p>
<p>I have now been three days in Navua and the rain has never,
for a single moment, ceased; falling with a maddening monotony
upon the iron roof of the dreary and desolate hotel in which I am
staying, with such a deafening din that one has to shout at the
top of one&rsquo;s voice if one wants to be heard.&nbsp; Not that
there is any one to talk to, for the immense and shapeless woman
who manages it&mdash;and who at first sight I imagined must be
pleasant and kind because she is so fat, though I wonder,
bitterly enough, how I ever came to <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>cherish such a delusion, seeing that
she has an eye like an old, ill-tempered elephant&mdash;cares
nothing for anything or any one, apart from those few dazed and
desiccated individuals who frequent the bar.</p>
<p>Navua itself stands upon a point of land sprinting out into
the sea; to one side of it runs a river now in flood, and a more
depressing place, indeed, could scarcely be imagined, a place of
swamps and rice-fields, degenerate Indians, mosquitos, and
rain.&nbsp; The only gleam of light in the whole
district&mdash;or falling across my own mood of abysmal
depression&mdash;is afforded by the nearness of a very delightful
District Magistrate and his wife.</p>
<p>I dined with this couple last night, finding myself immensely
entertained by certain items in the government of the natives,
more particularly the Indians, which they recounted to me.&nbsp;
The most engaging of all was the sentence of six months&rsquo;
imprisonment with hard labor for adultery, flashing through my
mind, as it did, a bizarre picture of an almost deserted Bond
Street; a desolate and weed-grown Leicester Square; sudden wide
gaps in society where no one ever quite dared to ask where any
one else might happen to be.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Day after day I have worn my soul out hoping for a passage to
Bega, but there has been a strong <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>wind blowing in from the sea, and
even if the chief did get over with his cutter&mdash;and he is
the only person from whom I can expect anything&mdash;he would
never be able to get back.&nbsp; Last evening, however, the
District Magistrate, who is also Provincial Commissioner and
Police Magistrate&mdash;there used to be all three of them and a
doctor too, until the Fiji Government bled to death a
sugar-company which had started large operations here&mdash;came
up to see me.&nbsp; Finding me in despair, he suggested, as there
was no sign of the wind abating, that I should fill in the time
by going up the river to-day, starting at six o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, staying at a native village twenty miles away for a
couple of nights, and then coming back to see what had happened
here meanwhile.</p>
<p>All last night it rained as though the bottom had fallen out
of a tank immediately above us, so that I hardly thought that the
pole-men for the boat would have the courage to put in an
appearance, for there is nothing that a Fijian dislikes more than
getting wet; but less than an hour late, which is nothing to be
accounted of here, we started off with a fierce current against
us, making close upon three miles in as many hours.&nbsp; I
myself sat in the center of the canoe, endeavoring to keep my
entire person, including my feet, dry upon a kerosene <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>box; with
an enormous umbrella with twenty ribs&mdash;which I bought at the
Chinaman&rsquo;s store here for five rupees&mdash;open over me;
while the four men, two at the bow and two at the stern,
alternately poled and paddled.</p>
<p>When we reached the first rapids, however, we found the thick
yellow water so swollen by rain, with waves as big as the sea,
thick with tree trunks hurtling down or whirling round and
round,&mdash;the whole face of the river being carpeted by
millions upon millions of dead grasshoppers,&mdash;that my men,
try as they would, were absolutely helpless, not only to make any
way, but to prevent us from being driven back by the
current.&nbsp; So we were at last reluctantly forced to turn,
race downstream to Navua, reaching there close upon midday,
terribly depressed.</p>
<p>As I streamed into the hotel I encountered the District
Magistrate, who told me that the Ratu, or chief, of Bega, had
actually got over, and was now lying round a turn of the river in
a new cutter with an auxiliary engine.&nbsp; He was starting back
to his island this afternoon and had been prevailed upon to take
me with him, though in telling me of it the D.M. did make one
proviso, and very emphatically too: that, however sick or however
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>frightened I might be, I should not blame him.</p>
<p>We start at two o&rsquo;clock, and now, moderately dry, very
moderately fed, I am sitting on the veranda scribbling.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to state that it is still raining; for
that must be understood to run like a Greek chorus through the
greater part of this recital.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Another day has dawned, rather to my surprise, and I am
sitting, writing, upon the sea-whitened trunk of a tree washed up
upon the white sands of Bega.&nbsp; Yesterday I wrote what I did
write about the rain because it seemed impossible to believe that
it could ever stop, but to-day is fine.&nbsp; Later on the sun
may come out, for it is, as yet, scarcely five in the morning,
and everything has improved&mdash;as it well may do, for
yesterday, take it all in all, was about as bad a day as I have
ever yet chanced upon.</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s cutter is very small.&nbsp; He is proud of
its auxiliary engine, but as the engine broke down before we
reached the mouth of the river, refused to come to, however much
the Fijian engineer hammered at it,&mdash;and a Fijian&rsquo;s
one idea of engineering is hammering,&mdash;it was not of much
use to us; though we sailed out of the lagoon in <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>great
style, and, taking some very bad seas, tacking a good deal, got
within about three quarters of a mile of Bega at four-thirty.</p>
<p>It was bitterly cold, the rain icy and sleet-like.&nbsp;
Inside the cutter the engine, stinking horribly, took up what
room there was, and I myself sat by the helm on an upturned
kerosene box.&nbsp; It is more than four months, now, since I
left England, and never for more than a few days at a time have I
been divorced from a kerosene box, or a bath-towel to keep the
blazing sun or pelting rain off my back.</p>
<p>The chief is a fairly young man, handsome and finely grown, as
all these Fijian chiefs are.&nbsp; With him there were two young
men and another whom he called the captain, hideously distorted
by elephantiasis.&nbsp; But even with these four the sail
thrashed so whenever we tacked that I myself took the
helm&mdash;a bar of iron so heavy that I was obliged to lash
myself round, with a rope fastened to the hatch of the
companionway, to keep myself from being flung overboard or swept
off by the waves.</p>
<p>Close upon Bega the wind dropped, or was shut away from us by
the mountain, so that tack and tack as we might, it seemed as
though we should never make land at all.&nbsp; After a while the
darkness <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>fell suddenly, like a black curtain; then it cleared a
little, though there was no moon, and I could see no reason for
it.&nbsp; The chief took the helm, and, lying down upon the deck,
I sprawled my arms across my kerosene box, laying my head upon
them, every inch of me aching from the strain of holding on and
steering.&nbsp; The two younger men disappeared into the bowels
of the cutter, and the captain, a monstrous and pathetic figure,
remained stationary in the bow, silhouetted out against the pale
sky, staring toward the mountainous mass of land as though by
staring he could bring it nearer.</p>
<p>For close upon a couple of hours scarcely a breath of air came
to us, and the sails hung fretting against the mast.&nbsp; Then
the darkness fell again, so thickly that I had a feeling as
though I could taste it, smell it, while a little wind arose,
just sufficient to take us within a quarter of a mile of the
shore.&nbsp; The dinghy which we had been dragging behind us was
pulled up level with the cutter, so full of water that as I
dropped into it in the darkness I was sure that I had dropped
into the sea.</p>
<p>We struck the coral so far out that I had to be carried.&nbsp;
And this was the beginning of the first panic which has seized me
since I left England.&nbsp; <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>Picture it like this: I was in the
arms of a chief of whom I knew nothing whatever, disembarking by
night upon an island where he was absolute ruler.&nbsp; I was not
even going into his own village where his wife and family lived,
for we were unable to make it on account of the wind, but to a
lonely place of which I had heard nothing but ill.&nbsp; Even
then, as he carried me, all that I had heard of Bega flashed
through my mind, the thought that there was no other single white
person nearer to us than Navua, to which it was perfectly
impossible to return.&nbsp; My return anywhere, indeed, hung upon
the will and the word of the man who carried me, high up in his
arms as though I had been a baby; while it was no better when he
put me down upon the soft sand in the velvety blackness of that
teeming-wet and moonless night, with the breathing of many people
who must have seen us coming, flocked down to the shore to meet
us,&mdash;were then gathered, without a word, without a single
sound save that soft sibilant breath,&mdash;all around us parting
as I moved, so that, however close they might be, nobody touched
me.</p>
<p>The chief himself spoke to nobody apart from his men who came
splashing on shore after us.&nbsp; He bade them go on to the
nearest village and tell the villagers that we were coming, while
he and I <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>went up to a little shop, which he declared to be close
by us in the bush, to see if it were possible to buy any
food.</p>
<p>When he turned and said, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I followed him,
stretching out one hand in front of me, just touching him to make
sure of not losing him.&nbsp; My nerves were so on edge that I
had no confidence in him, and was only more afraid of the people
I had not yet seen than I was of him; I scarcely believed that
there was any shop.</p>
<p>After a while, however, though there was no light showing, we
reached a door.&nbsp; I knew it was a door by the chief&rsquo;s
knocking upon it and by the variety of snores that came from
behind it, lost in the blackness; by the peremptory calls to
open.&nbsp; After a long delay a glint of light showed, the door
opened, and in we went, finding ourselves in a small and very
dirty hovel with an Indian man and woman and half a dozen naked
children.</p>
<p>Here we bought hard biscuits and tinned salmon; I myself had
tea and sugar in my pack.&nbsp; All the while I was in the place
the Indian woman grinned, the children stared, while, after I had
paid for what we bought, the man, catching hold of the
chief&rsquo;s sleeve with a sidelong glance in my direction, made
some facetious whispering remark which I could not catch, and
could not have <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>understood if I had caught it, though the effect of it
frightened me more, all strung up as I was, than anything has
ever done before; for the chief giggled as he moved away,
beckoning me to follow.&nbsp; And only those who are acquainted
with the almost unvarying gravity of the aristocratic Fijians,
their proud aloofness in all their dealings with white women, can
realize what this giggle meant to me, though there was, of
course, nothing left to do but to follow him, the very thought of
a night spent with the Indian family, filthy and low-classed as
they were, being out of the question.</p>
<p>We had borrowed the Indian&rsquo;s lantern, and making our way
down to the shore again, we followed it, I walking behind the
chief without the very slightest idea as to how far we had to
go.&nbsp; By this time the sands, so far as I could see, were
deserted, but looking down upon them in the light of the lantern
I found them padded over by innumerable
footprints&mdash;footsteps among which, at that moment, I would
have given almost anything to discover the impress of a boot or
shoe.</p>
<p>After what seemed a little more than a quarter of an hour we
came to a village, lying on a narrow strip of land between the
shore and the high cliffs, hung with creepers and loud with the
trickle of innumerable small waterfalls.&nbsp; Here the people <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>flocked
openly around us, leading us to the buli&rsquo;s house, where the
three men from off the cutter were already gathered, the figure
of the captain throwing grotesque shadows across the walls as he
leant above the fire, poking at it, setting an iron pot of yams
to boil over it.</p>
<p>The room was dirty, not very big, and crowded with men;
littered with spades and axes and fishing-gear; the floor without
mats.</p>
<p>It is always very difficult for me not to be smiling and
friendly, often enough out of sheer nervousness.&nbsp; But last
night, feeling very much alone, I kept my mouth set like a
rat-trap and, walking past the men as though they did not exist,
moved to the place of honor at the top of the room and sat down
on the platform-like bed.</p>
<p>The chief came up to me and asked whether I wanted to change
my things.&nbsp; When I said that I would change my shoes and
stockings, which were soaking wet, he ordered one of the men of
the village to give me a clean lava-lava, so that I could spread
it over my knees to hide myself as I did so.&nbsp; He himself
opened my pack and handed me clean shoes and stockings out of a
calico bag&mdash;very polite and ingratiating; awed, I think, by
my silence and my set face.</p>
<p>I sat on the bed without moving until the food <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>was cooked;
then I moved forward into the room, and sat down upon the
floor.&nbsp; The chief and I ate together, passing on what
remained of the food to the crew and the other men; who in their
turn tossed on the scraps to a couple of women who came in and
out of the hut, replenishing the fire.</p>
<p>After we had all finished eating, the women went out of the
room with the pots and pans, but the men remained.&nbsp; The
chief came up to me, and, asking me if I wished to sleep, himself
spread my mat and hung up my mosquito curtain, and told me to lie
down and rest.&nbsp; I had often slept in a room full of people
before, but I did not dare to do it there, in that strange
place.&nbsp; Telling the chief that the room must be emptied
before I would lie down, I went out and walked up and down the
shore a little so as to give them time to discuss matters and
finish their smokes.</p>
<p>The shore was absolutely deserted and so was the village; not
so much as a glint of light was to be seen or the sound of a
voice heard anywhere.&nbsp; But the rain had ceased, there was a
deliciously fresh, clean wind blowing, and the moon had risen, so
nothing seemed altogether so desolate as it had done.</p>
<p>When I went back into the but it was evident that the chief
had been talking to the men, for they <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>immediately rose and went out, while
he himself walked round, fastening the shutters and arranging the
fire so that the ashes would not blow about if a sudden gust of
wind arose.</p>
<p>I walked to the end of the room and, sitting upon the edge of
the bed, watched him for a moment or two, curiously uneasy.</p>
<p>When I spoke, however, saying, very decidedly, &ldquo;I must
have the room to myself before I can sleep, and nobody must come
near me until morning,&rdquo; he wished me good night and went
out without a word, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>For a long while I lay uneasily on the hard plank bed, unable
to sleep.&nbsp; For I am so accustomed to have every door and
window open that I felt stifled, while the room was so dirty,
with corners heaped with rubbish into which I dared not pry, that
it smelt horrible.&nbsp; A skeleton of a white dog kept on
getting in between the lintel and the door, licking some of the
empty pots which the women had left behind them, and the rats
rustled and squealed continually.</p>
<p>At last I could bear it all no longer, and, thinking that I
could hear people whispering round the house, got up, went
out.&nbsp; The moment I was in the fresh air, however, all my
fears were gone, for I found that the sounds I had heard were <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>nothing
more than the trickle of running water down the cliff behind me,
the rustle of the palms, the pat of small placid waves lapping
upon the shore.&nbsp; My nerves were so soothed that, after a
quiet half-hour, sitting, half dreaming, on a heap of driftwood,
white as skeletons in the moonlight, I went back to bed and slept
until close upon five o&rsquo;clock this morning, forgetful of
the dog, of the close air, of the chief&rsquo;s giggle.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is a divine morning, so exquisitely fresh that it might be
the very first that the world has ever known.&nbsp; As I sit upon
the shore, writing, a great tree above me which the natives here
call <i>futu</i> is dropping down masses of bright rose-colored
stamens from a creamy white flower,&mdash;of which each petal is
tipped with rose-pink,&mdash;so thickly that it lies like a
velvet carpet upon the sand beneath it and mantles my shoulders
with pink.&nbsp; At the back of me the black cliff is hung with
ferns: asparagus and maidenhair, and dozens of others of which I
do not know the name.&nbsp; The smooth golden sands are spread
with fragile and beautiful shells, thick as though it were the
counter of a shell shop, punctuated by the small, upright bronze
figures of the native children, with their long lavender-gray
shadows, who run in and <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>out of the sea.&nbsp; They come to
me with what they call &ldquo;eye-shells,&rdquo; the rounded
portion of a shell precisely like the porcelain of an artificial
eye.</p>
<p>The people out of the village come round me and talk to
me.&nbsp; They are more primitive than any Fijians I have yet
seen, but they are smiling and pleasant, and I cannot for the
life of me imagine why I had such a sinister impression of them
and their village last night.&nbsp; The chief, too, is quiet and
dignified and very polite, sitting on the floor of the hut,
counting out small piles of money to pay for a load of bananas
which he took into Navua.</p>
<p>The cutter is still hung far out in the bay and, as there is
not enough wind for sailing, the chief is going to take me up the
coast and round the island in his long boat with six pairs of
oars, directly he has finished his business.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We are at sea again.&nbsp; Just because we do not particularly
want it, a stiff wind has risen, the sky is a clear dark blue,
piled with silver-white cumulus clouds, the sun is shining.&nbsp;
As the men bend to their oars the chief sits in the stern of the
boat just behind me and tells me tales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a tree on the shore called the <i>fau ceva</i>
tree; you can see it there with bent boughs and a <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>bent trunk,
like an old, old man.&nbsp; If you cut a bough of that tree you
will not be able to go to sea, because of the wind which will
arise and last for eight days.&nbsp; If you want the wind to
cease, all you can do is to go to the wise man of Dakuni, who
will make a bow and arrow, and shoot at the wind so that it drops
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the chief&rsquo;s stories are of the ways of the wind and
the sea, and of magic which is used in the controlling of
them.&nbsp; When he ceases telling stories he starts to sing a
long-drawn monotonous song, of the ways of a boat and of the
sails and the helm; of boat-building, and of battles at
sea.&nbsp; From this he goes on to sing of me, myself, calling me
by the same name as they gave me in Mbau, Dauvolavola&mdash;The
One Who is always Writing.&nbsp; The men who are rowing the boat
are not his own men, but come from Dakuibeqa.&nbsp; After he has
told them of my writing, in a song with a chorus where they pick
up the last line of every verse,&mdash;repeat it again and again
in a swinging chant to which they keep time with their
oars,&mdash;he starts off upon another song in which he tells
them how I steered the cutter over from Navua, tying myself with
a rope so that I should not be washed overboard; tells how the
wind stormed and the waves <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>washed over and the rain fell,
finding a new name for me&mdash;&ldquo;The One Who is Never
Afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the day the wind rises so that the rowers
are unable to make any way against it, and we turn into a little
bay, where the men carry me on shore to a village.&nbsp; Here we
go into the buli&rsquo;s house, and when my pack is on shore make
some tea, while the women give us fresh oranges.&nbsp; All the
village seems busied over the making of dancing skirts out of
long streamers of the fine, silvery inner bark of trees, so
beaten and polished that they are as thin and shining as ribbons;
dyeing them every sort of color&mdash;pink and blue and magenta
and purple, yellow, brown, and russet&mdash;with vegetable dyes;
hanging them across strings from tree to tree to dry.</p>
<h2><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> arrived at the chief&rsquo;s
house close upon three o&rsquo;clock yesterday, having taken over
twenty-four hours to get here and found that his wife, having
already heard that I was coming&mdash;in the way which one does
hear everything in these islands&mdash;had a delicious boiled
fowl and fried bananas all ready for us.&nbsp; The guest-house
was already prepared, a large exquisitely clean room with a
wooden bed on which were piles of fringed mats.&nbsp; The moment
I finished my meal I flung myself down and slept the sleep of the
just,&mdash;with every door flung wide open, the sea wind blowing
clean over me, and no sort of doubt or fear in my
mind,&mdash;until well into the afternoon; lulled by the sound of
the sea no more than a yard away from my head.&nbsp; Heaven only
knows how I shall ever again live or sleep in the close room of a
London flat.</p>
<p>The chief himself prepares my meals and takes them with me
while his wife waits upon us.&nbsp; So long as we are actually
eating he sits upon a chair, but he is so manifestly
uncomfortable that the <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>moment he has finished he stretches
himself out upon the floor and plays with his little boy.&nbsp;
He is very polite to me, very punctilious about helping me first,
but I wonder what he really thinks about civilized women, for
even his own wife never eats with him.&nbsp; She is a
plain-looking woman, with white and very regular teeth.&nbsp;
When I admire them he says, rather sulkily, that mine are better,
and I find it difficult to stiffen gravely instead of
laughing.&nbsp; This is his fourth wife.&nbsp; He tells me <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>in his
naif, boyish way that the other three were lazy and dirty, and no
good for anything, so he sent them back home at the end of their
month&mdash;which had a classic sort of sound to my mind, so long
accustomed to the erratic ways of English servants.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image281" href="1600651h-images/p281.jpg">
<img alt=
"Section of a rope-tree at Bega"

"Section of a rope-tree at Bega"
 src="1600651h-images/p281.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Bega is all mountains and deep valleys, and thick and
luxurious vegetation.&nbsp; Sitting on a bank this morning I
counted what I took to be sixteen different ferns within reach of
my hand.&nbsp; When I brought them home, however, and showed them
to the chief, he laid them out upon the table and separated them
into pairs, pointing out to me that nearly all of them were male
and female, so that there were only six or eight different
varieties, in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is the way with everything,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are always men and women among the trees
and the flowers, the birds and the fish in the sea; no one is
altogether alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last evening he took me for a walk through the village which
lies in an amphitheater of hills, all alike crowned to the very
top with forests; excepting for one single sugar-cone hill half a
mile away, which is smooth green, like a field, with a fringe of
dark trees running up one side of it and down the other.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>From
the village we mounted a steep hill high above to the right of
it, with a wonderful view of jutting bays, and here he showed me
the schools which he is building for the boys of Bega: four large
native houses in which there are already forty boys and three
teachers.&nbsp; In time, however, he intends to make room for one
hundred and forty, being determined that the boys of his island
shall be well educated.&nbsp; And yet what is education?&nbsp; He
himself had never been to school, never learned to read, and yet
he could tell me what he had about the ferns.&nbsp; Imagine any
uneducated man at home being able to differentiate between the
male and female of the same species!</p>
<p>We went into one of the school-houses, really a
boarding-house, and sat upon the bed&mdash;one long platform
running the whole length of the room, and divided into sections
by the different boys&rsquo; mats, with their vividly colored
woolen fringes.&nbsp; Here there was, as in most houses, a
clearing made in the coarser mats which covered the floor, and a
large wood fire burning there.&nbsp; Some of the boys were paring
and cooking a vast pot full of taro for their evening meal, while
others came and went with wood and water.</p>
<p>At that height the air was fresh and sweet with the scent of
burning wood.&nbsp; From where I sat the <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>coast with
its three bays enwrapped a trefoil of smooth sea reflecting as in
glass the pale daffodil sky above it; while the fire in the
corner of the room was red and gold, flickering upon the dark
faces of the boys, who divided their attention between their
cooking and us: boys with shining bronze skins, bright dark eyes,
and white teeth, wearing nothing more than the whitest of
sulus.</p>
<p>The chief began to sing&mdash;the song of the shipbuilding and
the sailing, the song of the fighting men in their canoes, and
the song which he had made about me; while his small son of three
years old who sat upon my lap beat upon my chest with his hands
in time to the music, and his mother, sitting upon the floor
beside him, smiled pensively.</p>
<p>As we toiled up the steep path to the school she had carried
the child on her back; but as we walked down it he walked like a
little chief by his father&rsquo;s side, holding his hand, while
the mother followed behind us.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This island of Bega is different from all the other islands,
because here the men have the gift of being able to walk over
red-hot stones without being burned.</p>
<p>To-day the chief took me to see the immense amphitheater where
the ceremony takes place.&nbsp; <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>I saw the burned ground, the ashes
and charred wood, the blackened stones, and the marks of fire
upon the trees all around it which show how intense the heat must
be on such occasions.&nbsp; But as it is a great performance and
requires a great deal of time to get it ready it could not be
done for one person alone; or, at any rate, without several
days&rsquo; warning, so that it is impossible for me to see
it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Whenever we are walking about the village the chief walks in
front of me.&nbsp; If I want anything carried when we first
start, he calls a man to follow with it; but if I take off my
coat and carry it he waits till we are well away out of sight of
every one, then he takes it from me.&nbsp; Very often when I am
sitting sketching he will fan me with a large leaf to keep away
the mosquitos and flies, but if any one passes he drops it at
once, like a shy, proud school-boy, terribly embarrassed.</p>
<p>I keep on trying to settle when, and how, to get back to
Navua; but he wants me to stay and teach him more English,
threatens to cut off a bough of the <i>fau ceva</i> tree so that
I shall not be able to get away.&nbsp; He promises me that if I
stay he will take me over to the other side of the
island&mdash;show me there upon the coast a great rock; a rock so
sacred that if you lay your hands upon it three great <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>waves will
come sweeping up out of the sea, one after the other, and it will
be a wonder if you escape with your life.</p>
<p>Across many of the paths here are creepers with thick twisted
stems like ropes.&nbsp; I persuaded the chief to attempt to
measure one for me to-day; but after he had measured it to the
length of sixty-two fathoms it lost itself among the other trees
and he was obliged to give it up.&nbsp; He had not, indeed, much
liked touching it at all, for it, also, is sacred, and if any man
cuts it he will die within the month.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am back again in Navua, where it is still raining.&nbsp;
Though thank Heaven I am leaving this afternoon, having crossed
over from Bega yesterday, a Sunday.&nbsp; And in this lay the
root of all my trouble, for the Fijians do not like starting any
enterprise upon that day, though it did not seem to me that the
captain of the cutter had any religious scruples about going as
far as he wished, which was to the second village along the
coast, where he happened to have a wife.</p>
<p>The chief himself was not able to come over with me, and he
put me in charge of this captain, the man with elephantiasis, and
two younger men.&nbsp; From the very beginning everything went
wrong.&nbsp; <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>The engine would not work and the wind was so light and
fitful that it seemed as though we should never get out of the
land-locked bay.&nbsp; Then when we did get out of it, the men
kept so close into the coast that we lost what wind there
was.&nbsp; It was useless to expostulate with them, for they knew
scarcely any English and were sulky and obstinately fixed in
their own way.</p>
<p>At the first village the cutter was run into a bay, and one of
the men, going on shore, sent out a young boy in his place.</p>
<p>Coming over we had had the so-called captain, the chief, and
two other men; now there were only three counting the boy; and
though I steered I did not know enough about the coast, the
opening in the reefs, to take the matter entirely into my own
hands.</p>
<p>As the wind rose still more the youth whom we had started
with, and whom we had originally brought over from Navua, went
below and started tinkering with the engine; while the captain
and the new boy talked together, shaking their heads and saying
that it was impossible that we could ever reach Navua that night,
that the winds were against us and the time wrongly chosen,
plainly performing for my benefit; though it was only when we got
level with the village, where we had <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>stayed the night we came over, that
the trouble really began, for here the captain took the tiller
out of my hand, and, shouting to the boy to shift the sails, ran
the cutter right up into the bay.</p>
<p>At this I became furiously angry, going for the captain so
fiercely that he went below into some mysterious little cubbyhole
up in the bow and shut the hatch over himself, leaving the tiller
to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>At first I was glad enough to be rid of him.&nbsp; But after
we had passed the Bega Passage, out of the reef, the wind got up
and blew so heavily, in such fierce gusts, with blinding torrents
of rain, that it seemed impossible for us to manage the sails, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>and I sent
first one boy and then another to tell the captain to come on
deck, cursing my own trust in the Fijian character; for if I had
only taken a revolver with me I could have frightened him to his
post.</p>
<p>All this while the seas grew higher and higher, and the pull
upon the tiller was such that I had to hold it with my legs flung
over it at my knees, as well as my hands, lashing myself round
with a rope to keep from being washed overboard.&nbsp; Still, for
all our difficulties, short-handed as we were, we succeeded in
running across to the mainland reef; had made the passage and got
through it; were a good three quarters of a mile on the landward
side, when the captain came up on deck and said that he would
steer.</p>
<p>So great was my distrust of him, however, that I would not let
him touch the tiller; and, turning away, he went and stood in the
bow of the cutter, on the steps of the tiny hold, with his head
just out of the hatch, a monstrous and sinister figure wrapped
round with mist and rain.</p>
<p>The Navua boy, Mau, said that he must try to persuade the
auxiliary motor&mdash;at which he had been hammering on and off
throughout the whole passage&mdash;to go, or else we should not
be able to get up the river.&nbsp; He disappeared below and the
Bega <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>boy, who had never stopped grumbling about the wet and
cold, followed him, leaving me alone on deck to manage the cutter
which had taken four men on the voyage over.&nbsp; Though I
shouted down the hold, furiously telling him to come up on deck
again, he took no notice whatever, while the captain remained
immobile in the bow.</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, things began to happen.&nbsp; The
captain clambered up on deck and shouted to the Bega boy, who
immediately came shouting up out of the cabin.&nbsp; For a moment
or so they bellowed furiously at each other, over-shouting the
wind, the thresh of canvas; then, before I knew what they were
about, the captain came toward me, wrenched the tiller out of my
hand, and unshipped the rudder; while the boy ran down the sail,
leaving it loose and flapping with the boom, swinging so that it
was with the greatest difficulty that I could keep from being
swept overboard.</p>
<p>At this I was strung up into such a rage as I think I have
never been in before.&nbsp; It is impossible that the men could
have understood the language that I used, and, indeed, I was
amazed at myself, at the sound of my voice hurtling it out; but
something in the way I used it or the look of me&mdash;for I
always get a dead white when I am <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>really angry&mdash;frightened them
so that they ran forward and began to hoist the sail.&nbsp;
Rather, they pretended to hoist it, getting it all twisted in a
way that no Fijian who had not some ulterior motive of his own
would ever do, for these people are the most wonderful seamen in
the world.</p>
<p>Hanging on as best I could, I picked up the tiller, which had
dropped upon the deck beside me, and was trying to fix it into
its socket when, happening to glance round, I saw to my horror
that we had drifted back within half a dozen yards of the reef,
white with foam, overhung with thick clouds of spray.</p>
<p>At this I gave up all idea of steering.&nbsp; Crawling to the
little mouth of the engine-room, I shrieked down it to the boy
Mau, who ran up on deck, took the loose iron bar of the tiller
out of my hand, and then,&mdash;realizing how hopeless it was,
for of course we had no steering-way on us,&mdash;called to me,
bellowing through the wind, the roar of the waves, and the loud
flapping of the sails, with his hands to his mouth, though it was
no more than a yard away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marama, come away with me in little boat.&nbsp; These
men very bad men.&nbsp; Me row Marama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dinghy trailing behind us was more than <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>half full
of water, but, pulling her up a little, he took a running jump
into her and drew her level with the cutter, which had now swung
round so that she had her nose almost on the reef.&nbsp; I made
the other boy and the captain, who by now looked thoroughly
frightened, throw in my suit-case and bundle of
bedding,&mdash;for I knew I could not trust them once I was out
of the cutter,&mdash;then scrambled overboard as best I could,
horribly hampered by my lame leg and the tossing of the little
dinghy&mdash;for the sea ran like a mad mill-race through the
opening in the reef, spreading out all fanways beyond it.</p>
<p>By this time it must have been six o&rsquo;clock, and was
almost dark, while the rain fell in torrents which no words can
describe.&nbsp; The boy, Mau, said that it was only three miles
to the mouth of the river, two or more up it; but, while it might
have been no more, it seemed endless; seemed, indeed, after the
first hour&rsquo;s battling with wind and tide against us,
impossible that we should ever even reach the shore.</p>
<p>The water in the dinghy was half-way up to my knees and deadly
cold.&nbsp; I bailed the whole time, but it was impossible to
lessen it.&nbsp; When we did reach the river mouth we
found&mdash;hearing and feeling it, for by now it was too dark to
see <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>anything&mdash;that the river was running in just such
a flood as it had been when I left; while the mangrove swamps and
rice fields were so flooded upon each side that it was only by
the rush of water that we could judge where its right course
lay.</p>
<p>Ultimately we did, however, reach the hotel at Navua, between
eight and nine o&rsquo;clock; though for the last mile or so I
had to keep Mau, who was nearly exhausted, going by a running
series of questions and promises; my own voice, hoarse as a
crow&rsquo;s, sounding oddly far away to myself.</p>
<p>When he told me that he was about to be married, I drew a
vivid fancy picture of his future happy state, and the family
which he would have; told him of my own son in Africa and how
there were lions and elephants, and Heaven only knows what,
there.&nbsp; The poor fellow&rsquo;s voice sank to a hoarse
whisper over the oft-repeated words, like a sort of desperate
chorus: &ldquo;Me get Marama to Navua.&nbsp; Me get Marama
there&rdquo;; while he kept missing strokes so I thought that
every moment he must collapse.</p>
<p>Never in my life have I been so glad of anything as I was when
I saw the lights of that so-called hotel, inhospitable as it
proved.&nbsp; For when I streamed up into the veranda, with the
water literally sluicing off me, the few wastrels gathered <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>there
stared at me without the slightest movement to help me with the
baggage which I was pulling after me; for by this time Mau was so
utterly exhausted that it was all he could do to drag himself up
the river bank and through the thick belt of scrub to the
hotel.</p>
<p>In the one sitting-room the landlady, playing cards with two
of her male boarders, glanced up at me sullenly.&nbsp; When I
asked her for food for Mau, who was my first thought, she
answered, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t serve niggers here,&rdquo; and
went on dealing without a second glance at me; while the two men
in dirty and bedraggled white clothes, with unshaven faces and
bloodshot eyes&mdash;one of them, to his shame, an English
public-school boy&mdash;stared stupidly without so much as rising
to their feet.</p>
<p>As I rapped out an order for whisky, however, the landlady
hoisted herself out of her chair, slopped with bare slippered
feet into the bar, measured out two tots,&mdash;of which I gave
one to Mau, though it is altogether against the law,&mdash;then
returned to her cards, licking her thumb as she dealt.&nbsp; And
if Somerset Maugham could only have seen that room and that
party, the dirty flaming lamp, its blackened chimney hung round
with insects, the flying ants lying among their own <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>fallen
wings upon the spotted table-cloth, the filthy cards, the
derelict specimens of civilization playing at some unknown game
with that shapeless woman; been deafened by the deluge which
poured down unceasingly upon the tin roof, he would have realized
afresh the frightful truth of his own masterpiece,
&ldquo;Rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked the landlady, quietly enough, if I might have
something to eat.&nbsp; But when she grunted out sullenly that it
was too late, saying, &ldquo;There is no night service
here,&rdquo; my short patience came to a sudden end and I flung
round at her savagely, declaring that if she did not find
something for me at once I would go off and complain to the
Resident Magistrate.&nbsp; Then, making out some sort of
acquiescence, more like a grunt than human speech, I went up into
my room and changed my things, feeling that I would give anything
on earth for some hot water to put my feet in, or, best of all, a
hot-water bottle and bed.&nbsp; I pottered about miserably for a
good half-hour, trying to get my hair dry, thinking that I would
give the slut downstairs time to prepare something for me to eat,
but when I did get down again I found her still at her cards and
got nothing, in the end, beyond a plate of half-raw cold meat
with pickles and some <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>sodden bread for my supper.&nbsp;
And this from one white woman to another in a far-away
country!</p>
<p>Throughout the better part of that night I lay awake, too
chilled to sleep,&mdash;for my rug was sopping wet, like
everything else I had taken over to Bega with me,&mdash;listening
to the persistent thrash of rain upon the iron roof, the
torturing drip, drip, drip where it soaked through the weak
places and splashed down on the floor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Once more I am back in the hotel in Suva, wallowing in hot
baths and linen sheets, telling myself that there is nothing on
earth that I could wish for.&nbsp; Though, even now, I am
perfectly aware, at the back of my mind, that in no more than
another twenty-four hours I shall be mad to be off on the trail
again.</p>
<p>I hear from the magistrate at Navua that from all he hears
that rascally captain from Bega got up his sails and raced back
to his own island directly I was out of sight.&nbsp; As for Mau,
he is enshrined forever in my memory, together with all the
hospitable and courteous Fijians I have known.&nbsp; Goodness
only knows what would have happened to me if it had not been for
him, as nothing on earth would have persuaded me to give in to
the captain&rsquo;s demands.&nbsp; It would have been <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>by no means
a pleasant night at sea, with no choice between the open deck and
the one tiny hold used to carry bananas, shared with that swollen
parody of man.</p>
<h2><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> come over to Auckland on one
of the New Zealand Company&rsquo;s boats, with the idea of going
on down to Wellington, picking up a French boat there, and so
over to New Caledonia.&nbsp; Now, however, I find that if I do go
to New Caledonia I shall not only have to stay there a great deal
longer than I want to, but from there shall have to go on to Fiji
again.&nbsp; For, though boats run there from Wellington, there
are no boats that run back here.</p>
<p>I am now waiting for a Chinese boat which I have a fancy for
journeying upon up to Sydney, whence I shall be able to get on to
British New Guinea; though it is all rather a waste of time, for
New Zealand has been too much written about for me to tackle it,
and the time is too short to get farther afield than Rotorua,
where I have spent an altogether fascinated week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have been thrilled by meeting Conor O&rsquo;Brien,
who is on his way round the world in a twelve-ton ketch, built
under his own eyes out <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>of Irish oak in Cork, during the
time that the rebellion was going on; with every sort of wildness
knocked into her by the men who were continually throwing down
their tools to go and fight for the Republicans or Irish Free
State; leaving the prospective owner to carry on with odd jobs as
best he could; that is, when he himself was not treading upon the
tail of somebody else&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; For in those days
Captain O&rsquo;Brien was a fierce Republican; as he may be now,
for all I know, though we had no time or thoughts for politics,
gathered round the table in the saloon,&mdash;a saloon so tiny,
that from any one of the settees, which run three sides of it,
one may lean forward and rest one&rsquo;s arms upon the
table,&mdash;talking, talking, talking, by the light of three
candles set in heavy brass candlesticks, dimmed by a thick haze
of cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>And what talk it was!&nbsp; I remember a man once saying to
me, &ldquo;Wine and women I love, but talk is the breath of my
nostrils&rdquo;; and I myself feel much the same way.&nbsp; There
is nothing upon the whole face of the earth that I delight in so
much as the sort of talk which we had then&mdash;Conor
O&rsquo;Brien, myself, and a man who is with him.&nbsp; Talk of
the ways of ships with the wind, and the ways of the sea; of
strange and dangerous coasts; of alarms and excursions; of the
strange places we have been <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>in, of the queer things we have
seen.&nbsp; Never shall I forget the picture of the two men:
O&rsquo;Brien, shortish, square-built, with closely cut fair
beard and brilliant blue eyes; his companion, Captain West, who
only joined him in Melbourne, spare and hard, with curiously
light, rapidly dilating gray eyes, like gimlets for sharpness,
and a gift of silence.</p>
<p>I am wild to get a passage on the ketch, but the difficulty is
that, though the owner is quite willing to take me, accept my
seamanship at a glance, he is going on to the Friendly Islands
and Fiji, while I myself am bound in the opposite
direction.&nbsp; If, as it was suggested in the course of our
long discussion, we should split the difference, and he should
run me up in a north-easterly direction, dropping me at New
Caledonia, he would find there no wind to take him on to any
place to which he is now bound, upon his homeward voyage round by
the Horn; and this, as the vessel has already been out close upon
a year, would be a very serious consideration.</p>
<p>I do not intend repeating here anything that Conor
O&rsquo;Brien told me of his own venture,&mdash;a venture in
comparison with which mine is a mere affair of milk and
water,&mdash;for he will give it to the world in a book of his
own.&nbsp; During all the <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>time he and I talked together his
companion had scarcely uttered a word.&nbsp; But last night he
came up with a message for me and I persuaded him to stay to
dinner, with the result that, later on, over the fire in the
hotel sitting-room, which we had to ourselves, he quite suddenly
began to talk; staring straight in front of him with his odd,
bright light eyes, betraying no emotion of any sort, yet speaking
so quickly, in such a rapid, sustained rush, that it seemed as
though what he had to tell me had been bottled up until he no
longer had any control over it.</p>
<p>Since leaving Melbourne with O&rsquo;Brien he has had a bad
time, having fallen on the unrailed deck of the ketch and broken
his knee, which swelled to an enormous size.&nbsp; And only
imagine what the agony must have been on such a boat, where any
sort of comfort was altogether out of the question.&nbsp; Indeed,
the pain at one time proved so intense that he lanced the knee
with his knife, without improving matters.&nbsp; He has now but
just come up to Auckland after a month in the Wellington
hospital, for on account of this accident O&rsquo;Brien found
himself obliged to put in at New Zealand instead of going
straight on to Fiji as he had intended.</p>
<p>However, it was not of this, all of which I had <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>heard
before from O&rsquo;Brien, that West now spoke, but of what had
gone immediately before it.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that O&rsquo;Brien left
Ireland&mdash;that is, close upon a year ago&mdash;he had started
off from Newcastle, New South Wales, as a passenger in a
barquentine called the <i>Amy Turner</i>, bound for Manila, where
he was to join a ship as mate; having been at sea since he was
fourteen and seen as much of the world, bitter and
sweet,&mdash;mostly bitter to judge by the look of him,&mdash;as
any man.</p>
<p>This <i>Amy Turner&rsquo;s</i> captain was also her owner, and
had his wife with him.&nbsp; To begin with, they had a good
enough voyage.&nbsp; When they were almost in sight of Guam, one
of the Ladrone Islands north of the Carolines, however, she was
caught by a typhoon&mdash;which the annals of shipping show to be
one of the worst ever experienced&mdash;and for four days and
nights every hand, including the passenger, was at the pumps,
with very little food, no chance of getting anything hot, and no
sleep.</p>
<p>It was the twenty-third of June when the typhoon caught the
ship.&nbsp; On the twenty-seventh, when it was found that there
was no longer any hope of combating the water in the hold and it
was plain that she was sinking rapidly, nose downward, it was
decided if possible to launch the boats.&nbsp; <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>This was in
itself a desperate venture, with, of course, no davits of any
sort and a mountainous sea running; such a sea as can be
encountered nowhere and at no time save where the center of the
cyclone has immediately passed, leaving behind it a demoniacal
conflict.&nbsp; For after the center is passed, when the wind
slaps round from a completely opposite direction to that from
which it has before blown, the waves, still carrying with them
the old impetus, pile up high, pyramid-like, in every
direction.</p>
<p>As the men struggled with the port boat on the main deck,
helped by the passenger,&mdash;and all alike near up to their
necks in water,&mdash;the captain and his wife, the second mate
and steward, remained upon the poop-deck; the idea being that a
line could be passed from the boat round to them, so that if she
was once launched they might be able to drag her along to such a
position that they could either jump into her, or jump into the
sea and climb into her.</p>
<p>As Captain West explained this to me,&mdash;or, rather, not to
me at all, for he gave me the idea that things had got to such a
pass with him, the lust to tell so overwhelming, that he would
have gone on speaking just the same whether I was there or not,
for he never so much as glanced in <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>my direction,&mdash;it was amazing
what a sense of rush and pressure, the pressure of time shutting
to with a slam like a violently banged door, the whole level
recital gave me.&nbsp; So overwhelming, indeed, was the
impression of a wild rush of events, of the hurry and horror of
those last few moments, that I felt as breathless as though I
myself were being torn through the whole dreadful experience: the
straining, the gasping, the heart-arresting blank as the ship
sank beneath my feet,&mdash;yes, actually beneath my
feet,&mdash;turning over upon her side, dragging the port boat
down with her; seeing the starboard boat, seeing it with my own
eyes as they saw it, shoot out clear in an upright position upon
the curved crest of a wave; feeling the icy water close over me
as I struggled to rise, recatch my breath, with death at my
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long we were in the
water,&rdquo; the shy, quiet voice continued; &ldquo;it could not
have been for long,&mdash;a few minutes,&mdash;for no one could
have lived longer; the thrash of it was like a flail.&nbsp; For a
moment I saw the captain&rsquo;s wife&mdash;only a
moment&mdash;torn as though she had been dragged through a hedge,
the expression on her face, all queer and mazed-looking.&nbsp;
The others saw more of the men, but no one saw the skipper; we
spoke of that later, I and the three who got into the boat <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>with
me,&mdash;yes, there were three, a Liverpool man, an Australian,
and a Russian-Finn,&mdash;making the starboard boat, dragging
ourselves into it as best we might.&nbsp; A job, let me tell you
this.&nbsp; Yes, a job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, of course, there was no one to be
seen.&nbsp; How was it possible?&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice took on a
queer note of surprise at a question which I had not so much as
thought of asking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the sea was like mountains,
with deep valleys between them.&nbsp; Nothing whatever to be
seen, not so much as a glimpse of our ship, no sort of wreckage,
no anything.&nbsp; We ourselves deafened by the roar of the
waves, like thunder; blinded by the spume, the tearing sheets of
rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two days and two nights it went on.&nbsp; For two
days and two nights.&nbsp; Yes, that was it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice dropped at this, and he paused for a minute or two,
giving so unbearable an impression of something which knew no
end, of an eternity of suffering amid an unendurable
tumult,&mdash;and to my mind no torture can ever be so terrible
as the torture of noise,&mdash;that I cried out to him to go on,
which he did; without, though, so much as turning his head in my
direction, with no appearance whatever of having heard me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bitterly cold; I never felt such cold.&nbsp; <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>All four of
us were wearing nothing more than our trousers, for we had
stripped at the pumps.&nbsp; Two days and two nights, thrashed by
the sea, chilled to the bone, unable for one moment to break off
in our business of trying to keep the boat afloat, watching the
waves.&nbsp; No time for anything, not so much as to see what
food there might be aboard with us.&nbsp; And all this on the top
of four days and nights at the pumps.&nbsp; No joke, that,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whom he was speaking to I know not; certainly it was not to
me.&nbsp; Rather, to the ghosts of those others who had gone down
with the barquentine; rather, as though he thought that they
might feel some resentment against him for not having managed to
save them; was putting it to them that life was, indeed,
&ldquo;no joke,&rdquo; likely enough worse than death; speaking
in so reasoning and reasonable a voice that I became shudderingly
aware of others whom I could not see, there in that
over-furnished, plush-bedizened hotel sitting-room, so smug and
comfortable with its blazing fire.&nbsp; I noticed afresh with a
sort of terror the curious expansion and dilation of the
light-tinted eyes of the mariner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time, in spite of all we could do, she <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>beam-ended,
and spilt the four of us out into the water.&nbsp; She righted
herself, however, so that we were able to crawl back into her,
more miserable, if that was possible&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
know, really I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It all seemed to have
reached such a dead level of misery that nothing could, any
longer, be worse or better than it had been before.&nbsp; I
suppose it was lucky, anyhow, that the gear the boat had in her
was so securely fastened that nothing was spilt beyond
ourselves.&nbsp; It was after this that we found the sea anchors,
and that helped to keep her more or less steady.&nbsp; Not that
we minded one way or another.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think, by that
time, we any of us minded what happened; just went on fighting
for life as though it was a sort of habit, with nothing to it,
nothing whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third day the weather began to improve a
little.&nbsp; On the fifth it was so much better that we were
able to take some sort of stock of what we had with us: a few
tins of meat; half a becker of water; a sextant, and a nautical
almanac; mast and sail still lashed in their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the sixth day the sail was set and I took the
latitude&mdash;as best I could, for I had no idea how far we had
drifted since the typhoon first <a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>struck us.&nbsp; Why&mdash;&rdquo;
his voice was patiently argumentative&mdash;&ldquo;no one could
have had any idea; it was all beyond us, beyond the power of
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What worried me,&rdquo; he went on in a slightly
complaining tone, &ldquo;was as to what seemed the best course
for us to take.&nbsp; It was I who was responsible, you
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said &ldquo;you,&rdquo; but it was not in
the least to me that he spoke; more likely he was explaining to
the dead captain-owner what he had done with his boat and his
men.&nbsp; &ldquo;We could try to make for Saipan, which I
calculated to be somewhere about three hundred and fifty miles
away.&nbsp; On the other hand, there was Guam.&nbsp; Yes, Guam
was nearer; but then it was dead to windward, with a very strong
current setting in against it; this wiped it out and brought us
down to Saipan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even then we missed Saipan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
West&rsquo;s voice was dreary and dejected, as though he could
not cease to blame himself for that.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t know how I did it; suppose we must have drifted
beyond all calculations; it was none too easy, you see, no
chronometers, no sight of the sun.&nbsp; Anyhow, when I realized
that we had missed Saipan, I saw that this left us with the
Mackenzies, eight hundred miles away, and, failing this, the
Philippines, twice that distance.&nbsp; Not that <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>there
seemed much chance of our reaching them unless we got rain, as we
might do somewhere about the eighth parallel, for the sun had
been blazing down upon us for days past, and we were getting
pretty short of water, though, of course, I had set them all upon
rations; they gave in to me in that; they gave in to me in
everything, I had no trouble in that way.&nbsp; I suppose they
sort of felt that I was the only one they could depend on, and
kept to what I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One tablespoonful of water a day; not much for tropical
seas, under a tropical sun,&rdquo; he went on flatly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But there it was; there was no help for it.&nbsp; And when
I found we had missed Saipan I put it to them that we should all
go without food until we found it impossible to endure starvation
any longer, and they agreed to that too.&nbsp; Not a bad lot,
take them all in all, and by that time I had got to know
them.&nbsp; The young Australian was a reasonable lad; one could
do anything with him, that was evident enough.&nbsp; The
Liverpool chap was a brainless mass of bone and muscle, a sort of
draft animal, but he did all he could, kept quiet; I&rsquo;ve
nothing to say against him&mdash;against any of them, come to
that.&nbsp; For the Russian-Finn could not help being what he
was,&mdash;none of us can,&mdash;going all to pieces almost at
once, <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>having to be cared for like a child.&nbsp; The poor
devil was covered all over with boils; I never saw anything like
it.&nbsp; It was bad enough for all of us, with sores which broke
out from being so constantly washed with salt water, and horribly
stiff with not being able to walk about, you see, but far worse
for the Finn.&nbsp; As for me, I did not dare to think of
sleep.&nbsp; The responsibility&mdash;that was what weighed on
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time our tongues were blackened, swollen so
that we could hardly bear the feel of them in our mouths.&nbsp;
We managed to catch a dolphin which had been following us for
several days, but the meat was all salt, and we could not swallow
more than a morsel or so of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nasty thing about it all was&mdash;&rdquo; he spoke
so calmly that there seemed nothing uncongruous about that petty
word &ldquo;nasty&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;there was a huge great
shark started to follow us, did follow us for days, rubbing its
beastly nose against the side of our boat, brushing beneath
it.&nbsp; The men unshipped the rudder and hit at it, but it did
not seem to take any notice; seemed a jolly sight surer of life
than we were, and that got on our nerves.&nbsp; Then it came over
me that I had missed the Mackenzies&mdash;how, God knows, but
those small islands are none too easy to find, flat down in an <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>open
boat.&nbsp; At one time we sighted a steamer, too far away to see
us, still there was a sort of comfort in feeling that there were
other people in the world, and ships afloat upon the
sea&mdash;queer though.&nbsp; But then the whole set was clear;
or so it seemed to us&mdash;ordinary enough in
reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quiet man by my side upon the hotel sofa&mdash;a hard,
twisted contortion of a sofa, despite its plush&mdash;spoke
ruminatingly; adding no word as to the desperate disappointment
which must have overcome the castaways when that steamer passed
by on its way without seeing the one precious flare, one out of
the three found in the boat, which they burned, the waving of
their miserable rags upon the end of one of their two oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night it rained,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and we
were able to drink as much as we wanted.&nbsp; If it had come at
the same time as we had killed the dolphin it would have been
better, for it made us frightfully hungry, almost beyond bearing;
but there you are, things never come as they might do.&nbsp;
Anyhow, we were able to bathe our sores, and that was
something.&nbsp; The wretched Finn went pretty well mad with
delight at the touch of the water; awful to think how he must
have suffered, that chap.&nbsp; Twenty-three days we were at it,
twenty-three days and nights.&nbsp; By that time I <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>had found
my reckoning, and made out that in two days we should see
land.&nbsp; Not that I really believed we&rsquo;d see it, really
believed we would ever see it again.&nbsp; All the same, I was
right, for at the end of those two days we did actually sight a
small island in the Philippines.&nbsp; Though even then it seemed
as though we might be beaten, for there was a devil of a current
setting down the coast, and by that time we none of us had
strength left to use the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hung about as best we could, however, and at sunset
that same evening a little breeze sprang up from the sea and
drove us into shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulty then was to know what to do with our
boat.&nbsp; I tell you I couldn&rsquo;t make out what we were to
do with it; it seemed as though after everything, I was beat
there,&rdquo; continued the narrator, in a low, hopeless tone;
while nothing, I think, in all that dreadful narrative wrung me
more than his account of that landing when it might have been
reasonably hoped that the worst of their troubles were over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew nothing of what there was on the island; if
there were people they might not be friendly; one could not be
sure of water or food: there was nothing which one could be sure
of, and, if we lost our boat, what might happen to us?&nbsp; <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>We could
not drag it up upon the sands; how could we?&nbsp; We none of us
had an ounce of strength left in us; and there was nothing like a
stump or the fallen trunk of a tree on the shore.&nbsp; At last
it came to me that we might tie the painter to a stone, though
when we found one big enough&mdash;which in general I could have
lifted perfectly well for myself&mdash;it took the four of us
what seemed like hours to roll it down a few yards of sand.&nbsp;
We were done at the end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no houses or people within sight.&nbsp; But
we dragged our way a little into the bush at the back of the
beach, and found a deserted palm-leaf hut, that seemed to us like
the Ritz, the Carlton, and Piccadilly all rolled into
one&mdash;&rdquo; that&rsquo;s what he said, &ldquo;the Ritz, the
Carlton, and Piccadilly all rolled into one,&rdquo; of this
wretched, deserted native dwelling!&mdash;&ldquo;and there we
threw ourselves down, slept like the dead until sunrise, while no
one knows what the feel of the soft sand was like to us after
that boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it grew light we roused ourselves, feeling
stronger.&nbsp; The Australian boy, poking about in the corners
of the hut, came across an old cooking-pot with some rice still
in the bottom of it.&nbsp; We found water, too, just at the back
of it.&nbsp; All this while we had kept the last of the tins of
meat <a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>unopened; and now, with one of our flares, we lit a
fire and cooked the first hot meal we had tasted since the day
the typhoon struck us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the end of our troubles, or pretty near
the end,&mdash;not that they sound much when one comes to talk
about them,&mdash;for some natives on some of the other islands,
seeing the smoke of our fire, came off in their canoes and took
us in charge; nursed and fed and looked after us as though we
were kids.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s the way with most
natives,&mdash;what people call savages,&mdash;so long as
there&rsquo;s not been too many white men about to spoil
them.&nbsp; It was they who got us up to Manila, where I picked
up a boat running down to Melbourne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gave me some sort of a reception&mdash;ovation,
whatever you call it&mdash;in Melbourne,&rdquo; he added, in a
shy whisper.&nbsp; Then turned and looking at me with a sort of
astonishment as if surprised to see me there&mdash;though later
on, before he left, he held my hand and gazing at me very
earnestly thanked me for having listened to him; added that it
made &ldquo;all the difference.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Presented me
with an address and a gold watch, they did&mdash;a queer sort of
present for a man with no money and nothing more than one suit of
cast-off white things, picked up in Manila, to his name.&nbsp; <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>But, there,
I suppose they meant it kindly.&nbsp; They made fuss enough of
me, but I was glad to fall in with O&rsquo;Brien, to get off to
sea again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get off to sea again,&rdquo; with the memory of all
those dreadful days still fresh upon him, his flesh scarred with
sun and salt!&nbsp; But there, indeed, spoke the true
sailor.&nbsp; Why, I myself remember having been at sea from the
middle of February to the end of June without a sight of land;
going on shore the first day in Adelaide, driving up Mount Lofty
with the captain of the barque I was traveling on, and sickening
for a sight of the sea; exclaiming with delight, as we caught
sight of it, shining far away among the trees below us, during
our homeward journey:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sea!&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s the
sea,&rdquo; as though it were altogether strange.</p>
<p>And how the captain added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sight for sore eyes, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

316</span>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> writing on board the Chinese
steamer the <i>Ling Nam</i>, an adventuress, if ever there was
one, with all the hard, brazen look of her kind.&nbsp; At the
present time she is owned by the Chung Wha Navigation Company,
running from Chili to Hongkong, touching at Tahiti, New Zealand,
and Australia, flying the striped and many-colored flag of the
Chinese Republic,&mdash;red for China, yellow for Manchuria, blue
for Mongolia, white for the Mohammedans, and black for
Thibet,&mdash;but just before the war she was the German
passenger-ship, <i>Field Marshal</i>, plying between Hamburg and
East Africa.</p>
<p>At one time the German crown-prince sailed in the <i>Ling
Nam</i>, and she still bears his impress in the most appalling
decorations, mostly marble and tiles, like an underground railway
station.&nbsp; The cabin he occupied is unchanged, all lined with
glazed tiles of the most virulent blue imaginable; the ceiling
literally peppered over with unshaded electric bulbs; the whole
thing, down to the bed, so entirely characteristic that one can
almost see <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>the hope of the Hohenzollerns lying there, sleeping
with the light full upon his face, his mouth open, his chin
running back in acute perspective from under it.</p>
<p>Soon after war was declared a hole was ripped through the side
of the <i>Field Marshal</i> by an English shell, which shattered
one of the marble panels on the stairway, and she passed into our
hands; was sold to an Australian company and carried troops home
to England.</p>
<p>They call her a passenger-ship now, but never was anything
more unlike the ordinary passenger-ship.&nbsp; She has all the
liberties of a cargo-boat, and something else, altogether
intriguing, a queer sense of unreality; though what it comes from
I cannot say; perhaps from the emptiness of the vast decks,
which&mdash;though I know there are at least three hundred
third-class Chinese passengers on board her, a number of
first-class, and, in fact, five classes in all&mdash;have up to
now been so completely empty that one wandered over them as one
wanders over a vast and empty house, feeling that the supposed
tenants could be nothing more than the ghosts of the men who have
died there.</p>
<p>And how many of these ghosts there might well be!&nbsp; For
the <i>Ling Nam</i> is mainly occupied in carrying back to China
men who have spent the <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>greater part of their lives in South
America, with but one desire left: to return to their own country
and lay their bones there.&nbsp; These people the shipping
company has undertaken to repatriate, either alive or dead; the
fact being that many of them have been so engrossed in
money-making, or felt themselves so young, that they have put off
returning until too late and there are continual deaths
throughout the voyage.</p>
<p>We carry no doctor with us, and when an old man dies&mdash;no
one troubles about returning the old women&mdash;the first mate
and one of the engineers embalm him between them; a ghastly
performance which I have seen taking place to-day, out in the
open upon the poop-deck, with thousands upon thousands of
sea-birds wheeling and screaming overhead, collected together in
this vulture-like fashion by Heaven only knows what instinct;
swooping down with loud screaming cries upon any choice fragment
which is thrown overboard.&nbsp; And it strikes me that a great
deal less of the defunct Chinaman than his relations can be aware
of ever reaches China.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Throughout five days at sea the weather has been bad, with
continual rain and wind.&nbsp; To-day, however, we have had a
little sunshine: pale and <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>fitful gleams which drew the
passengers up from their lairs, looking like curiously bedraggled
crows; sitting about upon the deck, blinking and smiling.&nbsp;
All the decks are now crowded.&nbsp; There are none of the women
from the first class to be seen,&mdash;they, indeed, will remain
immured below until the very end of the journey,&mdash;but among
the lesser classes there are many women and children.&nbsp; Never
in my life have I heard such incessant talking, running on and on
without ceasing,&mdash;like nothing so much on earth as the sound
of water being violently poured out of a great many bottles, the
shaking of innumerable crow-scarers,&mdash;such laughing and
tittering, the men laughing like women.&nbsp; Nothing less like
the taciturn, dark brooders over deep and guilty secrets, such as
fiction writers love, could be well imagined than these Chinese
turning themselves round in the sparse sunlight, wrinkling up
their queer parchment faces with delight, while the women, odd
little images in black trousers and short coats, of a shining
stuff which looks like mackintosh, scuttle round after the
children, squealing with laughter.</p>
<p>I see next to nothing of the white passengers.&nbsp; The men,
having discarded their collars and ties,&mdash;not for coolness,
for the wind is icy, but rather, it seems, from an ingrained
habit,&mdash;spend their <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>time playing bridge or poker, or
lying back upon the settees with their feet upon the
tables.&nbsp; Which will, I think, show them as they are, as well
as any more elaborate word-picture.&nbsp; The two white women
whom I know to be on board are apparently overcome by
sea-sickness.</p>
<p>All this morning I spent up on the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle head
in a state of splendid isolation, drenched with sharp scuds of
spray from the immense swathes of foam, and marbled ice-green
water which parted before us, sweeping out triumphantly on each
side.&nbsp; Launched as I was clear above the water, I felt as
though I had a horse, with a vast, sweeping, and immensely
buoyant gallop, beneath me; while the ship itself lost, for the
first time, that queer demi-mondaine aspect which she in general
wears.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, I have spent my time since I came
on board talking to Mr. Wu Shen-kun,&mdash;as unlike the Mr. Wu
of the drama as the real is forever unlike the purely
imaginary,&mdash;who seems to have fitted as many activities as
possible into his short life, and now, hopelessly paralyzed, sits
all day, smiling, at the door of his cabin, hung round with every
intelligent man on the boat, for he has the keenest mind, the
most engaging personality that it is possible to imagine.</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>For
two years Mr. Wu was at the London University and the School of
Economics, this period being broken by a distinguished interval
as one of the members of the Chinese delegation at the Washington
Conference upon disarmament and followed by his appointment as
secretary to the Chinese Legation in Chili.&nbsp; During the time
that he was in Washington, and again in London, he tells
me,&mdash;though it is difficult to get anything out of him about
himself,&mdash;he was troubled with constant dragging pains in
his limbs which the doctors then thought to be the result of the
climate.&nbsp; When he got down to Chili, however, he was told by
two different specialists that these pains were connected with
his spine, and that he must undergo an operation, which he did,
with the result that he is now a cripple for life,&mdash;and
still well under thirty years of age,&mdash;on his way back to
his own quiet home in the Province of Hunan, or South Lake, in
central China; with no prospects save to be tied to his bed or
chair for the remainder of his life, among people whose whole
outlook upon life is that of the most remote Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Not that he makes a grievance of his own fate, or of anything
else; and that is part of the charm he carries with him, imparts
to others,&mdash;an indomitable and unwordy
philosophy,&mdash;tapping his <a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>closely cropped little round head
and saying, &ldquo;After all, it is what is in there, and how it
got there, and who put it there, and what I myself am going to do
with it, which is all that really concerns me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
greatly surprises me,&mdash;surprises me because one has such
strange preconceived notions about the Chinese,&mdash;by saying
that he considers that the young men at Oxford and Cambridge and
the boys at English schools learn much more than the young men
and the boys in China, for the simple reason that they are so
much more serious; though, every day that I am on board among
these childish, laughing, chattering, and hysterical people, I
realize how true this may be.</p>
<p>There are three young Chinese doctors on board, students and
business men, and the talk is well worth hearing: talk of things
which happened four thousand years ago,&mdash;for these people
seem to have a faculty for completely disregarding
time,&mdash;tales of the time of the Emperor Shun, whose two
wives wept themselves to death when he died, their tears falling
upon the young bamboo above his grave, the Hsian bamboo which
remains spotted to this day from the scalding drops which fell
upon it; tales of Tso-lu, the oldest town in China, founded by
the Emperor Hwan, who had gained his dominion by killing Chi-yu,
who in his <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>fighting made smoke screens, apparently much the same
as those used in the last war, to protect his men.&nbsp; Hwan
himself invented the compass in the shape of a little man, whose
finger always pointed to the south, seated in a tiny
carriage.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We are nearing Sydney, where I hope to pick up a boat for
Papua; but I shall hate to leave Mr. Wu and his friends with whom
I have spent enchanted hours in never-ending discussion of
philosophies and religions, speculations as to the future, talks
of the past.&nbsp; Of all they have told me, there is nothing
attracts me more than their description of Taoism, so that if
ever I can come to form any definite faith I think I shall be a
Taoist; for with three souls and seven sub-consciousnesses, and
ten ruling influences, how could one ever feel lonely?</p>
<p>Of all these souls and sub-consciousnesses and influences the
three souls alone proceed, in after life, to heaven, the seven
sub-consciousnesses accompanying the body into the grave; while,
if there be any man so wicked that he deserves to die, a holy
Taoist can accomplish his death by the simple process of drawing
away from him his three souls and his seven
sub-consciousnesses&mdash;or spirits, as they often call them,
puzzling me until <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>I find how sharply they differentiate between the soul
and the spirit.</p>
<p>The doctors talked continually and gravely of their
profession.&nbsp; The one whose words they most hung upon,
however, spoke&mdash;apart from his own language&mdash;only
Spanish, and thus I missed a great deal which I should have liked
to hear; though there were certain things, like their cure for
meningitis, which were explained to me, interesting me
immensely.&nbsp; It seems that the Chinese doctors have a horror
of our method of treating it with ice and cold-water bandages,
which they declare increases the mischief by hardening the
arteries.&nbsp; They themselves use everything that is possible
to make the patient perspire, immersing him in an atmosphere of
steam.&nbsp; This is very curious, for the native Tahitians also
treat this disease with heat, placing the two rinds of a divided
fresh, soft cocoanut round a child&rsquo;s head after immersing
the nut in boiling water; binding it about with many layers of
leaves to keep the heat in.&nbsp; The Chinese, like many native
people, treat blood-pressure by enriching the blood as much as
possible, so that it may flow more quickly.</p>
<p>The captain of the <i>Ling Nam</i> is quite young,&mdash;very
young indeed to be a captain,&mdash;tall and spare, handsome in a
sort of dashing way.&nbsp; He moves <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>quickly, often runs, talks
incessantly, talks of himself without ceasing; cannot cross the
deck without seeming to make a procession of one.&nbsp; Always,
always, we are in a position of terrible danger from which he
alone can save us.&nbsp; Either the ship will sink or be dashed
to pieces on a rock or captured by an uprising among the third-,
fourth-, and fifth-class passengers.&nbsp; They do, indeed, grow
increasingly restless, surging up on to the first deck, querulous
and loud-voiced, all their infantile smiles a thing of the
past,&mdash;though I suspect that they are merely hungry and in
need of a square meal, supposing that the bill of fare drops
through that second, third, fourth, and fifth, below what is
really inadequate to the first,&mdash;while the captain confronts
them with a pistol in each hand, his long legs wide apart like an
animated compass, his hair streaming in the wind.</p>
<p>This evening he rushed into the saloon where the European
passengers were playing bridge, and screamed into the ear of the
most elderly and nervous of them that we were now in the Tasman
Sea, the most dangerous part of the whole voyage, and it would be
a wonder if we got through.&nbsp; The first night out, going
through the narrows after leaving Auckland, he dragged me up on
the bridge in a thick darkness which could be felt, to <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>impress me
with a purely fictitious account of how the compasses had all
gone wrong, how he himself would not dare to leave the bridge for
a single moment&mdash;having but just left it for no other reason
than to see how easily I could be frightened.&nbsp; And never,
never, throughout the entire voyage, has he allowed us for one
single moment to forget that we are at the mercy of the most
mutinous crew, including the officers, the most bloodthirsty
steerage passengers upon the most unstable ship in the most
dangerous waters in the world; foretelling southerly busters and
cyclones from which we may deem ourselves fortunate to escape
alive, with sincere thanks to the Almighty for having created the
one man in the entire world capable of saving us.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sydney, after fifteen years; an immeasurably elongated Sydney,
running from bay to bay, from inlet to inlet, round one
promontory after another, in a wide ribbon of red-tiled roofs,
threaded in among masses of green trees, as beautiful a modern
city, in as beautiful a setting, as can well be imagined; and yet
bringing with it, to me at least, that exhausted and mazed
feeling, that sense of being nothing more than a mere pinch of
friable dust, to which conventional civilizations and great <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>cities
always reduce me.&nbsp; And in this state I shall remain until I
can, by some means or other, gather enough money to move on to
yet other islands, embrace afresh all that they mean to me of
delight and enchantment: an altogether apart world of flesh-white
sands and blazing sea; palm-trees, schooners, ketches: pearlers,
planters, and sea-captains; of aspirations, failures,
relinquishments, and dreams which broke one&rsquo;s heart while
one was among them and drag now at the strings of it with an
almost intolerable nostalgia; of a bronze-skinned people who are
innocent as we can never now be, guilty as we have never yet
been; people with their own ideals, their own traditions, so
entirely different from ours that we touch a new heaven and a new
hell in realizing them, a grown-upness which we have before never
known and a childishness which eludes our grasp.</p>
<p>All this and more; the very atmosphere of the little islands
of the South Seas: a sun which bakes to the bone, and an air like
a caress; a glow and wonder in the sky, and upon the sea and upon
the mountain-tops; color which runs itself in upon our mind like
a gleaming flood of jeweler&rsquo;s enamel, color piled upon
every wharf, spilling down upon every sandy shore where one makes
landfall.</p>
<p>Wharfs and landing-stages like rainbow <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>gardens
with girls&mdash;girls with silk and muslin dresses of every
light and delicate and vivid tint flounced to the waist as in
Tahiti; waving, flowing hair, and flowers&mdash;challenges to
love&mdash;behind each ear.&nbsp; Brilliant green and golden
oranges and mangoes and pomegranates.&nbsp; The flare of scarlet
flamboyant trees and purple Bougainvillea hanging in mantles from
the banyan trees which fringe the bays, backed with their
mountains, their blue and lavender peaks.</p>
<p>The dropping of the anchor outside new islands,&mdash;islands
and islands and islands, no two ever alike,&mdash;ever-changing
languages and ever-changing peoples; all in the little, small as
a jewel, so that it seems as though one were able to take it up
in the hollows of one&rsquo;s two hands, feel the warmth of it,
turning it, catching the glow upon it as upon a jewel.</p>
<p>That, for me, is life.</p>
