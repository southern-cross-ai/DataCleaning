The Van Normans</h3>

<p>The old Van Norman mansion was the finest house in Mapleton.
Well back from the road, it sat proudly among its finely kept lawns
and gardens, as if with a dignified sense of its own importance,
and its white, Colonial columns gleamed through the trees, like
sentinels guarding the entrance to the stately hall.</p>

<p>All Mapleton was proud of the picturesque old place, and it was
shown to visiting strangers with the same pride that the native
villagers pointed out the Memorial Library and the new church.</p>

<p>More than a half-century old, the patrician white house seemed
to glance coldly on the upstart cottages, whose inadequate pillars
supported beetling second stories, and whose spacious, filigreed
verandas left woefully small area for rooms inside the house.</p>

<p>The Van Norman mansion was not like that. It was a long
rectangle, and each of its four stories was a series of commodious,
well-shaped apartments.</p>

<p>And its owner, the beautiful Madeleine Van Norman, was the most
envied as well as the most admired young woman in the town.</p>

<p>Magnificent Madeleine, as she was sometimes called, was of the
haughty, imperious type which inspires admiration and respect
rather than love. An orphan and an heiress, she had lived all of
her twenty-two years of life in the old house, and since the death
of her uncle, two years before, had continued as mistress of the
place, ably assisted by a pleasant, motherly chaperon, a clever
social secretary, and a corps of capable servants.</p>

<p>The mansion itself and an income amply sufficient to maintain it
were already legally her own, but by the terms of her uncle's will
she was soon to come into possession of the bulk of the great
fortune he had left.</p>

<p>Madeleine was the only living descendant of old Richard Van
Norman, save for one distant cousin, a young man of a scapegrace
and ne'er-do-well sort, who of late years had lived abroad.</p>

<p>This young man's early life had been spent in Mapleton, but, his
fiery temper having brought about a serious quarrel with his uncle,
he had wisely concluded to take himself out of the way.</p>

<p>And yet Tom Willard was not of a quarrelsome disposition. His
bad temper was of the impulsive sort, roused suddenly, and as
quickly suppressed. Nor was it often in evidence. Good-natured,
easy-going Tom would put up with his uncle's criticism and
fault-finding for weeks at a time, and then, perhaps goaded beyond
endurance, he would fly into a rage and express himself in fluent
if rather vigorous English.</p>

<p>For Richard Van Norman had been by no means an easy man to live
with. And it was Tom's general amiability that had made him the
usual scapegoat for his uncle's ill temper. Miss Madeleine would
have none of it. Quite as dictatorial as the old man himself she
allowed no interference with her own plans and no criticism of her
own actions.</p>

<p>This had proved the right way to manage Mr. Van Norman, and he
had always acceded to Madeleine's requests or submitted to her
decrees without objection, though there had never been any
demonstration of affection between the two.</p>

<p>But demonstration was quite foreign to the nature of both uncle
and niece, and in truth they were really fond of each other in
their quiet, reserved way. Tom Willard was different. His affection
was of the honest and outspoken sort, and he made friends easily,
though he often lost them with equal rapidity.</p>

<p>On account, then, of his devotion to Madeleine, and his enmity
toward young Tom Willard, Richard Van Norman had willed the old
place to his niece, and had further directed that the whole of his
large fortune should be unrestrictedly bestowed upon her on her
wedding day, or on her twenty-third birthday, should she reach that
age unmarried. In event of her death before her marriage, and also
before her twenty-third birthday, the whole estate would go to Tom
Willard.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest reluctance that Richard Van Norman
decreed this, but a provision had to be made in case of Madeleine's
early death, and Willard was the only other natural heir. And now,
at twenty-two, Madeleine was on the eve of marriage to Schuyler
Carleton, a member of one of the oldest and best families of
Mapleton.</p>

<p>The village gossips were pleased to commend this union, as Mr.
Carleton was a man of irreproachable habits, and handsome enough to
appear well beside the magnificent Madeleine.</p>

<p>He was not a rich man, but, as her marriage would bring her
inheritance, they could rank among the millionaires of the day. Yet
there were those who feared for the future happiness of this
apparently ideal couple. Mrs. Markham, who was both housekeeper and
chaperon to her young charge, mourned in secret over the attitude
of the betrothed pair.</p>

<p>"He adores her, I'm sure," she said to herself, "but he is too
courtly and polished in his manner. I'd rather he would impulsively
caress her, or involuntarily call her by some endearing name than
to be always so exquisitely deferential and polite. And Madeleine
must love him, or why should she marry him? Yet she is so haughty
and formal, she might be a very duchess instead of a young American
girl. But that's Madeleine all over. I've never seen her exhibit
any real emotion over anything. Ah, well, I'm an old-fashioned
fool. Doubtless, they're cooing doves when alone together, but
their high-bred notions won't allow any sentiment shown before
other people. But I almost wish she were going to marry Tom. He has
sentiment and enthusiasm enough for two, and the relationship is so
distant it's not worth thinking about. Dear old Tom! He's the only
one who ever stirs Madeleine out of that dignified calm of
hers."</p>

<p>And that was true enough. Madeleine had inherited the Van Norman
traits of dignity and reserve to such an extent that it was
difficult for any one to be a really close friend.</p>

<p>She had, too, a strange little air of preoccupation, and even
when interested in a conversation would appear to look through or
beyond her companion in a way that was discouraging to the average
caller.</p>

<p>So Miss Van Norman was by no means a favorite with the Mapleton
young people in a personal sense, but socially she was their
leader, and to be on her invitation list was the highest aspiration
of the village "climbers."</p>

<p>And now that she was about to marry Schuyler Carleton, the event
of the wedding was the only thing talked of, thought of, or dreamed
of by Mapleton society.</p>

<p>Madeleine, who always kept in touch with Tom Willard by
correspondence, had written him of her approaching marriage, and he
had responded by coming at once to America to attend the
ceremony.</p>

<p>Relieved from the embarrassment of his uncle's presence, Tom was
his jovial self, and showed forth all the reprehensible
attractiveness which so often belongs to the scapegrace nature. He
sometimes quarreled with Madeleine over trifles, then, making up
the next minute, he would caress and pet her with the privileged
air of a relative.</p>

<p>He was glad to be back among the familiar scenes of Mapleton,
and he went about the town renewing old acquaintances and making
new ones, and charming all by his winning personality.</p>

<p>In less than a week he had more friends in the village than
Schuyler Carleton had ever made.</p>

<p>Carleton, though handsome and distinguished looking, was
absolutely without personal magnetism or charm, which traits were
found in abundance in Tom Willard.</p>

<p>The friends of Schuyler Carleton attributed his reserved, almost
repellent demeanor to shyness, and this was partly true. His
acquaintances said it was indifference, and this again, was partly
true. Then his enemies, of whom he had some, vowed that his cold,
curt manner of speech was merely snobbishness, and this was not
true at all.</p>

<p>His manner toward his fianc&eacute;e was all that the most
exacting could require in the matter of courtesy and punctilious
politeness. He was markedly undemonstrative in public, and if this
were true of his behavior when the two were alone, it was probably
because Madeleine herself neither inspired nor desired terms or
acts of endearment.</p>

<p>Tom's attitude toward Madeleine angered Carleton extremely, but
when he spoke to her on the subject he was gaily informed that the
matter of cousinly affection was outside the jurisdiction of a
fianc&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Tom, on his part, was desperately in love with Madeleine, and
had been for years. Repeatedly he had begged her to marry him, and
she knew in her heart that his plea was prompted by his love for
herself and not by any consideration of her fortune.</p>

<p>And yet, should she marry another, all hope of his uncle's money
would be forever lost to Tom Willard.</p>

<p>But prodigal and spendthrift that he was, if Tom felt any regret
at his vanishing fortunes, he showed no sign of it. Save for sudden
and often easily provoked bursts of temper, he was infectiously gay
and merry, and was the life of the house party already gathered
under Madeleine's roof.</p>

<p>The fact that Tom was staying at the Van Norman house, which of
course Carleton could not do, gave Willard an advantage over the
prospective bridegroom, of which he was by no means unconscious.
Partly to tease the imperturbable but jealous Carleton, and partly
because of his own affection for his cousin, Tom devoted himself
assiduously to Madeleine, especially when Carleton was present.</p>

<p>"You see, Maddy," Tom would say, "there are only a few days left
of our boy and girl chumminess. I fancy that after you are married,
Schuyler won't let me speak to you, save in most formal terms, so I
must see all I can of you now."</p>

<p>Then he would tuck her arm through his own, and take her for a
stroll in the grounds, and Carleton, coming to search for her,
would find them cosily chatting in a secluded arbor, or drifting
lazily in a canoe on the tiny, lily-padded lake.</p>

<p>These things greatly annoyed Schuyler Carleton, but remonstrance
was never an easy task for him, nor did it ever affect Madeleine
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I wish, Madeleine," he had said one day, when he had waited two
hours for her to return from a drive with Tom, "that you would have
a little regard for appearances, if you have none for my wishes. It
is not seemly for my betrothed wife to be driving all over the
country with another man."</p>

<p>Magnificent Madeleine looked straight at him, tilting her head
back slightly to look beneath her half-closed lids.</p>

<p>"It is not seemly," she said, "for my betrothed husband to imply
that I could be at fault in a matter of propriety or punctilio.
That is not possible."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, and his eyes gleamed with admiration
of her glorious beauty and imperious manner. "Forgive me,&mdash;you
are indeed right."</p>

<p>Though Schuyler Carleton may not have been lavish of affection,
he begrudged no admiration to the splendid woman he had won.</p>

<p>And yet, had he but known it, the apparently scornful and
haughty girl was craving a more tender and gentle love, and would
gladly have foregone his admiration to have received more
affection.</p>

<p>"But it will come," Madeleine thought to herself. "I am not of
the 'clinging vine' type, I know; but after we are married, surely
Schuyler will be less formally polite, and more,&mdash;well,&mdash;
chummy."</p>

<p>Yet Madeleine herself was chummy with nobody save Tom.</p>

<p>They two were always chatting and laughing together, and though
they differed sometimes, and even quarrelled, it was quickly made
up, and forgotten in a new subject of merry discussion.</p>

<p>But, after all, they rarely quarrelled except regarding
Madeleine's approaching marriage.</p>

<p>"Don't throw yourself away on that iceberg, Maddy," Tom would
plead. "He's a truly fine man, I know, but he can't make you
happy."</p>

<p>"How absurd you are, Tom! Give me credit, please, for knowing my
own mind, at least. I love Schuyler Carleton, and I am proud that
he is to be my husband. He is the finest man I have ever known in
every way, and I am a fortunate girl to be chosen by such a
man."</p>

<p>"Oho, Maddy! Don't do the humble; it doesn't suit you at all.
You are the type who ought to have 'kings and crown princes at your
feet.' And Carleton is princely enough in his effects, but he's by
no means at your feet."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" exclaimed Madeleine angrily.</p>

<p>"Just what I say. Schuyler Carleton admires you greatly, but he
doesn't love you&mdash;at least, not as I do!"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Tom. Naturally you know nothing about Mr.
Carleton's affection for me&mdash;he does not proclaim it from the
housetops. And I desire you not to speak of it again."</p>

<p>"Why should I speak of what doesn't exist? Forgive me, Maddy,
but I love you so myself, it drives me frantic to see that man
treating you so coolly."</p>

<p>"He doesn't treat me coolly. Or, if he does, it's because I
don't wish for tender demonstrations before other people. I'm fond
of you, Tom, as you know, but I won't allow even you to criticise
the man I am about to marry."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, marry him, then, and a precious unhappy life
you'll lead with him,&mdash;and I know why."</p>

<p>Madeleine turned on him, her eyes blazing with anger.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Explain that last remark of yours."</p>

<p>"Small need! You know why as well as I do;" and Tom pushed his
hands into his pockets and strode away, whistling, well knowing
that he had roused his cousin's even temper at last.</p>

<p>In addition to some of her Mapleton friends, Madeleine had
invited two girls from New York to be her bridesmaids. Kitty French
and Molly Gardner had already come and were staying at the Van
Norman house the few days that would intervene before the
wedding.</p>

<p>Knowing Madeleine well, as they did, they had not expected
confidence from her, nor did they look forward to cosy, romantic
boudoir chats, such as many girls would enjoy.</p>

<p>But neither had they expected the peculiar constraint that
seemed to hang over all the members of the household.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham had been so long housekeeper, and even companion,
for Madeleine that she was not looked upon as a servant, and to her
Kitty French put a few discreet questions regarding the exceeding
reserve of Mr. Carleton.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss French," said the good woman, looking sadly
disturbed. "I love Madeleine as I would my own child. I know she
adores Mr. Carleton,&mdash;and&mdash;yes, I know he greatly admires
her,&mdash;and yet there is something wrong. I can't express
it&mdash;it's merely a feeling,&mdash;an intuition, but there is
something wrong."</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Willard is in love with Maddy," suggested Miss
French.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that They've always had a cousinly affection for
each other, and,&mdash;yes, Tom is in love with her,&mdash;but what
I mean is aside from all that. The real reason that Madeleine
flirts with Tom&mdash;for she does flirt with him-&mdash;is to
pique Mr. Carleton. There! I've said more than I meant to, but
you're too good a friend to let it make any trouble, and, anyway,
in a few days they will be married, and then I'm sure it will be
all right,&mdash;I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Like many people, Mrs. Markham emphasized by repetition a
statement of whose truth she was far from sure.</p>

<h3 align="center">II<a name="II" id="II"></a><br>
Miss Morton Arrives</h3>

<p>The day before the wedding the old house was a pleasant scene of
bustle and confusion.</p>

<p>Professional decorators were in charge of the great
drawing-room, building a canopy of green vines and flowers, beneath
which the bridal pair should stand the next day at high noon.</p>

<p>This work was greatly hindered by a bevy of young people who
thought they were helping.</p>

<p>At last, noting a look of dumb exasperation on the face of one
of the florist's men, Molly Gardner exclaimed, "I don't believe our
help is needed here; come on, Kitty, let's go in the library and
wait for tea-time."</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock, and the girls found most of the
house guests already assembled in the library, awaiting the arrival
of the tea-tray.</p>

<p>Several other young people were there also, most of them being
those who were to be of the wedding cortege next day.</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden, who was to be best man, had just come from New
York, and had dropped in to see Miss Van Norman.</p>

<p>Although he was an old friend of Carleton's, Madeleine did not
know him very well, and though she made him welcome, it was with
that coldly formal air that did not greatly attract the young man,
but he could not fail to be impressed by her great beauty.</p>

<p>"Lucky fellow, Carleton," he said to Tom Willard. "Why, that
woman would create a sensation in any great city in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is too handsome to live all her life in a small
village," agreed Tom. "I think they intend to travel a great
deal."</p>

<p>"An heiress, too, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has all the desirable traits a woman can possess."</p>

<p>"All?" Fessenden's tone was quizzical.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tom sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing; only, if I were to marry, I should prefer a little
more softness of nature."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's only her manner. My cousin is most sweet and
womanly, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she is," returned Fessenden, who was a bit ashamed of
his outspokenness; "and she's getting a sterling good fellow for a
husband."</p>

<p>"She is so," said Tom, heartily, which was kind of him,
considering his own opinion of Carleton.</p>

<p>And then both men strolled over to where Madeleine sat at the
tea-table. She was reading a telegram that had just been brought to
her, and she laughingly explained to Tom that it meant a bother for
him.</p>

<p>"Miss Morton has concluded to come to the wedding, after all,"
she said. "She wrote me that she wouldn't come, but she has changed
her mind, it seems. Now, it does sound ridiculous, I know, but in
this big house there isn't a room left for her but the one you
have, Tom. You see, one bedroom is used for a 'present room,' one
is reserved for Schuyler tomorrow, the bridesmaids have another,
and except for our own rooms, and those already occupied by guests,
there are no more. I hate to ask you, Tom, but could you go to the
Inn?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Maddy dear; anything to oblige. But it does seem too bad
to turn me out of your house the very last day that your
hospitality is all your own to offer. Tomorrow the grand Seigneur
will be master here, and my timid little Madeleine can no longer
call her soul her own."</p>

<p>This reference to the tall and stately mistress of the house
raised a general laugh, but Madeleine did not join in it.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Tom," she said earnestly, as she looked again at
the telegram she was holding, "but Miss Morton was an old friend of
Uncle Richard's, and as she wants to come here I can't turn her
away. And unless you give her your room, there is no other."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Madeleine! I'm only joking. Of course I'll go to the
hotel. Only too glad to accommodate Miss Morton. Forget it, girl; I
assure you I don't mind a bit. I'll pack up a few traps after
dinner and skip down to the picturesque, if rather ostentatious,
Mapleton Inn."</p>

<p>As Tom spoke he put his arm carelessly round Madeleine's
shoulders, and though scarcely more than a cousinly caress, it was
unfortunate that Schuyler Carleton should enter the room at that
moment. A lightning glance flashed between the two men, and as Tom
moved away from Madeleine with a slightly embarrassed shrug of his
shoulders, Carleton's face grew so stern that an uncomfortable
silence fell upon the guests.</p>

<p>However, the arrival of the tea-tray saved the situation, and
Madeleine at once busied herself in the pretty occupation of
serving tea to her guests.</p>

<p>With an air of jealous proprietorship, Carleton moved toward her
and, looking handsome, though sulky, stood by Willard with folded
arms, as if on guard.</p>

<p>Urged on by a daredevil spirit of mischief, and perhaps
remembering that Madeleine would soon be beyond his reach as
Carleton's wife, Tom also moved toward her from the other side.
Endeavoring to treat the situation lightly, Madeleine held up a
newly-filled teacup.</p>

<p>"Who will have this?" she asked gaily.</p>

<p>"I will!" declared Carleton and Tom at the same time, and each
held out a hand.</p>

<p>Madeleine looked at them both smilingly.</p>

<p>Carleton's face was white and set; he was evidently making a
serious matter of the trifling episode.</p>

<p>Tom, on the contrary, was smiling broadly, and was quite
evidently enjoying his rival's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I shall give it to you, because you look so pleasant," declared
Madeleine, handing the cup to Tom. "Now, Schuyler, smile prettily
and you may have one, too."</p>

<p>But Carleton would not fall in with her light mood.</p>

<p>Bending a little, he said in a tense voice, "I will leave you to
your cousin now. Tomorrow I shall assert my claim."</p>

<p>Though not rude in themselves, the words were accompanied by a
harsh and disdainful glance that made several of the onlookers
wonder what sort of a life the haughty Madeleine would lead with
such a coldly tyrannical husband.</p>

<p>"The brute!" said Tom, under his breath, as Carleton left the
room. "Never mind, Maddy, the old Turk has left you to me for this
evening, and we'll take him at his word."</p>

<p>Suddenly Madeleine's mood changed to one of utter gaiety. She
smiled impartially on all, she jested with the girls, she bewitched
the young men with her merry banter, and she almost seemed to be
flirting with Tom Willard. But he was her cousin, after all, and
much is forgiven a bride-to-be on her wedding eve.</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden looked at Miss Van Norman with a puzzled air.
He couldn't seem to understand her, and was glad when by chance the
two were left comparatively alone for a few moments'
conversation.</p>

<p>"A great responsibility devolves on the best man, Miss Van
Norman," he said, in response to a chaffing remark of hers. "I
suppose that tomorrow I shall be general director-in-chief, and if
anything should go wrong, I shall be blamed."</p>

<p>"But nothing will go wrong," said Madeleine, gaily, "and then,
think how you'll be praised!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you won't be here to hear the praise heaped upon me, so
what's the use?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall be gone forever," said Madeleine, putting on one of
her faraway looks. "I never want to come back to Mapleton. I hate
it!"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Van Norman! You want to desert this beautiful old
house? Schuyler can never find you a home so comfortable and
attractive in every way."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I want to go far away from Mapleton to live.
We're going to travel for a year, any way, but when we do settle
down, it will be abroad, I hope."</p>

<p>"You surprise me. Schuyler didn't tell me this. We've been chums
so long, that I usually know of his plans. But, of course, getting
married changes all that."</p>

<p>"You're a very intimate friend of Mr. Carleton's, aren't you?"
said Madeleine, with a strange note of wistfulness in her
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; I only thought&mdash;I mean, do you
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rob Fessenden was thrilled by the plaintive expression on the
beautiful face, and suddenly felt a great desire to help this girl,
who was seemingly so far above and beyond all need of help, and yet
was surely about to ask his aid, or at least his sympathy.</p>

<p>"Don't hesitate," he said gently; "what is it, Miss Van Norman?
I want to be as firm a friend of yours as I am of Schuyler's, so
please say what you wish to."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't," Madeleine whispered, and her voice was
almost a moan.</p>

<p>"Please," again urged Fessenden.</p>

<p>"Do you know Dorothy Burt?" Madeleine then broke out, as if the
words were fairly forced from her.</p>

<p>"No," said Fessenden, amazed; "I never heard the name before.
Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Hush! She's nobody&mdash;less than nobody. Don't mention her to
me ever again&mdash;nor to any one else. Ah, here comes Miss
Morton."</p>

<p>As Fessenden watched Madeleine, she changed swiftly from a
perturbed, troubled girl to a courteous, polished hostess.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Morton," she said, advancing to meet her newest
guest, "how kind of you to come to me at this time."</p>

<p>"I didn't come exactly out of kindness," said Miss Morton, "but
because I desired to come. I hope you are quite well. Will you give
me some tea?"</p>

<p>Miss Morton was a tall, angular lady, with gray hair and sharp,
black eyes. She seemed to bite off her words at the ends of her
short sentences, and had a brisk, alert manner that was, in a way,
aggressive.</p>

<p>"An eccentric," Rob Fessenden thought, as he looked at her, and
wondered why she was there at all.</p>

<p>"An old sweetheart of Mr. Richard Van Norman, I believe," said
Kitty French, when he questioned her. "They were once engaged and
then quarrelled and broke it off, and neither of them lived happily
ever after."</p>

<p>"As the Carletons will," said Fessenden, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kitty slowly, "as the Carletons will&mdash;I hope.
You know Mr. Carleton awfully well, don't you? Are you sure he will
make our Maddy happy, Mr. Fessenden?"</p>

<p>"I think so;" and Fessenden tried to speak casually. "He is not
an emotional man, or one greatly given to sentiment, but I judge
she is not that sort either."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she is! Maddy is apparently cold and cynical, but she
isn't really so a bit. But she perfectly adores him, and if they're
not happy, it won't be her fault."</p>

<p>"Nor will it be his," said Fessenden, warmly defending his
absent friend. "Carleton's an old trump. There's no finer man in
the world, and any woman ought to be happy with him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that," said Kitty, with a little sigh
of relief. "Do look at that funny Miss Morton! She seems to be
scolding Madeleine. I'm sorry she came. She doesn't seem very
attractive. But perhaps it's because she was crossed in love and it
made her queer."</p>

<p>"Or she was queered in love and it made her cross," laughed
Fessenden. "Well, I must go, now, and look up Carleton. Poor old
boy, he was a little miffed when he went away."</p>

<p>After tea all the callers departed, and those who were house
guests went to their rooms to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>Tom Willard, with great show of burlesque regret and tearful
farewells, went to the hotel, that Miss Morton might have the room
he had been occupying.</p>

<p>He promised to return for dinner, and gaily blew kisses to
Madeleine as with his traps he was driven down the avenue.</p>

<p>At dinner, Schuyler Carleton's place was vacant. It had been
arranged next to Madeleine's, and when fifteen minutes after the
dinner hour he had not arrived, she haughtily accepted Tom
Willard's arm and led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>But having reached the table, she directed Tom to take his
rightful seat, at some distance from her own, and Carleton's chair
remained empty at Madeleine's side.</p>

<p>At first this was uncomfortably evident, but Madeleine was in
gay spirits, and soon the whole party followed her lead, and the
conversation was general and in a merry key.</p>

<p>The young hostess had never looked more regally beautiful. Her
dark hair, piled high on her head, was adorned with a dainty
ornament which, though only a twisted ribbon, was shaped like a
crown, and gave her the effect of an imperious queen. Her low-cut
gown of pale yellow satin was severe of line and accented her
stately bearing, while her exquisitely modelled neck and shoulders
were as white and pure as those of a marble statue. Save for a
double row of pearls around her throat, she wore no ornaments, but
on the morrow Carleton's gift of magnificent diamonds would grace
her bridal costume. The combination of haughty imperial beauty and
a dazzling witchery of mood was irresistible, and the men and girls
alike realized that never before had Madeleine seemed so
wonderful.</p>

<p>After the dessert was placed on the table, Willard could stand
it no longer, and, leaving his own place, he calmly appropriated
Carleton's vacant chair.</p>

<p>Madeleine did not reprove him, and Kitty French took occasion to
whisper to her neighbor:</p>

<p>"'T were better by far to have matched our fair cousin to brave
Lochinvar.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham overheard the quotation, and a look of pain came
into her eyes. But it was all too late now, and to-morrow Madeleine
would be irrevocably Schuyler Carleton's wife.</p>

<p>After dinner coffee was served in the cosy library. Madeleine
preferred this room to the more elaborately furnished drawing-room,
and to-night her word was law.</p>

<p>But suddenly her mood changed. For no apparent reason her gay
spirits vanished, her smile faded away, and a pathetic droop curved
the corners of her beautiful mouth.</p>

<p>At about ten o'clock she said abruptly, though gently, "I wish
you'd all go to bed. Unless you girls get some beauty sleep, you
won't look pretty at my wedding to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I'm quite ready to go," declared Kitty French with some tact,
for she saw that Madeleine was nervous and strung up to a high
tension.</p>

<p>"I, too," exclaimed Molly Gardner, and the two girls said
good-night and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Two or three young men who had been dinner guests also made
their adieux, and Tom Willard said, "Well, I may as well toddle to
my comforts of home, as understood by a country innkeeper."</p>

<p>Madeleine said good-night to him kindly enough, but without jest
or gaiety. Tom looked at her curiously for a moment, and then,
gently kissing her hand, he went away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, having seen Miss Morton comfortably installed in
what had been Tom's room, returned to the library to offer her
services to Madeleine.</p>

<p>But the girl only thanked her, saying, "There is nothing you can
do to-night. I want to be alone for an hour or two. I will stay
here in the library for a time, and I'd like to have you send
Cicely to me."</p>

<p>A few moments later Cicely Dupuy came in, bringing some letters
and papers. She was Miss Van Norman's private secretary, and
admirably did she fill the post. Quick-witted, clever, deft of hand
and brain, she answered notes, kept accounts, and in many ways made
herself invaluable to her employer.</p>

<p>Moreover, Madeleine liked her. Cicely was of a charming
personality. Small, fair, with big, childish blue eyes and a
rose-leaf skin, she was a pretty picture to look at.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Madeleine, "and make a little list of some
final matters I want you to attend to to-morrow."</p>

<p>Cicely sat down, and, taking pencil and tablet from the library
table, made the lists as Madeleine directed. This occupied but a
short time, and then Miss Van Norman said wearily:</p>

<p>"You may go now, Cicely. Go to bed at once, dear. You will have
much to do to-morrow. And please tell Marie I shall not need her
services to-night. She may go to her room. I shall sit here for an
hour or more, and I will answer these notes. I wish to be
alone."</p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Van Norman," said Cicely, and, taking the lists
she had made, she went softly from the room.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br>
A Cry In The Night</h3>

<p>"Help!"</p>

<p>The loud cry of a single word was not repeated, but repetition
was unnecessary, for the sound rang through the old Van Norman
house, and carried its message of fear and horror to all, awake or
sleeping, within its walls.</p>

<p>It was about half-past eleven that same night, and Cicely Dupuy,
still fully dressed, flew from her bedroom out into the hall.</p>

<p>Seeing a light downstairs, and hearing the servants' bells, one
after another, as if rung by a frantic hand, she hesitated a moment
only, and then ran downstairs.</p>

<p>In the lower hall Schuyler Carleton, with a dazed expression on
his white, drawn face, was uncertainly pushing various electric
buttons which, in turn, flashed lights on or off, or rang bells in
distant parts of the house.</p>

<p>For a moment Cicely stared straight at the man.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, their gaze seemed to concentrate, and they stood
motionless, as if spellbound.</p>

<p>This crisis was broken in upon by Marie, Madeleine's French
maid, who came running downstairs in a hastily donned negligee.</p>

<p><em>"</em><em>Mon Dieu!"</em> she cried. <em>"Ou est
Mademoiselle?"</em></p>

<p>With a start, Carleton turned from Cicely, and still with that
dazed look on his face, he motioned Marie toward the wide doorway
of the library. The girl took a step toward the threshold, and
then, with a shriek, paused, and ventured no further.</p>

<p>Cicely, as if impelled by an unseen force, slowly turned and
followed Marie's movements, and as the girl screamed, Cicely
grasped her tightly by the arm, and the two stood staring in at the
library door.</p>

<p>What they saw was Madeleine Van Norman, seated in a chair at the
library table. Her right arm was on the table, and her head, which
had fallen to one side, was supported by her right shoulder. Her
eyes were partly closed, and her lips were parted, and the position
of the rigid figure left no need for further evidence that this was
not a natural sleep.</p>

<p>But further evidence there was. Miss Van Norman still wore her
yellow satin gown, but the beautiful embroidered bodice was stained
a dull red, and a crimson stream was even then spreading its way
down the shimmering breadths of the trailing skirt.</p>

<p>On the table, near the outstretched white hand, lay a Venetian
dagger. This dagger was well known to the onlookers. It had lain on
the library table for many years, and though ostensibly for the
purpose of a paper-cutter, it was rarely used as such. Its edges
were too sharp to cut paper satisfactorily, and, moreover, it was a
wicked-looking affair, and many people had shuddered as they
touched it. It had a history, too, and Richard Van Norman used to
tell his guests of dark deeds in which the dagger had taken part
while it was still in Italy.</p>

<p>Madeleine herself had had a horror of the weapon, though she had
often admitted the fascination of its marvellous workmanship, and
had said upon several occasions that the thing fairly hypnotized
her, and some day she should kill herself or somebody else with
it.</p>

<p>From an instinctive sense of duty, Marie started forward, as if
to help her mistress, then with a convulsive shudder she screamed
again and clasped her hands before her eyes to shut out the awful
sight.</p>

<p>Cicely, too, moved slowly toward the silent figure, then turned
and again gazed steadfastly at Schuyler Carleton.</p>

<p>There must have been interrogation in her eyes, for the man
pointed toward the table, and Cicely looked again, to notice there
a bit of paper with writing on it.</p>

<p>She made no motion toward it, but the expression on her face
changed to one of bewildered surprise. Before she had time to
speak, however, the other people of the house all at once began to
gather in the hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham came first, and though when she saw Madeleine she
turned very white and seemed about to faint, she bravely went at
once toward the girl, and gently tried to raise the fallen
head.</p>

<p>She felt a firm grasp on her shoulder, and turned to see Miss
Morton, with a stern, set face, at her side.</p>

<p>"Don't touch her," said Miss Morton, in a whisper. "Telephone
for a doctor quickly."</p>

<p>"But she's dead," declared Mrs. Markham, at the same time
bursting into violent sobs.</p>

<p>"We do not know; we hope not," went on Miss Morton, and without
another word she led Mrs. Markham to a sofa, and sat her down
rather suddenly, and then went herself straight to the
telephone.</p>

<p>As she reached it she paused only to inquire the name of the
family physician.</p>

<p>Harris, the butler, with difficulty articulated the name of
Doctor Hills and his telephone number, and without further inquiry
Miss Morton called for him.</p>

<p>"Is this Doctor Hills?" she said when her call was answered.
"Yes; this is the Van Norman house. Come here at once. . . . No
matter; you must come at once&mdash;it is very important&mdash;a
matter of life and death. . . . I am Miss Morton. I am in charge
here. Yes, come immediately! Good-by."</p>

<p>Miss Morton hung up the receiver and turned to the frightened
group of servants.</p>

<p>"You can do nothing," she said, "and you may as well return to
your rooms. Harris may stay, and one of the parlor maids."</p>

<p>Miss Morton had an imperious air, and instinctively the servants
obeyed her.</p>

<p>But Cicely Dupuy was not so ready to accept the dictum of a
stranger. She stepped forward and, facing Miss Morton, said
quietly, "Mrs. Markham is housekeeper, as well as Miss Van Norman's
chaperon. The servants are accustomed to take their orders from
her."</p>

<p>Miss Morton returned Cicely's direct gaze. "You see Mrs.
Markham," she said, pointing to the sofa, where that lady had
entirely collapsed, and, with her head in a pillow, was shaking
with convulsive sobs. "She is for the moment quite incapable of
giving orders. As the oldest person present, and as a life-long
friend of Mr. Richard Van Norman, I shall take the liberty of
directing affairs in the present crisis." Then, in a softer tone
and with a glance toward Madeleine, Miss Morton continued, "I trust
in view of the awfulness of the occasion you will give me your
sympathy and cooperation, that we may work in harmony."</p>

<p>Cicely gave Miss Morton a curious glance that might have meant
almost anything, but with a slight inclination of her head she said
only, "Yes, madam."</p>

<p>Then Kitty French and Molly Gardner came downstairs and stood
trembling on the threshold.</p>

<p>"What is it?" whispered Kitty. "What's the matter with
Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"Something dreadful has happened," said Miss Morton, meeting
them at the door. "I have telephoned for Doctor Hills and he will
be here soon. Until then we can do nothing."</p>

<p>"But we can try to help Maddy," exclaimed Kitty, starting toward
the still figure by the table. "Oh, is she hurt? I thought she had
fainted!"</p>

<p>As the two girls saw the dread sight, Miss Gardner fainted
herself, and Miss Morton bade Marie, who stood shivering in the
hall, take care of her.</p>

<p>Relieved at having something to do, Marie shook the girl and
dashed water in her face until she regained consciousness, the
others, meanwhile, paying little attention.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton stood leaning against the doorpost, his eyes
fixed on Madeleine's tragic figure, while Kitty French, who had
dropped into a chair, sat with her hands tightly clasped, also
gazing at the sad picture.</p>

<p>Although it seemed hours to those who awaited him, it was but a
few moments before the doctor came.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills was a clean-cut, alert-looking young man, and his
quick eyes seemed to take in every detail of the scene at a
glance.</p>

<p>He went straight to the girl at the table and bent over her.
Only the briefest examination was necessary before he said gently,
"She is quite dead. She has been stabbed with this dagger. It
entered a large blood vessel just over her heart, and she bled to
death. Who killed her?"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke his eye fell on the written paper which lay on
the table. With one of his habitually quick gestures he snatched it
up and read it to himself, while a look of great surprise dawned on
his face. Immediately he read it aloud:</p>

<p class="note">I am wholly miserable, and unless the clouds lift I
must end my life. I love S., but he does not love me.</p>

<p>After he finished reading, Doctor Hills stood staring at the
paper, and looked utterly perplexed.</p>

<p>"I should have said it was not a suicide," he declared, "but
this message seems to indicate that it is. Is this written in Miss
Van Norman's hand?" Miss Morton, who stood at the doctor's side,
took the paper and scrutinized it.</p>

<p>"It is," she said. "Yes, certainly that is Miss Van Norman's
writing. I had a letter from her only a few days ago, and I
recognize it perfectly."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Mrs. Markham, in a determined, though
rather timid way. "I am more familiar with Madeleine's writing than
a stranger can possibly be."</p>

<p>Miss Morton handed the paper to the housekeeper without a word,
while the doctor, waiting, wondered why these two women seemed so
out of sympathy with each other.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is surely Madeleine's writing," agreed Mrs. Markham,
her glasses dropping off as her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose she killed herself, poor girl," said the doctor.
"She must have been desperate, indeed, for it was a strong blow
that drove the steel in so deeply. Who first discovered her
here?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Schuyler Carleton, stepping forward. His face was
almost as white as the dead girl's, and he was scarcely able to
make his voice heard. "I came in with a latch-key, and found her
here, just as you see her now."</p>

<p>As Carleton spoke Cicely Dupuy stared at him with that curious
expression that seemed to show something more than grief and
horror. Her emotional bewilderment was not surprising in view of
the awful situation, but her look was a strange one, and for some
reason it greatly disconcerted the man.</p>

<p>None of this escaped the notice of Doctor Hills. Looking
straight at Carleton, but with a kindly expression replacing the
stern look on his face, he went on:</p>

<p>"And when you came in, was Miss Van Norman just as we see her
now?"</p>

<p>"Practically," said Carleton. "I couldn't believe her dead. And
I tried to rouse her. Then I saw the dagger on the floor at her
feet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the floor?" interrupted Doctor Hills.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carleton, whose agitation was increasing, and who
had sunk into a chair because of sheer inability to stand. "It was
on the floor at her feet&mdash;right at her feet. I picked it up,
and there was blood on it&mdash;there is blood on it&mdash;and I
laid it on the table. And then I saw the paper&mdash;the paper that
says she killed herself. And then&mdash;and then I turned on the
lights and rang the servants' bells, and Cicely&mdash;Miss
Dupuy&mdash;came, and the others, and&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton had with difficulty concluded his narration,
and he sat clenching his hands and biting his lips as if at the
very limit of his powers of endurance.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills again glanced round the assembly in that quick way
of his, and said:</p>

<p>"Did any of you have reason to think Miss Van Norman had any
thought of taking her own life?"</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke, and then Kitty French, who, in a
despairing, miserable way, was huddled in the depths of a great
arm-chair, said:</p>

<p>"I have heard Madeleine say that some time she would kill
herself with that horrid old dagger. I wish I had stolen it and
buried it long ago!"</p>

<p>Doctor Hills turned to Mrs. Markham. "Did you have any reason to
fear this?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "and I do not think Madeleine meant she would
voluntarily use that dagger. She only meant she had a superstitious
dread of the thing."</p>

<p>"Do you understand her reference to her own unhappiness in this
bit of writing?" went on the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do," said Mrs. Markham in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That is enough for the present," said the doctor, as if to
interrupt further confidences. "Although it is difficult to believe
a stab of that nature could be self-inflicted, it is possible, and
this communication seems to leave no room for doubt.</p>

<p>"Now, the law of New Jersey requires that in case of a death not
by natural means the county physician shall be summoned, and
further proceedings are entirely at his discretion. I shall
therefore be obliged to send for Doctor Leonard before disturbing
the body in any way. He will probably not arrive in less than an
hour or so, and I would advise that you ladies retire. You can of
course do nothing to help, and as I shall remain in charge, you may
as well get what rest you can during the night."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your consideration, Doctor Hills," said Mrs.
Markham, who seemed to have recovered her calmness, "but I prefer
to stay here. I could not rest after this awful shock, and I cannot
stay away from Madeleine."</p>

<p>Kitty French and Molly Gardner, who, clasped in each other's
arms, were shivering with excitement and grief, begged to be
allowed to stay, too, but Doctor Hills peremptorily ordered them to
go to their rooms. Cicely Dupuy was allowed to stay, as in her
position of social secretary she might know much of Madeleine's
private affairs. For the same reason Marie was detained, while
Doctor Hills asked her a few questions.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton sat rigidly in his chair, as immovable as a
statue. This man puzzled Doctor Hills. And yet it was surely shock
enough almost to unhinge a man's brain thus to find his intended
bride the night before his wedding.</p>

<p>But Carleton seemed absorbed in emotions other than those of
grief. Though his face was impassive, his eyes darted about the
room looking at one after another of the shocked and terrified
group, returning always to the still figure at the table, and as
quickly turning his gaze away, as if the sight were unbearable, as
indeed it was.</p>

<p>He seemed like a man stunned with the awfulness of the tragedy,
and yet conscious of a care, a responsibility, which he could not
shake off.</p>

<p>If, inadvertently, his eyes met those of Miss Dupuy, he shifted
his gaze immediately. If by chance he encountered Mrs. Markham's
sad glance, he turned away, unable to bear it. In a word, he was
like a man at the limit of his endurance, and seemed veritably on
the verge of collapse.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br>
Suicide Or&mdash;?</h3>

<p>Miss Morton, also, seemed to have distracting thoughts. She sat
down on the sofa beside Mrs. Markham, then she jumped up suddenly
and started for the door, only to turn about and resume her seat on
the sofa. Here she sat for a few moments apparently in deep
thought. Then she rose, and slowly stalked from the room and went
upstairs.</p>

<p>After a few moments, Marie, the French maid, also rose and
silently left the room.</p>

<p>Having concluded it was a case for the county physician, Doctor
Hills apparently considered that his personal responsibility was at
an end, and he sat quietly awaiting the coming of his
colleague.</p>

<p>After a time, Miss Morton returned, and again took her seat on
the sofa. She looked excited and a little flurried, but strove to
appear calm.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful hour. Only rarely any one spoke, and though
glances sometimes shot from the eyes of one to the eyes of another,
each felt his gaze oftenest impelled toward that dread, beautiful
figure by the table.</p>

<p>At last Schuyler Carleton, with an evident effort, said
suddenly, "Oughtn't we to send for Tom Willard?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham gave a start. "Of course we must," she said. "Poor
Tom! He must be told. Who will tell him?"</p>

<p>"I will," volunteered Miss Morton, and Doctor Hills looked up,
amazed at her calm tone. This woman puzzled him, and he could not
understand her continued attempts at authority in a household where
she was a comparative stranger. And yet might it not be merely a
kind consideration for those who were nearer and dearer to the
principals of this awful tragedy?</p>

<p>But even as he thought this over, Miss Morton had gone to the
telephone, her heavy silk gown rustling as she crossed the room,
and her every movement assertive of her own importance.</p>

<p>Calling up the Mapleton Inn, she succeeded, after several
attempts, in rousing some of its occupants, and finally was in
communication with young Willard himself. She did not tell him of
the tragedy, but only asked him to come over to the house at once,
as something serious had happened, and returned to her seat with a
murmured observation that Tom would arrive as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Again the little group lapsed into silence. Cicely Dupuy was
very nervous, and kept picking at her handkerchief, quite
unconscious that she was ruining its delicate lace edge.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills glanced furtively from one to another. Many things
puzzled him, but most of all he was at a loss to understand the
suicide of this beautiful girl on the very eve of her wedding.</p>

<p>At last Tom Willard came.</p>

<p>Miss Morton met him at the door, and took him into the
drawing-room before he could turn toward the library.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton's frantic touches on various electric buttons
had turned on all the lights in the drawing-room. As no one had
noticed this, the great apartment had remained illuminated as if
for a festivity, and the soft, bright lights fell on the floral
bower and the elaborate decorations that had been arranged for the
wedding day.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Tom, his own face white with an impending
sense of dread as he looked into Miss Morton's eyes.</p>

<p>As gently as possible, but in her own straightforward and
inevitably somewhat abrupt way, Miss Morton told him.</p>

<p>"I want to warn you," she said, "to prepare for a shock, and I
think it kinder to tell you the truth at once. Your cousin
Madeleine&mdash;Miss Van Norman&mdash;has taken her own life."</p>

<p>"What?" Tom almost shouted the word, and his face showed an
absolutely uncomprehending amazement.</p>

<p>"She killed herself to-night," Miss Morton went on, whose
efforts were now directed toward making the young man understand,
rather than towards sparing his feelings.</p>

<p>But Tom could not seem to grasp it. "What do you mean?" he said,
catching her by both arms. "Madeleine? Killed herself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Morton, shaken out of her own calm by Tom's
excited voice. "In the library, after we had all gone to bed, she
stabbed herself with that horrible paper-cutter thing. Did you know
she was unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Unhappy? No; why should she be? Tomorrow was to have been her
wedding day!"</p>

<p>"To-day," corrected Miss Morton. "It is already the day on which
our dear Madeleine was to have become a bride. And instead&mdash;"
Glancing around the brilliant room and at the bridal bower, Miss
Morton's composure gave way entirely, and she sobbed hysterically.
At this Cicely Dupuy came across from the library. Putting her arm
around Miss Morton, she led the sobbing woman away, and without a
word to Tom Willard gave him a glance which seemed to say that he
must look out for himself, for her duty was to attend Miss
Morton.</p>

<p>As the two women left the drawing-room Tom followed them. He
walked slowly, and stared about as if uncertain where to go. He
paused a moment midway in the room, and, stooping, picked up some
small object from the carpet, which he put in his waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>A moment more and he had crossed the hall and stood at the
library door, gazing at the scene which had already shocked and
saddened the others.</p>

<p>With a groan, as of utter anguish, Tom involuntarily put up one
hand before his eyes.</p>

<p>Then, pulling himself together with an effort, he seemed to dash
away a tear, and walked into the room, saying almost harshly, "What
does it mean?"</p>

<p>Doctor Hills rose to meet him, and by way of a brief explanation
he put into Tom's hand the paper he had found on the table. Tom
read the written message, and looked more stupefied than ever. With
a sudden gesture he turned towards Schuyler Carleton and said in a
low voice, "but you did love her, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Carleton simply.</p>

<p>"Why should she have thought you didn't?" went on Tom, looking
at the paper, and seeming to soliloquize rather than to address his
question to any one else.</p>

<p>As this was the first time that the "S." in Madeleine's note had
been openly assumed to stand for Schuyler Carleton, there was a
stir of excitement all round the room.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Carleton, but a dull, red flush spread over
his white face and his voice trembled.</p>

<p>"You don't know!" said Tom, in cutting tones. "Man, you must
know."</p>

<p>But no reply was made, and, dropping into a chair, Tom buried
his face in both hands and remained thus for a long time.</p>

<p>Tom Willard was a large, stout man, and possessed of the genial
and merry demeanor which so often accompanies avoirdupois. Save for
his occasional, though really rare, bursts of temper, Tom was
always in joking and laughing mood.</p>

<p>To see him thus in an agonized, speechless despair deeply
affected Mrs. Markham. Tom had always been a favorite with her, and
not even Madeleine had regretted more than she the estrangement
between Richard Van Norman and his nephew. And even as Mrs. Markham
looked at the bowed head of the great strong man she suddenly
bethought herself for the first time that Tom was now heir to the
Van Norman fortune.</p>

<p>She wondered if he had himself yet realized it; and then she
scolded herself for letting such thoughts intrude so unfittingly
soon. And yet she well knew that it would not be in ordinary human
nature long to ignore the fact of such a sudden change of fortunes.
As she looked at Tom her glance strayed toward Mr. Carleton, and
then the thought struck her that what Tom had gained this man had
lost. For had Madeleine lived the Van Norman money would have been,
in a way, at the disposal of her husband. The girl's death then
would make Tom a rich man, while Schuyler Carleton would remain
poor. He had always been poor, or at least far from wealthy, and
more than one gossip was of the opinion that he had wooed Miss Van
Norman not entirely because of disinterested love for her.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Markham was busy with these fast-following thoughts a
voice in the doorway made her look up.</p>

<p>A quiet, unimportant-looking man stood there, and was
respectfully addressing Doctor Hills.</p>

<p>"I'm Hunt, sir," he said, "a plain-clothes man from
headquarters."</p>

<p>The three men in the room gave a start of surprise, and each
turned an inquiring look at the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Who sent you? And what for?" asked Doctor Hills.</p>

<p>"I've been here all night, sir. I'm on guard in the present room
upstairs."</p>

<p>"I engaged him," said Mrs. Markham. "Madeleine's presents are
very valuable, and although the jewels are still in the bank, the
silver and other things upstairs are worth a large amount, and I
thought best to have this man remain here during the night."</p>

<p>"A very wise precaution, Mrs. Markham," said Doctor Hills; "and
why did you leave your post, my man?"</p>

<p>"The butler told me of what had happened, and I wondered if I
might be of any service down here. I left the butler in charge of
the room while I came down to inquire."</p>

<p>"Very thoughtful of you," said Doctor Hills, with a nod of
appreciation; "and while I hardly think so, we may have use for you
before the night is over. I am expecting Doctor Leonard, the county
physician, and until he comes I can do nothing. I am sure the room
above is sufficiently guarded for the time being, so suppose you
sit down here a few minutes and wait."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt chose to take a seat in the hall, just outside the
library door, and thus added one more solemn presence to the
quietly waiting group.</p>

<p>And now Doctor Hills had occasion to add another puzzling
condition to those that had already confronted him.</p>

<p>Almost every one in the room was curiously affected by the
appearance of this detective, or plain-clothes man, as he was
called.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton gave a start, and his pale face became whiter
yet.</p>

<p>Cicely Dupuy looked at him, and then turning her glance toward
Mr. Hunt, whom she could see through the doorway, she favored the
latter with a stare of such venomous hatred that Doctor Hills with
difficulty repressed an exclamation.</p>

<p>Cicely's big blue eyes roved from Hunt to Carleton and back
again, and her little hands clenched as with a firm resolve of some
sort in her mind; she seemed to brace herself for action.</p>

<p>Her hovering glances annoyed Carleton; he grew nervous and at
last stared straight at her, when her own eyes dropped, and she
blushed rosy red.</p>

<p>But this side-play was observed by no one but Doctor Hills, for
the others were evidently absorbed in serious thoughts of their own
concerning the advent of Mr. Hunt.</p>

<p>Tom Willard stared at him in a sort of perplexity; but Tom's
good-natured face had worn that perplexed look ever since he had
heard the awful news. He seemed unable to understand, or even to
grasp the facts so clearly visible before him.</p>

<p>But Miss Morton was more disturbed than any one else. She looked
at Hunt, and an expression of fear came into her eyes. She fidgeted
about, she felt in her pocket, she changed her seat twice, and she
repeatedly asked Doctor Hills if he thought Doctor Leonard would
arrive soon.</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard did not live in Mapleton, but motored over from
his home in a nearby village. He was a stranger to all those
awaiting him in the Van Norman house, with the exception of Doctor
Hills. Unlike that pleasant-mannered young man, Doctor Leonard was
middle aged, of a crusty disposition and curt speech.</p>

<p>When he came, Doctor Hills presented him to the ladies, and
before he had time to introduce the two men, Doctor Leonard said
crossly, "Put the women out. I cannot conduct this affair with
petticoats and hysterics around me."</p>

<p>Though not meant to reach the ears of the ladies, the speech was
fairly audible, and with a trace of indignation Miss Morton arose
and left the room. Mrs. Markham followed her, and Cicely went
also.</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard closed the library doors, and, turning to Doctor
Hills, asked for a concise statement of what had happened.</p>

<p>In his straightforward manner Doctor Hills gave him a brief
outline of the case, including all the necessary details.</p>

<p>"And yet," he concluded, "even in the face of that written
message, I cannot think it a suicide."</p>

<p>"Of course it's a suicide," declared Doctor Leonard in his
blustering way; "there is no question whatever. That written
confession which you all declare to be in her handwriting is ample
proof that the girl killed herself. Of course you had to send for
me&mdash;the stupid old laws of New Jersey make it imperative that
I shall be dragged out many miles away from my home for every death
that isn't in conventional death-bed fashion; but there is no
suspicion of foul play here. The poor girl chose to kill herself,
and she has done so with the means which she found near at hand. I
will write the burial certificate and leave it with you. There is
no occasion for the coroner."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" exclaimed Schuyler Carleton, in a fervent
tone.</p>

<p>"Amen," said Tom. "It's dreadful enough to think of poor Maddy
as she is, but had it been any one else who&mdash;"</p>

<p>Unheeding the ejaculations of the two men, Doctor Hills said
earnestly, "But, Doctor, if it had not been for the written paper,
would you have called it suicide?"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with the case," declared Doctor Leonard
testily; "The paper is there, and is authentic. No sane man could
doubt that it is a suicide after that."</p>

<p>"But, Doctor Leonard, it would seem impossible for a woman to
stab herself at that angle, and with such an astonishing degree of
force; also to pull the dagger from the wound, cast it on the
floor, and then to place her arm in that particular position on the
table."</p>

<p>"Why do you say in that particular position?"</p>

<p>"Because the position of her right arm is as if thrown there
carelessly, and not as if flung there in a death agony."</p>

<p>"You are imaginative, Doctor Hills. The facts may not seem
possible, but since they are the facts you must admit that they are
possible."</p>

<p>"Very well, Doctor Leonard, I accept your decision, and I
relinquish all professional responsibility in the matter."</p>

<p>"You may do so. There is no occasion for mystery or question. It
is a sad affair, indeed, but no crime is indicated beyond that of
self-destruction. The written confession hints at the motive for
the deed, but that is outside my jurisdiction. Who is the man in
the hall? I fancied him a detective."</p>

<p>"He is; that is, he is a man from headquarters who is here to
watch over the bridal gifts. He came downstairs thinking we might
require his services in another way."</p>

<p>"Send him back to his post. There is no work for detectives,
just because a young girl chose to end her unhappy life."</p>

<p>Doctor Hills opened the library door and directed Hunt to return
to his place in the present room.</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard, still with his harsh and disagreeable manner,
advised Willard and Carleton to go to their homes, saying he and
Doctor Hills would remain in charge of the library for the rest of
the night.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills found the women in the drawingroom, awaiting such
message as Doctor Leonard might have for them. Doctor Hills told
them all that Doctor Leonard had said, and advised them to retire,
as the next day would be indeed a difficult and sorrowful one.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br>
A Case For The Coroner</h3>

<p>It was characteristic of Miss Morton that she went straight to
her own room and shut the door. Mrs. Markham, on the other hand,
went to the room occupied by Kitty French. Molly Gardner was there,
too, and the two girls, robed in kimonas, were sitting, white-faced
and tearful-eyed, waiting for some further news from the room
whence they had been banished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham told them what Doctor Leonard had said, but Kitty
French broke out impetuously, "Madeleine never killed herself,
never! I know she always said that about the dagger, but she never
really meant it, and any way she never would have done it the night
before her wedding. I tell you she didn't do it! It was some horrid
burglar who came in to steal her presents, who killed her."</p>

<p>"I would almost rather it had been so, Kitty dear," said Mrs.
Markham, gently stroking the brow of the excited girl; "but it
could not have been, for we have very strong locks and bolts
against burglars, and Harris is very careful in his precautions for
our safety."</p>

<p>"I don't care! Maddy never killed herself. She wouldn't do it, I
know her too well. Oh, dear! now there won't be any wedding at all!
Isn't it dreadful to think of that decorated room, and the bower we
planned for the bride!"</p>

<p>At these thoughts Kitty's tears began to flow afresh, and Molly,
who was already limp from weeping, joined her.</p>

<p>"There, there," said Mrs. Markham, gently patting Molly's
shoulder. "Don't cry so, dearie. It can't do any good, and you'll
just make yourself ill."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said Molly, as she mopped her eyes
with her wet ball of a handkerchief; "why did she kill
herself?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Markham, but her expression seemed to
betoken a sad suspicion.</p>

<p>"She didn't kill herself," reiterated Kitty. "I stick to that,
but if she did, I know why."</p>

<p>This feminine absence of logic was unremarked by her hearers,
who both said, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Schuyler didn't love her enough," said Kitty earnestly.
"She just worshipped him, and he used to care more for her, but
lately he hasn't."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madeleine didn't tell me," returned Kitty. "I just gathered
it. I've been here 'most a week&mdash; you know I came several days
before you did, Molly&mdash;and I've noticed her a lot. Oh, I don't
mean I spied on her, or anything horrid. Only, I couldn't help
seeing that she wished Mr. Carleton would be more attentive."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought he was awfully attentive," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Oh, attentive, yes. I don't exactly mean that. But there was
something lacking,&mdash;don't you think so, Mrs. Markham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kitty, I do think so. In fact, I know that Mr. Carleton
didn't give Madeleine the heart-whole affection that she gave him.
But I hoped it would all turn out right, and I surely never dreamed
it was such a serious matter as to bring Madeleine to this. But she
was a reserved, proud nature, and if she thought Mr. Carleton had
ceased to love her, I know she would far rather die than marry
him."</p>

<p>"But she could have refused to marry him," cried Molly. "She
didn't have to kill herself to get rid of him."</p>

<p>"She didn't kill herself," stubbornly repeated Kitty, but Mrs.
Markham said:</p>

<p>"You don't understand Maddy's nature, Molly; she must have had
some sudden and positive proof of Mr. Carleton's lack of true
affection for her to drive her to this step. But once convinced
that he did not care for her, I know her absolute despair would
impel her to the desperate deed."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he love her?" said Molly, who could see no reason
why any man shouldn't love the magnificent Madeleine.</p>

<p>"I think," said Kitty slowly, "there was somebody else."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" exclaimed Mrs. Markham sharply, as if
she had detected Kitty in some wrongdoing.</p>

<p>"I don't know it, but I can't help thinking so. Madeleine has
sometimes asked me if I didn't think most men preferred gentle,
timid dispositions to a strong, capable nature like her own. Of
course she didn't express it just like that, but she hinted at it
so wistfully, that I told her no, she was the splendidest, most
adorable woman in the whole world. I meant it, too, but at the same
time I do think men 'most always love the soft, tractable kind of
girls, that are not so imperious and awe-inspiring as Maddy
was."</p>

<p>Surely Kitty ought to know, for she was the most delicious type
of soft, tractable femininity.</p>

<p>Her round, dimpled face was positively peachy, and her curling
tendrils of goldy hair clustered round a low white brow, above
appealing violet eyes. A man might admire the haughty Madeleine,
but he would caressingly love bewitching little Kitty, and would
involuntarily feel a sense of protection toward her, because of the
shy trustfulness in her glance.</p>

<p>This was not entirely ingenuous, for wise little Kitty quite
understood her own charm, but it was natural, and in no way forced;
and she was quite content that her lines had fallen in her own
pleasant places, and she left the magnificent Madeleines of the
world to pursue their own roles. But she had admired and loved
Maddy Van Norman, and just because of their differing natures, had
understood why Schuyler Carleton's affection was tempered with a
certain sense of inferiority.</p>

<p>"You know," she went on, as if thinking aloud, "everybody was a
little afraid of magnificent Maddy. She was so superb, so regal.
You couldn't imagine yourself cuddling her!"</p>

<p>"I should say not!" exclaimed Molly. "I could only imagine
salaaming to her, or deferentially kissing her hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I mean. Well, Mr. Carleton got tired of that
stilted kind of an attitude,&mdash;or, at least, she thought he
did. I don't know, I'm sure, but she was possessed with a notion
that he cared for some other girl,&mdash;some one of the clinging
rosebud sort."</p>

<p>"Do you know this?" asked Mrs. Markham; "I mean, do you know
that Maddy thought this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," asserted Kitty, with a wag of her wise little
head. "I tried to persuade her that no clinging rosebud could rival
a tall, proud lily, but she thoroughly believed there was some one
else."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Carleton was to marry her," said Mrs. Markham. "I can't
believe he would do that if he loved another."</p>

<p>"That's what bothered Maddy," said Kitty; "she knew how
honorable Mr. Carleton had always been, and she said that as he was
engaged to her, he would think it his duty to marry her, even
though his heart belonged to some one else."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said Molly. "If he was going to marry her, and
didn't love her, it was because of her fortune. Probably his
rosebud girl hasn't a cent."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that," said Kitty, shuddering. "Somehow it
seems disloyal to both of them."</p>

<p>"But it is all true," said Mrs. Markham sadly. "Madeleine has
never been of a confidential nature, but I know that she had the
idea Kitty tells of, and I fear it was true. And I may be disloyal,
or even unjust, but I can't help thinking Schuyler was attracted by
Maddy's money. He is proud and ambitious, and he would be quite in
his element as the head of a fine establishment, with plenty of
money to spend on it."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll never have it now," said Molly, and as this brought
back the realization of the awful event that had happened, both
girls burst into crying again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, herself with overwrought nerves, found she could
do nothing to comfort the girls, so left them and went to commune
with her grief in her own room.</p>

<p>Meantime the two doctors alone in the library were still in
discussion.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" inquired Doctor Leonard angrily. "Do
you want to imply, and with no evidence whatever, that the girl
died by some hand other than her own? Do you want to involve the
family in the expense and unpleasant publicity of a coroner's
inquest, when there is not only no reason for such a proceeding,
but there is every reason against it?"</p>

<p>"I want nothing but to get at the truth," rejoined Doctor Hills,
a little ruffled himself. "I hold that a young woman, unless
endowed with unusual strength, or possibly under stress of intense
passion, could not inflict upon herself a blow strong enough to
drive that dagger to the hilt in her own breast, pull it forth
again, and cast it on the floor, and after that place her arm in
the position it now occupies."</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard looked thoughtful. "I agree with you," he said
slowly; "that is, I agree that it does not seem as if a woman could
do that. But, my dear Doctor Hills, Miss Van Norman did do that. We
know she did, from her own written confession, and also by the
theory of elimination. What else could have happened? Have you any
suggestion to advance?"</p>

<p>Doctor Hills was somewhat taken aback at Doctor Leonard's
suddenness. Up to this moment the county physician had stoutly
maintained that the case was a suicide beyond any question, and
then, turning, he had put the question to the younger doctor in
such a way that Doctor Hills was not quite ready with an
answer.</p>

<p>"No," he said hesitatingly; "I have no theory to advance, and,
moreover, I do not consider this an occasion for theories. But we
must ascertain the facts. I state it as a fact that a woman could
not stab herself as Miss Van Norman is stabbed, withdraw the
dagger, and then place her right arm on the table in the position
you see it."</p>

<p>"And I assert that you are stating what is not a fact, but
merely your own opinion."</p>

<p>Doctor Hills looked disconcerted at this. His companion was an
older and far more experienced man than himself, and not only did
Doctor Hills have no desire to antagonize him, but he wished to
show him the deference that was justly his due.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said frankly; "it is merely my own opinion.
But now will you give me yours, based, not on the written paper,
but the position and general effect of the body of Miss Van
Norman?" Put thus on his mettle, Doctor Leonard looked carefully at
the dead girl, whose pose was so natural and graceful that she
might have been merely sitting there, resting.</p>

<p>He gazed long and intently, and then said, slowly:</p>

<p>"I see your point, Doctor Hills. It was a vigorous blow,
suddenly and forcefully given. It could scarcely have been done,
had the subject been a frail, slight woman. But Miss Van Norman was
of a strong, even athletic build, and her whole physical make-up
indicates strength and force of muscle. Your observation as to her
apparently natural position is all right so far as it goes; but I
have observed more carefully still, and I notice her evident
physical strength, which was doubtless greatly aided by her stress
of mental passion, and I aver that a woman of her physique could
have driven the blow, removed the weapon, and, perhaps even then
unconscious, have thrown her arm on the table as we now see
it."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Doctor Leonard," said young Hills, "for your
patience with me. You are doubtless right, and I frankly admit you
have made out a clear case. Miss Van Norman was, indeed, a strong
woman. I have been the family physician for several years, and I
know her robust constitution. Knowing this, and appreciating your
superior judgment as to the possibility of the deed, I am forced to
admit your opinion is the true one. And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides, Doctor Hills," went on Doctor Leonard, as the younger
man hesitated, "we cannot, we must not, ignore the written paper.
Why should we do so? Those who know, tell us Miss Van Norman wrote
it. It is, therefore, her dying statement. Dare we disregard her
last message, written in explanation of her otherwise inexplicable
act? We may wonder at this suicide, we may shudder at it; but we
may not doubt that it is a suicide. That paper is not merely
evidence,&mdash;it is testimony, it is incontrovertible proof."</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard ceased speaking, and sat silent because he had
nothing more to say.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills also sat silent, because, try as he might, he could
not feel convinced that the older physician was right. It was
absurd, he well knew, but every time he glanced at the relaxed pose
of that white right arm on the table, he felt more than ever sure
that it had lain there just so when the dagger entered the girl's
breast.</p>

<p>As the two men sat there, almost as motionless as the other
still figure, both saw the knob of the door turn.</p>

<p>They had closed the double doors leading to the hall, on the
arrival of Doctor Leonard, and now the knob of one of them was
slowly and noiselessly turning round.</p>

<p>A glance of recognition passed between them, but neither spoke
or moved.</p>

<p>A moment later, the knob having turned completely round, the
door began to open very slowly.</p>

<p>Owing to the position of the two men, it was necessary for the
door to be opened far enough to admit the intruder's head before
they could be seen, and the doctors waited breathlessly to see who
it might be who desired to come stealthily to the library that
night.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills, whose thoughts worked quickly, had already assumed
it was Mrs. Markham, coming to gaze once more on her beloved
mistress; but Doctor Leonard formulated no supposition and merely
waited to see.</p>

<p>At the edge of the door appeared first a yellow pompadour,
followed by the wide-open blue eyes of Cicely Dupuy. Seeing the two
men, she came no further into the room, but gave a sort of gasp,
and pulled the door quickly shut again. In the still house, the two
listeners could hear her footsteps crossing the hall, and ascending
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Curious, that," murmured Doctor Hills. "If she wanted to look
once more on Miss Van Norman's face, why so stealthy about it? And
if she didn't want that, what did she want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," rejoined Doctor Leonard; "but I see nothing
suspicious about it. Doubtless, she did come for a last glance
alone at Miss Van Norman, but, seeing us here, didn't care to
enter."</p>

<p>"But she gave a strange little shuddering gasp, as if
frightened."</p>

<p>"Natural excitement at the strange and awful conditions now
present."</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt." Doctor Hills spoke a bit impatiently. The
phlegmatic attitude of his colleague jarred on his own overwrought
nerves, and he rose and walked about the room, now and then
stopping to scrutinize anew the victim of the cruel dagger.</p>

<p>At last he stood still, across the table from her, but looking
at Doctor Leonard.</p>

<p>"I have no suggestion to make," he said slowly. "I have no
theory to offer, but I am firmly convinced that Madeleine Van
Norman did not strike the blow that took away her life. Perhaps
this is more a feeling or an intuition than a logical conviction,
but&mdash;" He hesitated and looked intently at the dead girl, as
if trying to force the secret from her.</p>

<p>With a sudden start he took a step forward, and as he spoke his
voice rang with excitement.</p>

<p>"Doctor Leonard," he said, in a quick, concise voice, "will you
look carefully at that dagger?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the older man, impressed by the other's sudden
intensity; and, stepping forward, he scrutinized the dagger as it
lay on the table, without, however, touching it.</p>

<p>"There is blood on the handle," went on Doctor Hills.</p>

<p>"Yes, several stains, now dried."</p>

<p>"And do you see any blood on the right hand of Miss Van
Norman?"</p>

<p>Startled at the implication, Doctor Leonard bent to examine the
cold white hand. Not a trace of blood was on it. Instinctively he
looked at the girl's left hand, only to find that also immaculately
white.</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard stood upright and pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"I was wrong, Doctor Hills," he said, with a nod which in him
betokened an unspoken apology. "It is a case for the coroner."</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br>
Fessenden Comes</h3>

<p>It was about nine o'clock the next morning when Rob Fessenden
rang the bell of the Van Norman house. Having heard nothing of the
events of the night, he had called to offer any assistance he might
give before the ceremony.</p>

<p>The trailing garland of white flowers with fluttering streamers
of white ribbon that hung beside the portal struck a chill to his
heart.</p>

<p>"What can have happened?" he thought blankly, and confused ideas
of motor accidents were thronging his mind as the door was opened
for him. The demeanor of the footman at once told him that he was
in a house of mourning. Shown into the drawing-room, he was met by
Cicely Dupuy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fessenden!" she exclaimed as she greeted him. "Then you
have not heard?"</p>

<p>"I've heard nothing. What is it?"</p>

<p>Poor Miss Dupuy had bravely taken up the burden of telling the
sad story to callers who did not know of it, and this was not the
first time that morning she had enlightened inquiring friends.</p>

<p>In a few words she told Mr. Fessenden of the events of the night
before. He was shocked and sincerely grieved. Although his
acquaintance with Miss Van Norman was slight, he was Schuyler
Carleton's oldest and best friend, and so he had come from New York
the day before in order to take his part at the wedding.</p>

<p>While they were talking Kitty French came in. As Mr. Fessenden
began to converse with her Cicely excused herself and left the
room.</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful?" began Kitty, and her tear-filled eyes
supplemented the trite sentence.</p>

<p>"It is indeed," said Rob Fessenden, taking her hand in
spontaneous sympathy. "Why should she do it?"</p>

<p>"She didn't do it," declared Kitty earnestly. "Mr. Fessenden,
they all say she killed herself, but I know she didn't. Won't you
help me to prove that, and to find out who did kill her?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Miss French? Miss Dupuy just told me it was a
suicide."</p>

<p>"They all say so, but I know better. Oh, I wish somebody would
help me! Molly doesn't think as I do, and I can't do anything all
alone."</p>

<p>Miss French's face was small and flower-like, and when she
clasped her little hands and bewailed her inability to prove her
belief, young Fessenden thought he had never seen such a perfect
picture of beautiful helplessness. Without reserve he instantly
resolved to aid and advise her to the best of his own ability.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Markham doesn't think as I do, either," went on Kitty.
"Nobody thinks as I do."</p>

<p>"I will think as you do," declared Fessenden, and so potent was
the charm of the tearful violet eyes, that he was quite ready to
think whatever she dictated. "Only tell me what to think, and what
to do about it."</p>

<p>"Why, I think Madeleine didn't kill herself at all. I think
somebody else killed her."</p>

<p>"But who would do such a thing? You see, Miss French, I know
nothing of the particulars. I saw Miss Van Norman for the first
time yesterday."</p>

<p>"Had you never met her before?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a few years ago. But I mean, I came to Mapleton only
yesterday, and saw her in the afternoon. I was to be Schuyler's
best man, you know, and as he didn't come here to dinner last
night, I thought I'd better not come either, though I had been
asked. He was a little miffed with Miss Van Norman, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Maddy did flirt with Tom, and it always annoyed
Mr. Carleton. Did you dine with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at his home. I am staying there. By the way, I met Miss
Burt there; do you know her?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"She's a companion to Mrs. Carleton, Schuyler's mother. I never
saw her until last night at dinner."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know her," repeated Kitty. "I don't believe she was
invited to the wedding, for I looked over the list of invitations.
Still, her name may have been there. The list was so very
long."</p>

<p>"And now there'll be no wedding and no guests."</p>

<p>"No," said Kitty; "only guests at a far different ceremony."
Again the deep violet eyes filled with tears, and Fessenden was
conscious of a longing to comfort and help the poor little girl
thrown thus suddenly into the first tragedy of her life.</p>

<p>"It would be dreadful enough if she had died from an illness,"
he said; "but this added awful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Kitty; "but to me the worst part is for them
to say she killed herself,&mdash;and I know she didn't. Why, Maddy
was too fine and big-natured to do such a cowardly thing."</p>

<p>"She seemed so to me, too, though of course I didn't know her so
well as you did."</p>

<p>"No, I'm one of her nearest friends,&mdash;though Madeleine was
never one to have really intimate friends. But as her friend, I
want to try to do what I can to put her right in the face of the
world. And you said you'd help me."</p>

<p>She looked at Fessenden with such hopefully appealing eyes, that
he would willingly have helped her in any way he could, but he also
realized that it was a very serious proposition this young girl was
making.</p>

<p>"I will help you, Miss French," he said gravely. "I know little
of the details of the case, but if there is the slightest chance
that you may be right, rest assured that you shall be given every
chance to prove it."</p>

<p>Kitty French gave a sigh of relief. "Oh, thank you," she said
earnestly; "but I'm afraid we cannot do much, however well we
intend. Of course I'm merely a guest here, and I have no authority
of any sort. And, too, to prove that Maddy did not kill herself
would mean having a detective and everything like that."</p>

<p>"I may not be 'everything like that,'" said Fessenden, with a
faint smile, "but I am a sort of detective in an amateur way. I've
had quite a good deal of experience, and though I wouldn't take a
case officially, I'm sure I could at least discover if your
suspicions have any grounds."</p>

<p>"But I haven't any suspicions," said Kitty, agitatedly clasping
her little hands against her breast; "I've only a feeling, a deep,
positive conviction, that Madeleine did not kill herself, and I'm
sure I don't know who did kill her."</p>

<p>Fessenden gave that grave smile of his and only said, "That
doesn't sound like much to work upon, and yet I would often trust a
woman's intuitive knowledge against the most conspicuous clues or
evidences."</p>

<p>Kitty thanked him with a smile, but before she could speak, Miss
Morton came into the room.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly dreadful," that lady began, in her impetuous
way; "they're going to have the coroner after all! Doctor Leonard
has sent for him and he may arrive at any minute. Isn't it awful?
There'll be an inquest, and the house will be thronged with all
sorts of people!"</p>

<p>"Why are they going to have an inquest?" demanded Kitty,
whirling around and grasping Miss Morton by her elbows.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, quite as excited as Kitty herself
"&mdash;because the doctors think that perhaps Madeleine didn't
kill herself; that she was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murdered!" exclaimed Kitty. "I knew it! I knew she was! Who
killed her?"</p>

<p>"Mercy! I don't know," exclaimed Miss Morton, frightened at
Kitty's vehemence. "That's what the coroner is coming to find
out."</p>

<p>"But who do you think did it? You must have some idea!"</p>

<p>"I haven't! Don't look at me like that! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It must have been a burglar," went on Kitty, "because it
couldn't have been any one else. But why didn't he steal things?
Perhaps he did! We never thought to look?"</p>

<p>"How you do run on! Nobody could steal the presents, because
there was a policeman in the house all the time."</p>

<p>"Then, why didn't he catch the burglar?" demanded Kitty,
grasping Miss Morton's arm, as if that lady had information that
must be dragged from her by force.</p>

<p>Feeling interested in getting at the facts in the case, and
thinking that he could learn little from these two excited women,
Rob Fessenden turned into the hall just in time to meet Doctor
Hills, who was coming from the library.</p>

<p>"May I introduce myself?" he said. "I'm Robert Fessenden, of New
York, a lawyer, and I was to have been best man at the wedding.
You, I know, are Doctor Hills, and I want to say to you that if the
earnest endeavor of an amateur detective would be of any use to you
in this matter, it is at your disposal. Mr. Carleton is my old and
dear friend, and I need not tell you how he now calls forth my
sympathy."</p>

<p>Instinctively, Doctor Hills liked this young man. His frank
manner and pleasant, straightforward ways impressed the doctor
favorably, and he shook hands warmly as he said, "This is most kind
of you, Mr. Fessenden, and you may prove the very man we need. At
first, we were all convinced that Miss Van Norman's death was a
suicide; and though the evidence still strongly points to that, I
am sure that there is a possibility, at least, that it is not
true."</p>

<p>"May I learn the details of the case? May I go into the
library?" said Fessenden, hesitating to approach the closed door
until invited.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; I'll take you in at once. Doctor Leonard, who is
in there, is the county physician, and, though a bit brusque in his
manner, he is an honest old soul, and does unflinchingly what he
judges to be his duty."</p>

<p>Neither then nor at any time, neither to Doctor Leonard himself
nor to any one else, did Doctor Hills ever mention the difference
of opinion which the two men had held for so long the night before,
nor did he tell how he had proved his own theory so positively that
Doctor Leonard had been obliged to confess himself wrong. It was
not in Doctor Hills' nature to say "I told you so," and, fully
appreciating this, Doctor Leonard said nothing either, but threw
himself into the case heart and soul in his endeavors to seek truth
and justice.</p>

<p>Fessenden and Doctor Hills entered the library, where everything
was much as it had been the night before. At one time the doctors
had been about to move the body to a couch, and to remove the
disfigured gown, but after Doctor Leonard had been persuaded to
agree with Doctor Hills' view of the ease, they had left everything
untouched until the coroner should come.</p>

<p>The discovery of this was a satisfaction to Robert Fessenden.
His detective instinct had begun to assert itself, and he was glad
of an opportunity to examine the room before the arrival of the
coroner. Though not seeming unduly curious, his eyes darted about
in an eager search for possible clues of any sort. Without touching
them, he examined the dagger, the written paper, the appointments
of the library table, and the body itself, with its sweet, sad
face, its drooping posture, and its tragically stained raiment.</p>

<p>In true detective fashion he scrutinized the carpet, glanced at
the window fastenings, and noted the appointments of the library
table.</p>

<p>The only thing Fessenden touched, however, was a lead pencil
which lay on the pen-rack. It was an ordinary pencil, but he gazed
intently at the gilt lettering stamped upon it, and then returned
it to its place.</p>

<p>Again he glanced quickly but carefully at every article on the
table, and then, taking a chair, sat quietly in a corner,
unobtrusive but alert.</p>

<p>With something of a bustling air the coroner came in. Coroner
Benson was a fussy sort of man, with a somewhat exaggerated sense
of his own importance.</p>

<p>He paused with what he probably considered a dramatic start when
he saw the dead body of Miss Van Norman, and, shaking his head,
said, "Alas! Alas!" in tragic tones.</p>

<p>Miss Morton and Kitty French had followed him in, and stood arm
in arm, a little bewildered, but determined to know whatever might
transpire. Cicely Dupuy and Miss Markham had also come in.</p>

<p>But after a glance round and a preliminary clearing of his
throat, he at once requested that everybody except the two doctors
should leave the room.</p>

<p>Fessenden and Kitty French were greatly disappointed at this,
but the others went out with a feeling of relief, for the strain
was beginning to tell upon the nerves of all concerned.</p>

<p>As usual, Miss Morton tried to exercise her powers of
generalship, and directed that they should all assemble in the
drawing-room until recalled to learn the coroner's opinion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham, unheeding Miss Morton's dictum, went away to
attend to her household duties, and Cicely went to her own room,
but the others waited in the drawing-room. They were joined shortly
by Tom Willard and Schuyler Carleton, who arrived at about the same
time.</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton, never a robust man, looked like a wreck of his
former self. Years had been added to his apparent age; his
impassive face wore a look of stony grief, and his dark eyes seemed
filled with an unutterable horror.</p>

<p>Tom Willard, on the contrary, being of stout build and rubicund
countenance, seemed an ill-fitting figure in the sad and tearful
group.</p>

<p>But as Kitty French remarked to Fessenden in a whisper, "Poor
Tom probably feels the worst of any of us, and it isn't his fault
that he can't make that fat, jolly face of his look more
funereal."</p>

<p>"And he's said to be the heir to the estate, too," Fessenden
whispered back.</p>

<p>"Now, that's mean of you," declared Kitty. "Tom hasn't a greedy
hair in his head, and I don't believe he has even thought of his
fortune. And, besides, he was desperately in love with Madeleine. A
whole heap more in love than Mr. Carleton was."</p>

<p>Fessenden stared at her.</p>

<p>"Then why was Carleton marrying her?"</p>

<p>"For her money," said Kitty, with a disdainful air.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that," went on Fessenden, quite seriously. "I
thought Carleton was hard hit. She was a magnificent woman."</p>

<p>"Oh, she was, indeed," agreed Kitty enthusiastically. "Mr.
Carleton didn't half appreciate her, and Tom did. But then she was
always very different with Tom. Somehow she always seemed
constrained when with Mr. Carleton."</p>

<p>"Then why was she marrying him?"</p>

<p>"She was terribly in love with him. She liked Tom only in a
cousinly way, but she adored Mr. Carleton. I know it."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems you were right about her not killing herself, so
you're probably right about this matter, too."</p>

<p>"Now, that shows a nice spirit," said Kitty, smiling, even in
the midst of her sorrow. "But, truly, I'm 'most always right;
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be after this, for I'm always going to agree with
you."</p>

<p>"That's a pretty large order, for I'm sometimes awfully
disagreeable."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't believe that, but I've practically promised to
believe everything you tell me, so I suppose I shall have to."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I have defeated my own ends! Well, never mind; abide by
your first impression,&mdash;that I'm always right,&mdash;and then
go ahead."</p>

<p>"Go ahead it is," declared Fessenden, and then Molly Gardner
joined them. Molly was more overcome by the tragic turn affairs had
taken than Kitty, and had only just made her appearance downstairs
that day.</p>

<p>"You dear child," cried Kitty, noting her pale cheeks and sad
eyes, "sit right down here by us, and let Mr. Fessenden talk to
you. He's the nicest man in the world to cheer any one up."</p>

<p>"And you look as if you need cheering, Miss Gardner," said
Fessenden, arranging some pillows at her back, as she languidly
dropped down on the sofa.</p>

<p>"I can't realize it at all," said poor Molly; "I don't want to
be silly and keep fainting all over the place, but every time I
remember how Maddy looked last night&mdash;" She glanced toward the
closed library doors with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Don't think about it," said Rob Fessenden gently. "What you
need most, Miss Gardner, is a bit of fresh air. Come with me for a
little walk in the grounds."</p>

<p>This was self-sacrifice on the part of the young man, for he
greatly desired to be present when the coroner should open the
closed doors to them again. But he really thought Miss Gardner
would be better for a short, brisk walk, and, getting her some
wraps, they went out at the front door.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br>
Mr. Benson's Questions</h3>

<p>It was some time after Fessenden and Molly had returned from
their walk that the library doors were thrown open, and Coroner
Benson invited them all to come in.</p>

<p>They filed in slowly, each heart heavy with an impending sense
of dread. Doctor Hills ushered them to seats, which had been
arranged in rows, and which gave an unpleasantly formal air to the
cozy library.</p>

<p>The body of Madeleine Van Norman had been taken upstairs to her
own room, and at the library table, where she had last sat, stood
Coroner Benson.</p>

<p>The women were seated in front. Mrs. Markham seemed to have
settled into a sort of sad apathy, but Miss Morton was briskly
alert and, though evidently nervous, seemed eager to hear what the
coroner had to tell.</p>

<p>Kitty French, too, was full of anxious interest, and, taking the
seat assigned to her, clasped her little hands in breathless
suspense, while a high color rose to her lovely cheeks.</p>

<p>Molly Gardner was pale and wan-looking. She dreaded the whole
scene, and had but one desire, to get away from Mapleton. She could
have gone to her room, had she chosen, but the idea of being all
alone was even worse than the present conditions. So she sat, with
overwrought nerves, now and then clutching at Kitty's sleeve.</p>

<p>Cicely Dupuy was very calm&mdash;so calm, indeed, that one might
guess it was the composure of an all-compelling determination, and
by no means the quiet of indifference.</p>

<p>Marie was there, and showed the impassive face of the
well-trained servant, though her volatile French nature was
discernible in her quick-darting glances and quivering, sensitive
lips.</p>

<p>The two doctors, Mr. Carleton, Tom Willard, and young Fessenden
occupied the next row of seats, and behind them were the house
servants.</p>

<p>Unlike the women, the men showed little or no emotion on their
faces. All were grave and composed, and even Doctor Leonard seemed
to have laid aside his brusque and aggressive ways.</p>

<p>As he stood facing this group, Coroner Benson was fully alive to
the importance of his own position, and he quite consciously
determined to conduct the proceedings in a way to throw great
credit upon himself in his official capacity.</p>

<p>After an impressive pause, which he seemed to deem necessary to
gain the attention of an already breathlessly listening audience,
he began:</p>

<p>"While there is much evidence that seems to prove that Miss Van
Norman took her own life, there is very grave reason to doubt this.
Both of the eminent physicians here present are inclined to believe
that the dagger thrust which killed Miss Van Norman was not
inflicted by her own hand, though it may have been so. This
conclusion they arrive at from their scientific knowledge of the
nature and direction of dagger strokes, which, as may not be
generally known, is a science in itself. Indeed, were it not for
the conclusive evidence of the written paper, these gentlemen would
believe that the stroke was impossible of self-infliction.</p>

<p>"But, aside from this point, we are confronted by this startling
fact. Although the dagger, which you may see still lying on the
table, has several blood-stains on its handle, there is absolutely
no trace of blood on the right hand of the body of Miss Van Norman.
It is inconceivable that she could have removed such a trace, had
there been any, and it is highly improbable, if not indeed
impossible, that she could have handled the dagger and left it in
its present condition, without showing a corresponding stain on her
hand."</p>

<p>This speech of Coroner Benson's produced a decided sensation on
all his hearers, but it was manifested in various ways. Kitty
French exchanged with Fessenden a satisfied nod, for this seemed in
line with her own theory.</p>

<p>Fessenden returned the nod, and even gave Kitty a faint smile,
for who could look at that lovely face without a pleasant
recognition of some sort? And then he folded his arms and began to
think hard. Yet there was little food for coherent thought.</p>

<p>Granting the logical deduction from the absence of any stain on
Miss Van Norman's hands, there was, as yet, not the slightest
indication of any direction in which to look for the dastard who
had done the deed.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton showed no emotion, but his white face seemed
to take on one more degree of horror and misery. Tom Willard looked
blankly amazed, and Mrs. Markham began on a new one of her
successive crying spells. Miss Morton sat bolt upright and placidly
smoothed the gray silk folds of her gown, while her face wore a
decided "I told you so" expression, though she hadn't told them
anything of the sort.</p>

<p>But as Fessenden watched her&mdash;the rows of seats were
slightly horseshoed, and he could see her side face well&mdash;he
noticed that she was really trembling all over, and that her
placidity of face was without doubt assumed for effect. He could
not see her eyes, but he was positive that only a strong fear or
terror of something could explain her admirably suppressed
agitation.</p>

<p>The behavior of Cicely Dupuy was perhaps the most extraordinary.
She flew into a fit of violent hysterics, and had to be taken from
the room. Marie followed her, as it had always been part of the
French maid's duty to attend Miss Dupuy upon occasion as well as
Miss Van Norman.</p>

<p>"In view of this state of affairs," went on the coroner, when
quiet had been restored after Cicely's departure, "it becomes
necessary to make an investigation of the case. We have absolutely
no evidence, and no real reason to suspect foul play, yet since
there is the merest possibility that the death was not a suicide,
it becomes my duty to look further into the matter. I have been
told that Miss Van Norman had expressed a sort of general fear,
that she might some day be impelled to turn this dagger upon
herself. But that is a peculiar mental obsession that affects many
people at sight of a sharp-pointed or cutting instrument, and is by
no means a proof that she did do this thing. But quite aside from
the temptation of the glittering steel, we have Miss Van Norman's
written confession that she at least contemplated taking her own
life, and ascribing a reason therefor. In further consideration,
then, of this written paper, of which you all know the contents,
can any of you tell me of any fact or quote any words spoken by
Miss Van Norman that would corroborate or amplify the statement of
this despairing message?"</p>

<p>As Mr. Benson spoke, he held in his hand the written paper that
had been found on the library table. It was indeed unnecessary to
read it aloud, for every one present knew its contents by
heart.</p>

<p>But nobody responded to the coroner's question. Mr. Carleton
looked mutely helpless, Tom Willard looked honestly perplexed, and
yet many of those present believed that both these men knew the sad
secret of Madeleine's life, and understood definitely the written
message.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Benson earnestly requested that any one knowing the
least fact, however trivial, regarding the matter, would mention
it.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Markham spoke.</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing but my own surmise," she said; "I know
nothing for certain, but I have reason to believe that Madeleine
Van Norman had a deep sorrow,&mdash;such a one as would impel her
to write that statement, and to act in accordance with it."</p>

<p>"That is what I wished to know," said Coroner Benson; "it is not
necessary for you to detail the nature of her sorrow, or even to
hint at it further, but the assurance that the message is in
accordance with Miss Van Norman's mental attitude goes far toward
convincing me that her death is the outcome of that written
declaration."</p>

<p>"I know, too," volunteered Kitty French, "that Madeleine meant
every word she wrote there. She was miserable, and for the very
reason that she herself stated!"</p>

<p>Mr. Benson pinched his glasses more firmly on his nose, and
turned his gaze slowly toward Miss French.</p>

<p>Kitty had spoken impulsively, and perhaps too directly, but,
though embarrassed at the sensation she had caused, she showed no
desire to retract her statements.</p>

<p>"I am told," said the coroner, his voice ringing out clearly in
the strange silence that had fallen on the room, "that the initial
on this paper designates Mr. Schuyler Carleton. I must therefore
ask Mr. Carleton if he can explain the reference to himself."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Schuyler Carleton, and only the intense silence
allowed his low whisper to be heard. "Miss Van Norman was my
affianced wife. We were to have been married to-day. Those two
facts, I think, prove the existence of our mutual love. The paper
is to me inexplicable."</p>

<p>Tom Willard looked at the speaker with an expression of frank
unbelief, and, indeed, most of the auditors' faces betrayed
incredulity.</p>

<p>Even with no previous reason to imagine that Carleton did not
love Madeleine, the tragic message proved it beyond all possible
doubt,&mdash;and yet it was but natural for the man to deny it.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills spoke next.</p>

<p>"I think, Coroner Benson," he said, as he rose to his feet, "we
are missing the point. If Miss Van Norman took her life in
fulfilment of her own decision, the reasons that brought about that
decision are not a matter for our consideration. It is for us to
decide whether she did or did not bring about her own death, and as
a mode of procedure may I suggest this? Doctor Leonard and myself
hold, that, in view of the absence of any stain on Miss Van
Norman's hands, she could not have handled the stained dagger that
killed her. A refutation of this opinion would be to explain how
she could have done the deed and left no trace on her fingers.
Unless this can be shown, I think we can not call it a
suicide."</p>

<p>Although nothing would have induced him to admit it, Coroner
Benson was greatly accommodated by this suggestion, and immediately
adopting it as his own promulgation, he repeated it almost exactly
word for word, as his official dictum.</p>

<p>"And so," he concluded, "as I have now explained, unless a
theory can be offered on this point, we must agree that Miss Van
Norman's unfortunate death was not by her own hand."</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden arose.</p>

<p>"I have no theory," he said; "I have no argument to offer. But I
am sure we all wish to discover the truth by means of any light
that any of us may throw on the mystery. And I want to say that in
my opinion the absence of blood on the hands, though it indicates,
does not positively prove, that the weapon was held by another than
the victim. Might it not be that, taking the dagger from the table,
clean as of course it was, Miss Van Norman turned it upon herself,
and then, withdrawing it, let it drop to the floor, where it
subsequently became blood-stained, as did the rug and her own
gown?"</p>

<p>The two doctors listened intently. It was characteristic of both
that though Doctor Hills had shown no elation when he had convinced
Doctor Leonard of his mistake the night before, yet now Doctor
Leonard could not repress a gleam of triumph in his eyes as he
turned to Doctor Hills.</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Mr. Benson, with a cautiously dubious
air, though really the theory struck him as extremely probable, and
he wished he had advanced it himself.</p>

<p>Doctor Hills looked thoughtful, and then, as nobody else spoke,
he observed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Carleton might perhaps judge of that point. As he first
discovered the dagger, and picked it up from the floor, he can
perhaps say if it lay in or near the stains on the carpet."</p>

<p>Everybody looked at Schuyler Carleton. But the man had reached
the limit of his endurance.</p>

<p>"I don't know!" he exclaimed, covering his white face with his
hands, as if to shut out the awful memory. "Do you suppose I
noticed such details?" he cried, looking up again. "I picked up the
dagger, scarce knowing that I did it! It was almost an unconscious
act. I was stunned, dazed, at what I saw before me, and I know
nothing of the dagger or its blood-stains!"</p>

<p>Truly, the man was almost frenzied, and out of consideration for
his perturbed state, the coroner asked him no more questions just
then.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Rob Fessenden, "that the nature or
shape of the stains on the dagger handle might determine this
point. If they appear to be finger-marks, the weapon must have been
held by some other hand. If merely stains, as from the floor, they
might be considered to strengthen Doctor Hill's theory."</p>

<p>The Venetian paper-cutter was produced and passed around.</p>

<p>None of the women would touch it or even look at it, except
Kitty French. She examined it carefully, but had no opinion to
offer, and Mr. Benson waited impatiently for her to finish her
scrutiny. He had no wish to hear her remarks on the subject, for he
deemed her a mere frivolous girl, who had no business to take any
part in the serious inquiry. All were requested not to touch the
weapon, which was passed round on a brass tray taken from the
library table.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton covered his eyes, and refused to glance at
it.</p>

<p>Tom Willard and Robert Fessenden looked at it at the same time,
holding the tray between them.</p>

<p>"I make out no finger-prints," said Tom, at last. "Do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Fessenden; "that is, not surely. These may be marks
of fingers, but they are far too indistinct to say so positively.
What do you think, Doctor Leonard?"</p>

<p>The gruesome property was passed on to the two doctors, who
examined it with the greatest care. Going to the window, they
looked at it with magnifying glasses, and finally reported that the
slight marks might be finger-marks, or might be the abrasion of the
nap of the rug on which the dagger had fallen.</p>

<p>"Then," said Coroner Benson, "we have, so far, no evidence which
refutes the theory that Miss Van Norman's written message was the
expression of her deliberate intent, and that that intention was
fulfilled by her."</p>

<p>Once more Mr. Benson scanned intently the faces of his
audience.</p>

<p>"Can no one, then," he said again, "assert or suggest anything
that may have any bearing on this written message?"</p>

<p>"I can," said Robert Fessenden.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br>
A Soft Lead Pencil</h3>

<p>Coroner Benson looked at the young man curiously. Knowing him to
be a stranger in the household, he had not expected information
from him.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he said quietly.</p>

<p>"I am Robert Fessenden, of New York City. I am a lawyer by
profession, and I came to Mapleton yesterday for the purpose of
acting as best man at Mr. Carleton's wedding. I came here this
morning, not knowing of what had occurred in the night, and after
conversation with some members of the household I felt impelled to
investigate some points which seemed to me mysterious. I trust I
have shown no intrusive curiosity, but I confess to a natural
detective instinct, and I noticed some peculiarities about that
paper you hold in your hand to which I should like to call your
attention."</p>

<p>Fessenden's words caused a decided stir among his hearers,
including the coroner and the two doctors.</p>

<p>Mr. Benson was truly anxious to learn what the young man had to
say, but at the same time his professional jealousy was aroused by
the implication that there was anything to be learned from the
paper itself, outside of his own information concerning it.</p>

<p>"I was told," he said quickly, "that this paper is positively
written in Miss Van Norman's own hand."</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden, while not exactly a handsome man, was of a
type that impressed every one pleasantly. He was large and blond,
and had an air that was unmistakably cultured and exceedingly
well-bred. Conventionality sat well upon him, and his courteous
self-assurance had in it no trace of egotism or self-importance. In
a word, he was what the plain-spoken people of Mapleton called
citified, and though they sometimes resented this combination of
personal traits, in their hearts they admired and envied it.</p>

<p>This was why Coroner Benson felt a slight irritation at the
young man's savoir faire, and at the same time a sense of
satisfaction that there was promise of some worth-while help.</p>

<p>"I was told so, too," said Fessenden, in response to the
coroner's remark, "and as I have never seen any of Miss Van
Norman's writing, I have, of course, no reason to doubt this. But
this is the point I want to inquire about: is it assumed that Miss
Van Norman wrote the words on this paper while sitting here at the
table last evening, immediately or shortly before her death?"</p>

<p>Mr. Benson thought a moment, then he said: "Without any evidence
to the contrary, and indeed without having given this question any
previous thought, I think I may say that it has been tacitly
assumed that this is a dying confession of Miss Van Norman's."</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly at his audience, and Doctor Hills
responded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "we have taken for granted that Miss Van Norman
wrote the message while sitting here last evening, after the rest
of the household had retired. This we infer from the fact of Mr.
Carleton's finding the paper on the table when he discovered the
tragedy."</p>

<p>"You thought the same, Mr. Carleton?"</p>

<p>"Of course; I could not do otherwise than to believe Miss Van
Norman had written the message and had then carried out her
resolve."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Fessenden," resumed the coroner, "we may assume
this to be the case."</p>

<p>"Then," said Fessenden, "I will undertake to show that it is
improbable that this paper was written as has been supposed. The
message is, as you see, written in pencil. The pencil here on the
table, and which is part of a set of desk-fittings, is a very hard
pencil, labeled H. A few marks made by it upon a bit of paper will
convince you at once that it is not the pencil which was used to
write that message. The letters, as you see, are formed of heavy
black marks which were made with a very soft pencil, such as is
designated by 2B or BB. If you please, I will pause for a moment
while you satisfy yourself upon this point."</p>

<p>Greatly interested, Mr. Benson took the pencil from the pen-rack
and wrote some words upon a pad of paper. Doctor Leonard and Doctor
Hills leaned over the table to note results, but no one else
stirred.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said Mr. Benson; "this message was not
written with this pencil. But what does that prove?"</p>

<p>"It proves nothing," said Fessenden calmly, "but it is pretty
strong evidence that the message was not written at this table last
night. For had there been any other pencil on the table, it would
doubtless have remained. Assuming, then that Miss Van Norman wrote
this message elsewhere, and with another pencil, it loses the
special importance commonly attributed to the words of one about to
die."</p>

<p>"It does," said Mr. Benson, impressed by the fact, but at a loss
to know whither the argument was leading.</p>

<p>"Believing, then," went on the lawyer, "that this paper had not
been written in this room last evening, I began to conjecture where
it had been written. For one would scarcely expect a message of
that nature to be written in one place and carried to another. I
was so firmly convinced that something could be learned on this
point, that just before we were summoned to this room, I asked
permission of Mrs. Markham to examine the appointments of Miss Van
Norman's writing-desk in her own room, and I found in her desk no
soft pencils whatever. There were several pencils, of gold and of
silver and of ordinary wood, but the lead in each was as hard as
this one on the library table. Urged on by what seemed to me
important developments, I persuaded Mrs. Markham to let me examine
all of the writing-desks in the house. I found but one soft pencil,
and that was in the desk of Miss Dupuy, Miss Van Norman's
secretary. It is quite conceivable that Miss Van Norman should
write at her secretary's desk, but I found myself suddenly
confronted by another disclosure. And that is that the handwritings
of Miss Van Norman and Miss Dupuy are so similar as to be almost
identical. In view of the importance of this written message,
should it not be more carefully proved that this writing is really
Miss Van Norman's own?"</p>

<p>"It should, indeed," declared Coroner Benson, who was by this
time quite ready to agree to any suggestion Mr. Fessenden might
make. "Will somebody please ask Miss Dupuy to come here?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Miss Morton, and, rising, she quickly rustled
from the room.</p>

<p>Of course, every one present immediately remembered that Miss
Dupuy had left the room in a fit of hysterical emotion, and
wondered in what frame of mind she would return.</p>

<p>Nearly every one, too, resented Miss Morton's officiousness.
Whatever errand was to be done, she volunteered to do it, quite as
if she were a prominent member of the household, instead of a
lately arrived guest.</p>

<p>"This similarity of penmanship is a very important point,"
observed Mr. Benson, "a very important point indeed. I am surprised
that it has not been remarked sooner."</p>

<p>"I've often noticed that they wrote alike," said Kitty French
impulsively, "but I never thought about it before in this matter.
You see"&mdash;she involuntarily addressed herself to the coroner,
who listened with interest&mdash;"you see, Madeleine instructed
Cicely to write as nearly as possible like she did, because Cicely
was her social secretary and answered all her notes, and wrote
letters for her, and sometimes Cicely signed Madeleine's name to
the notes, and the people who received them thought Maddy wrote
them herself. She didn't mean to deceive, only sometimes people
don't like to have their notes answered by a secretary, and so it
saved a lot of trouble. I confess," Kitty concluded, "that I can't
always tell the difference in their writing myself, though I
usually can."</p>

<p>Miss Morton returned, bringing Cicely with her. Still officious
of manner, Miss Morton rearranged some chairs, and then seated
herself in the front row with Cicely beside her. She showed what
seemed almost an air of proprietorship in the girl, patting her
shoulder, and whispering to her, as if by way of encouragement.</p>

<p>But Miss Dupuy's demeanor had greatly changed. No longer
weeping, she had assumed an almost defiant attitude, and her thin
lips were tightly closed in a way that did not look promising to
those who desired information.</p>

<p>With a conspicuous absence of tact or diplomacy, Mr. Benson
asked her abruptly, "Did you write this paper?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Cicely, and as soon as the words were uttered her
lips closed again with a snap.</p>

<p>Her reply fell like a bombshell upon the breathless group of
listeners. Tom Willard was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed. "Maddy didn't write that? You wrote
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," asserted Cicely, looking Tom squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"When did you write it?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"A week or more ago."</p>

<p>"Why did you write it?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to tell."</p>

<p>"Who is the S. mentioned on this paper?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to tell."</p>

<p>"You needn't tell. That is outside the case. It is sufficient
for us to know that Miss Van Norman did not write this paper. If
you wrote it, it has no bearing on the case. Your penmanship is
very like hers."</p>

<p>"I practised to make it so," said Cicely. "Miss Van Norman
desired me to do so, that I might answer unimportant notes and sign
her name to them. They were in no sense forgeries. Ladies
frequently have their own names signed by their secretaries. Miss
Van Norman often received notes like that."</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell before that you wrote this paper supposed
to have been written by Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>"Nobody asked me." Miss Dupuy's tone was defiant and even pert.
Robert Fessenden began to look at the girl with increasing
interest. He felt quite sure that she knew more about the tragedy
than he had suspected. His detective instinct became immediately
alert, and he glanced significantly at Kitty French.</p>

<p>She was breathlessly watching Cicely, but nothing could be
learned from the girl's inscrutable face, and to an attentive
listener her very voice did not ring true.</p>

<p>Doctor Leonard and Doctor Hills looked at each other. Both
remembered that the night before, Cicely had stealthily opened the
door of the library and put her head in, but seeing them, had
quickly gone back again.</p>

<p>This information might or might not be of importance, but after
a brief whispered conference, the two men concluded that it was not
the time then to refer to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton, though still pale and haggard of face, seemed to
have taken on new interest, and listened attentively to the
conversation, while big, good-natured Tom Willard leaned forward
and took the paper, and then sat studying it, with a perplexed
expression.</p>

<p>"But why did you not volunteer the information? You must have
known it was of great importance." The coroner spoke almost
petulantly, and indeed Miss Dupuy had suppressed important
information.</p>

<p>At his question she became greatly embarrassed. She blushed and
looked down, and then, with an effort resuming her air of defiance,
she snapped out her answer: "I was afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Afraid that they would think somebody killed Miss Van Norman,
instead of that she killed herself, as she did."</p>

<p>"How do you know she did?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it, except that I left her here alone when I went
to my room, and the house was all locked up, and soon after that
she was found dead. So she must have killed herself."</p>

<p>"Those conclusions," said the coroner pompously, "are for us to
arrive at, not for you to declare. The case," he then said, turning
toward the doctors and the young detective, "is entirely changed by
the hearing of Miss Dupuy's testimony. The fact that the note was
not written by Miss Van Norman, will, I'm sure, remove from the
minds of the doctors the possibility of suicide."</p>

<p>"It certainly will," said Doctor Leonard. "I quite agree with
Doctor Hills that except for the note all evidence is against the
theory of suicide."</p>

<p>"Then," went on Mr. Benson, "if it is not a suicide, Miss Van
Norman must have been the victim of foul play, and it is our duty
to investigate the matter, and attempt to discover whose hand it
was that wielded the fatal dagger."</p>

<p>Mr. Benson was fond of high-sounding words and phrases, and,
finding himself in charge of what promised to be a mysterious, if
not a celebrated, case, he made the most of his authoritative
position.</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden paid little attention to the coroner's speech.
His brain was working rapidly, and he was trying to piece together
such data as he had already accumulated in the way of evidence. It
was but little, to be sure, and in lieu of definite clues he
allowed himself to speculate a little on the probabilities. But he
realized that he was in the presence of a mysterious murder case,
and he was more than willing to do anything he could toward
discovering the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>The known facts were so appalling, and any evidence of
undiscovered facts was as yet so extremely slight, that Fessenden
felt there was a great deal to be done.</p>

<p>He was trying to collect and systematize his own small fund of
information when he realized that the audience was being
dismissed.</p>

<p>Mr. Benson announced that he would convene a jury and hold an
inquest that same afternoon, and then he would expect all those now
present to return as witnesses.</p>

<p>Without waiting to learn what the others did, Fessenden turned
to Kitty French, and asked her to go with him for a stroll.</p>

<p>"You need fresh air," he said, as they stepped from the veranda;
"but, also, I need you to talk to. I can formulate my ideas better
if I express then aloud, and you are such a clear-headed and
sympathetic listener that it helps a lot."</p>

<p>Kitty smiled with pleasure at the compliment, then her pretty
face became grave again as she remembered what must be the subject
of their conversation.</p>

<p>"Before I talk to the lawyers or detectives who will doubtless
soon infest the house, I want to straighten out my own ideas."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can have any," said Kitty; "I mean, of
course, any definite ideas about who committed the murder."</p>

<p>"I haven't really definite ones, but I want you to help me get
some."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kitty, looking provokingly lovely in her serious
endeavor to be helpful, "let's sit down here and talk it over."</p>

<p>"Here" was a sort of a rustic arbor, which was a delightful
place for a tete-a-tete, but not at all conducive to deep thought
or profound conversation.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Kitty, pursing her red lips and puckering her
white brow in her determination to supply the help that was
required of her.</p>

<p>"But I can't go on, if you look like that! All logic and
deduction fly out of my head, and I can think only of poetry and
romance. And it won't do! At least, not now. Can't you try to give
a more successful imitation of a coroner's jury?" Kitty tried to
look stupid and wise, both at once, and only succeeded in looking
bewitching.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Fessenden; "I can't sit facing you, as I
would the real thing in the way of juries. So I'll sit beside you,
and look at the side of that distant barn, while we talk."</p>

<p>So he turned partly round, and, fixing his gaze on the stolid
red barn, said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Who wrote that paper?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Kitty, feeling that she couldn't help much
here.</p>

<p>"Somehow, I can't seem to believe that Dupuy girl wrote it. She
sounded to me like a lady reciting a fabrication."</p>

<p>"I thought that, too," said Kitty. "I never liked Cicely,
because I never trusted her. But Maddy was very fond of her, and
she wouldn't have been, unless she had found Cicely
trustworthy."</p>

<p>"Come to luncheon, you two," said Tom Willard, as he approached
the arbor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Willard," said Kitty, "who do you think wrote that
paper?"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Dupuy," said Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>"She owned up to it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but I'm not sure she told the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't know why she shouldn't," said Tom, thoughtfully. And
then he added gently, "And, after looking at it closely, I felt
sure, myself, it wasn't Maddy's writing, after all."</p>

<p>"Then it must be Cicely's," said Kitty. "I admit I can't tell
them apart."</p>

<p>And then the three went back to the house.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br>
The Will</h3>

<p>Immediately after luncheon Lawyer Peabody came. This gentleman
had had charge of the Van Norman legal matters for many years, and
it was known by most of those present that he was bringing with him
such wills or other documents as might have a bearing on the
present crisis.</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody was an old man; moreover, he had for many years been
intimately associated with the Van Norman household, and had been a
close friend of both Richard Van Norman and Madeleine. Shattered
and broken by the sad tragedy in the household, he could scarcely
repress his emotion when he undertook to address the little
audience.</p>

<p>But the main purport of his business there at that time was to
announce the contents of the two wills in his possession.</p>

<p>The first one, the will of Richard Van Norman, was no surprise
to any one present, except perhaps those few who did not live in
Mapleton. One of these, Robert Fessenden, was extremely interested
to learn that because of Madeleine's death before her marriage, and
also before she was twenty-three years of age, the large fortune of
Richard Van Norman, which would have been hers on her wedding day,
passed at once and unrestrictedly to Tom Willard.</p>

<p>But also by the terms of Richard Van Norman's will the fine old
mansion and grounds and a sum of money, modest in comparison with
the whole fortune, but ample to maintain the estate, were
Madeleine's own, and had been from the day of her uncle's
death.</p>

<p>Possessed of this property, therefore, Madeleine had made a will
which was dated a few months before her death, and which Mr.
Peabody now read.</p>

<p>After appropriate and substantial bequests to several intimate
friends, to her housekeeper and secretary, and to all the servants,
Madeleine devised that her residuary fortune and the Van Norman
house and grounds should become the property of Miss Elizabeth
Morton.</p>

<p>This was a complete surprise to all, with the possible exception
of Miss Morton herself. It was not easy to judge from her haughty
and self-satisfied countenance whether she had known of this before
or not.</p>

<p>Fessenden, who was watching her closely, was inclined to think
she had known of it, and again his busy imagination ran riot. The
first point, he thought to himself, in discovering a potential
murderer, is to inquire who will be benefited by the victim's
death. Apparently the only ones to profit by the passing of
Madeleine Van Norman were Tom Willard and Miss Morton. But even the
ingenious imagination of the young detective balked at the idea of
connecting either of these two with the tragedy. He knew Willard
had not been in the house at the time of the murder, and Miss
Morton, as he had chanced to discover, had occupied a room on the
third floor. Moreover, it was absurd on the face of things to fancy
a well-bred, middle-aged lady stealing downstairs at dead of night
to kill her charming young hostess!</p>

<p>It was with a sense of satisfaction therefore that Fessenden
assured himself that he had formed no suspicions whatever, and
could listen with a mind entirely unprejudiced to such evidence as
the coroner's inquiry might bring forth.</p>

<p>He was even glad that he had not discussed the matter further
with Kitty French. He still thought she had clear vision and good
judgment, but he had begun to realize that in her presence his own
clearness of vision was dazzled by her dancing eyes and a certain
distracting charm which he had never before observed in any
woman.</p>

<p>But he told himself somewhat sternly that feminine charm must
not be allowed to interfere with the present business in hand, and
he seated himself at a considerable distance from Kitty French,
when it was time for the inquest.</p>

<p>A slight delay was occasioned by waiting for Coroner Benson's
own stenographer, but when he arrived the inquiry was at once
begun.</p>

<p>At the request of Miss Morton, or, it might rather be said, at
her command, the whole assembly had moved to the drawing-room, it
being a much larger and more airy apartment, and withal less
haunted by the picture of the tragedy itself.</p>

<p>And yet to hold a coroner's inquiry in a room gay with wedding
decorations was almost, if not quite, as ghastly.</p>

<p>But Coroner Benson paid no heed to emotional considerations and
conducted himself with the same air of justice and legality as if
he had been in a court-room or the town-hall.</p>

<p>As for the jury he had gathered, the half-dozen men, though
filled with righteous indignation at the crime committed in their
village, wasted no thought on the incongruity of their
surroundings.</p>

<p>Coroner Benson put his first question to Mrs. Markham, as he
considered her, in a way at least, the present head of the
household. To be sure, the house now legally belonged to Miss
Morton, and that lady was quickly assuming an added air of
importance which was doubtless the result of her recent
inheritance; but Mrs. Markham was still housekeeper, and by virtue
of her long association with the place, Mr. Benson chose to treat
her with exceeding courtesy and deference.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Markham, though now quite composed and willing to
answer questions, could give no evidence of any importance. She
testified that she had seen Madeleine last at about ten o'clock the
night before. This was after the guests who had been at dinner had
gone away, and the house guests had gone to their rooms. Miss Van
Norman was alone in the library, and as Mrs. Markham left her she
asked her to send Cicely Dupuy to the library. Mrs. Markham had
then gone directly to her own room, which was on the second floor,
above the drawing-room. It was at the front of the house, and the
room behind it, also over the long drawing-room, was the one now
devoted to the exhibition of Madeleine's wedding gifts. Mrs.
Markham had retired almost immediately and had heard no unusual
sounds. She explained, however, that she was somewhat deaf, and had
there been any disturbance downstairs it was by no means probable
that she would have heard it.</p>

<p>"What was the first intimation you had that anything had
happened?" asked Mr. Benson.</p>

<p>"Kitty French came to my door and called to me. Her excited
voice made me think something was wrong, and, dressing hastily, I
came downstairs, to find many of the household already
assembled."</p>

<p>"And then you went into the library?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had no idea Madeleine was dead. I thought she had
fainted, and I went toward her at once."</p>

<p>"Did you touch her?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I saw at once she was not living, but Miss Morton said
perhaps she might be, and then she telephoned for Doctor
Hills."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me if the house is carefully locked at night?"</p>

<p>"It is, I am sure; but it is not in my province to attend to
it."</p>

<p>"Whose duty is it?"</p>

<p>"That of Harris, the butler."</p>

<p>"Will you please call Harris at once?" Mr. Benson's tone of
finality seemed to dismiss Mrs. Markham as a witness, and she rang
the bell for the butler.</p>

<p>Harris came in, a perfect specimen of that type of butler that
is so similar to a certain type of bishop.</p>

<p>Aside from the gravity of the occasion, he seemed to show a
separate gravity of position, of importance, and of all-embracing
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Your name is Harris?" said Mr. Benson. "Yes, sir; James Harris,
sir."</p>

<p>"You have been employed in this house for some years?"</p>

<p>"Seventeen years and more, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it your duty to lock up the house at night?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir. Mr. Van Norman was most particular about it, sir,
being as how the house is alone like in the grounds, and there
being so much trees and shrubberies about."</p>

<p>"There are strong bolts to doors and windows?"</p>

<p>"Most especial strong, sir. It was Mr. Van. Norman's wish to
make it impossible for burglars to get in."</p>

<p>"And did he succeed in this?"</p>

<p>"He did, sir, for sure. There are patent locks on every door and
window, more than one on most of them; and whenever Mr. Van Norman
heard of a new kind of lock, he'd order it at once."</p>

<p>"Is the house fitted with burglar alarms?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; Mr. Van Norman depended on his safety locks and strong
bolts. He said he didn't want no alarm, because it was forever
getting out o' kilter, and bolts were surer, after all."</p>

<p>"And every night you make sure that these bolts and fastenings
are all secured in place?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir, and I have done it for many years."</p>

<p>"You looked after them last night, as usual?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sir; every one of them I attended to myself."</p>

<p>"You can testify, then, that the house could not have been
entered by a burglar last night?" asked Mr. Benson.</p>

<p>"Not by a burglar, nor by nobody else, sir, unless they broke
down a door or cut out a pane of glass."</p>

<p>"Yet Mr. Carleton came in."</p>

<p>Harris looked annoyed. "Of course, sir, anybody could come in
the front door with a latch-key. I didn't mean that they couldn't.
But all the other doors and windows were fastened all right, and I
found them all right this morning."</p>

<p>"You made a careful examination of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Of course we was all up through the night, and as
soon as I learned that Miss Madeleine was&mdash;was gone, sir, I
felt I ought to look about a bit. And everything was as right as
could be, sir. No burglar was into this house last night, sir."</p>

<p>"How about the cellar?"</p>

<p>"We never bother much about the cellar, sir, as there's nothing
down there to steal, unless they take the furnace or the gas-meter.
But the door at the top of the cellar stairs, as opens into the
hall, sir, is locked every night with a double lock and a bolt
besides."</p>

<p>"Then no burglar could come up through the cellar way?"</p>

<p>"That he couldn't, sir. Nor yet down through the skylight, for
the skylight is bolted every night same as the windows."</p>

<p>"And the windows on the second floor&mdash;are they fastened at
night?"</p>

<p>"They are in the halls, sir. But of course in the bedrooms I
don't know how they may be. That is, the occupied bedrooms. When
the guest rooms are vacant I always fasten those windows."</p>

<p>"Then you can testify, Harris, that there was no way for any one
to enter this house last night except at the front door with a
latch-key or through the window of some occupied bedroom?"</p>

<p>"I can swear to that, sir."</p>

<p>"You are sure you've overlooked no way? No back window, or
seldom-used door?"</p>

<p>Harris was a little hurt at this insistent questioning, but the
coroner recognized that this was a most important bit of evidence,
and so pressed his questions.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, sir. Mr. Van Norman taught me to be most
thorough about this matter, and I've never done different since
Miss Madeleine has been mistress here."</p>

<p>"That is all, thank you, Harris. You may go." Harris went away,
his honest countenance showing a look of relief that his ordeal was
over, and yet betokening a perplexed anxiety also.</p>

<p>Cicely Dupuy was next called upon to give her evidence, or
rather to continue the testimony which she had begun in the
library. The girl had a pleasanter expression than she had shown at
the previous questioning, but a red spot burned in either cheek,
and she was clearly trying to be calm, though really under stress
of a great excitement.</p>

<p>"You were with Miss Van Norman in the library last evening?"
began Mr. Benson, speaking more gently than he had been doing, for
he feared an emotional outburst might again render this witness
unavailable.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Dupuy, in a low tone; "when Mrs. Markham came
upstairs she stopped at my door and said Miss Van Norman wanted me,
and I went down immediately."</p>

<p>"You have been Miss Van Norman's secretary for some time?"</p>

<p>"For nearly five years."</p>

<p>"What were your duties?"</p>

<p>"I attended to her social correspondence; helped her with her
accounts, both household and personal; read to her, and often did
errands and made calls for her."</p>

<p>"She was kind to you?"</p>

<p>"She was more than kind. She treated me always as her social
equal, and as her friend." Cicely's blue eyes filled with tears,
and her voice quivered as she spoke this tribute to her
employer.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Benson feared she would break down, and changed his
course of questioning.</p>

<p>"At what time did you go to the library last evening?"</p>

<p>"It could not have been more than a few minutes past ten."</p>

<p>"What did you do there?"</p>

<p>"Miss Van Norman dictated some lists of matters to be attended
to, and she discussed with me a few final arrangements for her
wedding."</p>

<p>"Did she seem about as usual in her manner?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;except that she was very tired, and seemed a little
preoccupied."</p>

<p>"And then she dismissed you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She told me to go to bed, and said that she should sit up
for an hour or so, and would write some notes herself."</p>

<p>"Apparently she did not do so, as no notes have been found in
the library."</p>

<p>"That must be so, sir."</p>

<p>But as she said this, a change came over Miss Dupuy's face. She
seemed to think that the absence of those notes was of startling
importance, and though she tried not to show her agitation, it was
clearly evident from the way she bit her lower lip, and clenched
her fingers.</p>

<p>"At what time did Miss Van Norman dismiss you?" asked Mr.
Benson, seeming to ignore her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"At half-past ten."</p>

<p>"Did you retire at once?"</p>

<p>"No; I had some notes to write for Miss Van Norman, and also
some of my own, and I sat at my desk for some time. I don't know
just how long."</p>

<p>"And then what happened?"</p>

<p>At this question Cicely Dupuy became more nervous and
embarrassed than ever. She hesitated and then made two or three
attempts to speak, each one of which resulted in no intelligible
sound.</p>

Some Testimony</h3>

<p>"There is nothing to fear," said Mr. Benson kindly. "Simply tell
us what you heard while sitting there writing, that caused you to
leave your room."</p>

<p>Glancing around as if in search of some one, Cicely finally
managed to make an audible reply. "I heard a loud cry," she said,
"that sounded as if somebody were frightened or in danger. I
naturally ran out into the hall, and, looking over the baluster, I
saw Mr. Carleton in the hall below. I felt sure then that it was he
who had cried out, so I came downstairs."</p>

<p>"At what time was this?"</p>

<p>"At half-past eleven exactly."</p>

<p>"How do you know so accurately?"</p>

<p>"Because as I came downstairs the old clock on the middle
landing chimed the half-hour. It has a deep soft note, and it
struck just as I passed the clock, and it startled me a little, so
of course I remember it perfectly."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;" Cicely again hesitated, but with a visible
effort resumed her speech&mdash; "why, and then I came on down, and
found Mr. Carleton nearly distracted. I could not guess what was
the matter. He was turning on the lights and ringing the servants'
bells and acting like a man beside himself. Then in a moment Marie
appeared, and gave one of her French shrieks that completely upset
what little nerve I had left."</p>

<p>"And what did you do next?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I went into the library."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Cicely looked up suddenly, as if startled, but after only an
instant's hesitation replied:</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Carleton pointed toward the doorway, and Marie and
I went in together."</p>

<p>"You knew at once that Miss Van Norman was not alive?"</p>

<p>"I was not sure, but Marie went toward her, and then turned away
with another of her horrid screams, and I felt that Miss Van Norman
must be dead."</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Carleton say?"</p>

<p>"He said nothing. He&mdash;he pointed to the written paper on
the table."</p>

<p>"Which you had written yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he didn't know that." Cicely spoke eagerly, as if
saying something of importance. "He thought she wrote it."</p>

<p>"Never mind that point for the moment. But I must now ask you to
explain that written message which you have declared that you
yourself wrote."</p>

<p>At this Cicely's manner changed. She became again the obstinate
and defiant woman who had answered the coroner's earlier
questions.</p>

<p>"I refuse to explain it."</p>

<p>"Consider a moment," said Mr. Benson quietly. "Sooner or
later&mdash;perhaps at a trial&mdash;you will be obliged to explain
this matter. How much better, then, to confide in us now, and
perhaps lead to an immediate solution of the mystery."</p>

<p>Cicely pondered a moment, then she said, "I have nothing to
conceal, I will tell you. I did write that paper, and it was the
confession of my heart. I am very miserable, and when I wrote it I
quite intended to take my own life. When I was called to go to Miss
Van Norman in the library, I gathered up some notes and lists from
my desk to take to her. In my haste I must have included that paper
without knowing it, for when I reached my room I could not find it.
And then&mdash;then when I saw it&mdash;there on the table&mdash;I"
Cicely had again grown nervous and excited. Her voice trembled, her
eyes filled with tears, and, fearing a nervous collapse, Mr. Benson
hurried on to other questions.</p>

<p>"Whom does that S. in your note stand for."</p>

<p>"That I shall never tell." The determination in her voice
convinced him that it was useless to insist on that point, so the
coroner went on.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have no right to ask. Now you must tell me some
other things, and, believe me, my questions are not prompted by
curiosity, but are necessary to the discovery of the truth. Why did
Mr. Carleton point to that paper?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he seemed so shocked and stunned that he was almost
unable to speak. I suppose he thought that would explain why she
had killed herself."</p>

<p>"But she hadn't killed herself."</p>

<p>"But he thought she had, and he thought that paper proved
it."</p>

<p>"But why had he need to prove it, and to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't know what he thought! I don't know what I
thought myself after I reached the library door and looked in and
saw that dreadful sight! Oh, I shall see it all my life!" At the
memory Cicely broke down again and sank into her chair, shaking
with convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>Mr. Benson did not disturb her further, but proceeded to
question the others.</p>

<p>The account of Marie, the maid, merely served to corroborate
what Cicely had said. Marie, too, had heard Carleton's cry for
help, and, throwing on a dressing-gown, had run down-stairs to
Madeleine's room. Not finding her mistress there, she had hurried
down to the first floor, reaching the lower hall but a few minutes
after Cicely did. She said also that it was just about half-past
eleven by the clock in her own room when she heard Mr. Carleton's
cry.</p>

<p>"You knew who it was that had called out so loudly?" asked Mr.
Benson.</p>

<p>"No, m'sieu; I heard only the shriek as of one in great
disaster. I ran to Miss Van Norman's room, as that was my first
duty."</p>

<p>"Were you not in attendance upon her?"</p>

<p>"No; she had sent me the message by Miss Dupuy, that I need not
attend her when she retired."</p>

<p>"Did this often occur?"</p>

<p>"Not often; but sometimes when Miss Van Norman sat up late, by
herself, she would excuse me at an earlier hour. She was most kind
and considerate of everybody."</p>

<p>"Then when at last you saw Miss Van Norman in the library, what
did you do?"</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! I shrieked! Why not? I was amazed, shocked, but,
above all, desolated! It was a cruel scene. I knew not what to do,
so, naturally, I shrieked."</p>

<p>Marie's French shrug almost convinced her hearers that truly
that was the only thing to do on such an occasion.</p>

<p>"And now," said Coroner Benson, "can you tell us of anything,
any incident or any knowledge of your own, that will throw any
light on this whole matter?"</p>

<p>Marie's pretty face took on a strange expression. It was not
fear or terror, but a sort of perplexity. She gave a furtive glance
at Mr. Carleton and then at Miss Morton, and hesitated.</p>

<p>At last she spoke, slowly:</p>

<p>"If monsieur could perhaps word his question a little
differently&mdash;with more of a definiteness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well; do you know anything of Miss Van Norman's private
affairs that would assist us in discovering who killed her."</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," said Marie promptly, and with a look of
relief.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Van Norman ever, in the slightest way, express any
intention or desire to end her life?"</p>

<p>"Never, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Do you think she was glad and happy in the knowledge of her
fast-approaching wedding-day?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it;" and Marie's tone was that of one who well
knew whereof she spoke.</p>

<p>"That is all, then, for the present;" and Marie, with another
sidelong, curious glance at Miss Morton, resumed her seat.</p>

<p>Kitty French and Molly Gardner were questioned, but they told
nothing that would throw any light on the matter. They had heard
the cry, and while hastily dressing had heard the general commotion
in the house. They had thought it must be a fire, and not until
they reached the library did they know what had really
happened.</p>

<p>"And then," said Kitty indignantly, in conclusion of her own
recital, "we were not allowed to stay with the others, but were
sent to our rooms. So how can we give any evidence?"</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen, Miss French felt herself defrauded of
an opportunity that should have been hers, but Miss Gardner was of
quite a different mind. She answered in whispered monosyllables the
questions put by the coroner, and as she knew no more than Kitty of
the whole matter, she was not questioned much.</p>

<p>Robert Fessenden smiled a little at the different attitudes of
the two girls. He knew Kitty was eager to hear all the exciting
details, while Molly shrank from the whole subject. However, as
they were such minor witnesses, the coroner paid little serious
attention to them or to their statements.</p>

<p>Miss Morton's testimony came next. Fessenden regarded her with
interest, as, composed and calm, she waited the coroner's
interrogations.</p>

<p>She was deliberate and careful in making her replies, and it
seemed to the young detective as if she knew nothing whatever about
the whole affair, but was trying to imply that she knew a great
deal.</p>

<p>"You went to your room when the others did, at about ten
o'clock?" asked Mr. Benson.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I did not retire at once."</p>

<p>"Did you hear any sounds that caused you alarm?"</p>

<p>"No, not alarm. Curiosity, perhaps, but that is surely
pardonable to a naturally timid woman in a strange house."</p>

<p>"Then you did hear sounds. Can you describe them?"</p>

<p>"I do not think they were other than those made by the servants
attending to their duties. But the putting on of coal or the
fastening of windows are noticeable sounds when one is not
accustomed to them."</p>

<p>"You could discern, then, that it was the shovelling of coal or
the fastening of windows that you heard?"</p>

<p>"No, I could not. My hearing is extremely acute, but as my room
is on the third floor, all the sounds I heard were faint and
muffled."</p>

<p>"Did you hear Mr. Carleton's cry for help?"</p>

<p>"I did, but at that distance it did not sound loud. However, I
was sufficiently alarmed to open my door and step out into the
hall. I had not taken off my evening gown, and, seeing bright
lights downstairs, of course I immediately went down. The household
was nearly all assembled when I reached the library. I saw at once
what had happened, and I saw, too, that Mrs. Markham and the
younger women were quite frantic with fright and excitement. I
thought it my duty therefore to take up the reins of government,
and I took the liberty of telephoning for the doctor. I think there
is nothing more of importance that I can tell you."</p>

<p>At this Fessenden barely repressed a smile, for he could not see
that Miss Morton had told anything of importance at all.</p>

<p>"I would like," said Mr. Benson, "for you to inform us as to
your relations with the Van Norman household. Have you been long
acquainted with Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>"About two years," replied Miss Morton, with a snapping together
of her teeth, which was one of her many peculiarities of
manner.</p>

<p>"And how did the acquaintance come about?"</p>

<p>"Her uncle and I were friends many years ago," said Miss Morton.
"I knew Richard Van Norman before Madeleine was born. We
quarrelled, and I never saw him again. After his death Madeleine
wrote to me, and several letters passed between us. At her
invitation I made a short visit here about a year ago. Again, at
her invitation, I came here yesterday to be present at her
wedding." Miss Morton's manner, though quiet, betokened repressed
excitement rather than suppressed emotion. In no way did her hard,
bright eyes show grief or sorrow, but they flashed in a way that
indicated high nervous pressure.</p>

<p>"Did you know that you were to inherit this house and a large
sum of money at Miss Van Norman's death?" The question was thrown
at her so suddenly that Miss Morton almost gasped.</p>

<p>She hesitated for an appreciable instant, then with a sudden
snap of her strong, angular jaw, she said, "No!"</p>

<p>"You had no intimation of it whatever?"</p>

<p>"No." Again that excessive decision of manner, which to
Fessenden's mind, at least, stultified rather than corroborated the
verity of her statement.</p>

<p>But Coroner Benson expressed no doubt of his witness, but merely
said casually:</p>

<p>"Yet, on the occasion of the tragedy last night, you at once
assumed the attitude of the head of the house. You gave orders to
the servants, you took up the reins of management, and seemed to
anticipate the fact that the house was eventually to be your
own."</p>

<p>Miss Morton looked aghast. If one chose to think so, she looked
as if detected in a false statement. Glancing round the room, she
saw the eyes of Kitty French and of Marie, the maid, intently fixed
on her. This seemed to unnerve her, and in a broken, trembling
voice, almost a whine, she said:</p>

<p>"If I did so, it was only with a helpful motive. Mrs. Markham
was so collapsed with the shock she had just sustained, that she
was really incapable of giving orders. If I did so, it was only
from a desire to be of service."</p>

<p>This seemed indeed plausible, and the most casual observer would
know that Miss Morton's "helpfulness" could only be accomplished in
a peremptory and dictatorial manner.</p>

<p>"Will you tell us why Miss Van Norman chose to leave you so
large a bequest, when she had known you so slightly?" asked Mr.
Benson.</p>

<p>Fessenden thought Miss Morton would resent this question, but
instead she answered, willingly enough:</p>

<p>"Because she knew that except for my unfortunate quarrel with
Richard Van Norman, many years ago, the place would have been mine
any way."</p>

<p>"You mean you were to have married Mr. Van Norman."</p>

<p>"I mean just that."</p>

<p>Miss Morton looked a little defiant, but also an air of pride
tinged her statement, and she seemed to be asserting her lifelong
right to the property.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Norman, then, knew of your friendship with her uncle,
and the reason of its cessation?"</p>

<p>"She learned of it about two years ago."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"By finding some letters of mine among Mr. Van Norman's papers,
shortly after his death."</p>

<p>"And in consequence of that discovery she willed you this house
at her death?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is, I suppose she must have done so &mdash;as she did
so will it."</p>

<p>"But you did not know of it, and the reading of the will was to
you a surprise?"</p>

<p>"Yes," declared Miss Morton, and though the coroner then
dismissed her without comment on her statements, there were several
present who did not believe the lady spoke veraciously.</p>

<p>Tom Willard was called next, and Fessenden wondered what could
be the testimony of a man who had not arrived on the scene until
more than two hours after the deed was done.</p>

<p>And indeed there was little that Tom could say. Mr. Benson asked
him to detail his own movements after he left the house the night
before.</p>

<p>"There's little to tell," said Tom, "but I'll try to be exact. I
went away from this house about ten o'clock, taking with me a
suit-case full of clothes. I went directly to the Mapleton Inn, and
though I don't know exactly, I should say I must have reached there
in something less than ten minutes. Then I went to the office of
the establishment, registered, and asked for a room. The proprietor
gave me a good enough room, a bellboy picked up my bag, and I went
to my room at once."</p>

<p>"And remained there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; later I rang for some ice water, which the same boy
brought to me. Directly after that I turned in. I slept soundly
until awakened by a knocking at my door at about two o'clock in the
morning."</p>

<p>"The message from this house?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The landlord himself stood there when I opened the door,
and told me I was wanted on the telephone. When I went to the
telephone I heard Miss Morton's voice, and she asked me to come
over here. I came as quickly as possible, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom's voice broke at this point, and, feeling that his story was
finished, Mr. Benson considerately asked him no further
questions.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br>
"I Decline to Say"</h3>

<p>Schuyler Carleton was questioned next, When Mr. Benson asked him
to tell his story, he hesitated and finally said that he would
prefer to have the coroner ask direct questions, which he would
answer.</p>

<p>"Did you go away from this house with the other guests at about
ten o'clock last evening?"</p>

<p>"No, I was not here at dinner. I left at about half-past five in
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"I went directly home and remained there until late in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fessenden was with you?"</p>

<p>"He was with us at dinner. He is staying at my house, as he was
invited to be best man at the wedding."</p>

<p>Though this statement came calmly from Carleton's lips, it was
evident to all that he fully appreciated the tragic picture it
suggested.</p>

<p>"He was with you through the evening?"</p>

<p>"Part of the time. He went early to his room, saying he had some
business to attend to."</p>

<p>"Why were you two not here to dinner with Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>Fessenden looked up, surprised at this question. Surely Mr.
Benson had gathered odd bits of information since morning.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton looked stern.</p>

<p>"I did not come because I did not wish to. Mr. Fessenden
remained with me, saying he did not care to attend the dinner
unless I did."</p>

<p>Carleton looked casually at Fessenden as he said this, and
though there was no question in the glance, Rob nodded his head in
corroboration of the witness.</p>

<p>"You spent the entire evening at home, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, until a late hour."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I returned here between eleven and twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"To make a call?"</p>

<p>"No, I came upon an errand."</p>

<p>"What was the errand?"</p>

<p>"As it has no bearing upon the case, I think it is my privilege
to decline to answer."</p>

<p>"You entered the house with a latch-key."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Is that latch-key your own property?"</p>

<p>"For the time, yes. Mrs. Markham gave it to me a few days ago,
for my convenience, because I have occasion to come to the house so
frequently."</p>

<p>"Was it your intention when you went away in the afternoon to
return later?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"Upon this secret errand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you expect to see Miss Van Norman when you entered the
house with the latch-key?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"And when you entered you discovered the tragedy in the
library?"</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton hesitated. His dry lips quivered and his whole
frame shook with intense emotion. "Y-yes," he stammered.</p>

<p>But the mere fact of that hesitation instantly kindled a spark
of suspicion in the minds of some of his hearers. Until that moment
Carleton's excessive agitation had been attributed entirely to his
grief at the awful fate which had come to his fianc&eacute;e; but
now, all at once, the man's demeanor gave an impression of
something else.</p>

<p>Could it be guilt?</p>

<p>Fessenden looked at his friend curiously. In his mind, however,
no slightest suspicion was aroused, but he wondered what it was
that Carleton was keeping back. Surely the man must know that to
make any mystery about his call at the Van Norman mansion the night
before, was to invite immediate and justifiable suspicion.</p>

<p>The court had instructed the district attorney to be present at
the inquest, and though that unobtrusive gentleman had taken notes,
and otherwise shown a quiet interest in the proceedings, he now
awakened to a more alert manner, and leaned forward to get a better
look at the white, set face of the witness.</p>

<p>Carleton looked like a marble image. His refined, patrician
features seemed even handsomer for their haggard agony. Surely he
was in no way responsible for the awful deed that had been done,
and yet just as surely he was possessed of some awful secret fear
which kept every nerve strained and tense.</p>

<p>Endeavoring not to exhibit the surprise and dismay which he
felt, Coroner Benson continued his questions.</p>

<p>"And then, when you discovered Miss Van Norman, what did you
do?"</p>

<p>Carleton passed his hand across his white brow. "I hardly know,"
he said. "I was stunned&mdash;dazed. I went toward her, and, seeing
the dagger on the floor, I picked it up mechanically, scarcely
knowing what I did. I felt intuitively that the girl was dead, but
I did not touch her, and, not knowing what else to do, I cried out
for help."</p>

<p>"And turned on the lights?"</p>

<p>"I pushed several electric buttons, not knowing which were
lights and which bells; my principal idea was to arouse the inmates
of the house at once."</p>

<p>"Who first appeared in answer to your call?"</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy came running downstairs at once, followed by Miss
Van Norman's maid."</p>

<p>"And then you pointed to the paper that lay on the table near
Miss Van Norman's hand."</p>

<p>"Yes; I could not speak, and I thought that would tell Miss
Dupuy that Miss Van Norman had taken her own life."</p>

<p>"You thought, then, that Miss Van Norman wrote the message?"</p>

<p>"I thought so then&mdash;and I think so now."</p>

<p>This, of course, produced a sensation, but it was only evidenced
by a deeper silence on the part of the startled audience.</p>

<p>"But Miss Dupuy asserts that she wrote it," said the
coroner.</p>

<p>To this Schuyler Carleton merely gave a slight bow of his
handsome head, but it said as plainly as words that his belief was
not altered by Miss Dupuy's assertion.</p>

<p>"Granting for the moment, then," went on Mr. Benson, "that Miss
Van Norman did write it, is the message intelligible to you?"</p>

<p>"Intelligible, yes;" said Carleton, "but, as I have said before,
inexplicable."</p>

<p>This ambiguous speech meant little to most of the listeners, but
it seemed to give Robert Fessenden food for thought, and he looked
at Carleton with a new wonder in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carleton," said the coroner, with a note of gravity in his
voice, "I think it my duty to tell you that your own interests
require you to state the nature of your errand to this house last
night."</p>

<p>"I decline to do so."</p>

<p>"Then, will you state as exactly as you can the hour at which
you entered the front door?"</p>

<p>"I don't know precisely. But Miss Dupuy has testified that she
came downstairs in response to my call at half-past eleven. I came
into the house a&mdash;a few moments before."</p>

<p>"That is all," said the coroner abruptly. "Mr. Hunt, if you
please."</p>

<p>The man from headquarters, who had guarded the present room
through the night, came in from the doorway where he had been
standing.</p>

<p>"Will you tell what you know concerning Mr. Carleton's entrance
last night?" said the coroner, briefly.</p>

<p>"I was on guard in the present room from nine o'clock on," said
Mr. Hunt. "Of course I was on the watch-out for anything unusual,
and alert to hear any sound. I heard the company go away at ten
o'clock, I heard most of the people in the house go to their rooms
right after that. I heard and I also saw Miss Dupuy go down to the
library after that, and return to her room about half-past ten. I
noticed all these things because that is my business, but they made
no special impression on me, as they were but the natural
proceedings of the people who belonged here. Of course I was only
on the lookout for intruders. I heard the sound of a latch-key and
I heard the front door open at exactly quarter after eleven. I
stepped out into the hall, and, looking downstairs, I saw Mr.
Carleton enter. I also saw Miss Dupuy in the upper hall looking
over the banister. She, too, must have seen Mr. Carleton. But as
all of this was none of my business, and as nobody had entered who
hadn't a right to, I simply returned to my post. At half-past
eleven I heard Mr. Carleton's cry, and saw the lights go up all
over the house. Anything more, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not at present, Mr. Hunt. Miss Dupuy, did you hear Mr. Carleton
come in?"</p>

<p>Cicely Dupuy turned an angry face toward Mr. Hunt and fairly
glared at the mild-mannered man. She waited a moment before
answering the coroner's question, and then as if with a sudden
resolve she spoke a sharp, quick "Yes."</p>

<p>"And that was at quarter after eleven?"</p>

<p>"It was later," declared Cicely. "For Mr. Carleton told you
himself that he went directly into the library as soon as he came
into the house, and as I heard his cry at half-past eleven he must
have entered only a few moments before."</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton stared at Cicely, and she returned his
gaze.</p>

<p>His face was absolutely inscrutable, a pallid mask, that might
have concealed emotion of any sort. But there was a suggestion of
fear in the strange eyes, as they gazed at Cicely, and though it
was quickly suppressed it had been noted by those most
interested.</p>

<p>The girl looked straight at him, with determination written in
every line of her face. It was quite evident to the onlookers that
a mental message was passing between these two.</p>

<p>"You are sure, Mr. Hunt, that your statement as to the time is
correct?" said the coroner, turning again to him.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure, sir. It is my business to be sure of the
time."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carleton," said Mr. Benson, "there is an apparent
discrepancy here, which it is advisable for you to explain. If you
came into this house at quarter after eleven, and rang the bells
for help at half-past eleven, what were you doing in the
meantime?"</p>

<p>It was out at last. The coroner's question, though quietly put,
was equivalent to an accusation. Every eye in the room was turned
toward Carleton, and every ear waited in suspense for his
reply.</p>

<p>At last the answer came. The dazed, uncertain look had returned
to Carleton's face and his voice sounded mechanical, like that of
an automaton, as he replied, "I decline to say."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Carleton, you can scarcely realize the gravity of
the moment, or the mistake you are making in refusing to answer
this question."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," repeated Carleton, and his pallor
changed to a faint, angry flush of red.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Mr. Benson gently. He seemed to have lost his
pompous manner in his genuine anxiety for his witness, and he
looked sorrowfully at Carleton's impassive, yet stubborn face.</p>

<p>"As so much hinges on the question of who wrote that paper," he
resumed, "I will make a test now that ought to convince us all.
Miss Dupuy, you say that you wrote it, I believe."</p>

<p>"I did, yes, sir," said Cicely, stammering a little now, though
she had been calm enough a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"Then you know the words on the paper,&mdash;by rote?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Cicely, uncertain of where this was
leading.</p>

<p>"I will ask you, then, to take this paper and pencil, your own
pencil and write the same words in the same way once more."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me to do that!" implored Cicely, clasping her
hands and looking very distressed.</p>

<p>"I not only ask you, but I direct you to do it, and do it at
once."</p>

<p>An attendant handed pencil and paper to Cicely, and, after a
glance at Carleton, who did not meet it, she began to write.</p>

<p>Though evidently agitated, she wrote clearly and evenly, and the
paper she handed to Coroner Benson a moment later was practically
an exact duplicate of the one found on the library table.</p>

<p>"It does not require a handwriting expert," said the coroner,
"to declare that these two papers were written by the same hand.
The penmanship is indeed similar to Miss Van Norman's, of whose
writing I have here many specimens, but it is only similar. It is
by no means identical. You may all examine these at your leisure
and can only agree to what I say."</p>

<p>The district attorney, who had been comparing the papers, laid
them down with an air of finality that proved his agreement with
the statements made. "And so," went on Mr. Benson, "granting, as we
must, that Miss Dupuy wrote the paper, we have nothing whatever to
indicate that this case is a suicide. We are, therefore, seeking a
murderer, and our most earnest efforts must be made to that end. I
trust, Mr. Carleton, now that you can no longer think Miss Van
Norman wrote the message, that you will aid us in our work by
stating frankly how you were occupied during that quarter-hour
which elapsed between your entering the house and your raising the
alarm?"</p>

<p>But Carleton preserved his stony calm.</p>

<p>"There was no quarter-hour," he said; "I may have stepped into
the drawing-room a moment before going to the library, but I gave
the alarm almost immediately on entering the house. Certainly
immediately on my discovery of&mdash;of the scene in the
library."</p>

<p>Cicely looked defiantly at Mr. Hunt, who, in his turn, looked
perplexed. The man had no wish to insinuate anything against Mr.
Carleton, but as he had said, it was his business to know the time,
and he knew that Mr. Carleton came into the house at quarter after
eleven, and not at half-past.</p>

<p>The pause that followed was broken by Coroner Benson's voice.
"There is nothing more to be done at present. The inquest is
adjourned until to-morrow afternoon. But we have discovered that
there has been a crime committed. There is no doubt that Miss Van
Norman was murdered, and that the crime took place between
half-past ten and half-past eleven last night. It is our duty to
spare no effort to discover the criminal. As an audience you are
now dismissed."</p>

Dorothy Burt</h3>

<p>The people rose slowly from their chairs, and most of them
looked as if they did not quite comprehend what it all meant. Among
these was Carleton himself. He seemed oblivious to the fact that he
was&mdash;at least tacitly&mdash;an accused man, and stood quietly,
as if awaiting any further developments that might come.</p>

<p>"Look at Schuyler," said Kitty French to Fessenden. The two had
withdrawn to a quiet corner to discuss the affair. But Kitty was
doing most of the talking, while Fessenden was quiet and seemed
preoccupied. "Of course I suppose he must have killed Madeleine,"
went on Kitty, "but it's so hard to believe it, after all. I've
tried to think of a reason for it, and this is the only one I can
think of. They quarrelled yesterday afternoon, and he went away in
a huff. I believe he came back last night to make it up with her,
and then they quarrelled again and he stabbed her."</p>

<p>Fessenden looked at her thoughtfully. "I think that Hunt man
testified accurately," he said. "And if so, Carleton was in the
house just fifteen minutes before he gave the alarm. Now, fifteen
minutes is an awfully short time to quarrel with anybody so
desperately that it leads to a murder."</p>

<p>"That's true; but they both have very quick tempers. At least
Madeleine had. She didn't often do it, but when she did fly into a
fury it was as quick as a flash. I've never seen Mr. Carleton
angry, but I know he can be, for Maddy told me so."</p>

<p>"Still, a quarter of an hour is too short a time for a fatal
quarrel, I think. If Carleton killed her he came here for that
purpose, and it was done premeditatedly."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'if he killed her'? It's been proved she didn't
kill herself; it's been proved that no one could enter the house
without a latch-key, and it's been proved that the deed was done in
that one hour between half-past ten and half-past eleven. So it had
to be Mr. Carleton."</p>

<p>"Miss French, you have a logical mind, and I think you'd make a
clever little detective. But you have overlooked the possibility
that she was killed by some one in the house."</p>

<p>"Some of us?" Kitty's look of amazement almost made Fessenden
smile.</p>

<p>"Not you or Miss Gardner," he said. "But a burglar might have
been concealed in the house."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that!" exclaimed Kitty, her eyes opening
wide at the thought. "Why, he might have killed us all!"</p>

<p>"It isn't a very plausible theory," said Fessenden, unheeding
the girl's remark, "and yet I could think of nothing else. Every
instinct of my mind denies Carleton's guilt. Why, he isn't that
sort of a man!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he isn't as good as he looks," said Kitty, wagging her
head wisely. "I know a lot about him. You know he wasn't a bit in
love with Maddy."</p>

<p>"You hinted that before. And was he really a mere
fortune-hunter? I can't believe that of Carleton. I've known the
man for years."</p>

<p>"He must have been, or else why did he marry her? He's in love
with another girl."</p>

<p>"He is! Who?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who. But Madeleine hinted it to me only a few days
ago. It made her miserable. And that's why everybody thought she
wrote that paper that said, 'I love S., but he does not love
me.'"</p>

<p>"And you don't know who this rival is?"</p>

<p>"No, but I know what she's like. She's the 'clinging rosebud'
effect."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just that. You know Madeleine was a big, grand, splendid
type,&mdash;majestic and haughty; and she thought Schuyler loved
better some little, timid girl, who would sort of look up to him,
and need his protection."</p>

<p>Fessenden looked steadily at Miss French. "Are you imagining all
this," he said, "or is it true?"</p>

<p>"Both," responded Kitty, with a charming little smile. "Maddy
just hinted it to me, and I guessed the rest. You know, I have
detective instinct too, as well as you."</p>

<p>"You have, indeed;" and Rob gave an admiring glance to the
pouting red lips, and roguish eyes. "But tell me more about
it."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell," said Kitty, looking thoughtful, "but
there's a lot to deduce."</p>

<p>"Well, tell me what there is to tell, and then we'll both
deduce."</p>

<p>It pleased Kitty greatly to imagine she was really helping
Fessenden, and she went glibly on:</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Maddy was unhappy,&mdash;we all know
that,&mdash;and it was for some reason connected with Schuyler. Yet
they were to be married, all the same. But sometimes Maddy has
asked me, with such a wistful look, if I didn't think men preferred
little, kittenish girls to big, proud ones like herself."</p>

<p>"And you, being a little, kittenish girl, said yes?"</p>

<p>"Don't be rude," said Kitty, flashing a smile at him. "I am
kittenish in name only. And I am not little!"</p>

<p>"You are, compared to Miss Van Norman's type."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she was like a beautiful Amazon. Well, she either had
reason to think, or she imagined, that Schuyler pretended to love
her, and was really in love with some dear little clinging
rosebud."</p>

<p>"Clinging rosebud! What an absurd expression! And yet&mdash;by
Jove!&mdash;it just fits her! And Miss Van Norman said to
me&mdash;oh, I say, Miss French, don't you know who the rosebud
is."</p>

<p>"No," said Kitty, wondering at his sudden look of dismay.</p>

<p>"Well, I do! Oh, this is getting dreadful. Come outside with me
and let's look into this idea. I hope it's only an idea!"</p>

<p>Throwing a soft fawn-colored cape round her, and drawing its
pink-lined hood over her curly hair, Kitty went with Fessenden out
on the lawn and down to the little arbor where they had sat
before.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Dorothy Burt?" he asked, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"No; who is she?"&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Well, she's your 'clinging rosebud,' I'm sure of it! And I'll
tell you why."</p>

<p>"First tell me who she is."</p>

<p>"She's Mrs. Carleton's companion. Schuyler's mother, you know.
She lives in the Carleton household, and she is the sweetest,
prettiest, shyest little thing you ever saw! 'Clinging rosebud'
just fits her."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Kitty, who had suddenly lost interest in the
conversation. And indeed, few girls of Kitty's disposition would
have enjoyed this enthusiastic eulogy of another.</p>

<p>"I don't admire that sort, myself," went on Rob, who was
tactfully observant; "I like a little more spirit and vivacity."
Kitty beamed once more. "But she's a wonder, of her own class. I
was there at dinner last night, you know, and I saw her for the
first time. And, though I thought nothing of it at the time, I can
look back now and see that she adores Schuyler. Why, she scarcely
took her eyes off him at dinner, and she ate next to nothing. Poor
little girl, I believe she was awfully cut up at his approaching
marriage."</p>

<p>"And what was Schuyler's attitude toward her?" Kitty was
interested enough now.</p>

<p>Fessenden looked very grave and was silent for a time.</p>

<p>"It's a beastly thing to say," he observed at last, "but if
Schuyler had been in love with that girl, and wanted to conceal the
fact, he couldn't have acted differently from the way he did
act."</p>

<p>"Was he kind to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, kind, but with a restrained air, as if he felt it his duty
to show indifference toward her."</p>

<p>"Was she with you after dinner?"</p>

<p>Fessenden thought.</p>

<p>"I went to my room early; and Mrs. Carleton had then already
excused herself. Yes,&mdash;I left Schuyler and Miss Burt in the
drawing-room, and later I saw them from my window, strolling
through the rose-garden."</p>

<p>"On his wedding eve!" exclaimed Kitty, with a look akin to
horror in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I thought nothing of it, for I simply assumed that he
was devoted to Miss Van Norman, and was merely pleasant to his
mother's companion. But&mdash;in view of something Miss Van Norman
said to me yesterday&mdash;can it be it was only yesterday?&mdash;
the matter becomes serious."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"It seems like betraying a confidence, and yet it isn't, for we
must discover if it means anything. But she said to me, with real
agitation, 'Do you know Dorothy Burt?' At that time, I hadn't met
Miss Burt, and had never heard of her, so I said: 'No; who is she?'
'Nobody,' said Miss Van Norman, 'less than nobody! Never mention
her to me again!' Her voice, even more than her words, betokened
grief and even anger, so of course the subject was dropped. But
doesn't that prove her anxious about the girl, if not really
jealous?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does," said Kitty. "I know that's the one that has
been troubling Madeleine. Oh, how dreadful it all is!"</p>

<p>"And then, too," Fessenden said, still reminiscently, "Miss Van
Norman said she wanted to go away from Mapleton immediately after
her wedding, and never return here again."</p>

<p>"Did she say that! Then, of course, it was only so that Schuyler
should never see the Burt girl again. Poor, dear Maddy; she was so
proud, and so self-contained. But how she must have suffered! You
see, she knew Schuyler admired her, and respected her and all that,
and she must have thought that, once removed from the presence of
the rosebud girl, he would forget her."</p>

<p>"But I can't understand old Schuyler marrying Miss Van Norman if
he didn't truly love her. You know, Miss French, that man and I
have been stanch friends for years; and though I rarely see him, I
know his honorable nature, and I can't believe he would marry one
woman while loving another."</p>

<p>"He didn't," said Kitty in a meaning voice that expressed far
more than the words signified.</p>

<p>Fessenden drew back in horror.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he cried. "You can't mean that Schuyler put Miss Van
Norman out of the way to clear the path for Miss Burt!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean anything," said Kitty, rather contradictorily.
"But, as I said, Maddy was not killed by any one inside the
house&mdash;I'm sure of that&mdash;and no one from outside could
get in, except Schuyler&mdash;and he had a motive. Don't you
always, in detective work, look for the motive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is too horrible!"</p>

<p>"All murders are 'too horrible.' But I tell you it must have
been Schuyler&mdash;it couldn't have been Miss Burt!"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd! That little girl couldn't kill a fly, I'm
sure. I wish you could see her, Miss French. Then you'd understand
how her very contrast to Miss Van Norman's splendid beauty would
fascinate Schuyler. And I know he was fascinated. I saw it in his
repressed manner last evening, though I didn't realize it then as I
do now."</p>

<p>"I have a theory," said Kitty slowly. "You know Mr. Carleton
went away yesterday afternoon rather angry at Maddy. She had
carried her flirtation with Tom a little too far, and Mr. Carleton
resented it. I don't blame him,&mdash;the very day before the
wedding,&mdash;but it was partly his fault, too. Well, suppose he
went home, rather upset over the quarrel, and then seeing Miss
Burt, and her probably mild, angelic ways (I'm sure she has
them!)&mdash;suppose he wished he could be off with Maddy, and
marry Miss Burt instead."</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't kill his fianc&eacute;e, if he did think
that!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. Then suppose, after the evening in the
rose-garden with the gentle, clinging little girl, he concluded he
never could be happy with Maddy, and suppose he came at eleven
o'clock, or whatever time it was, to tell her so, and to ask her to
set him free."</p>

<p>"On the eve of the wedding day? With the house already in gala
dress for the ceremony?"</p>

<p>"Yes, suppose the very nearness of the ceremony made it seem to
him impossible to go through with it."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, and then suppose he did ask Madeleine to free him, and
suppose she refused. And she would refuse! I know her nature well
enough to know she never would give him up to the other girl if she
could help it. And then suppose, when she refused to free
him,&mdash;you know he has a fearfully quick temper, and that awful
paper-cutter lay right there, handy,&mdash;suppose he stabbed her
in a moment of desperate anger."</p>

<p>"I can't think it," said Rob, after a pause; "I've tried, and I
can't. But, suppose all you say is true as far as this; suppose he
asked her to free him, because he loved another, and suppose she
was so grieved and mortified at this, that in her own sudden fit of
angry jealousy,&mdash;you know she had a quick temper,
also,&mdash;suppose she picked up the dagger and turned it upon
herself, as she had sometimes said she would do."</p>

<p>Kitty listened attentively. "It might be so," she said slowly;
"you may be nearer the truth than I. But I do believe that one of
us must be right. Of course, this leaves the written paper out of
the question entirely."</p>

<p>"That written paper hasn't been thoroughly explained yet,"
exclaimed the young man. "Now, look here, Miss French, I'm not
going to wait to be officially employed on this case, though I am
going to offer Carleton my legal services, but I mean to do a
little investigating on my own account. The sooner inquiries are
made, the more information is usually obtained. Can you arrange
that I shall have an interview with Miss Dupuy?"</p>

<p>"I think I can," said Kitty; "but if you let it appear that
you're inquisitive she won't tell you a thing. Suppose we just talk
to her casually, you and I. I won't bother you."</p>

<p>"Indeed you won't. You'll be of first-class help. When can we
see her?"</p>

<p>While they had been talking, other things had been happening in
the drawing-room. The people who had been gathered there had all
disappeared, and, under the active superintendence of Miss Morton,
the florist's men who had put up the decorations were now taking
them away. The whole room was in confusion, and Kitty and Mr.
Fessenden were glad to escape to some more habitable place.</p>

<p>"Wait here," said Kitty, as they passed through the hall, "and
I'll be back in a moment."</p>

<p>Kitty flew upstairs, and soon returned, saying that Miss Dupuy
would be glad to talk with them both in Madeleine's
sitting-room.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br>
An Interview With Cicely</h3>

<p>This sitting-room was on the second floor, directly back of
Madeleine's bedroom, the bedroom being above the library. Miss
Dupuy's own room was back of this and communicated with it.</p>

<p>The sitting-room was a pleasant place, with large light windows
and easy chairs and couches. A large and well-filled desk seemed to
prove the necessity of a social secretary, if Miss Van Norman cared
to have any leisure hours.</p>

<p>Surrounded by letters and papers, Cicely sat at the desk as they
entered, but immediately rose to meet them.</p>

<p>Kitty's tact in requesting the interview had apparently been
successful, for Miss Dupuy was gracious and affable.</p>

<p>But after some desultory conversation which amounted to nothing,
Fessenden concluded a direct course would be better.</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy," he said, "I'm a detective, at least in an amateur
way."</p>

<p>Cicely gave a start and a look of fear came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I have the interests of Schuyler Carleton at heart," the young
man continued, "and my efforts shall be primarily directed toward
clearing him from any breath of suspicion that may seem to have
fallen upon him."</p>

<p>"O, thank you!" cried Cicely, clasping her hands and showing
such genuine gratitude that Fessenden was startled by a new
idea.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," he said, "that you'll give me any help in your
power. As Miss Van Norman's private secretary, of course you know
most of the details of her daily life."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't see why I should tell everything to that
Benson man!"</p>

<p>"You should tell him only such things as may have a bearing on
this mystery that we are trying to clear up."</p>

<p>"Then I know nothing to tell. I know nothing about the
mystery."</p>

<p>"No, Cicely," said Kitty, in a soothing voice, "of course you
know nothing definite; but if you could tell us some few things
that may seem to you unimportant, we&mdash;that is, Mr.
Fessenden&mdash;might find them of great help."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Cicely slowly, "you may ask questions, if you
choose, Mr. Fessenden, and I will answer or not, as I prefer."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Dupuy. You may feel sure I will ask only the
ones I consider necessary to the work I have undertaken. And first
of all, was Miss Van Norman in love with Carleton?"</p>

<p>"She was indeed, desperately so."</p>

<p>"Yet she seemed greatly attached to her cousin, Mr.
Willard."</p>

<p>"That was partly a cousinly affection, and partly a sort of
coquetry to pique Mr. Carleton."</p>

<p>"And was Carleton devoted to her?"</p>

<p>"Must I answer that?" Cicely's eyes looked troubled.</p>

<p>"Yes, you must." Fessenden's voice was very gentle.</p>

<p>"Then he was not devoted to her; in fact, he loved another."</p>

<p>"Who is this other?"</p>

<p>"Dorothy Burt, his mother's companion, who lives at the Carleton
home."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Van Norman know this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she learned of it lately, and it broke her heart. That is
why she was so uncertain and erratic in her moods; that is why she
coquetted with Mr. Willard, to arouse Schuyler Carleton's
jealousy."</p>

<p>"This throws a new light on it all," said Fessenden gravely.
"And this Miss Burt&mdash;did she return Carleton's regard?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Cicely, and her agitation seemed to
increase, though she tried hard to conceal it. "Of course Miss Van
Norman didn't speak openly of this matter, but I knew her so well
that I easily divined from her moods and her actions that she knew
she had a rival in Mr. Carleton's affections."</p>

<p>"Then he cared more for her in time past?"</p>

<p>"Yes, until that girl came to live with his mother. She's a
designing little thing, and she just twisted Mr. Carleton round her
finger."</p>

<p>"Do you know her personally, Miss Dupuy?" A look of intense
hatred came over Cicely's expressive face.</p>

<p>"No! I wouldn't meet her for anything. But I have seen her, and
I know perfectly well that Mr. Carleton cares for her more than he
did for Miss Van Norman."</p>

<p>"Yet he was about to marry Miss Van Norman."</p>

<p>"Yes; because they were engaged before he saw the Burt girl.
Then, you see, he didn't think it honorable to refuse to marry her,
and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had asked her, then, to give him back his freedom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had. And Miss Van Norman very rightly refused to do
so."</p>

<p>"Oh, Cicely," cried Kitty, "do you know this, or are you only
surmising it?"</p>

<p>"I know it, Miss French. In her sorrow over the matter, Miss Van
Norman often confided in me as in a friend."</p>

<p>"And you were a good friend to her, I'm sure," said Fessenden
heartily. "Now, Miss Dupuy, do you think it could have been
possible that Mr. Carleton came here late last night to ask Miss
Van Norman once again to release him from the marriage?"</p>

<p>"He might have done so," said Cicely in a noncommittal tone. "He
was very much annoyed at her behavior with Mr. Willard in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"But that was on purpose to annoy him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it succeeded."</p>

<p>"How do you know all this?"</p>

<p>"Miss Van Norman intimated as much just before dinner, when we
were here alone. She feared Mr. Carleton was so angry he wouldn't
come to dinner at all."</p>

<p>"And he didn't."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Dupuy, it would scarcely be possible to think that if
he did return later to ask his release&mdash;it would not be
possible to think that on Miss Van Norman's refusal to release him
he was so incensed against her that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" cried Cicely. "Of course he didn't kill her! Of
course he didn't! She killed herself! I don't care what any one
says&mdash;I know she killed herself!"</p>

<p>"If so," said Fessenden, "we must prove it by keeping on with
our investigations. And now, Miss Dupuy, will you tell me what was
your errand when you returned to the library late last night, when
the two doctors were alone there in charge of the room?"</p>

<p>"I didn't!" declared Cicely, her cheeks flaming and her blue
eyes fairly glaring at her interrogator.</p>

<p>"Please stick to the truth, Miss Dupuy," said Fessenden coldly.
"If you don't, we can't credit any of your statements. You opened
the door very softly, and were about to enter, when you spied the
doctors and withdrew."</p>

<p>"I went to get that paper," said Cicely, somewhat sulkily.</p>

<p>"Why did you want that?"</p>

<p>"Because it was mine. I had a right to it."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you go on in and get it? The doctors' presence
need have made no difference."</p>

<p>"I don't know why I didn't! I wish you'd stop asking
questions!"</p>

<p>"I will, in a moment. You are sure you wrote that paper
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am!" The answer was snapped out pertly.</p>

<p>"And you wrote it meaning yourself? You didn't write it with the
intent that it should be taken for Miss Van Norman's message?"</p>

<p>Cicely eyes dropped involuntarily. Then she raised them, and
stared straight at Fessenden. "What do you mean?" she asked
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Just what I say. Was that written paper an expression of your
own heart's secret?"</p>

<p>It must have been because of Fessenden's magnetism, or
compelling sympathy, but for some reason Cicely took no offense at
this, and answered simply, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Strange," mused Rob, "how that man won so many women's
hearts."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't strange," said Cicely, also in slow, thoughtful
tones. And then, suddenly realizing the admission she had made, and
seeing how she had revealed her own secret she flew into a
rage.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she cried. "I didn't refer to Mr.
Carleton."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," said Fessenden, so quietly that again Cicely was
silent, and Kitty sat surprised almost to breathlessness.</p>

<p>"There is to be only truth between us," went on Rob. "You did
mean Mr. Carleton, by the letter 'S'; but have no fear, your secret
shall be respected. Now we will have only the truth&mdash; remember
that. So please tell me frankly at what time you saw Mr. Carleton
come into the house last night?"</p>

<p>"Just a few moments before half-past eleven." Cicely said this
glibly, as if reciting a carefully-conned lesson.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment&mdash;you forget that Mr. Hunt fixed the time at
quarter after eleven, and that he saw you looking over the baluster
at the same time."</p>

<p>With an agonized cry of dismay, Miss Dupuy fainted into utter
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Perplexed and baffled in his inquiries, Fessenden saw that for
the moment Miss Dupuy's physical condition was of paramount
importance, and at Kitty's request he rang for Marie. Even before
she came the others had placed Cicely gently on a couch, and when
the maid arrived Fessenden left the room, knowing that the girl was
properly cared for.</p>

<p>Going downstairs again, he was about to make his adieux to Mrs.
Markham and leave the house, when Kitty French, coming down soon
after him, asked him to stay a few minutes longer.</p>

<p>The sight of her pretty face drove more serious thoughts from
his mind, and he turned, more than willing to follow where she led.
"Oh, whistle, and I'll come to you," he whispered. But Kitty had
weighty information to impart, and was in no mood for trifling.
They found a quiet corner, and then Kitty told him that Cicely had
regained consciousness almost immediately, but that just before she
did so, she cried out sharply, "They must not think Schuyler did
it! They must not!"</p>

<p>"And so," said Kitty, astutely, "you see, it's as I told you.
Mr. Carleton did kill Maddy, and Cicely knows it, but she doesn't
want other people to find it out, because she's in love with him
herself!"</p>

<p>Rob Fessenden gave his companion an admiring glance.</p>

<p>"That's good reasoning and sound logic," he said; "and I'd
subscribe to it if it were anybody but old Schuyler. But I can't
and won't believe that man guilty without further evidence than
that of a fainting, hysterical woman."</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to be in love with Mr. Carleton," said Kitty,
demurely.</p>

<p>"You're not, are you?" said Rob, so quickly that Kitty
blushed.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," she declared. "He's a stunning looking man, and
that superior, impassive way of his catches some women, but I don't
care for it. I prefer a more enthusiastic temperament."</p>

<p>"Like mine," said Rob casually.</p>

<p>"Have you a temperament?" said Kitty saucily. "It isn't at all
noticeable."</p>

<p>"It will be, after you know me better. But Miss French, since
you've raised this question of Miss Dupuy's evidence, let me tell
you what it means to me. Or, rather, what it seems to point to, for
it's all too vague for us to draw any real conclusions. But, as a
first impression, my suspicion turns toward Miss Dupuy herself
rather than Carleton."</p>

<p>"Cicely! You don't mean she killed Maddy! Oh, how can you?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't fly into hysterics yourself. Wait a minute. I
haven't accused her at all. But look at it. Miss Van Norman was
certainly killed by Carleton, or by some one already in the house.
It has been proved that nobody outside could get in. Now if the
criminal is some one in the house, we must consider each one in
turn. And if by chance we consider Miss Dupuy first, we must admit
a motive."</p>

<p>"What motive?"</p>

<p>"Why, that of a jealous woman. Miss Van Norman was just about to
marry the man Miss Dupuy is in love with. Perhaps&mdash;do have
patience, I'm merely supposing&mdash;perhaps she has vainly urged
Miss Van Norman to give him up, and, finding she wouldn't do so, at
the last minute she prevented the marriage herself,&mdash;putting
that paper on the table to make it appear a suicide. This would
explain her stealthy attempt to regain possession of the paper
later."</p>

<p>"Why should she want it?"</p>

<p>"So that it couldn't be proved not to be in Miss Van Norman's
writing."</p>

<p>"It's ingenious on your part," said Kitty slowly, "but it can't
be true. Cicely may be in love with Schuyler, but she wouldn't kill
Maddy because of that."</p>

<p>"Who can tell what a hysterical, jealous woman will do?" said
Rob, with the air of an oracle. "And moreover, to my mind, that
explains her half-conscious exclamation of which you just told me.
When she said, 'They must not think Schuyler did it,' it meant that
she knew he didn't do it, but she didn't want suspicion to rest on
him. That's why she insists it was a suicide."</p>

<p>So in earnest was Fessenden that Kitty felt almost convinced
there was something in his theory.</p>

<p>"But it can't be," she said, at last, with an air of finality.
"It wouldn't be possible for Cicely to do such a thing! I know her
too well!"</p>

<p>"Then, Miss French, if that, to you, is a logical argument, you
must admit mine. It wouldn't be possible for Carleton to do such a
thing! I know him too well!"</p>

<p>Kitty had to smile at the imitation of the strong inflections
she had used, and, too, she had to admit that one opinion was as
permissible as the other.</p>

<p>"You see," went on Rob quietly, "we're not really assuming Miss
Dupuy's guilt, we're only seeing where these deductions lead us.
Suppose, for the moment, that Miss Dupuy did, during that half-hour
in the library, have an altercation with Miss Van Norman, and just
suppose,&mdash;or imagine, if you prefer the word,&mdash;that she
turned the dagger upon her friend and employer, wouldn't her
subsequent acts have been just as they were? At Mr. Carleton's
alarm, she came downstairs, fully dressed; later she tried to
remove secretly that written paper; always at serious questioning
she faints or flies into hysterics; and, naturally, when suspicion
comes near the man she cares for, she tries to turn it off. And
then, too, Miss French, a very strong point against her is that she
was the last one, so far as we know, to see Miss Van Norman alive.
Of course, the murderer was the last one; but I mean, of the
witnesses, Miss Dupuy was the latest known to be with Miss Van
Norman. Thus, her evidence can not be corroborated, and it may or
may not be true. If she is the guilty one, we cannot expect the
truth from her, and so we must at least admit that there is room
for investigation, if not suspicion."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," said Kitty slowly; "a man's mind is
said to be more logical. A woman depends more on her intuition.
Now, my intuition tells me that Cicely Dupuy can not be the guilty
one."</p>

<p>"At risk of tiresome repetition," returned Fessenden, "I must
say again that that is no more convincing than my 'intuition' that
Carleton can not be the guilty one."</p>

<p>Kitty's smile showed her quick appreciation of this point, and
Rob went on:</p>

<p>"Though suspicion, so far, is cast in no other direction, it is
only fair to consider all the others in the house. This will, of
course, be done in due time. I approve of Mr. Benson, and I think,
though his manners are pompous and at times egotistical, he has a
good mind and a quick intelligence. He will do his part, I am sure,
and then, if necessary, others will be brought into the case. But,
as Carleton's friend, I shall devote all my energies to clearing
him from what I know is an unjust suspicion."</p>

<p>And then Rob Fessenden went away. Mrs. Markham asked him to
remain to dinner, but he declined, preferring to go home with
Carleton. He said he would return next morning, and said too that
he meant to stay in Mapleton as long as he could be of any service
to any of his friends.</p>

<p>This decision was, of course, the result of his great friendship
for Carleton, and his general interest in the Van Norman case, but
it was also partly brought about by the bewitching personality of
Kitty French and the impression she had made on his not usually
susceptible heart.</p>

<p>And being master of his own time, Fessenden resolved to stay for
a few days and observe developments along several lines.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br>
The Carleton Household</h3>

<p>Mrs. Carleton's dinner table that evening presented a very
different atmosphere from the night before.</p>

<p>The hostess herself was present only by a strong effort of will
power. Mrs. Carleton had been greatly overcome by the shock of the
dreadful news, and, aside from the sadness and horror of the
tragedy, she was exceedingly disappointed at what seemed to her the
ruin of her son's future.</p>

<p>The Carletons were an old and aristocratic family, though by no
means possessed of great fortune.</p>

<p>The alliance, therefore, with the wealth of the Van Norman
estate, and the power of the Van Norman name, seemed to Mrs.
Carleton the crowning glory of her son's career, and she had been
devoutly thankful when the wedding-day was set.</p>

<p>Though stubbornly unwilling to believe it, she had of late been
forced to notice the growing attachment between Schuyler and her
own companion, Miss Burt, and had it not been for the surety of the
approaching wedding, she would have dismissed the girl. But so
certain was she that her son's ambitions, like her own, were
centred on the Van Norman name, she could not believe that Schuyler
would let himself become greatly interested in Dorothy Burt.</p>

<p>But she did not allow for that mischievous Imp of Romance who
plays havoc with hearts without saying "by your leave."</p>

<p>And partly because of her own dainty charm, partly because of
her contrast to Madeleine's magnificence, Dorothy Burt crept into
Schuyler Carleton's affections before either of them realized it,
and when they did discover the surprising fact, it did not seem to
dismay them as it should have done.</p>

<p>But it troubled them; for Schuyler well knew that honor,
expediency, and good judgment all held him bound to Miss Van
Norman, and Dorothy Burt knew it equally well.</p>

<p>And, whether or not with an ulterior motive, she had made no
claim on him from the first. She had admitted her love for him, but
in the same breath had avowed her appreciation of its hopelessness.
Even if he hinted at a possible transfer of his allegiance, she had
hushed him at once, saying it was impossible for him to do
otherwise than to be true to his troth, and that he must forget
her, as she should&mdash;try to&mdash;forget him.</p>

<p>This nobility on her part only made Carleton love her more, and
though continuing to admire his beautiful fianc&eacute;e, his real
affection was all for little Dorothy.</p>

<p>She came to dinner that night, soft and lovely in a simple white
frock, her pathetic eyes wide open in grief and sorrow, her rosebud
mouth drooping and tremulous at the corners.</p>

<p>Fessenden watched her. Without appearing to do so, he noted
every expression that flitted across her baby face.</p>

<p>And he was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>The night before he had paid slight attention to her. To be
sure, Miss Van Norman had spoken her name in the afternoon, but it
had meant little to him, and, thinking of her merely as Mrs.
Carleton's companion, or secretary, he wasn't sure which, he had
been conventionally polite and no more. But to-night she was a
factor in the case, and must be reckoned with.</p>

<p>As Fessenden watched her, he saw, with a growing conviction, as
sure as it was awful, that she was relieved at Miss Van Norman's
death.</p>

<p>Gentle, tender little girl as she seemed, it was nevertheless
true that the removal of the obstacle between Carleton and herself
gave her only joy. She tried to hide this. She cleverly simulated
grief, horror, surprise, interest,&mdash;all the emotions called
forth by the conversation, which unavoidably pursued only one
course. In fact, Miss Burt took her cue every time from Mrs.
Carleton, and expressed opinions that invariably coincided with
hers.</p>

<p>It began to dawn upon Fessenden that the girl was unusually
clever, the more so, he thought, that she was consciously
concealing her cleverness by a cloak of demure innocence, and
careful unostentation. Never did she put herself forward; never did
she show undue interest in Schuyler, personally.</p>

<p>Fessenden reasoned that the game being now in her own hands, she
could afford to stand back and await developments.</p>

<p>Then came the next thought: how came the game so fortuitously
into her own hands? Was it, even indirectly, due to her own
instigation?</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he thought to himself. "I'm growing absurdly
suspicious. I won't believe wrong of that girl until I have some
scrap of a hint to base it on."</p>

<p>And yet he knew in his own heart if Dorothy Burt had wanted to
connive in the slightest degree in the removal of her rival, she
was quite capable of doing so, notwithstanding her very evident
effect of pretty helplessness.</p>

<p>"When an excessively clever young woman assumes an utterly
inefficient air," he thought, "it must be for some undeclared
purpose;" and he felt an absurd thrill of satisfaction that though
Kitty French was undeniably clever, she put on no ing&eacute;nue
arts to hide it.</p>

<p>Then Kitty's phrase of "a clinging rosebud" came to his mind,
and he realized its exceeding aptness to describe Dorothy Burt. Her
appealing eyes and wistful, curved mouth were enough to lure a man
who loved her to almost any deed of daring.</p>

<p>"Even murder?" flashed into his brain, and he recoiled at the
thought. Old Schuyler might have been made to forget his fealty; he
might have been unable to steel his heart against those subtle
charms; he might have thrown to the winds his honor and his faith;
but surely, never, never, could he have committed that dreadful
deed, even for love of this angel-faced siren.</p>

<p>"Could she?"</p>

<p>The words fairly burned into Fessenden's brain. The sudden
thought set his mind whirling. Could she? Why, no, of course not!
Absurd! Yes, but could she? What? That child? That baby-girl? Those
tiny, rose-leaf hands! Yes, but could she?</p>

<p>"No!" said Fessenden angrily, and then realized that he had
spoken aloud, and his hearers were looking at him with indulgent
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, smiling as he looked at Mrs. Carleton.
"My fancy took a short but distant flight, and I had to speak to it
sternly by way of reproof."</p>

<p>"I didn't know a lawyer could be fanciful," said Mrs. Carleton.
"I thought that privilege was reserved for poets."</p>

<p>"Thank you for a pretty compliment to our profession," said Rob.
"We lawyers are too often accused of giving rein to our fancy, when
we should be strapped to the saddle of slow but sure Truth."</p>

<p>"But can you arrive anywhere on such a prosaic steed?" asked
Miss Burt, smiling at his words.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rob; "we can arrive at facts."</p>

<p>What prompted him to speak so curtly, he didn't know; but his
speech did not at all please Miss Burt. Her color flew to her
cheeks, though she said nothing, and then, as Mrs. Carleton rose
from the table, the two ladies smiled and withdrew, leaving Rob
alone with his host.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old boy, of course," said Carleton, "but did
you have any reason for flouting poor little Dorothy like
that?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Fessenden honestly and apologetically. "I
spoke without thinking, and I'm sorry for it."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;it's nothing. Now, Rob, old fellow, you can't
deceive me. I saw a curious expression in your eyes as you looked
at Miss Burt tonight, and&mdash;well, there is no need of words
between us, so I'll only tell you you're all wrong there. You look
for hidden meanings and veiled allusions in everything that girl
says, and there aren't any. She's as frank and open-natured as she
can be, and&mdash;forgive me&mdash;but I want you to let her
alone." Fessenden was astounded. First, at Carleton's insight in
discovering his thoughts, and second, at Carleton's mistaken
judgment of Miss Burt's nature.</p>

<p>But he only said, "All right, Schuyler; what you say, goes.
Would you rather not talk at all about the Van Norman affair?"
Fessenden spoke thus casually, for he felt sure it would make it
easier for Carleton than if he betrayed a deeper interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care. You know, of course, how deeply it affects me
and my whole life. I know your sympathy and good-fellowship.
There's not much more to say, is there?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Carleton; there is. As your friend, and also in the
interests of justice, I am more than anxious to discover the
villain who did the horrid deed, and though the inquest people are
doing all they can, I want to add my efforts to theirs, in hope of
helping them,&mdash;and you."</p>

<p>"Don't bother about me, Rob. I don't care if they never discover
the culprit. Miss Van Norman is gone; it can't restore her to life
if they do learn who killed her."</p>

<p>Fessenden looked mystified.</p>

<p>"That's strange talk, Schuyler,&mdash;but of course you're
fearfully upset, and I suppose just at first it isn't surprising
that you feel that way. But surely,&mdash;as man to man,
now,&mdash;you want to find and punish the wretch that put an end
to that beautiful young life."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I suppose so;" Carleton spoke hesitatingly, and drew
his hand across his brow in the same dazed way he did when in the
witness box.</p>

<p>"You're done up, old man, and I'm not going to bother you
to-night. But I'm on the hunt, if you aren't, and I'm going ahead
on a few little trails, hoping they'll lead to something of more
importance. By the way, what were you doing in those few minutes
last night between your entering the house and entering the
library?"</p>

<p>Carleton stared at his guest.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. You went in at eleven-fifteen, and you called for
help at eleven-thirty."</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;it didn't take as long as that." Carleton's eyes had
a far-away look, and Rob grasped his arm and shook him, as he
said:</p>

<p>"Drop it, man! Drop that half-dazed way of speaking! Tell me,
clearly, what did you do in that short interval?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to state," said Carleton quietly, but with a direct
glance now that made Fessenden cease his insistence.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said; "it's of no consequence. Now tell me what
you were doing last evening before you went over to the house?"</p>

<p>At this Carleton showed a disposition to be both haughty and
ironical.</p>

<p>"Am I being questioned," he said, "and by you? Well, before I
went to Miss Van Norman's I was walking in the rose-garden with
Miss Burt. You saw me from your window."</p>

<p>"I did," said Rob gravely. "Were you with Miss Burt until the
time of your going over to the Van Norman house?"</p>

<p>"No," said Carleton, with sarcastic intonation. "I said
good-night to Miss Burt about three-quarters of an hour before I
started to go over to Miss Van Norman's. Do you want to know what I
did during that interval?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I was in my own room&mdash;my den. I did what many a man does
on the eve of his wedding. I burned up a few notes,&mdash;perhaps a
photograph or two,&mdash;and one withered rose-bud,&mdash;a
'keepsake.' Does this interest you?"</p>

<p>"Not especially, but, Schuyler, do drop that resentful air. I'm
not quizzing you, and if you don't want to talk about the subject
at all, we won't."</p>

<p>"Very well,&mdash;I don't."</p>

<p>"Very well, then."</p>

<p>The two men rose, and as Carleton held out his hand Rob grasped
it and shook it heartily, then they went to the drawing-room and
rejoined the ladies.</p>

<p>The Van Norman affair was not mentioned again that evening.</p>

<p>All felt a certain oppression in the atmosphere, and all tried
to dispel it, but it was not easy. Uninteresting topics of
conversation were tossed from one to another, but each felt
relieved when at last Mrs. Carleton rose to go upstairs and the
evening was at an end.</p>

<p>Fessenden went to his room, his brain a whirlwind of conflicting
thoughts.</p>

<p>He sat down by an open window and endeavored to classify them
into some sort of order.</p>

<p>First, he was annoyed at Carleton's inexplicable attitude.
Granting he was in love with Miss Burt, he had no reason to act so
unconcerned about the Van Norman tragedy. And yet Schuyler's was a
peculiar nature, and doubtless all this strange behavior of his was
merely the effort to hide his real sorrow.</p>

<p>But again, if he were in love with Miss Burt, his sorrow for the
loss of Madeleine was for the loss of her fortune and not herself.
This Fessenden refused to believe, but the more he refused to
believe it, the more it came back to him. Then there was his new
notion, that came to him at dinner, about Miss Burt. Carleton said
she was the ingenuous, timid girl she looked, but Rob couldn't
believe it. Executive ability showed in that determined little
chin. Veiled cunning lurked in the shadows of those innocent eyes.
And the girl had a motive. Surely she wanted her rival out of her
way. Then she had said good-night to Schuyler nearly an hour before
he went over to Madeleine's. Could she have&mdash;but, nonsense!
Even if she had been so inclined, how could she have entered the
house? Ah, that settled it! She couldn't. And Fessenden was
honestly glad of it. Honestly glad that he had proved to himself
that Miss Burt&mdash;lovely, alluring little Dorothy Burt&mdash;was
not the hardened criminal for whom he was looking!</p>

<p>Then it came back to Schuyler. No! Never Schuyler! But if not
he, then who? And what was he doing in that incriminating interval,
and why wouldn't he tell?</p>

<p>And then, idly gazing from his window Rob saw again two figures
walking in the rose-garden.</p>

<p>And they were the same two that he had seen there the evening
before.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton and Dorothy Burt were strolling,&mdash;no, now
they were standing, standing close to each other in earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>Rob was no eavesdropper, and of course he couldn't hear a word
they said, but somehow he found it impossible to take his eyes from
those two figures.</p>

<p>Steadily they talked,&mdash;so engrossed in their conversation
that they scarcely moved; then Schuyler's arm went slowly round the
girl's shoulders.</p>

<p>Gently she drew away, and he did not then again offer a
caress.</p>

<p>Rob sat looking at them, saying frankly to himself that he was
justified in doing so, since his motive effaced all consideration
of puerile conventions. If that girl were really the designing
young woman he took her to be,&mdash;more, if she could be the
author, directly or indirectly, of that awful crime,&mdash;then
Fessenden vowed he would save Schuyler from her fascinations at the
risk of breaking their own lifelong friendship.</p>

<p>After further rapt and earnest conversation, Carleton took Miss
Burt gently in his arms and kissed her lightly on the forehead.
Then, drawing her arm through his own, they turned and walked
slowly to the house.</p>

<p>A few moments later Rob heard the girl's light footsteps as she
came up to her room, but Carleton stayed down in the library until
long after all the rest of the household were sleeping.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br>
Fessenden's Detective Work</h3>

<p>Next morning Rob went over to the Van Norman house with a
clearly developed plan of action. He declared to himself that he
would allow no circumstance to shake his faith in his friend, that
he would hold Carleton innocent of all wrongdoing in the affair,
and that he would put all his ingenuity and cleverness to work to
discover the criminal or any clue that might lead to such a
discovery.</p>

<p>Although some questions he had wished to ask Cicely Dupuy were
yet unanswered, Fessenden had discovered several important facts,
and, after being admitted to the house, he looked about him for a
quiet spot to sit down and tabulate them in black and white. The
florist's men were still in the drawing-room, so he went into the
library. Here he found only Mrs. Markham and Miss Morton, who were
apparently discussing a question on which they held opposite
opinions.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Fessenden," said Mrs. Markham, as he was about to
withdraw. "I should be glad of your advice. Ought I to give over
the reins of government at once to Miss Morton?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" interrupted Miss Morton, herself. "The house is mine;
why should I not be mistress here?"</p>

<p>Fessenden repressed a smile. It seemed to him absurd that these
two middle-aged women should discuss an issue of this sort with
such precipitancy.</p>

<p>"It seems to me a matter of good taste," he replied. "The house,
Miss Morton, is legally yours, but as its mistress, I think you'd
show a more gracious manner if you would wait for a time before
making any changes in the domestic arrangements."</p>

<p>Apparently undesirous of pursuing the gracious course he
recommended, Miss Morton rose abruptly and flounced out of the
room.</p>

<p>"Now she's annoyed again," observed Mrs. Markham placidly. "The
least little thing sets her off."</p>

<p>"If not intrusive, Mrs. Markham, won't you tell me how it comes
about that Miss Morton inherits this beautiful house? Is she a
relative of the Van Normans?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. She was Richard Van Norman's sweetheart, years
and years and years ago. They had a falling-out, and neither of
them ever married. Of course he didn't leave her any of his
fortune. But only a short time ago, long after her uncle's death,
Madeleine found out about it from some old letters. She determined
then to hunt up this Miss Morton, and she did so, and they had
quite a correspondence. She came here for the wedding, and
Madeleine intended she should make a visit, and intended to give
her a present of money when she went away. In the meantime
Madeleine had made her will, though I didn't know this until
to-day, leaving the place and all her own money to Miss Morton. I'm
not surprised at this, for Tom Willard has plenty, and as there was
no other heir, I know Madeleine felt that part of her uncle's
fortune ought to be used to benefit the woman he had loved in his
youth."</p>

<p>"That explains Miss Morton, then," said Fessenden. "But what a
peculiar woman she is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is," agreed Mrs. Markham, in her serene way. "But I'm
used to queer people. Richard Van Norman used to give way to the
most violent bursts of temper I ever saw. Maddy and Tom are just
like him. They would both fly into furious rages, though I must say
they didn't do it often, and never unless for some deep
reason."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Carleton&mdash;has he a high temper?" Mrs. Markham's
brow clouded. "I don't understand that man," she said slowly. "I
don't think he has a quick temper, but there's something deep about
him that I can't make out. Oh, Mr. Fessenden, do you think he
killed our Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Fessenden suddenly, looking straight at her.</p>

<p>"I do," she said, taken off her guard. "That is, I couldn't
believe it, only, what else can I think? Mr. Carleton is a good
man, but I know Maddy never killed herself, and I know the way this
house is locked up every night. No burglar or evil-doer could
possibly get in.'</p>

<p>"But the murderer may have been concealed in the house for hours
beforehand."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! That would be impossible, with a house so full of
people, and the wedding preparations going on, and everything.
Besides, Mr. Hunt would have heard any intruder prowling around;
and then again, how could he have gone out? Everything was bolted
on the inside, except the front door, and had he gone out that way
he must surely have been heard."</p>

<p>"Well reasoned, Mrs. Markham! I think, with you, we may dismiss
the possibility of a burglar. The time was too short for anything
except a definitely premeditated act. And yet I cannot believe the
act was that of Schuyler Carleton. I know that man very well, and a
truer, braver soul never existed."</p>

<p>"I know it," declared Mrs. Markham, "but I think I'm justified
in telling you this. Mr. Carleton didn't love Madeleine, and he did
love another girl. Madeleine worshipped him, and I think he came
last night to ask her to release him, and she refused, and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something about Mrs. Markham's earnest face and sad, distressed
voice affected Fessenden deeply, and he wondered if this theory she
had so clearly, though hesitatingly, stated, could be the true one.
Might he, after all, be mistaken in his estimate of Schuyler
Carleton, and might Mrs. Markham's suggestion have even a
foundation of probability?</p>

<p>They were both silent for a few minutes, and then Mr. Fessenden
said, "But you thought it was suicide at first."</p>

<p>"Indeed I did; I looked at the paper through glasses that were
dim with tears, and it looked to me like Madeleine's writing. Of
course Miss Morton also thought it was, as she was only slightly
familiar with Maddy's hand. But now that we know some one else
wrote that message, of course we also know the dear girl did not
bring about her own death."</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham was called away on some household errands then, and
Fessenden remained alone in the library, trying to think of some
clue that would point to some one other than Carleton.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that man is not a murderer," he declared to himself.
"Carleton is peculiar, but he has a loyal, honest heart. And yet,
if not, who can have done the deed? I can't seem to believe it
really was either the Dupuy woman or the Burt girl. And I know it
wasn't Schuyler! There must have been some motive of which I know
nothing. And perhaps I also know nothing of the murderer. It need
not necessarily have been one of these people we have already
questioned." His thoughts strayed to the under-servants of the
house, to common burglars, or to some powerful unknown villain. But
always the thought returned that no one could have entered and left
the house unobserved within that fatal hour.</p>

<p>And then, to his intense satisfaction, Kitty French came into
the room.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Rose of Dawn," he said, looking at her bright
face. "Are you properly glad to see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, kind sir," she said, dropping a little curtsey, and
smiling in a most friendly way.</p>

<p>"Well, then, sit down here, and let me talk to you, for my
thoughts are running riot, and I'm sure you alone can help me
straighten them out."</p>

<p>"Of course I can. I'm wonderful at that sort of thing. But,
first I'll tell you about Miss Dupuy. She's awfully ill&mdash;I
mean prostrated, you know; and she has a high fever and sometimes
she chatters rapidly, and then again she won't open her lips even
if any one speaks to her. We've had the doctor, and he says it's
just overstrained nerves and a naturally nervous disposition; but,
Mr. Fessenden, I think it's more than that; I think it's a guilty
conscience."</p>

<p>"And yesterday, when I implied that Miss Dupuy might know more
about it all than she admitted, you wouldn't listen to a word of
it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it, but I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have; just for a change, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No," said Kitty, more seriously; "but because I've heard a lot
of Cicely's ranting,&mdash;for that's what it is,&mdash;and while
it's been only disconnected sentences and sudden exclamations, yet
it all points to a guilty knowledge of some sort, which she's
trying to conceal. I don't say I suspect her, Mr. Fessenden, but I
do suspect that she knows a lot more important information than
she's told."</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy's behavior has certainly invited criticism," began
Rob, but before he could go further, the French girl, Marie,
appeared at the door, and seemed about to enter.</p>

<p>"What is it, Marie?" said Kitty kindly. "Are you looking for
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle," said Marie, "and I would speak with
monsieur too. I have that to say which is imperative. Too long
already have I kept the silence. I must speak at last. Have I
permission?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Fessenden, who saw that Marie was agitated,
but very much in earnest. "Tell us what you have to say. Do not be
afraid."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Marie, "but I am afraid of one only. It is
the Miss Morton, the stranger lady."</p>

<p>"Miss Morton?" said Kitty, in surprise. "She won't hurt you; she
has been very good to you."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, mademoiselle; but too good. Miss Morton has been too
kind, too sweet, to Marie! It is that which troubles me."</p>

<p>"Well, out with it, Marie," said Rob. "Close that door, if you
like, and then speak out, without any more beating around the
bush."</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, I will no longer beat the bush; I will now
tell."</p>

<p>Marie carefully closed the door, and then began her story:</p>

<p>"It was the night of the&mdash;of the horror. You remember, Miss
French, we sat all in this very room, awaiting the coming of the
great doctor&mdash;the doctor Leonard."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kitty, looking intently at the girl; "yes, I know
most of you stayed here waiting,&mdash;but I was not here; Doctor
Hills sent Miss Gardner and me to our rooms."</p>

<p>"Yes; it is so. Well, we sat here, and Miss Morton rose with
suddenness and left the room. I followed, partly that I thought she
might need my services, and partly&mdash;I confess it&mdash;because
I trusted her not at all, and I wished to assure myself that all
was well. I followed her,&mdash;but secretly,&mdash;and
I&mdash;shall I tell you what she did?"</p>

<p>Kitty hesitated. She was not sure she should listen to what was,
after all, servants' gossip about a guest of the house.</p>

<p>But Fessenden looked at it differently. He knew Marie had been
the trusted personal maid of Miss Van Norman, and he deemed it
right to hear the evidence that she was now anxious to give.</p>

<p>"Go on, Marie," he said gravely. "Be careful to tell it exactly
as it happened, whatever it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieur. Well, then, I softly followed Miss Morton,
because she did not go directly to her own room, but went to Miss
Van Norman's sitting-room and stood before the desk of Miss
Madeleine."</p>

<p>"You are sure, Marie?" said Kitty, who couldn't help feeling it
was dishonorable to listen to this.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss French, let her tell the story in her own way,"
said Rob. "It is perhaps of the utmost importance, and may lead to
great results." Then Marie went uninterruptedly on.</p>

<p>"She stood in front of the desk, m'sieur; she searched eagerly
for papers, reading and discarding several. Then she found some,
which she saw with satisfaction, and hastily concealed in her
pocket. Miss Morton is a lady who yet has pockets in her gowns.
With the papers in her pocket, then, Miss Morton looks about
carefully, and, thinking herself unobserved, creeps, but
stealthily, to her own room. There&mdash;m'sieur, I was obliged to
peep at the keyhole&mdash;there she lighted a fire in her grate,
and burned those papers. With my eyes I saw her. Never would I have
told, for it was not my affair, but that I fear for Miss Dupuy. It
is in the air that she knows secrets concerning Miss Van Norman's
death. Ah, if one would know secrets, one should question Miss
Morton."</p>

<p>"This is a grave charge you bring against the lady, Marie," said
Fessenden.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, but it is true."</p>

<p>"I know it is true," said Kitty; "I have not mentioned it
before, but I saw Miss Morton go to Madeleine's room that night,
and afterward go to her own room. I knew nothing, of course, of the
papers, and so thought little of the whole incident, but if she
really took papers from Madeleine's desk and burned them, it's
indeed important. What could the papers have been?"</p>

<p>"You know she inherited," began Fessenden. "Oh, a will!" cried
Kitty.</p>

<p>"Marie, you may go now," Rob interrupted; "you did right to tell
us this, and rest assured you shall never be blamed for doing so.
You will probably be questioned further, but for the present you
may go. And thank you."</p>

<p>Marie curtseyed and went away.</p>

<p>"She's a good girl," said Kitty. "I always liked her; and she
must have heard, as I did, so much of Cicely's chatter, that she
feared some sort of suspicion would fall on Cicely, and she wanted
to divert it toward Miss Morton instead."</p>

<p>"As usual, with your quick wits, you've gone right to the heart
of her motive," said Rob; "but it may be more serious than you've
yet thought of. Miss Morton inherits, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, now," said Kitty significantly, "since she burnt that
other will."</p>

<p>"What other will?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you see? The will she burnt was a later one, that
didn't give her this house. She burnt it so the earlier one would
stand."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it, except by common sense! What else would she
take from Maddy's desk and burn except a will? And, of course, a
will not in her favor, leaving the one that did bequeath the house
to her to appear as the latest will."</p>

<p>"Does this line of argument take us any further?" said Rob, so
seriously that Kitty began to think.</p>

<p>"You don't mean," she whispered, "that Miss Morton&mdash;in
order to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To receive her legacy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could&mdash;no, she couldn't! I won't even think of it!"</p>

<p>"But you thought of Miss Dupuy. Miss French, as I told you
yesterday, we must think of every <em>possible</em> person, not
every <em>probable</em> one. These suggestions are not
suspicions&mdash;and they harm no one who is innocent."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is so. Well, let us consider Miss Morton then,
but of course she didn't really kill Maddy."</p>

<p>"I trust not. But I must say I could sooner believe it of a
woman of her type than Miss Dupuy's."</p>

<p>"But Cicely didn't either! Oh, how can you say such dreadful
things!"</p>

<p>"We won't say them any more. They are dreadful. But I thought
you were going to help me in my detective work, and you balk at
every turn."</p>

<p>"No, I won't," said Kitty, looking repentant. "I do want to help
you; and if you'll let me help, I'll suspect everybody you want me
to."</p>

<p>"I want you to help me, but this story of Marie's is too big for
me to handle by myself. I must put that into Mr. Benson's hands. It
is really more important than you can understand."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Kitty, so humbly that Rob smiled at her,
and had great difficulty to refrain from kissing her.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br>
Searching For Clues</h3>

<p>Believing that Marie's information about Miss Morton was of deep
interest, Rob started off at once to confer with Coroner Benson
about it.</p>

<p>As he walked along he discussed the affair with himself, and was
shocked to realize that for the third time he was suspecting a
woman of the murder.</p>

<p>"But how can I help it?" he thought impatiently. "The house was
full of women, and not a man in it except the servants, and no
breath of suspicion has blown their way. And if a woman did do it,
that unpleasant Morton woman is by far the most likely suspect. And
if she was actuated by a desire to get her inheritance, why,
there's the motive, and she surely had opportunity. It's a tangle,
but we must find something soon to guide us. A murder like that
can't have been done without leaving some trace somewhere of the
criminal." And then Fessenden's thoughts drifted away to Kitty
French, and he was quite willing to turn the responsibility of his
new information over to Mr. Benson. On his way to the coroner's
office he passed the Mapleton Inn. An impulse came to him to
investigate Tom Willard's statements, and he turned back and
entered the small hotel.</p>

<p>He thought it wiser to be frank in the matter than to attempt to
obtain underhand information. Asking to speak with the proprietor
alone, he said plainly:</p>

<p>"I'm a detective from New York City, and my name is Fessenden.
I'm interested in investigating the death of Miss Van Norman. I
have no suspicions of any one in particular, but I'm trying to
collect a few absolute facts by way of making a beginning. I wish
you, therefore, to consider this conversation confidential."</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor, the landlord of the inn, was flattered at being a
party to a confidential conversation with a real detective, and
willingly promised secrecy in the matter.</p>

<p>"Then," went on Fessenden, "will you tell me all you know of the
movements of Mr. Willard last evening?"</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor looked a bit disappointed at this request, for he
foresaw that his story would be but brief. However, he elaborated
the recital and spun it out as long as he possibly could. But after
all his circumlocution, Fessenden found that the facts were given
precisely as Willard had stated them himself.</p>

<p>The bellboy who had carried up the suitcase was called in, and
his story also agreed.</p>

<p>"Yessir," said the boy; "I took up his bag, and he gimme a
quarter, just like any nice gent would. 'N'en I come downstairs,
and after while the gent's bell rang, and I went up, and he wanted
ice water. He was in his shirt sleeves then, jes' gittin' ready for
bed. So I took up the water, and he said, 'Thank you,' real
pleasant-like, and gimme a dime. He's a awful nice man, he is. He
had his shoes off that time, 'most ready for bed. And that's all I
know about it."</p>

<p>All this was nothing more nor less than Fessenden had expected.
He had asked the questions merely for the satisfaction of having
verbal corroboration of Tom's own story.</p>

<p>With thanks to Mr. Taylor, and a more material token of
appreciation to the boy, he went away.</p>

<p>On reaching the coroner's office, he was told that Mr. Benson
was not in. Fessenden was sorry, for he wanted to discuss the
Morton episode with him.</p>

<p>He thought of going to Lawyer Peabody's, who would know all
about Miss Van Norman's will, but as he sauntered through one of
the few streets the village possessed, he was rather pleased than
otherwise to see Kitty French walking toward him.</p>

<p>She greeted him with apparent satisfaction, and said chummily,
"Let's walk along together and talk it over."</p>

<p>Immediately coroner and lawyer faded from Rob's mind, he
willingly fell into step beside her, and they walked along the
street which soon merged itself into a pleasant country road.</p>

<p>Fessenden told Kitty of his conversation at the inn, but she
agreed that it was unimportant.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "I suppose it was a good thing to have
some one else say the same as Tom said, but as Tom wasn't even in
the house, I don't see as he is in the mystery at all. But there's
no use of looking further for the criminal. It was Schuyler
Carleton, just as sure as I stand here." Kitty very surely stood
there. They had paused beneath an old willow tree by the side of
the road, and Kitty, leaning against a rail fence, looked like a
very sweet and winsome Portia, determined to mete out justice.</p>

<p>Though he was himself convinced that he was an unprejudiced
seeker after truth, at that moment Robert Fessenden found himself
very much swayed by the opinions of the pretty, impetuous girl who
addressed him.</p>

<p>"I believe I'm going to work all wrong," he declared. "I can't
help feeling sure that Carleton didn't do it, and so I'm trying to
discover who did."</p>

<p>"Well, why is that wrong?" demanded Kitty wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Why, I think a better way to do would be to assume, if only for
sake of argument, as they say, or rather for sake of a
starting-point&mdash;to assume that you are right and that Carleton
is the evildoer, though I swear I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Kitty laughed outright. "You're a nice detective!" she said.
"Are you assuming that Schuyler is the villain, merely to be polite
to me?"</p>

<p>"I am not, indeed! I feel very politely inclined toward you,
I'll admit, but in this matter I'm very much in earnest. And I
believe, by assuming that Carleton is the man, and then looking for
proof of it, we may run across clues that will lead us to the real
villain."</p>

<p>Kitty looked at him admiringly, and for Kitty French to look at
any young man admiringly was apt to be a bit disturbing to the
young man's peace of mind.</p>

<p>It proved so in this case, and though Fessenden whispered to his
own heart that he would attend first to the vindication of his
friend Carleton, his own heart whispered back that after that, Miss
French must be considered.</p>

<p>"And so," said Rob, as they turned back homeward, "I'm going to
work upon this line. I'm going to look for clues; real, material,
tangible clues, such as criminals invariably leave behind
them."</p>

<p>"Do!" cried Kitty. "And I'll help you. I know we can find
something."</p>

<p>"You see," went on Fessenden, his enthusiasm kindling from hers,
"the actual stage of the tragedy is so restricted. Whatever we find
must be in the Van Norman house."</p>

<p>"Yes, and probably in the library."</p>

<p>"Or the hall," he supplemented.</p>

<p>"What kind of a thing do you expect to find?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. In the Sherlock Holmes stories it's
usually cigar ashes or something like that. Oh, pshaw! I don't
suppose we'll find anything."</p>

<p>"I think in detective stories everything is found out by
footprints. I never saw anything like the obliging way in which
people make footprints for detectives."</p>

<p>"And how absurd it is!" commented Rob. "I don't believe
footprints are ever made clearly enough to deduce the rest of the
man from."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, in detective stories, there's always that 'light
snow which had fallen late the night before.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fessenden, laughing at her cleverness, "and there's
always some minor character who chances to time that snow exactly,
and who knows when it began and when it stopped."</p>

<p>"Yes, and then the principal characters carefully plant their
footprints, going and returning&mdash;overlapping, you
know&mdash;and so Mr. Smarty-Cat Detective deduces the whole
story."</p>

<p>"But we've no footprints to help us."</p>

<p>"No, we couldn't have, in the house."</p>

<p>"But if it was Schuyler&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, even if,&mdash;he couldn't make footprints without that
convenient 'light snow' and there isn't any."</p>

<p>"And besides, Schuyler didn't do it."</p>

<p>"No, I know he didn't. But you're going to assume that, you
know, in order to detect the real criminal."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I said so; but I don't believe that game will work,
after all."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you're much of a detective, any way," said
Kitty, so frankly that Fessenden agreed.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I am," he said honestly. "With the time, place,
and number of people so limited, it ought to be easy to solve this
mystery at once."</p>

<p>"I think it's just those very conditions that make it so hard,"
said Kitty, sighing.</p>

<p>And so completely under her spell was Fessenden by this time
that he emphatically agreed with her.</p>

<p>When they reached the Van Norman house they found it had assumed
the hollow, breathless air that invades a house where death is
present.</p>

<p>All traces of decoration had been removed from the drawing-room,
and it, like the library, had been restored to its usual immaculate
order. The scent of flowers, however, was all through the
atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression hovered about like a heavy
cloud.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Kitty slipped her hand in Rob's as they
entered.</p>

<p>Fessenden, too, felt the gloom of the place, but he had made up
his mind to do some practical work, and detaining Harris, who had
opened the door for them, he said at once, "I want you to open the
blinds for a time in all the rooms downstairs. Miss French and I
are about to make a search, and, unless necessary, let no one
interrupt us."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the impassive Harris, who was becoming
accustomed to sudden and unexpected orders.</p>

<p>They had chosen their time well for the search, and were not
interrupted. Most of the members of the household were in their own
rooms; and there happened to be no callers who entered the
house.</p>

<p>Molly Gardner had gone away early that morning. She had declared
that if she stayed longer she should be downright ill, and, after
vainly trying to persuade Kitty to go with her, had returned alone
to New York.</p>

<p>Tom Willard and Lawyer Peabody were in Madeleine's sitting-room,
going over the papers in her desk, in a general attempt to learn
anything of her affairs that might be important to know. They had
desired Miss Dupuy's presence and assistance, but that young woman
refused to go to them, saying she was still too indisposed, and
remained, under care of Marie, in her own room.</p>

<p>Fessenden suggested that Kitty should make search in the library
while he did the same in the drawing-room; and that afterward they
should change places.</p>

<p>Kitty shivered a little as she went into the room that had been
the scene of the tragedy, but she was really anxious to assist
Fessenden, and also she wanted to do anything, however
insignificant, that would help in the least toward avenging poof
Maddy's death.</p>

<p>And yet it was seemingly a hopeless task. Though she carefully
and systematically scrutinized walls, rugs and furniture, not a
clue could she find.</p>

<p>She was on her hands and knees under a table when Tom Willard
came into the room.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he said, unable to repress a smile as
Kitty, with her curly hair a bit dishevelled, came scrambling
out.</p>

<p>"Hunting for clues," she said briefly.</p>

<p>"There are no clues," said Tom gravely. "It's the most
inexplicable affair all 'round."</p>

<p>"Then you have no suspicion of any one?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss French," said Tom, looking at her kindly, as one
might at a child, but speaking decidedly; "don't let the amusement
of amateur detective work lead you into making unnecessary trouble
for people. If detective work is to be done, leave it to
experienced and professional hands. A girl hunting for broken
sleeve-links or shreds of clothing is foolishly theatrical."</p>

<p>Willard's grave but gentle voice made Kitty think that she and
Fessenden were acting childishly, but after Tom, who had come on an
errand, had left the room, Kitty confided to herself that she would
rather act foolishly at Rob Fessenden's bidding than to follow the
wise advice of any other man.</p>

<p>This was saying a good deal, but as she said it only to herself,
she felt sure her confidence would not be betrayed.</p>

<p>Not half an hour had elapsed when Kitty appeared at the
drawing-room door with a discontented face, and said, "There's
positively nothing in the library that doesn't belong there. It has
been thoroughly swept, and though there may have been many clues,
they've all been swept and dusted away."</p>

<p>"Same here," said Fessenden dejectedly. "However, let's change
rooms, so we can both feel sure." Then Kitty searched the
drawing-room, and Rob the library, and they both scrutinized every
inch of the hall.</p>

<p>"I didn't find so much as a thread," said Kitty, as they sat
down on a great carved seat in the hall to compare notes.</p>

<p>"I didn't either," said Rob, "with one insignificant exception;
in the drawing-room I found this, but it doesn't mean
anything."</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew from his pocket a tiny globule of a silver
color.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Kitty, taking it with her finger-tips from
the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"It's a cachou."</p>

<p>"And what in the world is a cachou? What is it for?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's a little confection filled with a sort of spice. Some
men use them after smoking, to eradicate the odor of tobacco."</p>

<p>"Eat them, do you mean? Are they good to eat?" and impulsive
Kitty was about to pop the tiny thing into her mouth, when Rob
caught her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he cried. "That's my only clue, after all this search,
and it may be of importance." He rescued the cachou from Kitty's
fingers, and then, slipping it into his pocket, he continued to
hold the hand from which he had taken it.</p>

<p>And then, somehow, detective work seemed for a moment to lose
its intense interest, and Rob and Kitty talked of other things.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kitty said: "Tom Willard thinks we're foolish to hunt
for clues."</p>

<p>"I think he's right," said Fessenden, smiling, "since we didn't
find anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't exactly say you were foolish, but he said I was.
He said it was silly for a girl to hunt around under tables and
chairs."</p>

<p>"He had no right to say so. It isn't silly for you to do
anything you want to do. But I know what Willard meant. He thinks,
as lots of people do, that there's no sense in expecting to find
material evidences of crime&mdash;or, rather, of the criminal. And
I suppose he's right. Whoever murdered Miss Van Norman certainly
left no tangible traces. But I'm glad we hunted for them, for now I
feel certain there were none left; otherwise, I should always have
thought there might have been."</p>

<p>"How much more sensible you are than Mr. Willard," said Kitty,
with an admiring glance that went straight to the young man's
heart, and stayed there. "And, too, you always make use of 'clues'
if you do find them. Look how cleverly you deduced about the soft
and hard lead pencils."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nothing," said Fessenden modestly, though her
praise was ecstasy to his soul.</p>

<p>"Indeed it was something! It was great work. And I truly believe
you'll make as great a deduction from that little thing you found
this morning. What do you call it?"</p>

<p>"A cachou."</p>

<p>"Yes, a cachou. The whole discovery of the murderer may hinge on
that tiny clue we found."</p>

<p>"It may, but I can hardly hope so."</p>

<p>"I hope so,&mdash;for I do want to prove to Tom Willard that our
search for clues wasn't silly, after all."</p>

<p>And Fessenden's foolish heart was so joyed at Kitty's use of
"we" and "our" that he cared not a rap for Willard's opinion of his
detective methods.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br>
Miss Morton's Statements</h3>

<p>That afternoon another session of the inquest was held.</p>

<p>Fessenden had told Coroner Benson of Marie's disclosures
concerning Miss Morton, and in consequence that lady was the first
witness called.</p>

<p>The summons was a complete surprise to her. Turning deathly
white, she endeavored to answer to her name, but only gave voice to
an unintelligible stammer.</p>

<p>The coroner spoke gently, realizing that his feminine cloud of
witnesses really gave him a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>"Please tell us, Miss Morton," he said, "what was your errand
when you left the library and went upstairs, remaining there nearly
half an hour, on the night of Miss Van Norman's death?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do any such thing!" snapped Miss Morton, and though
her tone was defiant now, her expression still showed fear and
dismay.</p>

<p>"You must have forgotten. Think a moment. You were seen to leave
the library, and you were also seen after you reached the upper
floors. So try to recollect clearly, and state your errand upstairs
at that time."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was overcome at the tragedy of the occasion, and I
went to my own room to be alone for a time."</p>

<p>"Did you go directly from the library to your own room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Without stopping in any other room on the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Think again, please. Perhaps I had better tell you, a witness
has already told of your stopping on the way to your own room."</p>

<p>"She told falsely, then. I went straight to my bedroom."</p>

<p>"In the third story?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Coroner Benson was a patient man. He had no wish to confound
Miss Morton with Marie's evidence, and too, there was a chance that
Marie had not told the truth. So he spoke again persuasively:</p>

<p>"You went there afterward, but first you stopped for a moment or
two in Miss Van Norman's sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Who says I did?"</p>

<p>"An eye-witness, who chanced to see you."</p>

<p>"Chanced to see me, indeed! Nothing of the sort! It was that
little French minx, Marie, who is everlastingly spying about! Well,
she is not to be believed."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to doubt your own statement, Miss Morton, but
another member of the household also saw you. Denial is useless; it
would be better for you to tell us simply why you went to Miss Van
Norman's room at that time."</p>

<p>"It's nobody's business," snapped Miss Morton. "My errand there
had nothing to do in any way with Madeleine Van Norman, dead or
alive."</p>

<p>"Then, there is no reason you should not tell frankly what that
errand was."</p>

<p>"I have my own reasons, and I refuse to tell." Mr. Benson
changed his tactics.</p>

<p>"Miss Morton," he said, "when did you first know that you were
to inherit this house and also a considerable sum of money at the
death of Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>The effect of this sudden question was startling.</p>

<p>Miss Morton seemed to be taken off her guard. She turned red,
then paled to a sickly white. Once or twice she essayed to speak,
but hesitated and did not do so.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the coroner, "that cannot be a difficult
question to answer. When was your first intimation that you were a
beneficiary by the terms of Miss Van Norman's will?"</p>

<p>And now Miss Morton had recovered her bravado.</p>

<p>"When the will was read," she said in cold, firm accents.</p>

<p>"No; you knew it before that. You learned it when you went to
Miss Van Norman's room and read some papers which were in her desk.
You read from a small private memorandum book that she had
bequeathed this place to you at her death."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," returned the quick, snappy voice. "I knew
it before that."</p>

<p>"And you just said you learned of it first when the will was
read!"</p>

<p>"Well, I forgot. Madeleine told me the day I came here last year
that she had made a will leaving the house to me, because she
thought it should have been mine any way."</p>

<p>"The day you were here last year, she told you this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we had a little conversation on the subject, and she told
me."</p>

<p>"Why did you not say this when I first asked you concerning the
matter?"</p>

<p>"I forgot it. Miss Morton spoke nonchalantly, as if
contradicting oneself was a matter of no moment.</p>

<p>"Then you knew of your legacy before Miss Van Norman died?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now that I think of it, I believe I did." She was
certainly a difficult witness. She seemed unable to look upon the
questions as important, and her answers were given either in a
flippant or savage manner.</p>

<p>"Then why did you go to Miss Van Norman's room to look for her
will that night?"</p>

<p>"Her will? I didn't!"</p>

<p>"No, not the will that bequeathed you the house, but a later
will that made a different disposal of it."</p>

<p>"There wasn't such a one," said Miss Morton, in a low, scared
voice.</p>

<p>"What, then, was the paper which you took from Miss Van Norman's
desk, carried to your own room, and burned?"</p>

<p>The coroner's voice was not persuasive now; it was accusing, and
his face was stern as he awaited her reply.</p>

<p>Again Miss Morton's face blanched to white. Her thin lips formed
a straight line, and her eyes fell, but her voice was strong and
sibilant, as she fairly hissed:</p>

<p>"How dare you! Of what do you accuse me?"</p>

<p>"Of burning a paper which you took secretly from Miss Van
Norman's private desk."</p>

<p>A moment's hesitation, and then, "I did not do it," she said
clearly.</p>

<p>"But you were seen to do it."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By a disinterested and credible witness."</p>

<p>"By a sly, spying French servant!"</p>

<p>"It matters not by whom; you are asked to explain the act of
burning that paper."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to explain. I deny it."</p>

<p>And try as he would Mr. Benson could not prevail upon Miss
Morton to admit that she had burned a paper.</p>

<p>He confronted her with the witness, Marie, but Miss Morton
coldly refused to listen to her, or to pay any attention to what
she said. She insisted that Marie was not speaking the truth, and
as the matter rested between the two, there was nothing more to be
done.</p>

<p>Kitty French said that she saw Miss Morton go into Madeleine's
room, and afterward go upstairs to her own room, but she knew
nothing about the papers in question.</p>

<p>Still adhering to her denial of Marie's story, Miss Morton was
excused from the witness stand.</p>

<p>Another witness called was Dorothy Burt. Fessenden was sorry
that this had to be, for he dreaded to have the fact of Carleton's
infatuation for this girl brought into public notice.</p>

<p>Miss Burt was a model witness, as to her manner and demeanor.
She answered promptly and clearly all the coroner's questions, and
at first Rob thought that perhaps she was, after all, the innocent
child that Carleton thought her.</p>

<p>But he couldn't help realizing, as the cross-questioning went
on, that Miss Burt really gave very little information of any
value. Perhaps because she had none to give, perhaps because she
chose to withhold it.</p>

<p>"Your name?" Mr. Benson had first asked.</p>

<p>"Dorothy Burt," was the answer, and the modest voice, with a
touch of sadness, as befitting the occasion, seemed to have just
the right ring to it.</p>

<p>"Your occupation?"</p>

<p>"I am companion and social secretary to Mrs. Carleton."</p>

<p>"Do you know of anything that can throw any light on any part of
the mystery surrounding the death of Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>Miss Burt drew her pretty eyebrows slightly together, and
thought a moment.</p>

<p>"No," she said quietly; "I am sure I do not."</p>

<p>So gentle and sweet was she, that many a questioner would have
dismissed her then and there; but Mr. Benson, hoping to get at
least a shred of evidence bearing on Schuyler Carleton's strange
behavior, continued to question her.</p>

<p>"Tell us, please, Miss Burt, what you know of Mr. Carleton's
actions on the night of Miss Van Norman's death."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carleton's actions?" The delicate eyebrows lifted as if in
perplexity at the question.</p>

<p>"Yes; detail his actions, so far as you know them, from the time
he came home to dinner that evening."</p>

<p>"Why, let me see;" pretty Dorothy looked thoughtful again. "He
came to dinner, as usual. Mr. Fessenden was there, but no other
guest. After dinner we all sat in the music room. I played a
little,&mdash;just some snatches of certain music that Mrs.
Carleton is fond of. Mr. Carleton and Mr. Fessenden chatted
together."</p>

<p>Rob raised his own eyebrows a trifle at this. Carleton had not
been at all chatty; indeed, Fessenden and Mrs. Carleton had
sustained the burden of the conversation; and while Miss Burt had
played, it had been bits of romantic music that Rob felt sure had
been for Schuyler's delectation more than his mother's.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Mr. Benson.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Miss Burt; "we all went to our rooms
early, as the next day was the day appointed for Mr. Carleton's
wedding, and we assumed he wanted to be alone."</p>

<p>Rob looked up astounded. Was she going to make no mention of the
stroll in the rose-garden? He almost hoped she wouldn't, and yet
that was certainly the evidence Mr. Benson was after.</p>

<p>"You said good-night to Mr. Carleton at what time, then?" was
the next rather peculiar question.</p>

<p>It might have been imagination, but Fessenden thought the girl
was going to name an earlier hour, then, catching sight of Rob's
steady eyes upon her, she hesitated an instant, and then said:
"About ten o'clock, I think."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carleton and Mr. Fessenden went to their rooms at the same
time?"</p>

<p>Dorothy Burt turned very pale. She shot a quick glance at
Schuyler Carleton and another at Fessenden, and then said in a low
tone: "They had gone upstairs a short time before."</p>

<p>"And you remained downstairs for a time with Mr. Carleton?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The answer, merely a whisper, seemed forced upon her
lips.</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>Again the hesitation. Again the swift glances at Carleton and
Rob, and then the low answer:</p>

<p>"In the rose-garden."</p>

<p>Fessenden understood. The girl had no desire to tell these
things, but she knew that he knew the truth, and so she was too
clever to lie uselessly.</p>

<p>"How long were you two in the rose-garden, Miss Burt?"</p>

<p>Another pause. Somehow, Fessenden seemed to see the workings of
the girl's mind. If she designated a long time it would seem
important. If too short a time, Rob would know of her inaccuracy.
And if she said she didn't know, it would lend a meaning to the
rose-garden interview which it were better to avoid.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a half-hour," she said, at last, and, though outwardly
calm, her quickly-drawn breath and shining eyes betokened a
suppressed excitement of some sort.</p>

<p>"And you left Mr. Carleton at ten o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know what he did after that?"</p>

<p>"I do not!" the answer rang out clearly, as if Miss Burt were
glad to be well past the danger point of the dialogue. But it came
back at her with the next question.</p>

<p>"What was the tenor of your conversation with Mr. Carleton in
the rose garden?"</p>

<p>At this Dorothy Burt's calm gave way. She trembled, her red
lower lip quivered, and her eyelids fluttered, almost as if she
were about to faint.</p>

<p>But, by a quick gesture, she straightened herself up, and,
looking her interlocutor in the eyes said:</p>

<p>"I trust I am not obliged to answer that very personal
question."</p>

<p>Like a flash it came to Fessenden that her perturbation had been
merely a clever piece of acting. She had trembled and seemed
greatly distressed in order that Mr. Benson's sympathy might be so
aroused that he would not press the question.</p>

<p>And indeed it required a hardened heart to insist on an answer
from the lovely, agitated girl.</p>

<p>But Mr. Benson was not so susceptible as some younger men, and,
moreover, he was experienced in the ways of witnesses.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to be so personal, Miss Burt," he said firmly; "but
I fear it is necessary for us to learn the purport of your talk
with Mr. Carleton at that time."</p>

<p>Dorothy Burt looked straight at Schuyler Carleton.</p>

<p>Neither gave what might be called a gesture, and yet a message
and a response flashed between the two.</p>

<p>Rob Fessenden, watching intently, translated it to mean a simple
negative on Schuyler's part, but the question in the girl's eyes he
could not read.</p>

<p>Carleton's "No," however, was as plain as if spoken, and,
apparently comprehending, Miss Burt went evenly on.</p>

<p>"We talked," she said, "on such subjects as might be expected on
the eve of a man's wedding-day. We discussed the probability of
pleasant weather, mention was made of Miss Van Norman and her
magnificent personality. The loneliness of Mrs. Carleton after her
son's departure was touched upon, and, while I cannot remember
definitely, I think our whole talk was on those or kindred
topics."</p>

<p>"Why did you so hesitate a moment ago, when I asked you to tell
this?"</p>

<p>Dorothy opened her lovely eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>"Hesitate! Why, I didn't. Why should I?" Mr. Benson was at last
put to rout. She had hesitated&mdash;more than hesitated; she had
been distinctly averse to relating what she now detailed as a most
indifferent conversation, but, in the face of that expression of
injured innocence, Mr. Benson could say no more on that
subject.</p>

<p>"When you left Mr. Carleton," he went on, "did you know he was
about to come over here to Miss Van Norman's?"</p>

<p>Again the telegraphic signals between Miss Burt and
Carleton.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash&mdash;invisible to most of the onlookers, but
distinctly seen by Fessenden&mdash;a question was asked and
answered.</p>

<p>"No," she said quickly; "I did not."</p>

<p>"You left him at ten o'clock, then, and did not see him again
that night?"</p>

<p>"That is correct."</p>

<p>"And you have no idea how he was occupied from ten o'clock,
on?"</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>"That's all at present, Miss Burt."</p>

<p>The girl left the witness-stand looking greatly troubled.</p>

<p>But the suspicious Mr. Fessenden firmly believed she looked
troubled because it made her more prettily pathetic.</p>

<p>He wasn't entirely right in this, but neither was Dorothy Burt
quite as ingenuous as she appeared.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br>
Carleton Is Frank</h3>

<p>Nearly a week had passed.</p>

<p>The funeral of Madeleine Van Norman had been such as befitted
the last of the name, and she had been reverently laid away to rest
in the old family vault.</p>

<p>But the mystery of her death was not yet cleared up. The
coroner's inquest had been finished, but most of the evidence,
though vaguely indicative, had been far from conclusive.</p>

<p>No further witnesses had been found, and no further important
fact had been discovered.</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton maintained the same inscrutable air, and,
though often nervous to the verge of collapse, had reiterated his
original story over and over again without deviation. He still
refused to state his errand to the Van Norman house on the night of
Madeleine's death. He still declined to say what he was doing
between the time he entered the house and the time when he cried
out for help.</p>

<p>He himself asserted there was little, if any, time therein
unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Tom Willard, of course, repeated his story, and it was publicly
corroborated by witnesses from the hotel. Tom had changed some
during these few days. The sudden accession of a large fortune
seemed to burden him rather than to bring him joy. But no one
wondered at this when they remembered the sad circumstances which
gave him his wealth, and remembered, too, what was no secret to
anybody, that he had deeply loved his cousin Madeleine. Of the
other witnesses, Cicely Dupuy was the only one whose later evidence
was not entirely in accordance with her earlier statements. She
often contradicted herself, and when in the witness chair was
subject to sudden fainting attacks, whether real or assumed no one
was quite sure.</p>

<p>And so, after the most exhaustive inquiry and the most diligent
sifting of evidence, the jury could return only the time-worn
verdict, "Death at the hands of some person or persons
unknown."</p>

<p>But in addition to this it was recommended by the jury that
Schuyler Carleton be kept under surveillance. There had not been
enough evidence to warrant his arrest, but the district attorney
was so convinced of the man's guilt that he felt sure proofs of it
would sooner or later be brought to light.</p>

<p>Carleton himself seemed apathetic in the matter. He quite
realized that his guilt was strongly suspected by most of the
community, but, instead of breaking down under this, he seemed
rather to accept it sadly and without dispute.</p>

<p>But though the inquest itself was over, vigorous investigation
was going on. A detective of some reputation had the case in hand
officially, and, unlike many celebrated detectives, he was quite
willing to confer with or to be advised by young Fessenden.</p>

<p>Spurred by the courtesy and confidence of his superior, Rob
devoted himself with energy to the work of unravelling the mystery,
but it was baffling work. As he confessed to Kitty French, who was
in all things his confidante, every avenue of argument led up
against a blank wall.</p>

<p>"Either Carleton did do or he did not," he said reflectively.
"If he did, there's absolutely no way we can prove it; and if he
didn't, who did?"</p>

<p>Kitty agreed that this was a baffling situation.</p>

<p>"What about that cachou, or whatever you call it?" she said.</p>

<p>"It didn't amount to anything as a clue," returned Rob moodily.
"I showed it to some of the servants, and they said they had never
seen such a thing before. Harris was quite sure that none of the
men who came here ever use them. I asked Carleton, just casually,
for one the other day, and he said he didn't have any and never had
had any. I asked Willard for one at another time, and he said the
same thing. It must have been dropped by some of the decorator's
men; they seemed a Frenchy crowd, and I've been told the French are
addicted to these things." Rob took the tiny silver sphere from his
pocket and looked at it as he talked. "Besides, it wouldn't mean a
thing if it had belonged to anybody. I just picked it up because it
was the only thing I could find in the drawing-room that wasn't too
heavy to lift."</p>

<p>Rob put his useless clue back into his pocket with a sigh. "I'm
going to give it up," he said, "and go back to New York. I've
stayed here in Mapleton over a week now, hoping I could be of some
help to poor old Carleton; but I can't&mdash;and yet I know he's
innocent! Fairbanks, the detective on the case, is pleasant to work
with, and I like him; but if he can't find out anything, of course
I needn't hope to. I'd stay on, though, if I thought Carleton cared
to have me. But I'm not sure he does, so I'm going back home. When
are you going to New York, Kitty?"</p>

<p>But the girl did not answer his question. "Rob," she said, for
the intimacy between these two young people had reached the stage
of first names, "I have an inspiration."</p>

<p>"I wish I had some faith in it, my dear girl; but your
inspirations have such an inevitable way of leading up a tree."</p>

<p>"I know it, and this may also. But listen: doesn't Schuyler
believe that you suspect him?"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect him," declared Rob, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"I know you don't; but doesn't Schuyler think you do?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know; I never thought about it. I think very
likely he does."</p>

<p>"And he's so proud, of course he won't discuss it with you, or
justify himself in any way. Now, look here, Rob: you go to
Schuyler, and in your nicest, friendliest way tell him you don't
believe he did it. Then&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;if he is
innocent, he will expand and confide in you, and you may get a
whole lot of useful information. And on the other hand, if he is
guilty, you'll probably learn the fact from his manner."</p>

<p>Rob thought it over. "Kitty," he said at last, "you're a trump.
I believe you have hit upon the only thing there is to try, and
I'll try it before I decide to go to New York. I'll stay in
Mapleton a day or two longer, for the more I think about it, the
more I think I haven't been fair or just to the old boy in not even
asking for his confidence."</p>

<p>"It isn't that so much, but you must assure him of your belief
in him. Tell him you know he is innocent."</p>

<p>"I do know it.'</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that has been your firm conviction all along,
though it isn't mine. But don't tell him it isn't mine; just tell
him of your own confidence and sympathy and faith in him, and see
what happens."</p>

<p>"A woman's intuitions are always ahead of a man's," declared Rob
heartily. "I'll do just as you say, Kitty, and I'll do it
whole-heartedly, and to the best of my ability."</p>

<p>Kitty was still staying in the Van Norman house, which had not
yet been, and probably would not soon be, known by any other
name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham had gone away temporarily, though it was believed
that when she returned it would be merely to arrange for her
permanent departure. The good lady had received a generous bequest
in Madeleine's will, and, except for the severing of old
associations, she had no desire to remain in a house no longer the
home of the Van Normans.</p>

<p>Miss Morton was therefore mistress of the establishment, and
thoroughly did she enjoy her position. She invited Miss French to
remain for a time as her visitor, and Kitty had stayed on, in hope
of learning the truth about the tragedy.</p>

<p>At Miss Morton's invitation Tom Willard had left the hotel and
returned to his old room, which he had given up to Miss Morton
herself at Madeleine's request.</p>

<p>Willard without doubt sorrowed deeply for his beautiful cousin,
but he was a man who rarely gave voice to his grief, and his
feelings were evident more from his manner than his words. He
seemed preoccupied and absent-minded, and, quite unlike Miss
Morton, he was in no haste to take even preliminary steps toward
the actual acquisition of his fortune.</p>

<p>Fessenden was curious to know whether Willard suspected that his
cousin's death was the work of Schuyler Carleton. But when he tried
to sound Tom on the subject he was met by a rebuff. It was politely
worded, but it was nevertheless a plain-spoken rebuff, and
conclusively forbade further discussion of the subject. And so as
an outcome of Kitty's suggestion, Fessenden determined to have a
plain talk with Schuyler Carleton.</p>

<p>"Old man," he said, the first time opportunity found him alone
with Schuyler in the Carleton library, "I want to offer you my
help. I know that sounds presumptuous, but we're old friends,
Carleton, and I think I may be allowed a little presumption on that
score. And first, though it seems to me absurdly unnecessary, I
want to assure you of my belief in your own innocence. Pshaw,
belief is a weak word! I know, I am positive, that you no more
killed that girl than I did!"</p>

<p>The light that broke over Carleton's countenance was a fine
vindication of Kitty's theory. The weary, drawn look disappeared
from his face, and, impulsively grasping Rob's hand, he exclaimed,
"Do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I mean it. I never for an instant thought it
possible. You're not that sort of a man."</p>

<p>"Not that sort of a man;" Carleton spoke musingly. "That isn't
the point, Fessenden. I've thought this thing out pretty
thoroughly, and I must say I don't wonder that they suspect me of
the deed. You see, it's a case of exclusive opportunity."</p>

<p>"That phrase always makes me tired," declared Rob. "If there's
one thing more misleading than 'circumstantial evidence,' it is
'exclusive opportunity.' Now, look here, Carleton, if you'll let
me, I'm going to take up this matter. Should you be arrested and
tried&mdash;and I may as well tell you frankly I'm pretty sure that
you will be&mdash;I want to act as your lawyer. But in the meantime
I want to endeavor to track down the real murderer and so leave no
occasion for your trial."</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton looked like a condemned man who has just been
granted a reprieve.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Fessenden," he said, "you're the only one who does
believe me innocent?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! Nobody believes you guilty."</p>

<p>"They're so strongly suspicious that it's little short of
belief," said Carleton sadly. "And truly, Rob, I can't blame them.
Everything is against me.</p>

<p>"I admit there are some things that must be explained away; and,
Schuyler, if I'm to be your lawyer, or, rather, since I am your
lawyer, I must ask you to be perfectly frank with me."</p>

<p>Carleton looked troubled. He was not of a frank nature, and it
was always difficult for him to confide his personal affairs to
anybody. Fessenden saw this, and resolved upon strong measures.</p>

<p>"You must tell me everything," he said somewhat sternly. "You
must do this at the sacrifice of your own wishes. You must ignore
yourself, and lay your whole heart bare to me, for the sake of your
mother, and&mdash;for the sake of the woman you love."</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton started as if he had been physically
struck.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he cried.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," said Fessenden gently. "You did not love
the woman you were about to marry. You do love another. Can you
deny it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Carleton, settling back into his apathy. "And since
you know that, I may as well tell you all. I admired and respected
Madeleine Van Norman, and when I asked her to marry me I thought I
loved her. After that I met some one else. You know this?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Miss Burt."</p>

<p>"Yes. She came into this house as my mother's companion, and
almost from the first time I saw her I knew that she and not
Madeleine was the one woman in the world for me. But, Fessenden,
never by word or lock did I betray this to Miss Burt while
Madeleine lived. If she guessed it, it was only because of her
woman's intuition. I was always loyal to Madeleine in word and
deed, if I could not be in thought."</p>

<p>"Was it not your duty to tell Madeleine this?"</p>

<p>"I tried several times to do so, but, though I hate to sound
egotistical, she loved me very deeply, and I felt that honor bound
me to her."</p>

<p>"I'm not here to preach to you, and that part of it is, of
course, not my affair. I know your nature, and I know that you were
as loyal to Miss Van Norman as you would have been had you never
seen Miss Burt, and I honor and respect you for it But you were
jealous of Willard?"</p>

<p>"My nature is insanely jealous, yes. And though he was her
cousin, I knew Willard was desperately in love with her, and
somehow it always made me frantic to see him showing affection
toward the woman I meant to make my wife."</p>

<p>"She was not in love with Willard?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. Madeleine's heart beat only for me,
ungrateful wretch that I am. Her little feints at flirting with
Willard were only to pique me. I knew this, and yet to see them
together always roused that demon of jealousy which I cannot
control. Fessenden, aside from all else, how can people think I
killed the woman who loved me as she did?"</p>

<p>"Of course that argument appeals to you, and of course it does
to me. But you must see how others, not appreciating all this, and
even suspecting or surmising that your heart was not entirely with
your intended bride&mdash;you must see that some appearances, at
least, are against you."</p>

<p>"I do see; and I see it so plainly that even to me those
appearances seem conclusive of my guilt."</p>

<p>"Never mind what they seem to you, old man; they don't seem so
to me, and now I'm going to get to work. First, as I told you, you
are going to be frank with me. What were you doing in the Van
Norman house before you went into the library?"</p>

<p>Schuyler Carleton blushed. It was not the shame of a guilty man,
but the embarrassment of one detected in some betrayal of
sentiment.</p>

<p>"Of course I will tell you," he said after a moment "I went
there on an errand which I wished to keep entirely secret. There is
a foolish superstition in our family that has been observed for
many generations. An old reliquary which was blessed by some
ancient Pope has been handed down from father to son for many
generations. The superstition is that unless this ancient trinket
hangs over the head of a bridegroom on his wedding day, ill fortune
will follow him through life. It is part of the superstition that
the reliquary must be put in place secretly, and especially without
the knowledge of the bride, else its charm is broken. The whole
notion is foolishness, but as my wedding was an ill-starred one,
any way, I hoped to gain happiness, if possible, by this means. Of
course, I don't think I really had any faith in the thing, but it
is such an old tradition in the family that it never occurred to me
not to follow it. My mother gave me the reliquary, after my
father's death, telling me the history of it. I had it with me when
I was at the house in the afternoon, and I hoped to find an
opportunity to fasten it up in that floral bower, unobserved. But
the workmen were busy there when I came away, and I knew there
would be many people about the next morning; so I decided to return
late at night to do my errand. I had no thought of seeing
Madeleine. There were no bright lights in the house, and the
drawing-room itself was dark save for what light came in from the
hall. I did go into the house, I suppose, at about quarter after
eleven. I didn't note the time, but I dare say Mr. Hunt was
correct. Without glancing toward the library then, I went at once
to the drawing-room and hid the reliquary among the garlands that
formed the top of that bower. As I stood there, I thought over what
I was about to do the next day. It seemed to me that I was doing
right, and I vowed to myself to be a true and loving husband to my
chosen wife. I stood there some time, thinking, and then turned to
go away. As I left the room I noticed a low light in the library,
and it occurred to me that if any one should be in there it would
be wiser to make my presence known. So I crossed the hall and went
into the library. The rest you know. The sudden shock of seeing
Madeleine as she was, just as I had come from what was to have been
our bridal bower, nearly unhinged my mind. I picked up the dagger,
I turned on lights and rang bells, not knowing what I did. Now I
have told you the truth, and if my demeanor has seemed strange, can
you wonder at it in a man who experienced what I did, and then is
suspected of being the criminal?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no," said Fessenden, grasping his friend's hand in
sincere sympathy. "It was a terrible experience, and the injustice
of the suspicion resting on you makes it a hundredfold more
horrible."</p>

<p>"When I went back to the house next morning I watched for an
opportunity, and managed, unobserved, to remove the reliquary from
its floral hiding-place. I shall never use it now. There are some
men fated not to know happiness, and I am of those."</p>

<p>"Let us hope not," said Fessenden gently. "But whatever the
future may hold, let us now keep to the business at hand, and use
every possible means to discover the evil-doer."</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX<br>
The Truth About Miss Burt</h3>

<p>Confidential relations thus being established between the two
men, Fessenden wished very much to learn a little more concerning
Dorothy Burt, but found it a difficult subject to introduce.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, greatly to his satisfaction when Carleton
himself led up to it.</p>

<p>"I've been frank with you, Rob," he said, "but perhaps there's
one more thing I ought to confess."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man, I'm not your father confessor. If you've any
facts, hand them over, but don't feel that you must justify
yourself to me."</p>

<p>"But I do want to tell you this, for it will help you to
understand my sensitiveness in the whole matter. As you know, Rob,
I do love Dorothy Burt, and it is only since Madeleine's death that
I have allowed myself to realize how much I love her. I shall never
ask her to marry me, for the stigma of this dreadful affair will
always remain attached to my name, and suspicion would more than
ever turn to me, if I showed my regard for Dorothy. As I told you,
I never spoke a word of love to her while Madeleine was alive. But
she knew,&mdash;she couldn't help knowing. Brave little girl that
she is, she never evinced that knowledge, and it was only when I
surprised a sudden look in her eyes that I suspected she too cared
for me. And yet, though we never admitted it to each other,
Madeleine suspected the truth, and even taxed me with it. Of course
I denied it; of course I vowed to Madeleine that she, and she only,
was the woman I loved; because I thought it the right and honorable
thing to do. If she hadn't cared so much for me herself, I might
have asked her to release me; but I never did, and never even
thought of doing so&mdash;until&mdash; that last evening.
Then&mdash;well, you know how she had favored Willard in preference
to me in the afternoon, and, though I well knew it was only to
tease me, yet it did tease me, and I came home really angry at her.
It was an ill-advised occasion for her to favor her cousin."</p>

<p>"I agree with you; but from the little I know of Miss Van
Norman's nature, I judge she was easily piqued and quick to
retaliate."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was; we were both too quick to take offense, but, of
course, the real reason for that was the lack of true faith between
us. Well, then I came home, angered, as I said, and Dorothy was
so&mdash;so different from Madeleine, so altogether sweet and dear,
so free from petty bickering or sarcasm, that for the first time I
felt as if I ought not to marry the woman I did not love. I brooded
over this thought all through the dinner hour and the early
evening. Then you and mother left us, and I asked Dorothy to go for
a little stroll in the garden. She refused at first&mdash;I think
the child was a little fearful of what I might say&mdash;but I said
nothing of the tumult in my heart. I realized, though, that she
knew I loved her, and that&mdash;she cared for me. I had thought
she did, but never before had I felt so sure of it,&mdash;and the
knowledge completely unmanned me. I bade her good night abruptly,
and rather coldly, and then I went into the library and fought it
out with myself. And I concluded that my duty was to Madeleine. I
confess to a frantic desire to go to her and ask her, even at that
last minute, to free me from my troth, and then I thought what a
scandal it would create, and I knew that even if Dorothy and I both
suffered, it was Madeleine's right to leave matters as they were.
Having decided, I proceeded to carry out my earlier intention of
going over to the Van Norman house with the reliquary. It was so
late then that I had no thought of seeing Madeleine, but&mdash;and
this, Rob, is my confession&mdash;on the way there, I still had a
lingering thought that if I should see Madeleine I would tell her
the truth, and leave it to her generosity to set me free. And it
was this guilty knowledge&mdash;this shameful weakness on my
part&mdash;that added to my dismay and horror at finding
her&mdash;as she was, in the library. I read that awful
paper,&mdash;I thought of course, then, she had taken her own life,
and I feared it was because she knew of my falseness and treachery.
This made me feel as if I were really her murderer, quite as much
as if I had struck the actual blow."</p>

<p>"Don't take it like that, Schuyler; that's morbid imagination.
You acted loyally to Miss Van Norman to the last, and though the
whole situation was most unfortunate, you were not really to blame.
No man can rule his own heart, and, any way, it is not for me to
comment on that side of the matter. But since you have spoken thus
frankly of Miss Burt, I must ask you how, with your slight
acquaintance, you are so sure she is worthy of your regard."</p>

<p>"Our acquaintance isn't so slight, Rob. She has been some time
with mother,&mdash;more than six months,&mdash;and we have been
good friends from the first. And I know her, perhaps by Love's
intuition,&mdash;but I know her very soul,&mdash;and she is the
truest, sweetest nature God ever made."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;forgive me&mdash;she has impressed me as being not
quite so frank and ingenuous as she appears."</p>

<p>"That's only because you don't know her, and you judge by your
own uncertain and mistaken impressions."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;when she gave her evidence at the inquest&mdash;she
seemed to hesitate, and to waver as to what she should say. It did
not have the ring of truth, though her manner was charming and even
naive."</p>

<p>"You misjudge her, Rob. I say this because I know it. And I
can't blame you, for, knowing of my engagement to Madeleine, you
are quite right to disapprove of my interest in another woman."</p>

<p>"It isn't disapproval exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't suspicion, is it? You don't think that Dorothy
had any hand in the tragedy, do you?" Carleton spoke savagely, with
an abrupt change from his former manner, and as he heard his
friend's words, Rob knew that he himself had no more suspicion of
Dorthy Burt than he had of Carleton. She had testified in a
constrained, uncertain manner, but that was not enough to rouse
suspicion of her in any way.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Fessenden declared heartily. "Don't be absurd.
But have I your permission to put a few questions to Miss Burt, not
in your presence?"</p>

<p>"Of course you have. I trust you to be kind and gentle with her,
for she is a sensitive little thing; but I know whatever you may
say to her, or she to you, will only make you see more clearly what
a dear girl she is."</p>

<p>Fessenden was far from sure of this, but, having gained
Carleton's permission to interview Miss Burt, he said no more about
her just then.</p>

<p>For a long time the two men discussed the situation. But the
more they talked the less they seemed able to form any plausible
theory of the crime. At last Fessenden said, "There is one thing
certain: if we are to believe Harris's statement about the locks
and bolts, no one could have entered from the outside."</p>

<p>"No," said Carleton; "and so we're forced to turn our attention
to some one inside the house. But each one in turn seems so utterly
impossible. We cannot even suggest Mrs. Markham or Miss
Morton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't altogether like that Miss Morton. She acted queerly
from the beginning."</p>

<p>"Not exactly queerly; she is not a woman of good breeding or
good taste, but she only arrived that afternoon, and it's too
absurd to picture her stabbing her hostess that night."</p>

<p>"I don't care how absurd it is; she profited by Miss Van
Norman's death, and she was certainly avid to come into her
inheritance at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Schuyler almost impatiently. "But I saw Miss
Morton when she first came downstairs, and though she was shocked,
she really did nobly in controlling herself, and even in directing
others what to do. You see, I was there, and I saw them all, and
I'm sure that Miss Morton had no more to do with that dreadful deed
than I had."</p>

<p>"Then what about her burning that will as soon as Miss Van
Norman was dead?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was a will; and, in fact, I'm not sure she
burned anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she did; I heard that French maid's story, when she
first told it, and it was impossible to believe she was making it
up. Besides, Miss French saw Miss Morton rummaging in the
desk."</p>

<p>"She is erratic, I think, and perhaps, not overrefined but I'm
sure she never could have been the one to do that thing. Why, that
woman is frightened at everything. She wouldn't dare commit a
crime. She is fearfully timid."</p>

<p>"Dismissing Miss Morton, then, let us take the others, one by
one. I think we may pass over Miss French and Miss Gardner. We have
no reason to think of Mr. Hunt in this connection, and this brings
us down to the servants."</p>

<p>"Not quite to the servants," said Carleton, with a peculiar look
in his eyes that caught Rob's attention.</p>

<p>"Not quite to the servants? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Carleton said nothing, but with a troubled gaze he looked
intently at Fessenden.</p>

<p>"Cicely!" exclaimed Rob. "You think that?"</p>

<p>"I think nothing," said Carleton slowly, "and an innocent man
who was suspected, I hate to hint a suspicion of one who may be
equally innocent. But does it not seem to you there are some
questions to be answered concerning Miss Dupuy?" Fessenden sat
thinking for a long time. Surely these two men were just and even
generous, and unwilling to suspect without cause.</p>

<p>"There are points to be explained," said Rob slowly; "and,
Schuyler, since we are talking frankly, I must ask you this: do you
know that Miss Dupuy is very much in love with you?"</p>

<p>"How absurd! That cannot be. Why, I've scarcely ever spoken to
the girl."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter&mdash;the fact remains. Now, you know she
wrote that paper which stated that she loved S., but he did not
love her. That initial designated yourself, and, because of this
unfortunate attachment, Cicely was of course jealous, or rather
envious, of Madeleine. I have had an interview with Miss Dupuy, in
which she gave me much more information about herself than she
thought she did, and one of the facts I discovered&mdash;from what
she didn't say, rather than what she did&mdash;was her hopeless
infatuation for you."</p>

<p>"It's difficult to believe this, but now that you tell me it is
true, I can look back to some episodes which seem to indicate it.
But I cannot think it would lead to such desperate results."</p>

<p>"There's one thing certain: when we do find the criminal it will
have to be somebody we never would have dreamed of; for if there
were any probable person we would suspect him already. Now, merely
for the sake of argument, let us see if Cicely did not have
'exclusive opportunity' as well as yourself. Remember she was the
last one who saw Miss Van Norman alive. I mean, so far as we have
had any witness or evidence. This fact in itself is always a matter
for investigation. And granting the fact of two women, both in love
with you, one about to marry you, and the other perhaps insanely
jealous; a weapon at hand, no one else astir in the house&mdash; is
there not at least occasion for inquiry?"</p>

<p>Carleton looked aghast. He took up the story, and in a low voice
said, "I can add to that. When I came in, as Hunt has testified,
Cicely was leaning over the banister, still fully dressed. When I
cried out for help fifteen minutes later, Cicely was the first to
run downstairs. She asked no questions, she did not look toward the
library, she glared straight at me with an indescribable expression
of fear and horror. I cannot explain her attitude at that moment,
but if this dreadful thing we have dared to think of could be true,
it would perhaps be a reason."</p>

<p>"And then, you know, she tried to get possession secretly of
that slip of paper, after it had served its purpose."</p>

<p>"Yes, and also after you, by clever observation, had discovered
that she wrote it, and not Madeleine."</p>

<p>"Their writing is strangely alike."</p>

<p>"Yes; even I was deceived, and I have seen much of Madeleine's
writing. Fessenden&mdash;this is an awful thing to hint&mdash;but
do you suppose some of the notes I have had purporting to be from
Miss Van Norman could have been written by Miss Dupuy?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Several people have said the secretary often wrote
notes purporting to be from the mistress."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; formal society notes. But I don't mean that. I mean,
do you suppose Cicely could have written of her own
accord&mdash;even unknown to Madeleine&mdash;as if&mdash;as if, you
know, it were Madeleine herself writing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, on purpose to deceive you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, on purpose to deceive me. It could easily be done. I've
seen so much of both their penmanship, and I never noticed it
especially. I've always taken it for granted that a purely personal
note was written by Madeleine herself. But now&mdash;I wonder."</p>

<p>"Do you mean notes of importance?"</p>

<p>"I mean notes that annoyed me. Notes that voluntarily referred
to her going driving or walking with Willard, when there was no
real reason for her referring to it Could it be that
Cicely&mdash;bah! I cannot say it of any woman!"</p>

<p>"I see your point; and it is more than possible that Miss Dupuy,
knowing of the strained relations between you and Miss Van Norman,
might have done anything she could to widen the breach. It would be
easy, as she wrote so much of the correspondence, to do this
unnoticed."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I mean. Often Madeleine's notes would contain
a gratuitous bit of information about her and Willard, and though
she frequently teased me when we were together, I was surprised at
her writing these things. I feel sure now that sometimes, at least,
they were the work of Miss Dupuy. I can't describe it exactly, but
that would explain lots of things otherwise mysterious."</p>

<p>"This is getting beyond us," said Rob, with a quick sigh. "I
think it my duty to report this to the coroner and to Detective
Fairbanks, who is officially on the case. I thought I liked
detective work, but I don't. It leads one toward too dreadful
conclusions. Will you go with me, Carleton? I shall go at once to
Mr. Benson."</p>

<p>"No, I think it would be better for you to go alone. Remember I
am practically an accused man, and my word would be of little
weight. Moreover, you are a lawyer, and it is your right and duty
to make these things known. But unless forced to do so, I do not
wish to testify against Miss Dupuy." Remembering the girl's
attitude toward Carleton, Rob could not wonder at this, and he went
off alone to the coroner's.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX<br>
Cicely's Flight</h3>

<p>Mr. Benson was astounded at the turn affairs had taken; but
though it had seemed to him that all the evidence had pointed
toward Carleton's guilt, he was really relieved to find another
outlet for his suspicions. He listened attentively to what
Fessenden said, and Rob was careful to express no opinion, but
merely to state such facts as he knew in support of this new
theory:</p>

<p>Detective Fairbanks was sent for, and he, too, listened eagerly
to the latest developments.</p>

<p>It seemed to Rob that Mr. Fairbanks was rather pleased than
otherwise to turn the trend of suspicion in another direction. And
this was true, for though the detective felt a natural reluctance
to suspect a woman, he had dreaded all along lest Carleton should
be looked upon as a criminal merely because there was no one else
to be considered. And Mr. Fairbanks's quick mind realized that if
there were two suspects, there yet might be three, or more, and
Schuyler Carleton would at least have a fair chance.</p>

<p>All things concerned seemed to have taken on a new interest, and
Mr. Fairbanks proposed to begin investigations at once.</p>

<p>"But I don't see," he complained, "why Mr. Carleton so foolishly
concealed that reliquary business. Why didn't he explain that at
once?"</p>

<p>"Carleton is a peculiar nature," said Rob. "He is shrinkingly
sensitive about his private affairs, and, being innocent, he had no
fear at first that even suspicion would rest upon him, so he saw no
reason to tell about what would have been looked upon as a silly
superstition. Had he been brought to trial, he would doubtless have
made a clean breast of the matter. He is a strange man, any way;
very self-contained, abnormally sensitive, and not naturally frank.
But if freed from suspicion he will be more approachable, and may
yet be of help to us in our search."</p>

<p>"Of course, though," said Mr. Fairbanks thoughtfully, "you must
realize that to a disinterested observer this affair of Mr.
Carleton and Miss Burt does not help to turn suspicion away from
him."</p>

<p>"I do realize that," said Rob; "but to an interested observer it
looks different. Why, if Mr. Carleton were the guilty man, he
surely would not tell me so frankly the story of his interest in
Miss Burt."</p>

<p>This was certainly true, and Mr. Fairbanks agreed to it.</p>

<p>Rob had been obliged to tell the detective the facts of the
case, though dilating as little as possible on Carleton's private
affairs.</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Mr. Fairbanks, "we will not consider Mr.
Carleton for the present, but turn toward the new trail, and it may
lead us, at least, in the right direction. If Miss Dupuy is
innocent, our investigations can do her no harm, and if she knows
more than she has told, we may be able to learn something of
importance. But she is of such a hysterical nature, it is difficult
to hold a satisfactory conversation with her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be advisable for me to talk to her first,"
said Rob. "I might put her more at her ease than a formidable
detective could, and then I could report to you what I learn."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the other; "you could choose an expedient time,
and, being in the same house, Miss French might help you."</p>

<p>"She could secure an interview for me quite casually, I am sure.
And then, if I don't succeed, you can insist upon an official
session, and question her definitely."</p>

<p>"There are indications," mused Mr. Fairbanks, "that accidental
leaving of such a paper on the table is a little unlikely. If it
were done purposely, it would be far easier to understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, and, granting there is any ground for suspicion, all Miss
Dupuy's hysterics and disinclination to answer questions would be
explained."</p>

<p>"Well, I hate to suspect a woman,&mdash;but we won't call it
suspicion; we'll call it simply inquiry. You do what you can to get
a friendly interview, and, if necessary, I'll insist on an official
one later." Rob Fessenden went straight over to the Van Norman
house, eager to tell Kitty French the developments of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>She was more than willing to revise her opinions, and was
honestly glad that Mr. Carleton was practically exonerated.</p>

<p>"Of course there's nothing official," said Rob, after he had
told his whole story, "but the burden of suspicion has been lifted
from Carleton, wherever it may next be placed."</p>

<p>At first Kitty was disinclined to think Cicely could be
implicated.</p>

<p>"She's such a slip of a girl!" she said. "I don't believe that
little blue-eyed, yellow-haired thing could stab anybody."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't reason that way," argued Rob. "Opinions don't
count at all. We must try to get at the facts. Now let us go at
once and interview Miss Dupuy. Can't we see her in that
sitting-room, as we did before? And she mustn't be allowed to faint
this time."</p>

<p>"We can't help her fainting," declared Kitty, a little
indignantly. "You're just as selfish as all other men. Everything
must bow to your will."</p>

<p>"I never pretended to any unmanly degree of unselfishness," said
Rob blandly. "But we must have this interview at once. Will you go
ahead and prepare the way?"</p>

<p>For answer Kitty ran upstairs and knocked at the door of what
had been Madeleine's sitting-room, where Miss Dupuy was usually to
be found at this hour of the day.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Marie, who replied to Kitty's question
with a frightened air.</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy? She is gone away. On the train, with luggage."</p>

<p>"Gone! Why, when did she go?"</p>

<p>"But a half-hour since. She went most suddenly."</p>

<p>"She did indeed! Does Miss Morton know of this?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know, but I think so."</p>

<p>Kitty turned to find Fessenden behind her, and as he had
overheard the latter part of the conversation he came into the room
and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Marie," he said to the maid, "tell us your idea of why Miss
Dupuy went away."</p>

<p>"She was in fear," said Marie deliberately.</p>

<p>"In fear of what?"</p>

<p>"In fear of the detectives, and the questions they ask, and the
dreadful coroner man. Miss Dupuy is not herself any more; she is so
in fear she cannot sleep at night. Always she cries out in her
dream." Fessenden glanced at Kitty. "What does she say, Marie?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing that I can understand, m'sieu; but always low cries of
fear, and sometimes she murmurs, 'I must go away! I cannot again
answer those dreadful questions. I shall betray my secret.' Over
and over she mutters that."</p>

<p>Fessenden began to grow excited. Surely this was evidence, and
Cicely's departure seemed to emphasize it. Without another word he
went in search of Miss Morton.</p>

<p>"Did you know Miss Dupuy was going away?" he said abruptly to
her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "The poor girl is completely worn out. For
the last few days she has been looking over Madeleine's letters and
papers and accounts, and she is really overworked, besides the
fearful nervous strain we are all under."</p>

<p>"Where has she gone?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I meant to ask her to leave an address, but she
said she would write to me as soon as she reached her destination,
and I thought no more about it."</p>

<p>"Miss Morton, she has run away. Some evidence has come to light
that makes it seem possible she may be implicated in Madeleine's
death, and her sudden departure points toward her guilt."</p>

<p>"Guilt! Miss Dupuy? Oh, impossible! She is a strange and
emotional little creature, but she couldn't kill anybody. She isn't
that sort."</p>

<p>"I'm getting a little tired of hearing that this one or that one
'isn't that sort.' Do you suppose anybody in decent society would
ever be designated as one who is that sort? Unless the murderer was
some outside tramp or burglar, it must have been some one probably
not 'of that sort.' But, Miss Morton, we must find Miss Dupuy, and
quickly. When did she go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; some time ago, I think. I ordered the carriage to
take her to the station. Perhaps she hasn't gone yet&mdash;from the
station, I mean."</p>

<p>Rob looked at his watch. "Do you know anything about train
times?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No except that there are not very many trains in the afternoon.
I don't even know which way she is going."</p>

<p>Rob thought quickly. It seemed foolish to try to overtake the
girl at the railway station, but it was the only chance. He dashed
downstairs, and, catching up a cap as he rushed through the hall,
he was out on the road in a few seconds, and running at a steady,
practised gait toward the railroad. After he had gone a few blocks
he saw a motor-car standing in front of a house. He jumped in and
said to the astonished chauffeur, "Whiz me down to the railroad
station, and I'll make it all right with your master, and with you,
too."</p>

<p>The machine was a doctor's runabout, and the chauffeur knew that
the doctor was making a long call, so he was not at all unwilling
to obey this impetuous and masterful young man. Away they went,
doubtless exceeding the speed limit, and in a short time brought up
suddenly at the railroad station.</p>

<p>Rob jumped out, flung a bill to the chauffeur, gave him a card
to give to his master, and waved a good-by as the motor-car
vanished.</p>

<p>He strode into the station, only to be informed by the
ticket-agent that a train had left for New York about a quarter of
an hour since, and another would come along in about five minutes,
which, though it made no regular stop at Mapleton, could be flagged
if desired.</p>

<p>A few further questions brought out the information that a young
woman corresponding to the description of Miss Dupuy had gone on
that train.</p>

<p>Fessenden thought quickly. The second train, a fast one, he knew
would pass the other at a siding, and if he took it, he would reach
New York before Cicely did, and could meet her there when she
arrived at the station.</p>

<p>Had he had longer to consider, he might have acted differently,
but on the impulse of the moment, he bought a ticket, said, "Flag
her, please," and soon he was on the train actually in pursuit of
the escaping girl.</p>

<p>As he settled himself in his seat, he rather enjoyed the fact
that he was doing real detective, work now. Surely Mr. Fairbanks
would be pleased at his endeavors to secure the interview with Miss
Dupuy under such difficulties.</p>

<p>But his plan to meet her at the Grand Central Station was
frustrated by an unforeseen occurrence. His own train was delayed
by a hot box, and he learned that he would not reach New York until
after Miss Dupuy had arrived there.</p>

<p>Return from a way station was possible, but Rob didn't want to
go back to Mapleton with his errand unaccomplished.</p>

<p>He thought it over, and decided on a radical course of
action.</p>

<p>Instead of alighting there himself, he wrote a telegram which he
had despatched from the way station to Miss Kitty French, and which
ran:</p>

<p>Gone to New York. Make M. tell C.s address and wire me at the
Waldorf.</p>

<p>It was a chance, but he took it and, any way, it meant only
spending the night in New York, and returning to Mapleton next day,
if his plan failed.</p>

<p>He had a strong conviction that Marie knew Cicely's address,
although she had denied it. If this were true, Kitty could possibly
learn it from her, and let him know in time to hunt up Cicely in
New York. And if Marie really did not know the address, there was
no harm done, after all.</p>

<p>The excitement of the chase stimulated Rob's mental activity,
and he gave rein to his imagination.</p>

<p>If Cicely Dupuy were guilty, she would act exactly as she had
done, he thought. A calmer, better-balanced woman would have stayed
at Mapleton and braved it out, but Miss Dupuy's excitable
temperament would not let her sleep or rest, and made it impossible
for her to face inquiry discreetly.</p>

<p>Rob purposed, if he received the address he hoped for, to go to
see the girl in New York, and by judicious kindliness of demeanor
to learn more from her about the case than she would tell under
legal pressure.</p>

<p>As it turned out, whatever might be his powers of detective
acumen, his intuition regarding Marie's information was
correct.</p>

<p>Kitty French, quickly catching the tenor of the telegram, took
Marie aside, and commanded her to give up the address. Marie
volubly protested and denied her knowledge, but Kitty was firm, and
the stronger will conquered.</p>

<p>Luckily, Marie at last told, and Kitty went herself to send the
telegram.</p>

<p>Marie accompanied her, as it was then well after dusk, but Kitty
did not permit the girl to enter the telegraph office with her.</p>

<p>And so, by ten o'clock that evening, Rob Fessenden received from
the hotel clerk a telegram bearing an address in West Sixty-sixth
Street, which not only satisfied his wish, but caused him to feel
greatly pleased at his own sagacity.</p>

<p>It was too late to go up there that evening, and so the amateur
detective was forced to curb his impatience until the next morning.
He was afraid the bird might have flown by that time, but there was
no help for it. He thought of telephoning, but he didn't know the
name of the people Cicely had gone to, and too, even if he could
succeeded in getting the call, such a proceeding would only startle
her. So he devoted the rest of the evening to writing a letter to
Kitty French, ostensibly to thank her for her assistance, but
really for the pleasure of writing her. This he posted at midnight,
thinking that if he should be detained longer than he anticipated,
she would then understand why.</p>

<p>Next morning the eager young man ate his breakfast, and read his
paper, a bit impatiently, while he waited for it to be late enough
to start.</p>

<p>Soon after nine, he called a taxicab and went to the address
Kitty had sent him.</p>

<p>Only the house number had been told in the message, so when
Fessenden found himself in the vestibule of an apartment house,
with sixteen names above corresponding bells, he was a bit taken
aback.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd started earlier," he thought, "for it's a matter of
trying them all until I strike the right one."</p>

<p>But he fancied he could deduce something from the names
themselves, at least, for a start.</p>

<p>Eliminating one or two Irish sounding names, also a Smith and a
Miller, he concluded to try first two names which were doubtless
French.</p>

<p>The first gave him no success at all, but, undiscouraged, he
tried the other.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Miss Dupuy," he said, to the woman who opened the
door.</p>

<p>"She is not here," was the curt answer. But the intelligence in
the woman's eye at the mention of the name proved to Fessenden that
at least this was the place.</p>

<p>"Don't misunderstand," he said gently. "I want to see Miss Dupuy
merely for a few moments' friendly conversation. It will be for her
advantage to see me, rather than to refuse."</p>

<p>"But she is not here," repeated the woman. "There is no person
of that name in my house."</p>

<p>"When did she go?" asked Rob quietly&mdash;so quietly that the
woman was taken off her guard.</p>

<p>"About half an hour ago," she said, and then, with a
horror-stricken look at her own thoughtlessness, she added hastily,
"I mean my friend went. Your Miss Dupuy I do not know."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do," said Rob decidedly, "and as she has gone, you
must tell me at once where she went." The woman refused, and not
until after a somewhat stormy scene, and some rather severe threats
on Fessenden's part did she consent to tell that Cicely had gone to
the Grand Central Station. More than this she would not say, and
thinking he was wasting valuable time on her, Rob turned and,
racing down the stairs, for there was no elevator, he jumped in his
cab and whizzed away to the station.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI<br>
A Successful Pursuit</h3>

<p>Before he entered the station he looked through the doorway, and
to his delight saw the girl for whom he was looking.</p>

<p>He did not rush madly into the station, but paused a moment, and
then walked in quietly, thinking that if his quest should be
successful he must not frighten the excitable girl.</p>

<p>Cicely sat on one of the benches in the waiting-room. In her
dainty travelling costume of black, and her small hat with its
black veil, she looked so fair and young that Rob felt sudden
misgivings as to his errand. But it must be done, and, quietly
advancing, he took a seat beside her.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Miss Dupuy?" he asked in a voice which was
kinder and more gentle than he himself realized.</p>

<p>She looked up with a start, and said in a low voice, "Why do you
follow me? May I not be left alone to go where I choose?"</p>

<p>"You may, Miss Dupuy, if you will tell me where you are going,
and give me your word of honor that you will return if sent
for."</p>

<p>"To be put through an examination! No, thank you. I'm going away
where I hope I shall never see a detective or a coroner again!"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of them, Miss Dupuy?"</p>

<p>The girl gave him a strange glance; but it showed anxiety rather
than fear. However, her only reply was a low spoken "Yes."</p>

<p>"And why are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I may tell things that I don't want to tell." The
girl spoke abstractedly and seemed to be thinking aloud rather than
addressing her questioner.</p>

<p>It may be that Fessenden was influenced by her beauty or by the
exquisite femininity of her dainty contour and apparel, but aside
from all this he received a sudden impression that what this girl
said did not betoken guilt. He could not have explained it to
himself, but he was at the moment convinced that though she knew
more than she had yet told, Cicely Dupuy was herself innocent.</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy," he said very earnestly, "won't you look upon me as
a friend instead of a foe? I am quite sure you can tell me more
than you have told about the Van Norman tragedy. Am I wrong in
thinking you are keeping something back?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to tell," said Cicely, and the stubborn
expression returned to her eyes.</p>

<p>It did not seem a very appropriate place in which to carry on
such a personal conversation, but Fessenden thought perhaps the
very publicity of the scene might tend to make Miss Dupuy preserve
her equanimity better than in a private house. So he went on:</p>

<p>"Yes, you have several things to tell me, and I want you to tell
me now. The last time I talked to you about this matter I asked you
why you gave false evidence as to the time that Mr. Carleton
entered the Van Norman house that evening, and you responded by
fainting away. Now you must tell me why that question affected you
so seriously."</p>

<p>"It didn't. I was nervous and overwrought, and I chanced to
faint just then."</p>

<p>Fessenden saw that this explanation was untrue, but had been
thought up and held ready for this occasion. He saw, too, that the
girl held herself well in hand, so he dared to be more definite in
his inquiries.</p>

<p>"Do you know. Miss Dupuy, that you are seriously incriminating
yourself when you give false evidence?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," was the answer, not flippantly given, but with
an earnestness of which the speaker herself seemed unaware.</p>

<p>And Fessenden was a good enough reader of character to perceive
that she spoke truthfully.</p>

<p>The only construction he could put upon this was that, as he
couldn't help believing, the girl was innocent and therefore feared
no incriminating evidence against her.</p>

<p>But in that case what was she afraid of, and why was she running
away?</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy," he began, starting on a new tack, "please show
more confidence in me. Will you answer me more straightforwardly if
I assure you of my belief in your own innocence? I will not conceal
from you the fact that not every one is so convinced of that as I
am, and so I look to you for help to establish it.</p>

<p>"Establish what? My innocence?" said Cicely, and now she looked
bewildered, rather than afraid. "Does anybody think that I killed
Miss Van Norman?"</p>

<p>"Without going so far as to say any one thinks so, I will tell
you that they think there are indications that point to such a
thing."</p>

<p>"How absurd!" said Cicely, and the honesty of her tone seemed to
verify Fessenden's conviction that whatever guilty knowledge this
girl might possess, she herself was innocent of crime.</p>

<p>"If it is an absurd idea, then why not return to Mapleton and
answer any queries that may be put to you? You are innocent,
therefore you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>"I have a great deal to fear."</p>

<p>The girl spoke gently, even sadly, now. She seemed full of
anxiety and sorrow, that yet showed no trace of apprehension for
herself.</p>

<p>All at once a light broke upon Fessenden. She was shielding
somebody. Nor was it hard to guess who it might be!</p>

<p>"Miss Dupuy," began Rob again, eagerly this time, "I have
succeeded in establishing, practically, Mr. Carleton's innocence.
May I not likewise establish your own?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carleton's innocence!" repeated the girl, clasping her
hands. "Oh, is that true? Then who did do it?"</p>

<p>"We don't know yet," went on Rob, hastening to make the most of
the advantage he had gained; "but having assured you that it was
not Schuyler Carleton, will you not tell me what it is you have
been keeping secret?"</p>

<p>"How do you know Mr. Carleton is innocent? Have you proved it?
Has some one else confessed?"</p>

<p>"No, no one has confessed. And, indeed, I may as well own up
that no one is quite so sure of Mr. Carleton's innocence as I am
myself. But I am sure of it, and I'm going to prove it. Now, will
you not help me to do so?"</p>

<p>"How can I help you?"</p>

<p>"By explaining that discrepancy in time, so far as you can. You
testified that Mr. Carleton entered the house at half-past eleven,
and Mr. Hunt said he came in at quarter-past. What made you tell
that falsehood, and stick to it?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing," exclaimed Cicely, "except that I thought I saw
Mr. Carleton come into the house some little time before he cried
out for help. I was looking over the baluster when Mr. Hunt said he
saw me, and I, too, thought it was Mr. Carleton who came in
then."</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Carleton, but he has satisfactorily explained why he
came in, and what he was doing until the time when he called out
for help. Why did you not tell us about this at first?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid&mdash;afraid they might connect Mr. Carleton with
the murder, and I was afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were afraid that he really had done the deed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cicely in a very low voice, but with an intonation
that left no doubt of her truthfulness.</p>

<p>"Then," said Rob in his kindest way, "you may set your mind at
rest. Mr. Carleton is no longer under actual suspicion, and you may
go away, as you intended, for a few days' rest. I should be glad to
have your address, though I trust it will not be necessary for me
to send for you; and I know you will not be called to witness
against Schuyler Carleton."</p>

<p>Cicely gave the required address, and though they continued the
conversation for a short time, Rob concluded that the girl knew
nothing that actually bore on the case. Her own false evidence and
nervous apprehension had all been because of her anxiety about Mr.
Carleton, and her fear that he had really been the murderer. Her
written paper, and all the evidences of her jealousy of Miss Van
Norman, were the result of her secret and unrequited love for the
man, and her attempted flight was only because she feared that her
uncontrollable emotion and impulsive utterances might help to
incriminate him.</p>

<p>Fessenden was truly sorry for her, and glad that she could go
away from the trying scenes for a time. He felt sure that she would
come, if summoned, for now, relieved of her doubt of Carleton, she
had no reason for refusing any testimony she could give.</p>

<p>It was in a kindly spirit that he bade her good-by, and promised
to use every effort not only to establish Carleton's innocence, but
to discover the guilty one.</p>

<p>When Fessenden returned to the Van Norman house, several people
were awaiting him in the library. Miss Morton and Kitty French were
there, also Coroner Benson and Detective Fairbanks.</p>

<p>"Were you too late?" asked Kitty, as Rob entered the room.</p>

<p>"No, not too late. I found Miss Dupuy in the Grand Central
station, and I had a talk with her."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Kitty impatiently.</p>

<p>"She is as innocent as you or I."</p>

<p>"How did you find it out so quickly?" inquired Mr. Fairbanks,
who had a real liking for the enthusiastic young fellow.</p>

<p>"Why, I found out that she was hanging over the baluster, as
Hunt said; and she did see Carleton come in at quarter after
eleven. She then went back to her room, and heard Carleton cry out
at half-past eleven, and when she discovered what had happened she
suspected Carleton of the deed; and, endeavoring to shield him, she
refused to give evidence that might incriminate him."</p>

<p>"But," cried Kitty, "of course Mr. Carleton didn't do it if
Cicely did."</p>

<p>"But don't you see, Miss French," said the older detective, as
Fessenden sat staring in blank surprise at what he deemed Kitty's
stupidity&mdash;"don't you see that if Miss Dupuy suspected Mr.
Carleton she couldn't by any possibility be guilty herself."</p>

<p>"Why, of course she couldn't!" exclaimed Kitty. "And I'm truly
glad, for I can't help liking that girl, if she is queer. But,
then, who did do it?" Suspicion was again at a standstill. There
was no evidence to point anywhere; there were no clues to follow,
and no one had any suggestion to offer.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Tom Willard and Schuyler Carleton
came in together.</p>

<p>They were told of Fessenden's interview with Miss Dupuy at the
station, and Carleton expressed himself as thoroughly glad that the
girl was exonerated. He said little, however, for it was a delicate
subject, since it all hinged on Miss Dupuy's affection for
himself.</p>

<p>Tom Willard listened to Fessenden's recital, but he only said
that nothing would ever have induced him to suspect Miss Dupuy, any
way, for it could not have been the deed of a fragile young
girl.</p>

<p>"The blow that killed Maddy was powerfully dealt," said Tom;
"and I can't help thinking it was some tramp or professional
burglar who was clever enough to elude Harris's fastenings. Or some
window may have been overlooked that night. At any rate, we have no
more plausible theory."</p>

<p>"We have not," said Mr. Fairbanks; "but I for one am not content
to let the matter rest here. I should like to suggest that we call
in some celebrated detective, whose experience and skill would
discover what is beyond the powers of Mr. Fessenden and
myself."</p>

<p>Rob felt flattered that Mr. Fairbanks classed him with himself,
and felt anxious too that the suggestion of employing a more
skilful detective should be carried out.</p>

<p>"But," objected Coroner Benson, "to engage a detective of high
standing would entail considerable expense, and I'm not sure that
I'm authorized to sanction this."</p>

<p>There was a silence, but nearly every one in the room was
thinking that surely this was the time for Tom Willard to make use
of his lately inherited Van Norman money.</p>

<p>Nor was Willard delinquent. Though showing no overwillingness in
the matter, he said plainly that he would be glad if Coroner Benson
or Mr. Fairbanks would engage the services of the best detective
they could find, and allow him to defray all expenses attendant
thereon.</p>

<p>At this a murmur of approval went round the room. All his
hearers were at their wits' end what to do next, and the
opportunity of putting a really great detective on the case was
welcome indeed.</p>

<p>"But I don't believe," said Willard, "that he will find out
anything more than our own men have discovered." The appreciative
glance Tom gave Mr. Fairbanks and Rob quite soothed whatever touch
of jealousy they may have felt of the new detective.</p>

<p>It was Carleton who suggested Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>He did not know the man personally, but he had read and heard of
the wonderful work he had done in celebrated cases all over the
country.</p>

<p>Of course they had all heard of Fleming Stone, and each felt a
thrill of gratitude to Willard, whose wealth made it possible to
employ the great detective.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks wasted no time, but wrote at once to Fleming
Stone, and received a reply stating that he would arrive in
Mapleton in a few days.</p>

<p>But in the meantime Rob Fessenden could not be idle.</p>

<p>In truth, he had a secret ambition to solve the mystery himself,
before the great detective came, and to this end he stayed on in
Mapleton, and racked his brain for ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks was more easily discouraged, and frankly confessed
the case was beyond his powers.</p>

<p>Privately, he still suspected Mr. Carleton, but in the face of
Rob's faith in his friend, and also because of the demeanor of
Carleton himself, he couldn't avow his suspicions.</p>

<p>For since Fessenden's assertions of confidence, Carleton had
changed in his attitude toward the world at large.</p>

<p>Still broken and saddened by the tragedy, he did not show that
abject and self-condemnatory air which had hung round him during
the inquest week.</p>

<p>Kitty French had almost recovered faith in him, and had there
been any one else at all to suspect, she would have asserted her
belief in his innocence.</p>

<p>Carleton himself seemed baffled. His suspicions had been
directed toward Cicely, because he could see no other possibility;
but the proof of her suspicions of himself, of course, showed he
was wrong in the matter.</p>

<p>He could suggest nothing; he could think of nobody who might
have done the deed, and he was thoroughly content to place the
whole affair unreservedly in the hands of Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>Indeed, every one seemed to be glad of the expected help, if we
except Fessenden. He was restlessly eager to do something himself,
and saw no reason why he shouldn't keep on trying until Stone
came.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br>
A Talk With Miss Morton</h3>

<p>Of course Fessenden confided his wishes to Kitty French. Equally
of course, that obliging young woman was desirous of helping him
attain them. But neither of them could think of new lines of
investigation to pursue.</p>

<p>"We've no clue but that little cachou," said Miss French, by way
of summing up; "and as that's no good at all, we have really
nothing that can be called a clue."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Rob, "and we have no suspect. Now that Carleton and
Miss Dupuy are both out of it, I don't see who could have done
it."</p>

<p>"I never felt fully satisfied about Miss Morton and her burned
paper," said Kitty thoughtfully.</p>

<p>They were walking along a village road while carrying on this
conversation, so there was no danger of Miss Morton's overhearing
them.</p>

<p>"I've never felt satisfied about that woman, any way," said Rob.
"The oftener I see her the less I like her. She's too smug and
complacent. And yet when she was questioned, she went all to
pieces."</p>

<p>"Well, as she flatly contradicted what Marie had said, of course
they couldn't keep on questioning her. You can't take a servant's
word against a lady's."</p>

<p>"You ought to, in a serious case like this. I say, Kitty, let's
go there now and have a heart-to-heart talk with her."</p>

<p>Kitty laughed at the idea of a heart-to-heart talk between those
two people, but said she was willing to go.</p>

<p>"It mayn't amount to anything," went on Rob, "and yet, it may.
I've asked Mr. Fairbanks to chase up that burned paper matter, but
he said there was nothing in it. He didn't hear Marie's story, you
see,&mdash;he only heard it retold, and he doesn't know how sincere
that girl seemed to be when she told about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I saw Miss Morton in Maddy's room, too. I think she
ought to tell what she was up to." So to the Van Norman house went
the two inquisitors, and had Miss Morton known of their fell
designs she might not have greeted them as cordially as she
did.</p>

<p>Miss Morton had grown fond of Kitty French during the girl's
stay with her, and she looked with approval on the fast-growing
friendship between her and young Fessenden.</p>

<p>As the hostess at the Van Norman house, too, Miss Morton showed
a kindly hospitality, and though she was without doubt eccentric,
and sometimes curt of speech, she conducted the household and
directed the servants with very little friction or awkwardness.</p>

<p>She was most friendly toward Tom Willard and Schuyler Carleton,
and the latter often dropped in at the tea hour. Fessenden dropped
in at any hour of the day, and of course Mr. Fairbanks came and
went as he chose.</p>

<p>Fessenden and Kitty found Miss Morton in the library, and, as
they had decided beforehand, went straight to the root of the
matter.</p>

<p>"Miss Morton," Fessenden began, "I want to do a little more
questioning on my own account, before Mr. Fleming Stone arrives.
I'm sure you won't object to helping me out a bit by answering a
few queries."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Miss Morton grimly, but not unkindly.</p>

<p>"They are a bit personal," went on Rob, who was at a loss how to
begin, now that he was really told to do so.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>This time, Miss Morton's tone was more crisp, and Kitty began to
see that Rob was on the wrong tack. So she took the helm herself,
and said, with a winning smile:</p>

<p>"We want you to tell us frankly what was the paper you
burned."</p>

<p>Something in Miss Morton's expression went to the girl's heart,
and she added impulsively:</p>

<p>"I know it wasn't anything that affects the case at all, and if
you want to refuse us, you may."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not tell you," said Miss Morton, and a far-away look
came into her strange eyes; "but since you have shown confidence in
me, I prefer to return it."</p>

<p>She took Kitty's hand in hers, and from the gentle touch the
girl was sure that whatever was the nature of the coming
confidence, it was not that of a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>"As you know, Kitty," she began, addressing the girl, though she
glanced at Rob occasionally, "many years ago I was betrothed to
Richard Van Norman. We foolishly allowed a trifling quarrel to
separate us for life. I will not tell you the story of that
now,&mdash;though I will, some time, if you care to hear it. But we
were both quick-tempered, and the letters that passed between us at
that time were full of hot, angry, unconsidered words. They were
letters such as no human beings ought to have written to each
other. Perhaps it was because of their exceeding bitterness, which
we read and reread, that we never made up that quarrel, though
neither of us ever loved any one else, or ceased to love the other.
At the death of Richard Van Norman, two years or more ago, I burned
his letters which I had kept so long, and I wrote to Madeleine,
asking her to return mine to me if they should be found among her
uncle's papers."</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Morton," said Kitty, "don't tell any more if it pains
you. We withdraw our request, don't we, Rob?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Fessenden heartily; "forgive us, Miss
Morton, for what is really an intrusion, and an unwarrantable
one."</p>

<p>"I want to tell you a little more," Miss Morton resumed, "and
afterward I'll tell you why I've told it. Madeleine replied with a
most kind letter, saying she had not found the letters, but should
she ever do so, she would send them to me. About a year ago, she
wrote and asked me to come here to see her. I came, thinking she
had found those letters. She had not, but she had found her uncle's
diary, which disclosed his feelings toward me, both before and
after our quarrel, and she told me then she intended to leave this
place to me in her will, because she thought it ought to be mine.
Truth to tell, I didn't take much interest in this bequest, for I
supposed the girl would long outlive me. But I had really no desire
for the house without its master, and though I didn't tell her so,
I would rather have had the letters which I hoped she had found,
than the news of her bequest."</p>

<p>"Why did you want the letters so much, Miss Morton?" asked
Kitty.</p>

<p>"Because, my dear, they were a disgrace to me. They would be a
disgrace to any woman alive. You, my child, with your gentle
disposition, can't understand what dreadful cruelty an angry woman
can be guilty of on paper. Well, again Madeleine told me she would
give me the letters if they ever appeared, and I went home. I
didn't hear from her again till shortly before her wedding, when
she wrote me that the letters had been found in a secret drawer of
Richard's old desk. She invited me to come to her wedding, and said
that she would then give me the letters. Of course I came, and that
afternoon that I arrived she told me they were in her desk, and she
would give them to me next morning. I was more than impatient for
them,&mdash;I had waited forty years for them,&mdash;but I couldn't
trouble her on her wedding eve. And then&mdash;when&mdash;when she
went away from us, without having given them into my possession, I
was so afraid they would fall into other hands, that I went in
search of them. I found them in her desk, I took them to my room
and burned them without reading them. And that is the true story of
the burned papers. I did look over a memorandum book, thinking it
might tell where they were. But right after that I found the
letters themselves in the next compartment, and I took them. They
were mine."</p>

<p>The dignified complacency with which Miss Morton uttered that
last short sentence commanded the respect of her hearers.</p>

<p>"Indeed, they were yours, Miss Morton," said Fessenden, "and I'm
glad you secured them, before other eyes saw them."</p>

<p>Kitty said nothing, but held Miss Morton's hand in a firm,
gentle pressure that seemed to seal their friendship.</p>

<p>"But," said Fessenden, a little diffidently, "why didn't you
tell all this at the inquest as frankly as you have told us?"</p>

<p>Miss Morton paled, and then grew red.</p>

<p>"I am an idiot about such things," she said. "When questioned
publicly, like that, I am so embarrassed and also so fearful that I
scarcely know what I say. I try to hide this by a curt manner and a
bravado of speech, with the result that I get desperate and say
anything that comes into my head, whether it's the truth or not. I
not only told untruths, but I contradicted myself, when witnessing,
but I couldn't seem to help it. I lost control of my reasoning
powers, and finally I felt my only safety was in denying it all.
For&mdash;and this was my greatest fear&mdash;I thought they might
suspect that I killed Madeleine, if they knew I did burn the
papers. Afterward, I would have confessed that I had testified
wrongly, but I couldn't see how it would do any good."</p>

<p>"No," said Rob slowly, "except to exonerate Marie of
falsehood."</p>

<p>Miss Morton set her lips together tightly, and seemed unwilling
to pursue that subject.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, "the reason I've told you two young people
this, is because I want to warn you not to let a quarrel or a
foolish misunderstanding of any sort come between you to spoil the
happiness that I see is in store for you."</p>

<p>"Good for you! Miss Morton!" cried Rob. "You're a brick! You've
precipitated matters a little; Kitty and I haven't put it into
words as yet, but&mdash;we accept these preliminary
congratulations,&mdash; don't we, dear?"</p>

<p>And foolish little Kitty only smiled, and buried her face on
Miss Morton's shoulder instead of the young man's!</p>

<p>And so, Miss Morton's name was erased from Rob's list of people
to be inquired of, and, as he acknowledged to himself, he was quite
ready now to turn over his share in the case to Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>And, too, since Miss Morton had given a gentle push to the
rolling stone of his affair with Kitty, it rolled faster, and the
two young people had their heart-to-heart talks with each other,
instead of adding a third to the interview.</p>

<p>But there was just one more unfinished duty that Fessenden
determined to attend to. Carleton had assured him that he was at
liberty to talk to Dorothy Burt, if he chose, and Rob couldn't help
thinking that he ought to get all possible light on the case before
Mr. Stone came; for he proposed to assist that gentleman greatly by
his carefully tabulated statements, and his cross-referenced
columns of evidence.</p>

<p>So, unaccompanied by Kitty, who was apt to prove a disturbing
influence on his concentration of mind, he interviewed Miss
Burt.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to get an opportunity, as she rarely left
the house, and Mrs. Carleton was not exigent in her demands on her
companion's time.</p>

<p>So the two strolled in the rose-garden late one afternoon, and
Rob asked Miss Burt to tell him why she hesitated so when on the
witness stand, and why she looked at Carleton with such
unmistakable glances of inquiry, which he as certainly
answered.</p>

<p>Dorothy Burt replied to the questions as frankly as they were
put.</p>

<p>"To explain it to you, Mr. Fessenden," she said, "I must first
tell you that I loved Mr. Carleton even while Miss Van Norman was
his affianced bride. I tell you this simply, both because it is the
simple truth and because Mr. Carleton advised me to tell you, if
you should ask me. And, knowing this, you may be surprised to learn
that when I heard of Miss Van Norman's death, I&mdash;" she raised
her wonderful eyes and looked straight at Rob&mdash;"I thought she
died by Schuyler's hand. Yes, you may well look at me in
surprise,&mdash;I know it was dreadful of me to think he could have
done it, but&mdash;I did think so. You see, I loved him,&mdash;and
I knew he loved me. He had never told me so, had never breathed a
word that was disloyal to Miss Van Norman,&mdash;and yet I knew.
And that last evening in this very rose-garden, on the night before
his wedding, we walked here together, and I knew from what he
didn't say, not from what he did say, that it was I whom he loved,
and not she. He left me with a few cold, curt words that I knew
only too well masked his real feelings, and I saw him no more that
night. He had told me he was going over to Miss Van Norman's, and
so, when I heard of the&mdash;the tragedy&mdash;I couldn't help
thinking he had yielded to a sudden terrible impulse. Oh, I'm not
defending myself for my wrong thought of him; I'm only confessing
that I did think that."</p>

<p>"And how did you learn that you were mistaken," said Rob gently,
"and that Schuyler didn't do it?"</p>

<p>"Why, the very next night he told me he loved me," said the
girl, her face alight with a tender glory, "and then I knew!"</p>

<p>"And your embarrassment at the questions on the witness
stand?"</p>

<p>"Was only because I knew suspicion was directed toward him, and
I feared I might say something to strengthen it, even while trying
to do the opposite."</p>

<p>"And you didn't care whether you told the truth or not?"</p>

<p>"If the truth would help to incriminate Schuyler, I would prefer
not to tell it."</p>

<p>The gentle sadness in Dorothy's tone robbed this speech of the
jarring note it would otherwise have held.</p>

<p>"You are right, Miss Burt," said Rob, "and I thank you for the
frank confidence you have shown in talking to me as freely as you
have done."</p>

<p>"Schuyler told me to," said the girl simply.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br>
Fleming Stone</h3>

<p>When Fessenden told Kitty of his interview with Dorothy Burt,
she agreed that he had now followed every trail that had presented
itself, or had been suggested by anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks, too, admitted that he was at his wits' end, and
saw no hope of a solution of the mystery except through the
services of Fleming Stone. And so when the great detective arrived,
both Fairbanks and Fessenden were ready to do anything they could
to help him, but had no suggestions to make.</p>

<p>With her ever-ready hospitality, Miss Morton invited Mr. Stone
to make his home at the Van Norman house, and, as this quite
coincided with his own wishes, Stone took up his quarters
there.</p>

<p>The first evening of his arrival he listened to the details of
the case.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone was of a most attractive personality. He was
nearly fifty years old, with graying hair and a kindly, responsive
face.</p>

<p>At dinner he had won the admiration of all by his tact and
interesting conversation. At the table the business upon which he
had come had not been mentioned, but now the group assembled in the
library felt that the time had come to talk of the matter.</p>

<p>It was a strangely-assorted household. Tom Willard, though the
only relative of the Van Normans present, was in no way the head of
the house. That position was held by Miss Morton, who, though
kind-hearted and hospitable, never let it be forgotten that she was
owner and mistress of the mansion.</p>

<p>Kitty French was an honored guest, and as Miss Morton had
invited her to stay as long as she would, she had determined now to
stay through Mr. Stone's sojourn there, after which, whatever the
results of his work, she would go back to her home in New York.</p>

<p>Fessenden and Schuyler Carleton had been with them at dinner,
and Mr. Benson and Mr. Fairbanks had come later, and now the group
waited only on Mr. Stone's pleasure to begin the recital of the
case.</p>

<p>When Fleming Stone, then, asked Coroner Benson to give him the
main facts, it seemed as if the great detective's work was really
about to begin.</p>

<p>"Would you rather see Mr. Benson alone?" asked Schuyler
Carleton, actuated, doubtless, by his own shrinking from any
publicity.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Stone briefly. "I prefer that you all should
feel free to speak whenever you wish."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Benson set forth in a concise way and in chronological
order the facts as far as they were known, the suspicions that had
been entertained and given up; and deplored the entire lack of clue
or evidence that might lead to investigation in any definite
direction.</p>

<p>The others, as Mr. Stone had suggested, made remarks when they
chose, and the whole conversation was of an informal and colloquial
nature. It seemed dominated by Fleming Stone's mind. He drew
opinions from one or another, until before they realized it every
one present had taken part in the recital. And to each Fleming
Stone listened with deference and courtesy. The coroner's legal
phrases, Fessenden's impetuous suggestions, Tom's blunt remarks,
Carleton's half-timid utterances, Kitty's volatile sallies, and
even Miss Morton's futile observations, all were listened to and
responded to by Fleming Stone with an air of deep interest and
consideration.</p>

<p>As the hour grew late Mr. Stone said that he felt thoroughly
acquainted with the facts of the case so far as they could be told
to him. He said he could express no opinion nor offer any
suggestion that night, but that he hoped to come to some
conclusions on the following day; and if they would all meet him in
the same place the next evening, he would willingly disclose
whatever he might have learned or discovered in the meantime. This
put an end to the conversation, and Mr. Benson and Mr. Fairbanks
went home. The ladies went to their rooms, and Carleton, Fessenden
and Willard sat up for an hour's smoke with Fleming Stone, who
entertained them with talk on subjects far removed from murder or
sudden death.</p>

<p>The next morning Fleming Stone expressed a desire to be shown
all the rooms in the house.</p>

<p>"In a case like this," he said, "with no definite dues to
follow, the only thing to do is to examine the premises in hope of
happening upon something suggestive."</p>

<p>Kitty was eager to be Mr. Stone's guide, and easily obtained
Miss Morton's permission to go into all the rooms of the old
mansion.</p>

<p>Fessenden went with them, and though the tour of the
sleeping-rooms was quickly made, it was evident that the quick eye
of the detective took in every detail that was visible. He stayed
longer in Madeleine's sitting-room, but, though he picked up a few
papers from her desk and glanced at them, he showed no special
interest in the room.</p>

<p>Downstairs they went then, and found Mr. Fairbanks in the
library, awaiting them. He brought no news or fresh evidence, and
had merely called in hope of seeing Mr. Stone.</p>

<p>The great detective was most frank and kindly toward his lesser
colleague, and made him welcome with a genial courtesy.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make a thorough examination of these lower rooms,"
said Fleming Stone, "and I should be glad of the assistance of you
two younger men. My eyes are not what they once were."</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks and Rob well knew that this statement was merely
an idle compliment to themselves; for the eyes of Fleming Stone had
never yet missed a clue, however obscurely hidden.</p>

<p>But Kitty, ignorant of the principles of professional etiquette,
really thought that Fleming Stone was depending on his two
companions for assistance.</p>

<p>Tom Willard had gone out, and Miss Morton was looking after her
all-important housekeeping, so the three men and Kitty French were
alone in the library.</p>

<p>In his quick, quiet way Fleming Stone went rapidly round the
room. He examined the window fixtures and curtains, the mantel and
fireplace, the furniture and carpet, and came to a standstill by
the library table. The dagger, which was kept in a drawer of the
table, was shown to him, but though he examined it a moment, it
seemed to have little interest for him.</p>

<p>"There's not a clue in this room," he said almost indignantly.
"There probably were several the morning after the murder, but the
thorough sweepings and dustings since have obliterated every
trace."</p>

<p>Somewhat abruptly he went into the large hall. Here his
proceedings in the library were duplicated. "Nothing at all," he
said; "but what could be expected in a room which is a general
thoroughfare?"</p>

<p>Then he went into the drawing-room. The other three followed,
feeling rather depressed at the hopeless outlook, and a little
disappointed in the great detective.</p>

<p>Stone glanced around the large apartment.</p>

<p>"Swept, scrubbed, and polished," he declared, as he glanced with
disfavor at the immaculate room.</p>

<p>"And indeed it was quite necessary," said Miss Morton, who
entered just then. "After all those vines and flowers were taken
away, and as a good deal of the furniture was out, I took occasion
for a good bit of house-cleaning."</p>

<p>"Well," said Fleming Stone quietly, "there's one clue they
didn't sweep away. Here is where the assassin entered."</p>

<p>As he spoke Mr. Stone was leaning against the mantel and looking
down at the immaculately brushed hearth.</p>

<p>"Where?" cried Kitty, darting forward, and though the others
gave no voice to their curiosity, they waited breathlessly for
Stone's next utterance.</p>

<p>The hearth and the whole fireplace were tiled, and in the floor
tiling, under the andirons, was a rectangular iron plate with an
oval opening closed by an iron cover. This cover was hinged, and
could be raised and thrown back to permit ashes to be swept into
the chute. The iron plate was sunk flush with the hearth and
cemented into the brick-work, and the cover fitted into the rim so
closely that scarce a seam showed.</p>

<p>"He came up through this hole in the fireplace," said Stone,
almost as if talking to himself, "very soon after Miss Dupuy went
upstairs at half-past ten. Before Mr. Carleton arrived at quarter
after eleven, the murderer had finished his work, and had departed
by this same means."</p>

<p>While the others stood seemingly struck dumb by this revelation,
Kitty excitedly flew to the fireplace and tried to raise the iron
lid, but the andirons were in the way. Rob set them aside for her,
while Stone said quietly, "Those andirons were probably not there
that night?"</p>

<p>"No," exclaimed Kitty; "they had been taken away, because we
expected to fill the fireplace with flowers the next day."</p>

<p>"But how could anybody get in the cellar?" asked Miss Morton,
looking bewildered.</p>

<p>"The cellar is never carefully locked," said Fleming Stone. "I
came downstairs early this morning, and before breakfast Harris had
shown me all through the cellar. He admits that several windows are
always left open for the sake of ventilation, and claims that the
carefully locked door in the hall at the head of the cellar stairs
precludes all danger from that direction."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," said Mr. Fairbanks perplexedly. "If
that opening is an ash-chute, such as I have in my own house, it is
all bricked up down below, with the exception of a small opening
for the removal of the ashes, and it would be quite impossible for
any one to climb up through it."</p>

<p>"But this one isn't bricked up," said Fleming Stone. "It was
originally intended to be enclosed; but it seems this fireplace is
rarely used. Harris tells me that the late Mr. Van Norman used to
talk about having the chute completed, and having a fire here more
often. But the library wood fire was more attractive as a family
gathering place, and this formal room was used only on state
occasions. However, as you see," and Mr. Stone raised the iron lid
again, "this opens directly into the cellar, and, I repeat, formed
the means of entrance for the murderer of Madeleine Van
Norman."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone's voice and manner were far from triumphant or
jubilant at his discovery. He seemed rather to state the fact with
regret, but as if it must be told.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks looked amazed and thoughtful, but Rob Fessenden
was frankly incredulous.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stone," he said respectfully, "I am sure you know what
you're talking about, but will you tell me how a man could get up
through that hole? It doesn't seem to me that a small-sized boy
could squeeze through."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone took a silver-cased tape-measure from his pocket,
and handed it to Rob without a word.</p>

<p>Eagerly stooping on the hearth, Rob measured the oval opening in
the iron plate. Although the rectangular plate was several inches
larger each way, the oval opening measured exactly nine and
one-half inches by thirteen and one-half inches.</p>

<p>"Who could get through that?" he inquired, as he announced the
figures. "I'm sure I couldn't."</p>

<p>"And Schuyler Carleton is a larger man than you are," observed
Mr. Fairbanks.</p>

<p>"That lets Tom Willard out, too," said Rob, with a slight smile;
"for he's nearly six feet tall, and weighs more than two hundred
pounds."</p>

<p>"The only man I know of," said Mr. Fairbanks thoughtfully, "who
could come up through that hole is Slim Jim."</p>

<p>"Who is Slim Jim?" cried Rob quickly. "Go for him; he is the
man!"</p>

<p>"Not so fast," said Mr. Fairbanks. "Slim Jim is a noted burglar
and a suspected murderer, but he is safely in prison at present and
has been for some months."</p>

<p>"But he may have escaped," exclaimed Rob. "Are you sure he
hasn't?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything about him of late; but if he is or has
been away from the prison, it can be easily found out."</p>

<p>"Isn't it unlikely," said Fleming Stone quietly, "that a noted
burglar should enter a house and commit murder, without making any
attempt to steal?"</p>

<p>"He may have been frightened away by the sound of Schuyler's
latch-key," suggested Rob, and Kitty looked at him with pride in
his ingenuity, and thought how much cleverer he was, after all,
than the celebrated Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>Fessenden urged Mr. Fairbanks to go at once and look up the
whereabouts of Slim Jim, and the detective was strongly inclined to
go.</p>

<p>"Go, by all means, if you choose," said Fleming Stone
pleasantly. "There's really nothing further to do here in the way
of examination of the premises. I do not mind saying that my own
suspicions are not directed toward Slim Jim, but my own suspicions
are by no means an infallible guide. I will ask you, though,
gentlemen, not to say anything about this ash-chute matter to-day.
I consider it is my right to request this. Of course you can find
out all about Slim Jim without stating how he entered the
house."</p>

<p>The two men promised not to say anything about the ash-chute to
anybody, and hot upon the trail of the suspected burglar they went
away.</p>

<p>Miss Morton excused herself, and upon Kitty French fell the
burden of entertaining Mr. Stone. Nor was this young woman dismayed
at the task.</p>

<p>Though not loquacious, the detective was an easy and pleasant
talker, and he seemed quite ready to converse with the girl as if
he had no other occupation on hand.</p>

<p>"How wonderful you are!" said Kitty, clasping her hands beneath
her chin as she looked at the great man. "To think of your spotting
that fireplace thing right away! Though of course I never should
have thought of anybody squeezing up through there. And Rob and I
spent a whole morning searching these rooms for clues, and that was
only the day after it happened."</p>

<p>"What an opportunity!" Stone seemed interested. "And didn't you
find anything&mdash;not anything?"</p>

<p>"No, not a thing. We were so disappointed. Oh, yes, Rob did find
one little thing, but it was so little and so silly that I guess he
forgot all about it."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I've almost forgotten the name. Oh, yes, Rob said it was a
cachou&mdash;a little silver thing, you know, like a tiny pill. Rob
says some men eat them after they've been smoking. But he asked all
the men that ever came here, and they all said they didn't use
them. Maybe the burglar dropped it."</p>

<p>"Maybe he did. Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Rob found it. It was right in that corner by the mantel, just
near the fireplace."</p>

<p>Fleming Stone stood up. "Miss French," said he, "if it is any
satisfaction to you, you may know that you have helped me a great
deal in my work. Will you excuse me now, as I find I have important
business elsewhere?"</p>

<p>Kitty smiled and bowed politely, but after Mr. Stone had left
her she wondered what she could have said or done that helped him;
and she wondered, too, what had caused that unspeakably sad look in
his eyes as he went away.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br>
A Confession</h3>

<p>Mr. Taylor, the landlord of the Mapleton Inn, showed a pleased
surprise when Fleming Stone walked into his hotel and approached
the desk. The men had never met, but everybody in Mapleton knew
that Fleming Stone was in town, and had heard repeated and accurate
descriptions of his appearance.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can spare half an hour for a smoke and a chat,"
said Stone affably, and though Mr. Taylor heartily agreed, he did
not confess that he could easily have spared half a day or more had
the great detective asked him.</p>

<p>In the landlord's private office they sat down for a smoke, and
soon the conversation, without effort, drifted around to the Van
Norman affair.</p>

<p>Unlike detectives of fiction, Fleming Stone was by no means
secretive or close-mouthed. Indeed he was discursive, and Mr.
Taylor marvelled that such a great man should indulge in such
trivial gossip. They talked of old Richard Van Norman and the
earlier days of the Van Norman family.</p>

<p>"You've lived here a long time, then?" inquired Mr. Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Boy and man, I've lived here nigh onto sixty
years."</p>

<p>"But this fine modern hotel of yours is not as old as that?"</p>

<p>The landlord's face glowed with pride. "Right you are, sir. Some
few years ago wife had some money left her, and we built the old
place over&mdash; pretty near made a whole new house of it."</p>

<p>"You have many guests?"</p>

<p>"Well, not as many as I'd like; but as many as I can expect in a
little town like this. Mostly transients, of course; drummers and
men of that sort. Young Willard stayed here, when the Van Norman
house was full of company, but after the&mdash;the trouble, he went
back there to stay."</p>

<p>"Affable sort of man, Willard, isn't he?" observed Stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's all of that, but he's a scapegrace. He used to lead
this town a dance when he lived here."</p>

<p>"How long since he lived here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's only been away a matter of three years, or that. 'Bout
a year before his uncle died they quarrelled. They both had the
devil's own temper, and they had quarrelled before, but this time
it was for keeps; and so off goes Mr. Tom, and never turns up again
until he comes to Miss Madeleine's wedding."</p>

<p>"Was he in any business when he lived here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had a good position as engineer in a big factory. He
was a good worker, Tom was, and not afraid of anything. Always
jolly and good-natured, except when he'd have one of them fearful
fits of temper. Then he was like a raging lion&mdash;no, more like
a tiger; quiet-like, but deep and desperate."</p>

<p>Soon after Fleming Stone rose to go. "Thank you very much," he
said politely, "for your half-hour. And, by the way, have you any
cachous? I find I haven't any with me, and after smoking, you know,
before going back to the ladies."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know; but I don't happen to have any. But wait a
minute, I believe Tripp has some." He threw open the door and gave
a quick whistle.</p>

<p>A boy appeared so suddenly that he could not have been far away,
and, moreover, his sharp black eyes and alert manner betokened the
type of boy who would be apt to be listening about.</p>

<p>His hand was already in his pocket when Mr. Taylor said to him,
"Tripp, didn't I see you have a small bottle of
cachous?&mdash;those little silver pellets, you know."</p>

<p>"Yessir;" and Tripp drew forth a half-filled bottle.</p>

<p>"That's right. Give them to the gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only want a couple," said Fleming Stone, taking the vial
which Tripp thrust toward him. "Where did you get these, my
boy?"</p>

<p>The boy blushed and looked down, twisting his fingers in
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Speak up, Tripp," said the landlord sternly. "Answer the
gentleman, and see that you tell the truth."</p>

<p>"I ain't going to tell no lie," said Tripp doggedly. "I found
this here bottle in the bureau-drawer of number fourteen a few days
ago."</p>

<p>"Fourteen? That's the room Mr. Willard had," said Mr. Taylor,
reflectively.</p>

<p>"Yessir, but he didn't leave them there. They were there before.
I seen 'em, and I knew that hatchet-faced hardware man left 'em;
then Mr. Willard, he come, but he didn't swipe 'em, so I did. That
ain't no harm, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Fleming Stone, "since you've told the truth
about it, and here's a dollar for your honesty. And I'm going to
ask you not to say anything more about the matter, for a few days
at least. Also I'm going to ask to be allowed to take a look at
room number fourteen."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Tripp, show the gentleman up;" and Mr. Taylor
fairly rubbed his hands with satisfaction to think that he and his
premises were being made use of by the great detective.</p>

<p>"Yessir. It's at the back of the house, sir. This way, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Stone's survey of the room was exceedingly brief. He gave
one glance around, looked out of the only window it contained,
tried the key in the lock, and then expressed himself
satisfied.</p>

<p>Tripp, disappointed at the quickly-finished performance,
elaborately pointed out the exact spot where he had found the
cachou bottle, but Mr. Stone did not seem greatly interested.</p>

<p>However, the interview was financially successful to Tripp, and
after Mr. Stone's departure he turned several hand-springs by way
of expressing his satisfaction with the detective gentleman.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening the group of the night before
reassembled in the library.</p>

<p>A strange feeling of oppression seemed to hang over all. The
very fact that Fleming Stone had as yet said nothing of any
discoveries he might have made, and the continued courtesy of his
pleasant, affable demeanor, seemed to imply that he had succeeded
rather than failed in his mission.</p>

<p>Although genial and quickly responsive; he was, after all, an
inscrutable man; and Mr. Fairbanks, for one, had learned that his
gentle cordiality often hid deep thoughts in a quickly-working
mind.</p>

<p>Without preamble, as soon as they were seated Mr. Stone
began:</p>

<p>"Employed by Coroner Benson, I was asked to come here to
discover, if might be, the murderer of Miss Madeleine Van Norman.
By some unmistakable evidence which I have found, by some reliable
witnesses with whom I have talked, and by some proofs which I have
discovered, I have learned beyond all doubt who is the criminal,
and how the deed was done. Is it the wish of all present that I
should now make known what I have discovered, or is it preferred
that I should tell Coroner Benson alone?"</p>

<p>For several minutes nobody spoke, and then the coroner said,
"Unless any one present states an objection, you may proceed to
tell us what you know, here and now, Mr. Stone."</p>

<p>After waiting a moment longer and hearing no objection raised,
Fleming Stone proceeded.</p>

<p>"The man who murdered Miss Van Norman entered the house through
a cellar window. He climbed up through the ash-chute in the
drawing-room fireplace."</p>

<p>Although some of Mr. Sterne's hearers had listened to this
revelation in the morning, the others had not heard of it, and
every face expressed utter astonishment, if not unbelief&mdash;with
the exception of one. Tom Willard turned white and stared at
Fleming Stone as if he had not understood.</p>

<p>"What?" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>As if he had not heard the interruption, Fleming Stone went
on:</p>

<p>"Who that man was, I think I need not tell you. Is he not
already telling you himself?"</p>

<p>Willard's face grew drawn and stiff, like that of a paralyzed
man, but his burning eyes seemed unable to tear themselves away
from the quiet gaze of Fleming Stone. Then with a groan Willard's
head sank into his hands and he fell forward on the table&mdash;the
very table at which Madeleine had sat on that fatal night.</p>

<p>There was a stir, and Schuyler Carleton rushed forward to
Willard's assistance if need be. But the man had not fainted, and,
raising his white face, he squared his shoulders, clenched his
hands, and, again fixing his eyes on those of Fleming Stone, said
in a desperate voice, "Go on."</p>

<p>"I must go on," said Stone, gently. "I know each one of you is
thinking that it is absurd to imagine a man of Mr. Willard's weight
and girth climbing up through the seemingly small opening in the
fireplace. But this can be explained. To one who does not know how,
such a feat would seem impossible, and, moreover, it would be
impossible. It is only one who knows how who can do it. There are
men in certain occupations, such as engineers and boiler men, who
are continually obliged to squeeze through holes quite as small.
The regular boiler man-hole is oval, and measures ten by fifteen
inches, but there are many of them in large tanks which measure
even less each way. I had occasion some time ago to interview an
engineer on this subject. He weighed two hundred and fifteen
pounds, and had a chest measure of forty-two inches. He told me
that he could go through a much smaller man-hole than another
workman who weighed only one hundred and sixty pounds, simply
because he knew how. It is done by certain manipulations of the
great muscles and by following a certain routine of procedure. But
the method is unimportant, for the moment. The fact remains, and
can be verified by any engineer. I discovered to-day that Mr.
Willard is or has been an expert engineer, and for many years held
such a position in a large factory right here in Mapleton. As to
Mr. Willard's presence in this house upon that fatal night, a tiny
clue discovered by Mr. Fessenden gives us indubitable proof. Mr.
Fessenden found next morning on the drawing-room floor a cachou. I
have learned that these are by no means in common use in Mapleton,
and, moreover, that it is not the custom of any one of the men now
present to use them. I further learned that after Mr. Willard left
here that night to go to the hotel he found by chance a small
bottle of these in the room which was assigned to him. I am
assuming that he carelessly put a few in his pocket, and that in
his struggle through the ash-chute one fell upon the carpet. The
room which Mr. Willard occupied at Mapleton Inn is in the second
story, and its window opens upon a veranda roof which has a gentle
slope almost to the ground. This provides an easy means of exit and
entrance, and as Mr. Willard has no alibi later than half-past ten
on that evening, the time would permit him to come here and go away
again before the hour when Mr. Carleton is known to have
arrived."</p>

<p>Then turning and meeting Tom's intent gaze, Fleming Stone
addressed himself directly to him, and said, "Why you chose to kill
your cousin, I don't know; but you did."</p>

<p>"I did," said Tom, in a hollow voice, "and I will tell you why."
He rose as he spoke, and standing by the table, he steadied himself
by placing one hand upon it.</p>

<p>"It was entirely unpremeditated," he said, "and I'm going to
tell you about it, because I owe a confession to Madeleine's
memory, though I am responsible for my deed to no one here
present."</p>

<p>Though Willard spoke with no attempt at pride or defiance, his
tone and, look were those of a man hopeless and utterly crushed. He
addressed himself principally to Fleming Stone, looking now and
then at Carleton, but not so much as glancing at any one else.</p>

<p>"It is no secret, I think, that I loved my cousin Madeleine.
Many, many times I have pleaded with her to marry me. But never
mind about that. When I came here to attend her wedding, I couldn't
help seeing that the man she was about to marry did not love and
worship her as I did. I besought her to give him up and to marry
me, but she would not listen to that for a moment. That day before
the wedding they had a little tiff, and Carleton did not return for
dinner, though Madeleine expected him. She was all broken up about
this, and was not herself during the evening. When I left her, at
about ten o'clock, to go to the hotel, her sad face haunted me, and
I could not dispel the idea that I must have one more talk with
her, and beg her not to marry a man who did not love her."</p>

<p>Without seeming to do so, Fleming Stone stole a glance at
Carleton. The man sat quietly, with bowed head, as one who hears
himself denounced, but recognizes the truth.</p>

<p>"I was in my room at the hotel," went on Tom, "and was preparing
for bed when the irresistible impulse came to me to go and see
Maddy once more before her wedding day. I had no thought of
wrong-doing. I came out through the window, instead of in the
ordinary way, only because I knew the inn was about to be closed
for the night, and I knew I could get back the same way. A trellis,
that was simply a ladder, reached up to the low roof, and it was
quite as easy an exit as through the front door. As to the cachous,
I had found the stray vial there, and had slipped a couple in my
pocket, without really thinking anything about it. I don't usually
carry them, but they are by no means unfamiliar to me. I came
directly over here, and found the house partially darkened, as if
for the night. There was a low light in the library and hall but
the blinds were drawn, and I could see only a glimpse of Maddy's
yellow dress on the floor. I was about to ring the bell, when I
suddenly thought that I didn't care to rouse the household, or even
the servants, and, remembering the way I often used to get in when
I came home at night later than my uncle approved, I went around
and entered by a cellar window. I came up through the fireplace,
exactly as Mr. Stone has described to you. It is astonishingly easy
to any one who knows how, and quite impossible for one who does
not. I crossed the drawing-room at once, and entered the library.
Naturally, I made very little noise, but still I am surprised that
Hunt did not hear me. I did not try to be entirely silent, for I
had no thought of evil in my heart. Madeleine looked up as I came
into this room, and smiled. She asked me how I got in, and I told
her, and we both laughed at some old reminiscences. I did not see
that paper that Miss Dupuy wrote. Then I told her frankly that I
wanted her to give up Carleton, for he did not love her and I did.
When I said that about Carleton, Maddy burst into weeping, and said
it wasn't true. I said it was, and offered to prove it, and then we
quarrelled. To you who do not know our family temper this may sound
trivial, but it was not. We had a most intense and fiery quarrel,
and though probably our voices were not raised&mdash;that was not
our way&mdash;we were so furious with each other that we were
practically beside ourselves. Maddened, too, by jealousy, and by
being baffled in my errand, I suddenly resolved to kill both my
cousin and myself. I picked up the dagger and told her what I was
about to do, being fully determined to stab her and then myself.
She did not scream, she simply sat there&mdash;in her superb
beauty&mdash;her arm resting on the table, and said quietly, 'You
dare not do it!'</p>

<p>"This threw me into a frenzy, and with one thrust I drove the
dagger home to her heart. She died without a sound, and I pulled
out the dagger to turn it upon myself. But the sight of Madeleine's
blood brought me to my senses. I dropped the dagger and new
thoughts came rushing to my mind thick and fast. Madeleine was
dead. I could not bring her again to life: The fortune was now
mine! Would I not be a fool then to kill myself? I'm not excusing
these thoughts; I'm simply telling the thing as it occurred. I
turned and softly recrossed the hall, let myself down through the
drawing-room fireplace, and was back in my room at the hotel
without having met any one going or coming. At two o'clock I was
summoned over here by telephone, and I came. Miss Morton met me in
the parlor, and as there was a bright light there then, I chanced
to see one of those miserable cachous on the carpet. I picked it up
and concealed it, but it warned me; and when Mr. Fessenden asked me
the next day if I had any, I said no. Now I have told you all.
Wait&mdash;do not speak! I know you would say that I was a coward
not to take my own life when I intended to. I admit it; I was a
coward, but it is not yet too late for the deed!"</p>

<p>Before any one could move to prevent it Tom had grasped the
dagger from the drawer where it was hidden and plunged it into his
own breast. He sank down into the chair&mdash;the very chair where
Madeleine had died, and, dreadful as the occasion was, those who
saw him could not but feel that it was just retribution.</p>

<p>It was Schuyler Carleton who again started forward, and put his
arm around the wounded man.</p>

<p>"Tom," he cried, "oh, Tom, why did you do that?" Carleton then
involuntarily started to pull the dagger away, but Tom stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Don't," he said thickly. "To pull that out will finish me.
Leave it, and I have a few moments more!"</p>

<p>"That is true," said Fleming Stone. "Some one telephone for a
doctor, but do not disturb the weapon. Mr. Willard, if you have
anything to say, say it quickly."</p>

<p>"I will," said Tom, quickly; "Fessenden, you are a lawyer, will
you draw up my will?"</p>

<p>Without a word, Rob caught up paper and pen, and prepared to
take the last words of the dying man.</p>

<p>Though not entirely in legal phrasing, the will was completed,
and after a general bequest to Fessenden himself, and directing
that all bills should be paid, and other minor matters of the sort,
Tom Willard left the bulk of his fortune to Schuyler Carleton.</p>

<p>"That," he said, with almost his last breath, "is only a deed of
justice, in the name of Madeleine and myself."</p>

<p>Before the arrival of Doctor Hills, Tom Willard was dead.
Self-confessed, self-convicted, self-punished; but his crime was
discovered by Fleming Stone, and proved by means of a tiny
clue.</p>
