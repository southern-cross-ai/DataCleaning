<p><b>SCENE.</b>
</p>

<p><i>The combined dining-room, kitchen, bath and laundry of JAMES
ADAMS' house. JAMES ADAMS, a spare, grizzled coal-miner, of about
forty, is sitting in a large tub, vigorously cleaning off the day's
accumulation of coal-dust, while his wife, MARTHA, a buxom woman of
about the same age, is pouring hot water over his back. The room,
without floor-covering, contains the usual furniture of a
Lancashire coal-miner's home in New South Wales in the early
nineties.</i>
</p>

<p>MARTHA ADAMS. Now doant splash all over the floor.</p>

<p>JAMES ADAMS. Well, doant wash the soap all in my eyes.</p>

<p>MARTHA. You're more afeerd of soap than the childer. Hurry,
before they get whoam.</p>

<p>JAMES. Johnnie Coleman may be round t' supper.</p>

<p>MARTHA <i>(dropping her dipper and replenishing the fire)</i>. A
nice time to tell me, with scarce enough in the pot for our own.
<i>(In response to a knock at the back door)</i>. Coom in. Coom in.
<i>(JOHN COLEMAN opens the door, and hesitates a moment on the
threshold)</i>. Sit ye down. James be about washed now. He brings
more coal whoam under his shirt than goes into his skips.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE COLEMAN. That's havin' so many corners in which it can
find restin'.</p>

<p>MARTHA. It isn't lack of eatin' that makes the corners.
<i>(Taking off her apron and moving towards the door)</i>. I must
run next door for another bit o' meat. <i>(Exit MARTHA)</i>.</p>

<p>JAMES. A'hm just through, Johnnie. This craze of the missus to
wash all over every day, instead of stoppin' at the neck, except o'
Sundays, always keeps I a bit behind. <i>(Wraps himself in an old
blanket and disappears into the adjoining bedroom)</i>.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I know, James, I know. My missus 'ud make me live in a
tub. But, get ye dressed. I'll straighten up a bit. <i>(Carries the
tub of water to the back door, returns and sweeps out the room.
GEORDIE WATKINS, a next door neighbour, in his working clothes and
begrimed with the day's coal dust, enters)</i>.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Hallo, Johnnie, where's Jim?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Dressin' hisself.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(calling)</i>. What about a day in the open
to-morrow, Sunday, Jim, with the dogs?</p>

<p>JAMES. A'hm waitin' for it, Geordie. 'Fore sunrise.</p>

<p>GEORDIE.&mdash;I'll be tryin' out my new bitch.</p>

<p>JAMES. Somethin' better than the last one, I'm hopin'.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. There be a special lodge meetin' to-morrow.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. What's the lodge about, now?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. You ought to know. Doant you read the notices posted at
the Miners' Rest?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I reads no notices interferin' with the dogs' run o'
Sundays.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Well, for once, you can forget your dogs and think o'
your mates.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. What's the meetin' for?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. There's delegates from the North to be there&mdash;on
eight hours and more money.</p>

<p><i>(MARTHA re-enters, puts on her apron and busies herself
adding ingredients to the stew pot)</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Hurry along there, James. The new parson be callin'
after supper.</p>

<p>(JAMES enters, attired in shirt and trousers, and gropes under
the sofa for his boots).</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(putting on his boots)</i>. Geordie is quite right,
Johnnie&mdash;these Sunday lodge meetin's must be stopped.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Sunday's the only day no full shift is workin', and all
hands can be got together.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Never mind your old lodge. The week's revival mission
start's to-morrow wi' a parson from Sydney&mdash;comin' to give a
special message from the Lord.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. But the last mission be only a few months gone.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. We ha'e a more important message than can come from any
parson.</p>

<p>JAMES, I won't go that far with you, Johnnie.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Our meetin' might help us to less hours in the pits,
and decent houses, and more money for to spend on the childer.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(lighting his pipe with a live ember and seating
himself in front of the fire)</i>. That's all very well, Johnnie,
for them as worries more about those comin' after them than about
theirselves. Things seem to come out accordin' to some plan.
They're better for us than when I went into t' pit thirty years
about, and I suppose when another thirty years has gone they'll be
better still.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. But why are they better to-day?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. How can I say? It just happens so.</p>

<p>JORNNIE. It just happens so! Why, man, why? Because some o' us
does the askin', and asks loud enough to be heard&mdash;and backs
our askin' with doin'.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Well, what's to do? I'm none thinkin' that any askin'
by me will make much difference.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. No, but you'll do the takkin' of what comes o' others
askin' and doin'.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I will. That's just me, Johnnie. I take what comes and
makes the best o' it.</p>

<p>JOHNNÏE <i>(excitedly).</i> With nowt a thought of them
as&mdash;</p>

<p>MARTHA <i>(interrupting)</i>. Can't you do better nor settin'
here talkin' and hinderin' me? The childer will be in one o' these
minutes&mdash;and no supper ready.</p>

<p>A VOICE OUTSIDE. Is my man in there, Martha?</p>

<p><i>(As GEORDIE rises hastily SUSAN WATKINS opens the door).</i>
</p>

<p>SUSAN. There you be, and your water waitin' this half-hour.</p>

<p>MARTHA. I was just sending him whoam, Susan.
Talk&mdash;talk&mdash;there's no doin' anything with a pack o' men
gettin' together.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(as he leaves)</i>. We'll talk it later, Jimmie. But
I'm for a day wi' the dogs. <i>(Exit GEORDIE and SUSAN).</i></p>

<p>JAMES. Geordie's gettin' worse every day, thinkin' everything he
kennels be a champion.</p>

<p>MARTHA. An' you're as bad as Geordie, thinkin' more and more o'
dogs.</p>

<p>JAMES. More o' dogs than his rights.</p>

<p>MARTHA. His rights will keep, but the special message o' the
mission will na.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Let the parson give his message to women-folk. The men
will get it later on, when they come whoam a bit late o'
nights.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Keep your jeerin' at religion for your lodge
meetin's.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I'm not jeerin'. I'm sick o' the way the lodge lags
behind.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Well, you just keep the chapel and the union apart.
Union's all right in its way, but chapel keeps faith burnin'.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Keeps faith burnin'. Those be but
words&mdash;words&mdash;</p>

<p>MARTHA. Be you losin' all faith? How many o' you would go down
the shaft, without faith?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Faith in what?</p>

<p>JIMMIE. Faith, that if anythin' happens, He will find a way
out.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Like last year&mdash;90 of us buried alive, and nigh 50
killed by odd accidents.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Have you come here to take away our religion, as well as
to stir up a pot o' trouble?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I'm no takkin' anything away. I add to faith what the
Book says itself: "The Lord helps those as helps theirselves."</p>

<p>JAMES. Well, don't let us talk it before supper. There is no
correct thinkin' with the smell o' onions comin' from the pot, and
me hoongry.</p>

<p>MARTHA. That be so. My hope o' salvation is always weakest when
I'm wantin' a bit o' food.</p>

<p><i>(The door opens and JAMIE, a lanky youth of 15, enters and
throws his cap on the sofa)</i>.</p>

<p>JAMIE. Ain't there no supper yet?</p>

<p>MARTHA. In a few minutes, boy.</p>

<p>JAMIE. It's always late these days.</p>

<p>JAMES. And what's put your nose out o' joint?</p>

<p>JAMIE. Nothin'.</p>

<p>MARTHA. What's your 'urry, boy?</p>

<p>JAMIE. I'm called for a special night shift. Somethin' wrong in
No. 3 roadway.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Them workin's is none too safe.</p>

<p>MARTHA. That's it. Frighten the boy before he gets to the
cage.</p>

<p>JAMES. You can't frighten Jamie wi' talk.</p>

<p>JAMIE <i>(fiercely)</i>. Well, I am afraid&mdash;and I hate
night-shift. We're all workin' too far from the shaft, and gas is
breedin' in th' old workin's.</p>

<p>JAMES. Youm be dreamin' again.</p>

<p>JAMIE. I tell you I hear it sometimes&mdash;movin' and
whisperin'. One of these days the whisperin' will swell into
thunder, and we'll be crushed, or smothered slow&mdash;same as
hundreds before us...I won't be a coal-miner.</p>

<p>JAMES. That's all because you'll be sleepin' o' Sunday, instead
o' skylarkin' with the other lads.</p>

<p>JAMES. It isn't. It isn't. I hate the pit. I want to die where I
can see it comin'&mdash;same as other folk. where no coal be
gotten.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Now, Jamie, there's nobbut to make the best o' what the
Lord provides, and be content.</p>

<p>JAMIE. But I ain't content. I want to work in farm&mdash;some
place where there is movin', free&mdash;nor feelin' my way in dark
passages, with, maybe, boggit, round every corner.</p>

<p>MARTHA. There be no boggits, lad, unless evil abide in
ye&mdash;-</p>

<p>JAMIE. But there be boggits&mdash;I seen them&mdash;back o' the
old tunnel&mdash;where Joe North an' his boys were crushed a year
come next Eastertide.</p>

<p>JAMES. That's enough o' yer foolishness. Hae some supper and get
at work.</p>

<p>MARTHA. The boy is ill, Jim. Why not send word to excuse him the
shift?</p>

<p>JAMIE. I'm not ill. But I will na' be a coal-miner. Some day
I'll run away like Jack Olden.</p>

<p>MARTHA <i>(placing a plate of stew before him).</i> Have some
supper, lad. Maybe it's bein' hungry that makes thee think o'
boggits.</p>

<p>JAMES. What's come over lads these days?</p>

<p>JAMIE. Did 'ee want to be a miner, after schoolin' time was
over?</p>

<p>JAMES. There was very little schoolin' in my days. I went down
t' pit soon after twelfth birthday.</p>

<p>JAMIE. Did ye go willin'?</p>

<p>JAMES. Not at t' start. I thought first time down in th' cage I
were fallin' right t' the bottom o' hell. A year come later, it was
just part o' the day's work.</p>

<p>JAMIE. Well, I be different. I hate it more each day whistle
blows.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Get on with supper, lad.</p>

<p>JAMIE. I doant want supper.</p>

<p>JAMES. You'm boys be talkin' too much together, and I want no
more o' your r likin' and dislikin', this and that.</p>

<p>JAMIE. I tell 'ee I be different to you. I ha'e the pluck to
keep on sayin' what you only said once&mdash;I won't be a
coal-miner.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(angrily)</i>. You think it pluck to gie your father
back words? Ha'e your supper wi'out more talk.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Now, man, doant be hasty. <i>(To JAMIE)</i> I have a
tasty put by for later.</p>

<p>JAMIE. I tell 'ee I doant want supper. <i>(Seizes his cap and
slouches from the room)</i>.</p>

<p><i>(JAMES tries to intercept him, but only reaches the door as
it is violently slammed)</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Let be, man. Let be. The boy has been ailin' a week
past.</p>

<p>JAMES. Doant ye think I know that? But sick, or no sick, a
hidin' would make him check the sin o' refusin' good food.</p>

<p>MARTHA <i>(putting the plate of stew back in the pot)</i>.
Choose your time better. A hidin', to a lad in that way o' mind,
would be like a naked light in a bad workin' place.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Why should he be a miner, feelin' that way about
it?</p>

<p>MARTHA. What else can he be? Somebody's to get coal for the
world, and who better than those born and bred to it?</p>

<p><i>(Three young children enter noisily and gather expectantly
round the fire, peering into the stew pot).</i>
</p>

<p>ALICE. What's for supper?</p>

<p>MARTHA. Where be Millie and John?</p>

<p>ALICE. They're stayin' with Mrs. Moylan for supper.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Doant ye see a visitor? <i>(The children shake hands
with JOHNNIE and seat themselves at the table. MARTHA fills each
plate with a generous helping of stew)</i>. I wish that lad had
stayed. Pull yon chairs up there. Wait a minite, you childer. Ask a
blessin', James.</p>

<p>JAMES. "For this food, and for all His blessin's the Loard make
us truly thankful."</p>

<p>ALL. Amen.</p>

<p><i>(Curtain to indicate the lapse of two hours. On the rising of
the curtain, JOHNNIE COLEMAN and GEORDIE WATKINS and JAMES are
sitting at the table smoking. MARTHA is at a small adjoining table,
sewing. The REV. FENWICK is sitting back from the table in the one
available easy chair).</i>
</p>

<p>MARTHA. You're gettin' to be very contrary lately, and you're
neglectin' chapel.</p>

<p>JAMES. I'm only sayin' that chapel and lodge meetin's should
come after supper o' Sundays.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. You know we cannot but get full lodge meetin's on
Sunday afternoons.</p>

<p>JAMES. Why not Saturday night? All the shift lads are out o' the
pit by 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. They won't come together those nights.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. They would, but for the Miners' Arms. Close up the
dram shop and they'd have nothing to do but attend to their lodge
meetings.</p>

<p><i>(ALICE enters with a can of beer and places it on the
table)</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA. You were a long time, child.</p>

<p>ALICE. I stayed a while to listen to Jamies talkin' excited to
some other o' the boys.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(rising hurriedly)</i>. Didn't he go to the pit?</p>

<p>ALICE. Oh, he's gone now. He and t'other two boys on the shift
went along wi' old Joe Corbett.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(resuming his seat)</i>. That lad wants serious talkin'
to, mother.</p>

<p><i>(ALICE kisses her mother and father good-night, and leaves.
MARTHA places heavy china mugs before the men, and filling one for
herself places it on the table. The rest of the company, except
PARSON FENWICK, help themselves)</i>.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. You'd be the better for a mug o' beer, parson. It keeps
out the cold, and lets in the milk o' human kindness.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. You know I don't touch the poisonous stuff. If you
all could only be persuaded to give it up altogether</p>

<p>JAMES. I can't hold with that, parson. I've had my pint on the
way home from shift for nigh on thirty years, and a drop for late
supper. It's done me no 'arm, and it has na' weakened my service o'
the Loard.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Nor mine. It's just a tasty bit o' food to me, a
finishin' up o' the day's eatin'.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. But what of those who want their three pints on
the way home, and waste half their substance at the Miners'
Arms?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Them's the ones you want to talk to, parson.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. Those are the ones who never listen to the
message.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. But we can't help that. Some's got to be damned, else
there'd be no sense in preachin' salvation.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. Our Lord will suffer until the last sinner seeks
salvation.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. But sinners must always be. There will always be
backslidin'. Look at old Corbett. He's been saved a score of times
to my reckonin', and 'e's a more cantankerous old sinner now than
'e ever was. Why, only to-day&mdash;</p>

<p>JAMES. You've done a bit o' backslidin' yourself, Geordie.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I know, I know. But I don't set my mind against the
message when it comes again.</p>

<p><i>(Enter MRS. WATKINS)</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Come and have a sup, Susan.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>(seating herself at the sewing table, while MARTHA
provides an extra mug of beer from the can)</i>. I was just lookin'
if Geordie was safe here.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Didn't I tell 'ee I was comin'?</p>

<p>SUSAN. You did, but you have been known to start for chapel, and
finish up at the Miners' Rest.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Never since I last heeded the call o' grace.</p>

<p>SUSAN. Only three weeks back, Geordie.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. What be Geordie's longest run in the narrow path?</p>

<p>SUSAN. I disremember, except that they all be too short.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Once I lasted nigh on six months.</p>

<p>SUSAN. There was little to boast about that, it bein' just after
our weddin'. How be it, parson, that some o' the men follow the
light steady and sure from the first call to the end o' things,
while others slip about like blind pit ponies in a wet tunnel?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. And some of the women, too.</p>

<p>JAMES. Ain't we all a bit that way? For times, doant we, each o'
us, forget the Lord's message, listenin' to others within
hearin'?</p>

<p>MARTHA. There be but one message. The others are ways the evil
one has o' ticklin' our ears.</p>

<p>JAMES. Not all o' them.</p>

<p>PARSON. Every one of them, and there is no salvation unless ye
close your ears to all but the call of Him who suffered on the
Cross.</p>

<p>JAMES. I think, sometimes, that, if He was here, gettin' coal,
He'd look for a day out in God's sun, betimes&mdash;perhaps with a
dog for company.</p>

<p>MARTHA. That's near to blasphemy, James.</p>

<p>JAMES. I'm far from the unforgivable sin o' blasphemin' the
Lord. But I must have my day i' the sun. It's what I live
for&mdash;what I think alone on when down below...Parson, you don't
know what it means to I&mdash;to lie on green grass, or in the
bracken, lookin' up for hours into light that blinds&mdash;with the
sweet smell o' fresh earth and growin' things&mdash;spittin' out
the black dust and drinkin' in the white air&mdash;to be for one
day out a' the six on the top o' things&mdash;not burrowin' like a
mole...I love to watch the sun creep up from yon side, wi' his
fringe a' all colours, and march like a flamin' torch in the 'ands
o' the Lord to t'other side, and then, to slowly fall out o' sight,
with his flashin' promise to come again. That's why I say all
meetin's o' Sunday should be kept till after supper.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. But if you backs up the lodge in the new move for
betterin' us all, you may have your two days a week in the
open.</p>

<p>JAMES. Mebbe so. But I hate wastin' the day in hand for what may
come, or as like may not.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Surely, man, you can give up one day for a special
mission.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I'll tell 'ee what, missus. We'll start at daybreak and
be back for afternoon service.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(eagerly)</i>. Back by noon, for sure.</p>

<p>MARTHA. I know 'ee too well, Geordie, and you, James. That
means, we'll see naught o' both o' you till long past supper.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. And you're forgettin' again the lodge nueetin'.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I'm thinkin' o' the dogs, not maiself.</p>

<p>SUSAN. And you think much more o' them than o' I.</p>

<p>JAMES. Now, if they was real terriers wi' some points about
them&mdash;</p>

<p>GEORDIE. <i>(opens door and gives a peculiar whistle. In
immediate response a handsome fox terrier rushes in and frantically
acclaims its master)</i>. You have nothin' to come within miles o'
that, Jim.</p>

<p>JAMES <i>(contemptuously)</i>. That? Put her side by side wi' my
last, man. Let those here do a little judgin' on points. <i>(Moves
towards door)</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Don't you dare bring the dogs in here, Jim; and you,
Geordie, flaunting temptation, shameless, like that. Take your dog
out o' this.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(opening door and motioning the dog outside)</i>. A
dog like that is worth a brace o' men.</p>

<p>JAMES. Some dogs might be.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. None o' yours, anyhow.</p>

<p>JAMES. Look here, Geordie...</p>

<p>MARTHA. Cease your dog talk, you two. You forget parson is
here.</p>

<p>SUSAN. Parson, the time has come for you to put dogs among the
deadly sins. I ha'e no peace since Geordie's last litter.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Parson knows a good dog when he sees it.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. I do, Geordie. I have a couple of terriers in a
class of their own.</p>

<p>JAMES. The two I met with ye on the common a month back?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. That's what parson means by a class of their own. No
terrier, with "feelin's o' self-respect, would be seen in their
company.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK <i>(indignantly)</i>. Both of them were by the
Emperor, out of Vixen. There's no breed like that, in these
parts.</p>

<p>JAMES. That strain be no good now, parson. Its proved long since
that Emperor's granfer was a mongrel.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK <i>(excitedly)</i>. Don't you call my dogs,
mongrels. That lie was answered more than a year back. <i>(Produces
a book from his tail pocket)</i>. Here's Austin's pedigree book.
You won't dispute that, will you? Here's a picture of the
grandfather, with his history, and a refutation of the slanders on
his character. <i>(Opens the book. JAMES and GEORDIE, looking over
his shoulder, examine the picture, and read the text, while MARTHA
watches them all with, evident disfavor)</i>.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. That's not a picture o' Emperor's granfer.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. Do you claim to know more about it than the
book?</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I saw Emperor's granfer when I was a lad. He hadna'
that black patch on the left hind leg.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. I'll take the book, before what you remember of
thirty years ago.</p>

<p>JAMES. But, book or no book, I remember, like Geordie here, that
black patch...</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. <i>(angrily)</i>. It's a wicked concoction,
between the two of you, and I'll settle it now. What money will
either of you put up? Here's my two pounds, and Johnnie Coleman can
hold it.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE <i>(to MARTHA)</i>. The parson is human like the rest o'
us. He can hear a call outside the gospel.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK <i>(shamefacedly restoring the book to his
pocket)</i>. I'm only asking for the truth. I'll defend even a dog
against ill-natured slander.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I'm not blamin' you. So would I&mdash;but facts is
facts.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. Sometimes there's no distinguishing your facts
from wilful lies.</p>

<p>JAMES. You know, Geordie, we might a' been mistaken. I'm not too
sure&mdash;thinkin' again&mdash;</p>

<p>MARTHA. Haven't we more serious things to talk about than dogs,
with the mission startin' to-morrow?</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. So I think. I want parson to leave out afternoon
service and come to lodge to help.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. What can I do to help?.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Those o' our lads here, whose senses are not choked wi'
coal dust, are too full o' religion to help in the big fight that's
loomin'. For once, parson, come down to things that be.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. My work is to make you think of things to come. If
you get all you want in this world you will become too soft and
lazy to strive after grace.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. We gets soft and lazy through not usin' the daylight
offerin'. I get nearer to religion down by the lake, than in
chapel, with the windows closed, and singin' the same hymns time
again, an' hearin' the same words spoke.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>(interrupting)</i>. Geordie! Agen your
backslidin'&mdash;you're gettin' as careless as the next door
ethodies.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Can you wonder, parson, that there's so much
backslidin' with so many roads to salvation? There's our Baptist
chapel&mdash;-an' the Methodies&mdash;and the Anglicans&mdash;and
now, a new chapel o' Plymouth Brothers&mdash;an' then there's
Johnnie Coleman here, with his makin' a religion o' unionism, how
can one be sure of salvation? After all, the only place that goes
on the same day on is out beyond the lake, an' the only livin'
things that seems to ha' no trouble is the dogs, so long as their
master treats 'em proper.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. So long as the master treats them proper. You just
touched the truth there, Geordie. A dog without a master is the
unhappiest creature on earth. How much more miserable would we be
without our Master?</p>

<p>MARTHA. Dogs is dogs, and human bein's is human bein's. I can't
hold with this likenin' us to snappin' little fox terriers.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. I was only using Geordie's words as an
illustration.</p>

<p>MARTHA. When Geordie and my man get together it's dogs, dogs
from first to last. I'm nigh tired o' it. And even when you,
parson, and Johnnie Coleman, comes, with messages, the dogs get
trippin' up every bit o' talk.</p>

<p>JAMES. Geordie started it, bringin' in that scraggy little pup
o' his.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(grinning)</i>. Frightened o' her, are you, Jimmie?
Thinkin' you'll want to search in a new litter for somethin' to
hold a candle to her?</p>

<p>JAMES. Frightened o' nothin'. I've never seen a more promisin'
dog</p>

<p>GEORDIE. That's your trouble, Jimmie, promisin'. Your litters
doant keep their promises.</p>

<p>MARTHA. There ye be again. I'm thinkin' a hymn oh two, and a
prayer, will bring us back to a proper state o' mind. The hymn
books are in yon drawwer, James.</p>

<p>GEORDIE <i>(rising hastily)</i>. It's time we be gettin' to
whoam, Susan.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE <i>(rising)</i>. The wife will be wonderin' why I be so
late.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Take heed to me, both o' ye. Ye be afeard to join in
prayers.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. I be afeared to sing, except in chapel.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. And I ha' no' much time for prayin'.</p>

<p>MARTHA. Johnnie Coleman, religion and thee is driftin'
apart.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I've told 'ee before that is not so. But my religion is
changin' a bit.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. Take heed of that admission, Johnnie. It's easy,
very easy, to slide into the blackness of unbelief.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I'm holdin' to the truth, parson, never fear.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. You're putting the little affairs of this life
before those of the world to come.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. Maybe. But I'm aimin' at gettin' some o' the coal dust
out o' our eyes before gettin' to that world.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. We will have vision, then, far beyond the range of
mortal eyes.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I want us to be able to understand...in this
life...think and act, as those who live on the top o' the world. We
underground men only thinks&mdash;underground.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. It's not a new way of thinking we want, it's
faith, the old faith restored.</p>

<p>JOHNNIE. I'm tired o' arguin', parson. I'll strike a bargain wi'
ye. Tell all the lads to come to lodge after mornin' service, and
I'll bring them to the mission for week nights.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK. I cannot bargain with unrighteousness,</p>

<p><i>(A violent yelping of dogs is heard outside. GEORDIE and
JAMES rush to the door, and, standing, watch two terriers in
combat)</i>.</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Let them be, James! they've got to settle it some
day.</p>

<p>JAMES. I don't want your pup to be killed!</p>

<p>GEORDIE. Killed! Five shillings she wins!</p>

<p>JAMES. I'll take it.</p>

<p>SUSAN <i>(hastening to the door)</i>. I'll make it six
shillings, Geordie.</p>

<p>MARTHA <i>(joining the spectators)</i>. That snarlin' little
beast o' yours, Geordie, has been seekin' trouble a week past. I'll
cover that shillin' o' yours, Susan.</p>

<p><i>(JOHNNIE COLEMAN joins the audience)</i>.</p>

<p>REV. FENWICK <i>(peering over JOHNNIE COLEMAN'S shoulder)</i>.
Neither o' them knows how to fight. If I only had one of mine
here!</p>

<p>JOHNNIE COLEMAN. I'll have a side bet wi' you,
parson....half-a-crown on Geordie's! Go it, you beauty!&mdash;</p>
