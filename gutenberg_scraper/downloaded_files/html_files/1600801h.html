<h2>At The Fortunate Frog<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Robert Coutts Armour<br>
(Writing as Coutts Brisbane)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Published in <i>The English Review</i>, December 1930</h3>

<hr>

<p>The last of the long line of patients had departed, writhing but
relieved. Dr. Hi Ho sat himself down on the low couch that had
served all morning as operating table, lit the pipe which his
servant Sung presented to him with the cautery iron which had done
yeoman service, and puffing a cloud of smoke, permitted himself to
smile.</p>

<p>That morning at daybreak he had opened his clinic for the first
time in his own house, after years spent as an itinerant
practitioner proclaiming his merits in every market place of the
great province of Ho Nan.</p>

<p>He had done well. Already he had thought of settling down in
some large city, when a stroke of fortune had trebled his capital
and he no longer hesitated.</p>

<p>He had purchased a small but well-situated house in the Street
of The Evening Star, in Sen Yang, hired a hairy, two-humped camel
and sent it forth through the crowded city ways, led by his
faithful ex-barrowman, Sung, to announce his arrival.</p>

<p>There was no false modesty about the advertisement. Large
placards hung on either side of the beast proclaimed in red
letters:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Dr. Hi Ho, Mighty Healer of bodies, is come
to live among you, in the house of The Fortunate Frog, in Evening
Star Street. Dr. Hi Ho, Healer of Mandarins, the Best Doctor in the
World. All Diseases cured. Pain abolished. Dr. Hi Ho, who formerly
sat in the market place, receives the sick at the sign of The
Fortunate Frog, or heals the incurable in their own homes.<br>
<br>
"Dr. Hi Ho, the Greatest Doctor in the World, is in Evening Star
Street at the sign of The Fortunate Frog He cures Everything!"</p>

<p>And since Dr. Hi Ho was already widely known as a successful if
somewhat drastic dealer with human infirmities, business had
started with sunrise. He had reason to smile.</p>

<p>"We begin well, Sung!" he observed. "And we will do better. The
Fortunate Frog is well named."</p>

<p>"Frogs become the prey of serpents," murmured Sung. "There are
three in Sen Yang who will willingly attempt to seat you in the
saddle of the Heaven Aspiring Steed without unnecessary delay. I
have already seen them observing the crowd at your door, and their
faces were as those of men who wear the wooden collar of
torment."</p>

<p>"Doubtless you speak of my honourable brethren in the art of
body-restoring? I have seen them before when we sat at the corner
of the market place. Twice they have endeavoured to drive me away
by the blows of hired men with clubs. But the people protected me.
It will be the same again."</p>

<p>"The tiger may miss his spring at one who runs. The sleeping man
is a sure prey," grunted Sung. "Also they now have time to consult
together. Yet the chief of these men, the honourable Yat Foo, is
elderly and rich. May this humble one suggest that soft words and a
not inconsiderable present may incline his heart you-wards, or at
the least move him to abstain from such actions as may end in my
inconsiderable self having with great grief to arrange with an
undertaker on your behalf?"</p>

<p>"Since he is the elder of the honourable brethren, etiquette
plainly demands that I should call upon him," said Hi Ho softly.
"And a bag of <i>taels</i> of superior silver and good weight would
be a suitable indication of the reverence due to one far gone in
years, even though he may have advanced into second childhood. I
will go. You will go also, remaining at the door in an attitude of
respect."</p>

<p>"And wearing beneath my coat a short sword of superior
sharpness," agreed Sung. "I will fetch your horse that you may go
with fitting dignity."</p>

<p>For near half a century, Dr. Yat Foo had practised in Sen Yang;
so it was not surprising that he had a fine house surrounded by a
high wall and excellently designed garden, with several servants
whose manners were polished as jade.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho was conducted to an inner apartment, the windows of
which looked upon the garden, and there left while the servant
sought his master. Dr. Hi looked forth and beheld a sight
entrancing even to one who had in his professional capacity seen
many of the pearls adorning the <i>yamens</i> of wealthy merchants
and great mandarins, for the maiden reclining by the fish pond far
outshone them all in pulchritude and the modesty of the regard with
which she returned Dr. Hi Ho's respectful yet adoring gaze.</p>

<p>Rising with a grace that recalled the rhythmic movements of a
slim bamboo swayed by the breeze of morning, the maiden approached
the window.</p>

<p>"Honourable sir, be not impatient if my revered father delays
giving himself the ineffable pleasure of beholding your moonlike
countenance," she said in a voice in which blended the sweetest
notes of singing birds. "At this hour he permits himself to repose
after the labours of the morning."</p>

<p>"I trust his sleep may be sound and prolonged so that I may the
longer enjoy the delight of looking upon you and hearing words that
are as the sounds of a lute of jade and gold," replied Dr. Hi.
"This despicable person's only claim to consideration is that he
belongs to the same profession as your revered and honourable
progenitor, having practised it with not inconsiderable success
about the province. Now he has ventured to establish himself in
this city and so has come to pay his respects to the great Dr. Yat
Foo. The name is Hi Ho, favourably known as a healer of
mandarins."</p>

<p>At these last words, the maiden's countenance, of a peach-like
smoothness and rotundity, which had so far exhibited only the
degree of interest demanded by politeness to a not ill-looking
stranger, became animated by curiosity and concern, for, indeed,
the name of Hi Ho had been spoken in that house in terms of no
kindliness.</p>

<p>"My revered father is well stricken in years. It may be that age
has soured a once-benevolent disposition, yet he has permitted
himself to speak of the honourable Dr. Hi Ho in terms such as might
be employed by the High Ones in reprimanding an inferior insect,"
she said hesitatingly. "Would it not be well, therefore, to prepare
yourself for a rebuff?</p>

<p>"Do you, most marvellous blossom of the gardens of Paradise,
share this inhospitable sentiment?" asked Hi Ho eagerly.</p>

<p>"I rejoice to talk to one so renowned as to cause the venerable
one to break a jade vase of considerable value but unequalled
ugliness and even to bestow hard words upon the humble person who
addresses you," she replied, lowering her eyes as modesty required,
but allowing a smile to uplift the corners of a mouth comparable
only to the petals of a vermilion flower. "And this humble one
ventures to assure Dr. Hi Ho that, in the household of Yat Foo, she
will remain his admiring friend."</p>

<p>"The house of The Fortunate Frog is lonely. It lacks a mistress.
Is it possible that this lowly one might hope to one day adorn his
hearth with a graceful shoot from the gnarled trunk of the
venerable Yat Foo?" asked Hi. Practice with the more exacting tools
of his profession had taught him to reach his objective with speed
and precision.</p>

<p>"It is written that many things, though possible, are too often
difficult of accomplishment," she murmured. "Yet to a person of
such attainments as the honourable Dr. Hi Ho, such a
transplantation might not be impossible. But now I must go. If it
were known to the venerable and irascible one that I had talked
with you, many blows from a heavy cane would be my portion."</p>

<p>"But I must see you again. I do not know your name!" said Hi Ho
urgently.</p>

<p>"About the falling of night I will be in that summerhouse. And
the name is Willow Leaf," whispered the girl, and slipped softly
out of sight.</p>

<p>A moment later a servant, whose countenance having once
encountered a sword, was destitute of a nose, appeared and, in
tones of dislike, bade Dr. Hi Ho follow him to the presence of the
master.</p>

<p>Dr. Yat Foo's person, despite a plenitude of good food, was of a
meagre habit, while his thin face, creased with many wrinkles, was
distorted by malevolence as he glared at his visitor. Yet habit was
strong and he could not refrain from making the usual gestures of
courtesy. He bowed.</p>

<p>"This humble and despicable roof is honoured by the presence of
the learned and benevolent Dr. Hi Ho," he said. "To what happy
cause may I attribute the delight of beholding his luminous and
sagacious countenance?"</p>

<p>"To the desire of basking for a moment in the rays of wisdom
emanating from the person of the world-famed Dr. Yat Foo and of
hearing his mellifluous voice," replied Hi Ho. "Also, as a mark of
the esteem in which I hold him, to lay at his feet this small token
of regard."</p>

<p>Dr. Foo took the bag eagerly enough, weighed it speculatively
and laid it beside him.</p>

<p>"It shall be expended in works of benevolence," he murmured.
"Doubtless, my son, you are proceeding further northwards in a day
or so?"</p>

<p>"I had proposed to bask in the effulgence of the light cast upon
Sen Yang by your learned self for a number of years only to be
limited by the decree of the Rulers of the Upper Sphere," murmured
Hi Ho. "I have thrown my good money away," he thought.</p>

<p>"You reside in the house named The Fortunate Frog, I am told.
That is a misfortune. The house is an unlucky one. Short is the
span of those who dwell there," went on Yat Foo.</p>

<p>"I will consult an astrologer. Perhaps the luck may be made to
change," suggested Hi Ho with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am something of an astrologer and I have read in the stars
that the town of Sen Yang is unlucky for anyone of the honourable
house of Ho," replied Yat Foo in a voice of doom.</p>

<p>"Is it permitted to ask what form this ill-luck will take?"
asked Hi Ho, still smiling, though he had received notice to
quit.</p>

<p>"The voice of the stars has spoken with no incertitude. Head and
body batterings, slicing with swords and knives, and a funeral
marred by the absence of a head from the honoured remains are but
too plainly indicated. Be warned, my son. In the fine province of
Sze Chuan, fortune awaits you. Seek it without delay."</p>

<p>"One hundred and five persons sought my aid this morning.
Numerous others will undoubtedly arrive to-morrow, while I have
received requests to visit several wealthy men in their own
<i>yamens</i>. Shall I leave them to perish because the stars have
spoken? Perhaps, Oh! venerated Yat Foo, your ears have mistaken the
words. Have I your leave to withdraw my humble and despicable
person from your honoured roof?"</p>

<p>"Your going will be as the withdrawal of the sun. May your
health continue to be excellent&mdash;yet I fear it will not,"
quoth Yat Foo, and so bowed him out.</p>

<p>Escorted by the no-nosed servant, he reached the street and the
waiting Sung, mounted his horse and rode home through a rosy dream
inspired not by the prospect of dissolution offered by Yat Foo's
words, but by the thought of presently seeing his daughter. He
ordered a light repast, and having eaten, lay down to repose for a
little before setting out to visit Yat Foo's garden. Meanwhile, Yat
Foo had summoned the other two old-established doctors of Sen Yang,
men of substance both, Dr. See Hop and Dr. Lu. Younger than Foo,
they might be assumed to have a greater interest in suppressing
competition before it could affect them adversely. Yat Foo came to
the point with admirable&mdash;and unusual&mdash;brevity.</p>

<p>"This mangy dog, Hi Ho, who calls himself a healer, has been
here. I told him that the climate of Sen Yang was unhealthy for
him. He will not take the warning. If he remains, there are lean
days for all of us, for the people, unmindful of what we have done
for them in the past, flock to him. My man Chai can break a head
very skilfully. The river will carry a body far."</p>

<p>"That is not the way!" said Dr. See Hop. "The fellow has great
friends. He procured for one great lord the felicity of a son and
another he has certainly cured of jaundice. Also, the mandarin of
the province, Sun Lo Chi, is said to be about to visit us, and he
might be moved to make loud noises if a healer disappears,
accompanied by questioning and slicings. Already Dr. Lu and I have
considered the matter."</p>

<p>"Thus!" intoned Dr. Lu pompously, for he was a person of girth.
"Let us stir up the people against him. Let a body be procured, one
of a traveller who is a stranger. Let the body be bestowed in the
outhouse of the house of Hi Ho. Then let an old woman&mdash;my
sister will play the part, for she seldom stirs from my house and
few know her&mdash;let her make an outcry, swearing that Hi Ho has
slain the man to calcine his bones for medicine and that he is her
sister's son. She shall make much outcry. The people will follow
her to the garden of Hi Ho. There they will find the body. And
because they are stupid and ignorant and there is good loot in Hi
Ho's house, they will fall upon him. And perhaps in the riot
someone will deal Hi Ho a blow that will send him to the Upper Air
without more ado. At the least, no more people will crowd about his
door for healing."</p>

<p>"Your words are wise," murmured Yat Foo. "I see but one
difficulty. We have no body prepared, yet we should move swiftly
before Sun Lo Chi comes to us."</p>

<p>"We have your headbreaker, Chai. Let him go forth in the dusk
and make a body ready. Travellers are often late upon the road.
Then let him take the body to Hi's garden and leave the rest to
me&mdash;and the people."</p>

<p>"It is good!" agreed Yat Foo. "So it shall be. Now let us
instruct Chai. He is stupid, but when once he understands he
remembers."</p>

<hr>

<p>Sen Yang had a wall. Once this wall had been strong and high, a
protection against brigands and spoilers. But time and neglect, and
the attentions of builders who found in it a quarry, had made many
gaps in it, and though the gates were solemnly shut at sundown,
belated travellers usually entered by the nearest hole.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho had noted that Dr. Yat Foo's garden backed against the
town wall. He had also observed that though there was no gap just
there, the upper tiers of stones had been removed, while cracks
offered a ready foothold. As darkness fell, he climbed into the
garden and sought the summerhouse. Willow Leaf, clad in shimmering
grey silk, gleamed in the obscurity.</p>

<p>"Flower of Paradise!" began Dr. Hi Ho. "Redolent garden of sweet
herbs! Moon of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! At another time, honourable Dr. Ho, I will listen to
sweet words. But now listen to mine. Mischief is intended towards
you. I do not know what, but Chai, who is a person of evil
countenance and a heart of stone, goes presently forth to
accomplish it. Be silent! Let us watch the going out. He
comes!"</p>

<p>The execrable Chai appeared walking upon feet of silence and
bearing a short but heavy club which might be concealed in the
sleeve. He climbed the wall.</p>

<p>"Moon of Endless Delight!" murmured Dr. Hi Ho. "I will follow.
It may be that the Watchers will offer to this person an
opportunity of connecting the edge of this sword with the head of
the abominable Chai. Tomorrow at this hour I will return."</p>

<p>And without further ado, for the need was pressing, he too
surmounted the wall and followed the shadowy figure, moving
silently in the direction of the town's eastern gate. At a little
distance from it, Chai took to the road and there loitered. Dr. Hi
Ho, perceiving that the time was not yet come for any attempt upon
the fellow, crouched by the wayside.</p>

<p>Two travellers, well mounted and carrying drawn swords against
the chances of the road, passed at a trot. The execrable Chai,
perceiving the gleam of steel, with admirable discretion withdrew
himself from their observation behind a clump of weeds. They passed
into the town through a convenient hole in the wall. For a little
was silence. Then came a solitary figure, walking with the gait of
one whose honourable feet are incommoded by the roughness of the
way. Even in the gloom it was plain that he was a beggar, for his
clothing was ragged and he bore a bowl.</p>

<p>Chai rose from his lurking place as he passed and suddenly,
without warning or even a polite word to indicate to the stranger
that he was about to pass into a state of no-existence, smote him
heavily upon the head with his loaded club.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho, greatly interested in this manifestation of the
essential baseness of the execrable Chai, remained quiescent until,
having hoisted the victim upon his broad shoulders, the slayer set
off once more around the walls. Dr. Hi Ho followed at a discreet
distance.</p>

<p>Thus he perceived the execrable Chai enter the town once more by
a gap in the wall, well shrouded by creepers and scale the wall of
a garden beyond.</p>

<p>And now Dr. Hi Ho's interest quickened, for though time had been
lacking to explore the vicinity of the Street of the Evening Star,
the dilapidated summerhouse to which Chai bore the defunct was all
too familiar, for it was his own. Dr. Ho hesitated. Should he draw
his sword and, hamstringing Chai, call for help? Or, slaying him
outright, dispose of the bodies with the help of Sung, thus leaving
the atrocious Dr. Yat Foo in doubt of the fate of his emissary?</p>

<p>But while he hesitated, Chai, with movements of much celerity,
had sped across the garden and, surmounting the wall at another
place, proceeded along the street into the Everywhere.</p>

<p>Dr. Hi Ho meditated no longer. He ran to his house and summoning
Sung, told him of what had occurred. Sung sighed.</p>

<p>"Honourable sir, there is but one thing which a wise man may do.
Let us bear this not-breathing one to the garden of the honourable
Dr. Foo and there bury him, but not deeply. A word to the
magistrate that the honourable Foo employs such remains for the
practice of magic is then clearly indicated. Let us hasten."</p>

<p>This advice, being at once sound and practical, they hastened to
the summerhouse, bearing a light and the wherewithal for the
digging of a grave. By the light, Dr. Hi Ho inspected the defunct.
And at once something which the stupidity of Chai had failed to
note, became apparent. Though outwardly clad in the rags of a
beggar, the body was inwardly covered with garments of superior
silk; while a long knife which, but for a fallacious reliance upon
the protection afforded by his poor appearance might have saved his
life, was of excellent quality and adorned with jewels of
price.</p>

<p>"Such garments are too good for the tomb!" murmured Sung.</p>

<p>"Are we robbers? Be silent!" quoth Dr. Hi sternly. "Yet it may
be that he wears some amulet by which doubtless sorrowing
relatives&mdash;Ah!" He paused, then bent a listening ear. "Amazing
is the no-perception of the villain Chai. This man lives! Let us
bear him within and struggle with the Demon for his life!"</p>

<p>Shortly after, faint groans, presently rising to prolonged howls
arose from the house of The Fortunate Frog as, relieved by timely
bloodletting and stimulated by skilful touches of a cautery iron,
the victim of ill-directed endeavour struggled back to
consciousness.</p>

<p>Towards dawn, revived by wine, sustained by a bowl of chicken
soup and four black eggs warranted a century old, which Dr. Hi Ho
kept in stock for his better class patients, the apparently dead
recovered sufficiently to give an account of himself and pour out
his thanks to his preserver.</p>

<p>The rosy flush of dawn suffused the Upper Air as, leaving the
sleeping man in the charge of the wife of Sung, a person of
discreet years and well versed in cookery, Dr. Hi Ho and the
faithful Sung, well armed, though their garments concealed their
weapons, proceeded to the residence of the honourable Dr. Yat
Foo.</p>

<p>Early though the hour, there were yet signs of activity by the
gate of the dean of Sen Yang. Two chairs stood there, each with its
chairmen. Dr. Hi Ho recognized them. They belonged to the
honourable Drs. See Hop and Lu. Glowering in the gateway was the
execrable Chai.</p>

<p>"Lead me to the presence of the learned and venerable doctor,
your honourable master," said Dr. Hi Ho, smiling with the
affability of a tiger of the hills confronting a well-fed but
unarmed traveller. "Celerity is indicated. If it is not
forthcoming, the stars prophesy disaster to his palatial dwelling
and all within."</p>

<p>With a growl of confusion, Chai led the way into the
<i>yamen</i>, and so to the presence of Dr. Yat Foo, who, in act of
concluding the last arrangements for the stirring up of the dregs
of Sen Yang against Dr. Hi Ho, regarded him with consternation,
while his eminent and honourable colleagues permitted their mouths
to display their yellow teeth.</p>

<p>"Revered and honourable brethren!" began Dr. Hi Ho, bowing
ceremoniously to each in turn. "Your very humble and ignorant
brother comes to render thanks to you for the kindness displayed in
the dark hours. Well does this person know that each of you could
have revived the honourable and eminent person sent to him by the
hands of the strong and dexterous No-Nose, Chai. Yet perceiving
that he was young and in need of help, your magnanimity selected Hi
Ho. The great Sun Lo Chi has been pleased to thank him in terms
that modesty does not allow him to repeat, while promising him
other rewards of a more substantial if less gratifying sort."</p>

<p>The three forgot politeness. They glared, they stared.</p>

<p>"Sun Lo Chi?" cried Yat Foo. "The mandarin who comes to dwell in
our midst?"</p>

<p>"The same," quoth Dr. Hi Ho blandly. "A person of surpassing
merit who, that he might the better observe the extortions of minor
officials, has been traversing his province in the garb of a
beggar&mdash;with his soldiers and <i>yamen</i> men a little behind
him. They are already in the city. Sun Lo Chi will presently send
them forth to seek a person with no nose, who, he has told me,
assaulted him with head batterings. Absence is indicated for that
person, lest there be slicings. Assault upon the body of a high
official is bitterly punished."</p>

<p>There was a stir by the door. Chai became suddenly notable by
his absence. With one accord the three smiled and nodded to each
other; with no word spoken, they were agreed.</p>

<p>"My son," said Yat Foo, "in the name of we three, the healers of
Sen Yang, this person bids you welcome. Presents of a quality
befitting one of your transcendent merits shall soon be within your
honourable house. Commend us to the noble Sun Lo Chi, in case there
should be some of his household too mean in degree to deserve your
skill."</p>

<p>"Truly it shall be so," murmured Dr. Hi Ho. "There is but one
thing more. This person lacks a wife to adorn his hearth and
furnish him with sons who shall make the offerings when he has by
the decree of the High Ones become an ancestor. The Willow is a
tree of grateful shade and peculiar fertility. A Willow Leaf is a
graceful and fitting decoration for an abode, mean yet not
unfurnished with all that may be required by the household of a
humble but flourishing healer of bodies."</p>

<p>"To be allied with the ancient and honourable house of Ho is the
one wish which this person desires to gratify," said Dr. Yat Foo.
"A go-between of renowned skill and delicacy shall wait upon the
honourable Dr. Hi Ho within the hour. All shall be concluded
swiftly. And now, what say the Sages? 'Of all precious things,
nought is better than a cup of wine drunk by brethren in
amity.'"</p>

<p>And solemnly, fraternally, the medical faculty of Sen Yang drank
together.</p>
