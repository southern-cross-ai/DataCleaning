<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="I" id="I"></a>Chapter I<br>
Buttonwood Terrace</strong>
</h3>

<p>The letter I had just read was signed <em>Anne Mansfield Van
Wyck,</em>&mdash;and the first two names gave my memory such a
fillip, that I sat for a long time, motionless, while my thoughts
raced back ten years, and reached their goal in a little suburban
town.</p>

<p>The picture which memory so obligingly showed me, in definite
detail, was that of two young people saying good-by, somewhat
effusively. One of these was an immature version of my present
self, and the other was a pigtailed school-girl, who now signed
herself, Anne Mansfield Van Wyck. At the time of that dramatic
parting, she had been Anne Mansfield, and I, Raymond Sturgis, was
leaving her to go to college.</p>

<p>Our farewell promises, though made in all good faith, were never
fulfilled; and the barrier of circumstances that time raised
between us, had kept us from sight of each other for ten years.</p>

<p>I assumed, when I thought of it at all, that Anne had forgotten
me; and though I had not forgotten her, I remembered her only
casually, and at long intervals.</p>

<p>I had heard of her marriage to David Van Wyck without poignant
regret, but with a feeling of resentment that she should throw
herself away on a man so old and eccentric, though a well-known
capitalist. And, now, all unexpectedly, I had received an
invitation to one of her house parties. It expressed, pleasantly
enough, a desire to renew our old-time acquaintance, and asked me
to come on Friday for the week-end.</p>

<p>The stationery was correct and rather elegant; the handwriting
fashionable and sophisticated,&mdash;not at all like the sprawling
school-girl hand of ten years ago.</p>

<p>My curiosity was roused to know what Anne would be like as Mrs.
Van Wyck, and I accepted the invitation with a pleased sense of
regaining an old friend.</p>

<p>As my train swayed swiftly through New England, toward the
village of Crescent Falls, where the Van Wycks had their summer
residence, I tried to picture to myself the pretty little Anne
Mansfield that I had known, as the chatelaine of a great estate,
with an elderly husband and two grown-up step-children. The picture
was so incongruous that I gave it up, and awaited first impressions
with unbiased opinions.</p>

<p>And I may well have done so, for, though I knew of his wealth, I
knew nothing of the taste and judgment that had led David Van Wyck
to select for his summer home a most beautiful country estate,
whose century-old mansion was surrounded by equally old buttonwood
trees, a species rapidly growing extinct in New England.</p>

<p>The motor car which brought me from the station swung into the
broad avenue that led to the house, and I marvelled that such a
home could have been found in America. For it was like an English
park; the green lawns rolling off in velvety sweeps toward
distances of woodland, which betokened flowery dells and
picturesque ravines.</p>

<p>No one had met me at the railroad station, save the chauffeur
and footman, so I assumed that the Van Wyck household was conducted
on formal lines. I held my mind open for informing impressions, and
suddenly, rounding a curve, we came within sight of the house.</p>

<p>I knew the Van Wyck home was called Buttonwood Terrace, but when
I saw it I felt a whimsical impulse to call it All Gaul&mdash;for
it was so definitely divided into three parts. The enormous
rectangle that had originally formed the main dwelling had later
received the addition of two also rectangular wings. But these were
not attached in the usual fashion; they were jauntily caught by
their corners to the two rear corners of the main house. These
lapping walls impinged but a few feet, or just enough for
communicating doors. Thus, the wings, with the back or southern
side of the house, formed three sides of a delightful terrace, from
which marble steps and grassy paths led to formal gardens beyond,
where one could wander among fountains, statues, and rare and
beautiful plants.</p>

<p>The West wing held the many kitchens and other servants&rsquo;
quarters, and the East wing,&mdash;I judged from its long, almost
church-like windows,&mdash;was a great hall of some sort.</p>

<p>For some reason, the car circled the house before pausing at the
front entrance, and, enthralled by the beauty and wonder of the
place, I was ready to forgive Anne Mansfield her much-criticized
marriage. The door was opened to me by an obsequious personage in
livery, and I was at once shown to my room. This was on the second
floor, at the front of the house, and on the East side. It was a
marvel of good taste and comfortable, even luxurious appointments,
but I scarcely noticed it, as I caught sight of the view from my
windows.</p>

<p>The Berkshire hills rolled above and beyond one another, in what
seemed a very riot of mountainous glee. The spring green had
appeared early, and the tender verdure of the young leaves
contrasted with the deep greens and purples of the mountain
forests. It was nearly sunset, and a red gold glow added a
theatrical effect to the glorious landscape.</p>

<p>I leaned out of my East window, and glanced toward the back of
the house. I saw again that great East wing, so peculiarly attached
to the corner of the main dwelling, and concluded it had been built
later. It had almost the appearance of a chapel, for the long
windows were of stained glass, with arched tops and ornate casings.
The fact that these windows reached from the roof nearly to the
ground, proved the wing apartment to be a lofty one, fully the
height of two ordinary stories. So interested in the matter was I,
that I asked the man who was unpacking my things, if the East wing
might be a chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He volunteered the further information that tea was now being
served there, and that I was to go down as soon as I was ready.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I followed my guide through the halls and rooms
of the enormous house. Drawing-rooms and reception rooms were
furnished with quiet elegance; and the heavy hangings, though of
brocades and tapestries, were never obtrusive in coloring or
design.</p>

<p>Through the halls we went, until we reached the doorway that
formed the sole connection between the main house and the East
wing. Here, after a murmured announcement of my name, the servant
left me, and I found myself in the study of David Van Wyck.</p>

<p>I think I have never seen a more impressive room than this study
at Buttonwood Terrace. Its domed ceiling of leaded glass was
perhaps thirty feet high, but so large was the room and so graceful
its lines that the architecture gave the effect of perfect
proportion.</p>

<p>The walls were panelled between the stained-glass windows, and
at the West end of the room was a small balcony, like a
musicians&rsquo; gallery, reached by a spiral staircase. At the
same end of the room, under the balcony and opening on the terrace,
were large double doors; and there was no other entrance save the
single door that connected with the main house through the lapped
corners.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a dozen people present, and though, of
course, I recognized my hostess, I went to greet her with a face
that, I am sure, showed an expression of incredulity.</p>

<p>Anne Van Wyck laughed outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really I,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you seem
unable to believe it&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even before I could reply she turned to welcome another
newcomer, and I stood alone, a moment, waiting for her to turn back
to me.</p>

<p>The scene was a picturesque one. The contrast of the modern
garbed society people, their light laughter and gay chatter, with
the dignity and grandeur of the old room and its antique
furnishings, made an interesting picture. Everywhere the eye rested
on carvings and tapestries worthy of a baronial hall, and yet the
gay occupation of afternoon tea seemed not amiss in this setting.
It was late in May, and though the great doors stood open to the
terrace, the blaze of an open fire was not ungrateful.</p>

<p>My hostess did not herself preside at the tea-table, but left
that to her step-daughter Barbara, while she graciously dispensed
charming smiles of greeting or farewell to the guests who came or
went. After a few moments came a lull in her duties and with a
fascinating smile she invited me to sit beside her and talk over
old times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remembering our schoolmate days, may I call you
Anne?&rdquo; I asked, taking my place by her on a divan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I really oughtn&rsquo;t to allow it, but it is
pleasant to feel you are an old friend,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;though a bit hard to realize that the little
school-girl I used to know is now mistress of all this
grandeur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fine old place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
returned, evading the personal equation. &ldquo;And, perhaps
because of its picturesque possibilities, I pride myself on my
house-parties. I adore having guests, and I invite them with an eye
to their fitting into this environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the implied compliment,&rdquo; I murmured,
but I brought back my gaze from my surroundings, to look more
attentively at Anne&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>It seemed to me I had caught a plaintive note in her voice, and
I looked for a corresponding expression in her eyes. But she
dropped her long lashes, after a swift glance that was a little
roguish, a little wistful, and entirely fascinating. Suddenly I
wondered if she were happy. My vague impression of her husband was
that he was tyrannical and possibly cruel; I felt intuitively that
Anne's lightheartedness was assumed, and covered a disappointed
life.</p>

<p>But meantime she was chatting on, gaily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
declared; &ldquo;I select my house-parties with the utmost care. I
have an exactly proper admixture of married people and unmarried,
of serious-minded and frivolous, of geniuses and
feather-heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In which class am I?&rdquo; I asked, more for the sake of
making her look at me than for a desire for information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so long since we last met, that I shall have
to study you a bit before I can classify you. But please be as
frivolous as you can, for I want you to offset a very serious
guest&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, following Anne&rsquo;s glance
across the room; &ldquo;the long girl in pale green. I shall have
to be a veritable buffoon to average up with that serious-minded
siren! She looks like a Study of a Wailing Soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she Burne-Jonesey? That&rsquo;s
Beth Fordyce, and she&rsquo;s the dearest thing in the world, but
she has a sort of aesthetic pose, and goes in a little for the
occult and such ridiculous things. But you&rsquo;ll like her, for
she&rsquo;s a dear when she forgets her fad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she ever forget it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; when she&rsquo;s thinking of clothes. Indeed,
sometimes I think she prefers clothes to soulfulness,&mdash;but
she&rsquo;s terribly devoted to both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly makes a success of her raiment,&rdquo; I
observed, looking at the long, sweeping lines of Miss
Fordyce&rsquo;s misty, green draperies.</p>

<p>I suppose it was only a touch of the Eternal Feminine, but Anne
seemed to resent my compliment to the green gown, and quickly
turned the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The frizzy blonde lady next her is Mrs. Stelton,&rdquo;
she went on; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a young widow who&rsquo;s terribly
in love with Morland, my step-son. To tell the truth, I invited her
because I want him to find out that he really doesn&rsquo;t care
for her, after all. Then Barbara, at the tea-table is my
step-daughter; she&rsquo;s exactly like her father, and when I
married him, Barbara was determined not to like me. But I am
determined she shall; and of course I shall win out&mdash;though I
haven&rsquo;t made any startling success as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much for the women,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now tell me
of your men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know my husband. He&rsquo;s
distinguished-looking, isn&rsquo;t he? And though he&rsquo;s nearly
sixty, that little alert air of his makes him seem younger. Morland
looks like him, but they are not at all alike otherwise. Morland is
handsome but he is puffy-minded, and any woman can lead him by a
string. For the moment, he thinks Mrs. Stelton is his ideal, but I
intend that Beth Fordyce shall dethrone her. That tall man talking
to Beth now is Connie Archer. He&rsquo;s a dear thing, but a little
difficult. Mr. Van Wyck doesn&rsquo;t like him; but, then, my
husband likes so few people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like Mr. Archer?&rdquo; I asked, looking directly
at her.</p>

<p>She flashed me a glance of surprise, and then answered coolly,
&ldquo;I like him, but not as much as he likes me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne Mansfield Van Wyck,&rdquo; I said, looking at her
sternly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve developed into a
coquette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Developed!&rdquo; she repeated, with a gay little laugh;
&ldquo;I was always a coquette. I used to flirt with you,
&rsquo;way back in High School Days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you did!&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;You purposely kept
Jim Lucas and me in a fever of jealousy toward one
another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did. You were both so susceptible. If I let
one of you carry my schoolbooks, the other promptly went off in a
sulk.&rdquo; Anne laughed merrily at the recollection, and I gazed
at her, thinking how beautiful she had grown, and wondering why she
had married Van Wyck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you remember,&rdquo; I went on, a little
diffidently, &ldquo;the last time we met?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I do!&rdquo; she replied, without a trace of
embarrassment &ldquo;You were going off to college, and you kissed
my hand as we parted. That was a very graceful act,&mdash;for a
school-boy,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve never forgotten how well you did
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, lightly, &ldquo;one must be a born
cavalier to get away with a hand-kiss successfully. When I get a
real good chance I&rsquo;m going to see if your right hand has lost
its cunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she returned laughingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to permit anything of that sort
I&rsquo;m a perfect Griselda of a wife and my husband rules me with
a rod of iron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; said Van Wyck himself, as he came
toward us, and, really, Anne&rsquo;s speech had been made at him
rather than to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you knew my wife as a child?&rdquo; he asked,
after Anne had conventionally introduced us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a girl,&rdquo; I corrected him. &ldquo;We were
acquainted during our High School days, when I was an awkward cub,
and she was &lsquo;standing with reluctant feet.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m; and was she then, as now, a self-willed,
insistent creature, determined to have her own way in
everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My blood boiled at his tone, even more than at his words. But I
felt sure it was better to keep to the light key, so I said:
&ldquo;Yes, indeed; like all other women. And even as boys, we men
are only too glad to give the Blessed Sex their own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne flashed me a glance that distinctly betokened approval. I
felt she had wondered how I would meet her husband&rsquo;s
ill-chosen speech, and I felt an elation at having passed through
the ordeal successfully in her eyes.</p>

<p>David Van Wyck glowered at me. As Anne had said, he was
distinguished-looking, but his drawn brows, and straight, thin
lips, showed habitual surliness. His thick, tossing hair was almost
white, and his acutely black eyes gleamed from beneath heavy gray
eyebrows. He was tall and well-proportioned, with an alert air that
made him seem less than the sixty years his wife had ascribed to
him.</p>

<p>He was handsome; his manners, though superficial, were correct;
and yet he roused in me a spirit of antagonism such as no stranger
ever had done before. After a few moments more conversation, he
said, quite abruptly, &ldquo;I will take your place beside my wife,
and do you go and make yourself charming to the other
ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="II" id="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
The Van Wyck Household</strong>
</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; I returned equably; &ldquo;but first
let me congratulate you on the find of this delightful old place.
This room itself is a marvel. It might have been brought over from
some English castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Van Wyck looked around appreciatively. &ldquo;It is a fine
room,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It was built later than the main
house, and was originally intended, I imagine, for a ballroom. It
has a specially fine floor, and that musicians&rsquo; gallery at
the end seems to indicate festivities on a big scale. To be sure,
the whole scheme of decoration is too massive and over-ornate for
these days, but it is all in harmony, and the gorgeousness of
coloring has been toned down by time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true. The lofty walls were topped by a wide and heavy
cornice, with an enormous cartouche in each corner, massive enough
for a cathedral. But the coloring was dimmed by the years, and the
gilding was tarnished to a soft bronze. Most of the furniture
consisted of choice old pieces collected by Van Wyck for this
especial use, and it was plain to be seen that he took great pride
in these, and in his rare and valuable pictures and curios,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my room,&rdquo; he was saying, as he smiled
benignly on his wife, &ldquo;but I let Anne have her fallal teas
here, because she thinks it&rsquo;s picturesque. But except at the
tea-hour, this is my exclusive domain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call it your study?&rdquo; I inquired casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call it my study, yes; although I&rsquo;m not a
studious man, by any means. It is really my office, I suppose; but
such a name would never fit this eighteenth-century atmosphere. I
have my desk here, and my secretaries and lawyers come when I call
them, and I have even profaned the place with a telephone, so that
I&rsquo;m always in touch with what the poets call the busy mart.
Moreover, I confess I&rsquo;m subject to short-lived fads and
fancies, and this good-sized room gives me space to indulge my
interest of the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, indeed,&rdquo; said Anne, laughing. &ldquo;Last
summer he was a naturalist, and this room was full of stuffed birds
and dried beetles and all sorts of awful things. But that&rsquo;s
all over now, and this year &mdash;what are you this year,
David?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Van Wyck&rsquo;s face hardened. A steely look came into his
eyes, and his square jaw set itself more firmly, as he replied, in
a dry, curt tone, &quot;I&rsquo;m a philanthropist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word seemed simple enough, and yet Anne&rsquo;s face also
became suddenly serious, and, unless I was mistaken, a flash of
anger shot from her dark eyes to her husband&rsquo;s grim face. But
just then Archer and Miss Fordyce joined us, and Anne&rsquo;s
smiles returned instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mood, Beth?&rdquo; she cried gaily. &ldquo;You see,
Honey, I&rsquo;ve been telling Mr. Sturgis that you&rsquo;re
aesthetic and lanky-minded and all the rest of it, and you must
live up to your reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; murmured Miss Fordyce, rolling a pair of
soulful blue eyes at me; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m only a
beginner&mdash;a disciple of the wonderful mysticism of
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Beth, cut it short,&rdquo; broke in Archer.
&ldquo;We know! The mysticism of the theosophical value of the
occult as applied to the hyper&aelig;stheticism of the soul by
whichever Great High Muck-a-Muck you&rsquo;ve been reading
last&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others laughed, but Miss Fordyce gave the speaker a
reproachful glance, which, however, utterly failed to wither
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be a real nice girl, Beth,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d chuck mysticism and go in for
athletics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Mr. Archer,&rdquo; began Miss
Fordyce, in her soft, melodious voice; but Archer interrupted
her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t come the misunderstood racket on me! I
won&rsquo;t stand for it. Practise your wiles on Mr. Sturgis. Take
him over there, and show him Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s Buddha, and tell
him what you know about Buddhaing as a fine art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked away with the pale-haired Miss Fordyce, but instead of
talking about Buddha, we naturally fell into conversation about our
fellow-guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well understand,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;that
the occult would scarcely appeal to such a practical specimen of
manhood as Archer. Who is he and what is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with, he&rsquo;s a supreme egotist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean his character; but what does he
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, exactly. I believe he&rsquo;s a
mining engineer or something. But he&rsquo;s terribly in love with
Anne, and he&rsquo;s clever enough not to let Mr. Van Wyck know
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Anne knows it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, yes; and she doesn&rsquo;t care two cents for
him. But she&rsquo;s a born coquette, and she leads him on, for
nothing but an idle amusement. I don&rsquo;t think a woman ought to
do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless you are right, Miss Fordyce; but is it your
experience that women always do what they ought to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very rarely,&rdquo; returned Miss Fordyce, laughing, and
I began to realize that when the girl dropped her silly pose, she
was really charming. &ldquo;And especially Anne,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of my dearest friends, but that
doesn&rsquo;t blind me to her faults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it a fault to be attractive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be as attractive as Anne Van Wyck is a crime.&rdquo;
Miss Fordyce smiled as she spoke, but there was a ring of
earnestness in her tone. &ldquo;She is a siren, and her charm is of
the sort that bowls men over before they know what they&rsquo;re
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you warned me,&rdquo; I returned;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my guard against her fatal
glances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known her a long time, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I knew her ten years ago, as a schoolgirl, but
she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the same Anne now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Fordyce,
warmheartedly, &ldquo;and I have done wrong in even seeming to
censure her. But she does lead men a dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she afraid of her husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne is afraid of nobody on earth,&mdash;well, with one
exception,&mdash;but the exception is not her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it then? You?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no! Why should she be afraid of me? But she
is afraid of Mrs. Carstairs, the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The housekeeper! How curious. Why is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But Mrs. Carstairs is really a most
peculiar person. She was housekeeper for Mr. Van Wyck before Anne
married him. Her son is Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s valet. Well, Anne
would be glad to send them both packing, mother and son, but her
husband won&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is accustomed to their ways,&mdash;and they are
both remarkably capable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why is Anne afraid of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s afraid of Carstairs. But
the mother is so queer. Anne says she has the evil eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you and Anne imagining these things?
Isn&rsquo;t it one of your &lsquo;occult&rsquo; notions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see Mrs. Carstairs. You&rsquo;ll realize at
once she&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought a housekeeper was always a portly, placid,
middle-aged woman, in a black silk dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beth Fordyce laughed, &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t guess farther
from the mark! Mrs. Carstairs is not middle-aged. Indeed, she seems
extremely young to be the mother of the valet. He must be over
twenty. Then she is very good looking, with a dark, subtle sort of
beauty. She&rsquo;s small, and slender, and she glides about so
softly, she seems to appear from nowhere. Why, there she is
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked across the room and saw Mrs. Carstairs speaking to
Anne. She wore black silk, it is true; but of modish cut and long,
graceful lines. Indeed, she seemed to have more of an air of
distinction than any of the other women present, excepting
Anne.</p>

<p>She had no touch of apology or obsequiousness in her manner, and
stood quietly talking, until she had finished her errand, and then
moved away, and left the room without embarrassment. Her selfpoise
was marvellous, and I felt a flash of regret that such a woman
should have to pursue what was after all, a menial occupation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks interesting,&rdquo; I remarked to Miss
Fordyce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; was the emphatic reply. &ldquo;Of course,
it's an open secret that she hoped to marry Mr. Van Wyck. She was
housekeeper here when he was a widower. Then, when he married Anne,
he insisted that Mrs. Carstairs should stay on, to relieve Anne of
all housekeeping boredom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Anne doesn&rsquo;t want her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit; but she can&rsquo;t persuade Mr. Van Wyck to
discharge her. The valet is most satisfactory, I believe, and the
mother and son refuse to be separated. So, they&rsquo;re both here.
But Anne is afraid of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Mrs. Carstairs hates Anne, and though
she is never openly disrespectful, she finds hundreds of little
ways to annoy her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Anne&rsquo;s step-children? How does she get along
with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, right enough. Morland adores her, and though Barbara
was offish at first, she is coming round. Anne has shown great tact
in managing Barbara, and I think they&rsquo;ll get to be
chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t yet had opportunity to converse with Barbara Van
Wyck, and under pretense of a quest of fresh tea, I led Miss
Fordyce toward the tea-table.</p>

<p>Miss Van Wyck was cordial, but not effusive, and struck me as
being what is sometimes called &ldquo;strong-minded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was a striking-looking girl, with a pale face and large dark
eyes; but she had no such charm as Anne, nor had she the gentle
softness of Beth Fordyce. She managed the tea-things with a
graceful air of being accustomed to it, and included us at once in
a conversation she was carrying on with some other callers.</p>

<p>It seemed the Van Wyck tea hour was something of an institution;
and neighbors and village people were always in greater or less
attendance.</p>

<p>The discussion was concerning a new public library in the town,
and as it was of slight interest to me, I permitted my attention to
wander about the room, and began to plan some way by which I could
unobtrusively make my way back to my hostess.</p>

<p>But just then a motor-car arrived, and a group of callers came
in through the great portals of the study. The general confusion of
introductions and greetings followed, and when it was over I
somehow found myself standing beside Mrs. Stelton, the pretty young
widow from whose toils Anne hoped to rescue Morland Van Wyck.</p>

<p>She was attractive in her way, but commonplace compared to Beth
Fordyce or Anne. She chatted pleasantly, but her conversation was
of the sort that makes a man&rsquo;s mind wander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you here for the week end, Mr. Sturgis?&rdquo; she
rattled on; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have a heavenly time! It&rsquo;s
the <em>dearest</em> place to visit. And they are all such
<em>lovely</em> people. The beautiful Mrs. Van Wyck is a
<em>perfect</em> hostess,&mdash;and Mr. Van Wyck is an old dear,
&mdash;though a bit of a curmudgeon now and then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re speaking of Mr. Morland Van Wyck?&rdquo; I
teased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>naughty</em> man! Of course not. I mean our host.
Morly isn&rsquo;t in the <em>least</em> curmudgeonish!&rdquo; She
tapped my arm with her lorgnon in a playful manner. &ldquo;As if
any one could be,&mdash;to you,&rdquo; I returned, knowing her
type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice gentleman!&rdquo; she babbled on. &ldquo;I admit I
like a compliment now and then. I&rsquo;m glad you're here.
We&rsquo;re such a pleasant house-party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that striking-looking man standing by the
window?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;We were introduced as he came in,
but I didn&rsquo;t catch his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stone,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Fleming Stone. They say
he is a detective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stone!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it really?
Detective! I should think he was! Why, he&rsquo;s probably the
greatest real detective who ever lived! What is he doing
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His home is in Crescent Falls,&rdquo; Mrs. Stelton
informed me; &ldquo;that is, his mother has recently come here to
live in the village, and he, naturally, visits her. He is staying
with her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a friend of Van Wyck&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he has never been here before. He came with Mr. and
Mrs. Davidson, Crescent Falls Village people, and I think he came
principally to see the house. This room, you know, is
famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as famous as he is,&rdquo; I said, gazing at the man
I so much admired, but had never before seen.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone was a man who would have compelled notice
anywhere, and yet his appearance was entirely quiet and
unostentatious. He was slightly above average height, of a strong,
well set up figure and a forceful expression of face. His hair was
slightly gray at the temples, and his dark, deep-set eyes gave a
strangely blended effect of unerring vision and kindly judgment.
His manner was marked by a gentle courtesy, and his personal
magnetism was apparent in every tone and gesture.</p>

<p>I longed to get away from the uninteresting widow and talk or at
least listen to Mr. Stone. As this was not possible, I suggested
that we both stroll across the room and join the group that
surrounded him.</p>

<p>Though apparently not over-anxious, Mrs. Stelton agreed to this,
and we became a part of the small circle that had formed around the
great detective.</p>

<p>Great detective I knew him to be, for his fame was world-wide,
and yet as he stood there drinking his tea with a careless grace,
he gave only the impression of a cultured society man, ready to
lend himself to the polite idle chatter of the moment</p>

<p>He was looking at Anne Van Wyck, and, though not staring, not
even gazing intently, I could see that his interest centred in
her.</p>

<p>But this was not at all astonishing. I think few men were ever
in Anne Van Wyck&rsquo;s presence without centring their interest
upon her.</p>

<p>Her slender figure was exquisitely proportioned, and her small
head, with its masses of soft dark hair, was set upon her shoulders
with a marvellous grace. Her deep gray eyes, with long, curling,
dark lashes, were full of fascination, and her small, pale face was
capable of expressing such receptiveness and such responsiveness
that one&rsquo;s eyes were drawn to it irresistibly. Anne&rsquo;s
face was mysterious&mdash;purposely so, maybe, for she was
intensely clever; but mysterious with the weird fascination of the
Sphinx.</p>

<p>And as Fleming Stone&rsquo;s own deep eyes met those of Anne Van
Wyck, in a glance that caught and held, it seemed as if two similar
natures experienced a mutual recognition.</p>

<p>I may have been over-fanciful, but I looked upon Fleming Stone
as almost superhuman; and though, before my arrival at Buttonwood
Terrace, I had felt no special personal interest in Mrs. David Van
Wyck, I was now conscious of a dawning realization that the Anne
Mansfield I used to know had grown to a wonderful woman.</p>

<p>It was part of Anne&rsquo;s beautiful tact, that she made no
reference to Fleming Stone&rsquo;s profession or to his
celebrity.</p>

<p>She smiled graciously and opened the conversation with a bit of
banter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a great pleasure to welcome you under our
roof-tree, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;but it is also
a surprise. For, I am told, you are a confirmed
woman-hater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;woman-haters&rsquo; always confirmed,
Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo; he parried; &ldquo;I never heard of one that
wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Anne, laughing at the quip; &ldquo;but
you evade my question. Do you hate all women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Stone; &ldquo;I do not. But if I did, I
should say I did not,&mdash;out of common politeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How baffling!&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;Now I can form no
idea of your attitude toward our sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve no reason to conceal that,&rdquo; said
Stone, lightly. &ldquo;It is merely the attitude of civilized man
toward civilized woman. Taken collectively, women are delightful.
But any one of them alone, nearly scares me out of my
wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try it!&rdquo; said Anne, with a daring
sweep of her long lashes, as she half closed her eyes, and looked
at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to try. I admit I&rsquo;m afraid
of you already. I&rsquo;m afraid of any woman. One never knows what
they mean by what they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They rarely know that, themselves,&rdquo; Anne flung back
at him; and Condon Archer, who stood near, added, &ldquo;Or if they
do, they know wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are cryptic utterances,&rdquo; I put in,
laughingly. &ldquo;Are you good people sure you know what
you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sure we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Anne, gaily,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s just as good. But if we&rsquo;re really
achieving cryptic remarks, we&rsquo;ll refer them to Beth. She
knows all about crypticism,&mdash;or whatever you call
it,&mdash;and mysticism, and occultism &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good gracious, Anne, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Miss
Fordyce. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind people who understand, talking
about those things; but you are not only ignorant but intolerant of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, girlie,&rdquo; said Anne, smiling at Miss
Fordyce, &ldquo;I love you, and so I love all those crazy notions
of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Stone understands,&rdquo; Beth Fordyce
went on, looking at him with earnest eyes.</p>

<p>It may have been my imagination, but it seemed to me that
Fleming Stone had to wrench his attention away from Anne by force,
and compel himself to reply to Miss Fordyce&rsquo;s remark.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="III" id="III"></a>Chapter
III<br>
All About A Fan</strong>
</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure I understand what, Miss Fordyce?&rdquo; he
asked; &ldquo;I assure you my understanding is not
limitless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, understand clairvoyance, and all that sort of thing.
You must, you know, with all your wonderful detective ability.
Please tell us all about yourself, won&rsquo;t you? I never saw a
real detective before, and they&rsquo;re awfully different from
what I imagined! I thought they were
more&mdash;more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unwashed,&rdquo; put in Archer bluntly. &ldquo;I am not
myself acquainted with many of them, but those I have met are not
in Mr. Stone&rsquo;s class socially, by any means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not in his class professionally,
either,&rdquo; I declared, anxious to have Fleming Stone aware of
my appreciation of his genius. &ldquo;Mr. Stone is in a class by
himself. His work is art, that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, but in the smile he
gave me there was a slight tinge of that boredness that masters
always feel at compliments from tyros. &ldquo;My art, as you call
it, is my life,&rdquo; he went on, simply. &ldquo;I do not study
it, I simply practise it as it comes along. And, after all, any
success I may have had is merely the rational outcome of logical
observation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t depreciate yourself, Mr. Stone,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Stelton, shaking a silly finger at him. &ldquo;You know
you are the greatest detective ever&mdash;Mr. Sturgis told me so.
And now you must, you simply <em>must</em>, tell us just how you do
it, and give us an example. Here, take my fan, and deduce my whole
mental calibre from it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Fleming Stone looked at the speaker pleasantly, I was
convinced that he felt, as I did, that it would be perfectly easy
to deduce the lady&rsquo;s mental calibre without the assistance of
her lace fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do! What fun!&rdquo; exclaimed Morland Van Wyck, who
was standing at the elbow of the fair widow who had enslaved
him.</p>

<p>Before Fleming Stone could reply, Anne spoke. &ldquo;That
wouldn&rsquo;t be a fair test,&rdquo; she said, flashing a smile at
Stone; and then her eyes curiously deepened with earnestness as she
went on: &ldquo;But I do wish, Mr. Stone, that you would do
something like that for us. I have heard that you can tell all
about any one, just from seeing some article that they have
used.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not a difficult thing to do, Mrs. Van
Wyck,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;You yourself could probably gather
a great deal of information from any personal belonging of a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned Anne gaily; &ldquo;if I saw a
thimble, I might deduce a sewing-woman; or a pipe, a man who
smoked. But I don&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;I mean the sort of thing
you do. Please give us an example.&rdquo; I fairly cringed at the
thought of Fleming Stone being stood up to do parlor tricks, like a
society circus; and so incensed was I that the line,
&ldquo;Butchered to make a Roman holiday,&rdquo; vaguely passed
through my mind. But as I saw Anne&rsquo;s vivid, glowing face and
her entreating eyes, I felt sure that no man on earth could deny
her anything.</p>

<p>Stone appeared to take it casually. &ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Van
Wyck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if it will please you. I have never
done such a thing, except in the interests of my work, but if you
will give me a personal belonging of some one unknown to me, I will
repeat to you whatever it may tell me concerning its
owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Beth Fordyce had said nothing during this latter
conversation, I think she had never once moved her eyes from
Stone&rsquo;s face. Her large and light blue eyes looked at him
with an absorbed gaze, and she spoke, tranquilly, but with a
positive air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will provide the article,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
have with me just the very thing. Excuse me, I will get it.&rdquo;
She glided away&mdash;for no other verb of motion expresses her
peculiar walk&mdash;and disappeared through the door that led into
the main part of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stelton, clasping her hands
in delight. &ldquo;And then, Mr. Stone, will you tell us how you
catch robbers by their foot-prints?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, madam,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;robbers are rarely
considerate enough to leave their foot-prints for my benefit. I
know they have the reputation of doing so, but they are sadly
remiss in the matter, and show a surprising negligence of their
duty to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sort of criminal negligence,&rdquo; murmured Archer,
and Stone grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p>Miss Fordyce returned, and as she crossed the room, her pale
green gown trailing, she came towards Stone with a rapt
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can help you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I can
evolve a mental picture of my friend, and project it to your mind
by will-power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t trouble to do that, Miss Fordyce,&rdquo;
said Stone, unable to keep a quizzical smile entirely suppressed.
&ldquo;You force me to confess that I have no knowledge of the
occult, and depend entirely upon my own very practical common-sense
and logic. What have you brought me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fan,&rdquo; answered Miss Fordyce, handing him one.
&ldquo;When I came up in the train this afternoon, a friend was
with me during part of the journey. She lent me this fan, and I
carelessly forgot to return it. As I know my friend very well, and
you do not know her at all, it is a fair test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Anne Van Wyck, her intense eyes
darkening with interest. &ldquo;Beth, that is just the thing. Now,
Mr. Stone, tell us of the fan&rsquo;s owner.&rdquo; In her
interest, Anne had moved nearer to Stone, and was breathlessly
awaiting his words. The magnetic fascination of the woman is
indescribable. I am positive that nothing on earth would have
induced Fleming Stone to such an exhibition of his special powers
of deduction, except Anne&rsquo;s compelling desire that he
should.</p>

<p>I saw, too, though it was almost imperceptible, the effort Stone
was obliged to make to detach his attention from her and
concentrate it on the fan he was holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To approach this matter in my usual way,&rdquo; he said
quietly, &ldquo;I shall have to ask permission to examine this fan
under a magnifying glass. Have you one at hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is one,&rdquo; said Morland, bringing a fine one
from his father&rsquo;s desk, at which action I fancied I saw a
shade of annoyance pass over David Van Wyck&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>For a few moments, Fleming Stone examined the fan through the
glass.</p>

<p>In idle curiosity I looked at the faces of those grouped about.
Mr. Van Wyck was clearly annoyed at the whole performance; though
Morland, under the influence of Mrs. Stelton, waited in delighted
anticipation. Condron Archer looked supercilious and even murmured
to me that he doubted the detective&rsquo;s powers in such a test.
Miss Fordyce wore the exalted air usual to people who affect the
mystic. But Anne, the centre of the group, was surely enough to
inspire Stone&rsquo;s latent powers to the utmost. She waited with
a suppressed eagerness that seemed to show implicit faith in the
result, and she even touched the fan as she too scanned it for any
enlightening details.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone returned the glass to Morland and the fan to Miss
Fordyce. But it was Anne whom he addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fan,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet, narrative way,
&ldquo;belongs to a lady with dark hair and eyes and rosy cheeks,
and a very perfect set of small, white teeth. She is healthy and
rather robust, of a vigorous but not an athletic type. She is
strong of muscle, but of rather a nervous temperament. She is
thrifty and economical by nature, but proud and fastidious. Usually
of decorous habits, but likes occasionally a gayer experience. She
is refined in her personal tastes and artistic in dressing, though
fond of bright colors. She is kind and generous-hearted, unmarried,
and past her first youth. She lives in or near the West Eighties in
New York City, and her telephone number has recently been changed
to 9863 Schuyler. She is fond of embroidering with colored silks,
she possesses a gown decorated with black spangled trimming, and
she wears a very heavy ring on the little finger of her right
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stone finished as quietly as he had begun, but his listeners
were more excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; Mrs. Stelton
was saying, and of course Morland agreed with her.</p>

<p>But Beth Fordyce was speaking, almost as if in a trance.
&ldquo;It is every word true,&rdquo; she said, with a far-away look
in her eyes. &ldquo;If you had known Leila, you could not have
described her more perfectly! Don&rsquo;t try to make me believe
you are not occult! You are positively clairvoyant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Beth,&rdquo; said Anne impatiently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such rubbish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;occultism isn&rsquo;t in it
with this kind of work. Mr. Stone, that is the real thing. Are you
going to tell your processes of reasoning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he is!&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;That will be
the delightful part of it. David, did you ever hear anything like
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Anne turned her lovely flushed face toward her husband,
she received no answering smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t interest me,&rdquo; he said coldly, and
it is a tribute to Anne&rsquo;s tact and cleverness that she
quickly covered this awkward speech by turning to Stone, saying
with utmost charm of manner, &ldquo;Tell me all about it at once. I
can&rsquo;t wait another minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo; said Stone, seeming to
address her only, &ldquo;I am very glad to explain, if it interests
you. You see, it&rsquo;s very simple, for this fan has been used a
good deal and naturally bears the impress of the lady who has used
it. To begin with, it is a souvenir fan that was given to the lady
when she dined in the restaurant of one of the large hotels in New
York. It is of the inexpensive paper sort that is used for that
purpose. But the name of the restaurant has been carefully
scratched out, showing that the lady desired to keep and use it,
but did not care to have her friends know where she obtained it.
This shows that the lady is not amply provided with fans, and shows
too that she does not often frequent the gay restaurants. The fan
is bright scarlet and gold, and, since she liked it well enough to
keep it, I assume that it suited her brunette coloring, and also
that she is fond of bright hues.</p>

<p>She is nervous, because the fan shows that she has often picked
at it&mdash;both its edge and its tassel&mdash;and has even
frequently bitten it with her small, sharp teeth. You see, these
lacquered sticks show clearly all marks and scratches, and this bar
of metal that holds the tassel is much bent, showing a vigorous and
healthy type. The fact that the fan has been used a great deal
shows a robust and rosy-cheeked young woman, though not athletic,
for athletic girls never use a fan. She is refined and fastidious
in her tastes, for I notice a faint perfume of orris and violet.
She is generous, for she gave away a fan that she found useful. And
I think neither a very young girl nor a married lady would so long
preserve a fan of this sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you know where she lives?&rdquo; demanded
Miss Fordyce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That argues a lack of observation on your part,&rdquo;
said Stone, smiling. &ldquo;On this light corner of the fan is
written, though faintly, &lsquo;New No. 9863 Schuyler.&rsquo; The
people living in the vicinity of West Eighty-Third Street have
recently had a change in their telephone-numbers; and when she
noted a new number on her fan, I assumed it to be her
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Miss Fordyce. &ldquo;But how did you
know about her spangled dress and that curious ring she
wears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ring left a decided impression on the outer sticks of
the fan near the end, in such a position that it could come only
from the abrasion of a heavy ring worn on the little finger. Then,
you see this tassel, as is usual on this sort of a fan, is of fine
silk floss. It is much fluffed and tangled, and has a tendency to
catch anything it may. In it I find a portion of a small black
spangle, and two or three threads of fine embroidery floss, pink
and green. Surely it is easy to infer that the lady uses embroidery
silks frequently, and that the spangle is from one of her
gowns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so casually!&rdquo; cried Anne, with
an imperious nod at him. &ldquo;You shall not so belittle your
great powers. Supposing it is only logic and careful observation,
no one else could do it! That fan could not have spoken to one of
us, because our logic cannot understand its language. Mr. Stone, I
thank you for doing that I know you didn&rsquo;t want
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my custom to deduce for social
entertainments,&rdquo; said Stone, smiling at her; &ldquo;but it is
my custom to accede to the wishes of my hostess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that, then;&rdquo; and Anne smiled back at
him. &ldquo;Now, as a small return favor, may I show you over the
house? Mrs. Davidson tells me you want to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m interested. I understand it is very old
and was built by an eccentric.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was; though we bought it from its second owner.
Mr. Sturgis, will you go with us?&rdquo; I was glad to accept the
invitation, and as we started we were joined by Miss Fordyce and
Archer, and also by Mrs. Stelton and Morland Van Wyck.</p>

<p>So it was quite a party which followed Anne through the doorway
in the corner.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a corridor that ran along the south side
of the house. We passed a branch corridor bearing to the right, but
Anne laughingly remarked that those were the apartments of herself
and her husband, and we might not enter. We went on into a
beautiful music-room, through stately reception and drawing-rooms,
and into a delightful library. There were billiard and
smoking-rooms near by, and through the dining-room and sunny
breakfast-room we passed out to the terrace and down into the
gardens. I thought Stone seemed disappointed that, though the house
was old, it gave no hint of secret passages or dark staircases. No
dungeons or anything that savored of mystery or crime. I chanced to
be walking by his side, and I rallied him on this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;From what I had
heard of the house, I had fancied it more complicated in structure.
It is very four-square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said I, as we looked at it from across
the wide expanse of lawn and garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious construction, though,&rdquo; mused Stone,
&ldquo;and yet perfectly simple: one large rectangle, with smaller
rectangles attached at its two back corners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually wings are built entirely across the ends,&rdquo;
I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course it was done to get the advantage of light.
Wings at the ends would have darkened many of the rooms; but
attached so, at the corners, there are windows all round each part
of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true, and, as I now recollected, every room was flooded
with daylight</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must join my hostess now,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;and
make my adieux. I am leaving to-night for Kansas City, where
I&rsquo;m about to investigate a most important case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I longed to ask him about it, but I didn&rsquo;t feel privileged
to do so. I did, however, express my pleasure in knowing him, and
hoped that we might meet again. He very courteously gave me his
card, bearing an address that he said would always reach him; an
attention that I prized highly, though it might never fulfil its
purpose.</p>

<p>We all returned to the study, and after the departure of the
Davidsons and their distinguished friend, the talk naturally turned
to Fleming Stone and his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncanny, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo;
declared Mr. Van Wyck, &ldquo;and it gives me the fidgets to have
the man around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that way, too,&rdquo; said Connie Archer.
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m perfectly sure that he could see straight
through my coat into my pocket and read a letter there that I
wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody know about&mdash;not
anybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it one I wrote you?&rdquo; asked Anne, so roguishly
that it was most apparent fooling, but her husband looked up and
scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Archer, with a most obvious intent
of teasing his host; &ldquo;that last delightful missive of
yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, David Van Wyck frowned angrily, and Anne said,
&ldquo;Nonsense, Connie, such jokes aren&rsquo;t funny. What is the
letter about, really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tailor&rsquo;s dun,&rdquo; said Archer,
taking his cue; &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t have Stone know it for
anything. I expect he pays his bills before they&rsquo;re
due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does,&rdquo; said Morland: &ldquo;deduces
the exact amount they&rsquo;re going to be, and sends off a check
without seeing &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t ask him here again, Anne,&rdquo; said
her husband. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come again very soon,&rdquo; I
volunteered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off to-night for Kansas
City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good thing, too,&rdquo; growled Mr. Van Wyck. &ldquo;And
now you people may seek some other pasture. I expect some callers
to-night, and I want to get this place into some semblance of a
gentleman&rsquo;s study, instead of a picnic ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, David,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;are they coming
to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are. My mind is made up, Anne, and I&rsquo;d
rather you wouldn&rsquo;t refer to. the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage!&rdquo; said Morland, under his
breath. He spoke to Anne, but his father heard it, and said,
&ldquo;None of that, boy! I suppose I have a right to do as I
choose with my own! And if you know when you&rsquo;re well off,
you&rsquo;ll accept the situation gracefully. It&rsquo;ll be better
for you in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland turned away, looking obstinate and sullen. I had no idea
what it was all about, but when I looked at Anne her face was so
tragic in its utter despair that I was startled. Surely I had been
right in thinking her light-hearted manner was a cloak for some
desperate, heart-breaking trouble. But in obedience to Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s command, we all left the study. It was not quite time
to dress for dinner, so we strolled out through the great doors
onto the terrace; and even as we left, the footmen were already
clearing away the tea-things.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
The Decision Of David Van Wyck</strong>
</h3>

<p>From a certain terrace-landing which Anne called her
&ldquo;Sunset View,&rdquo; we watched the last glowing clouds dull
and darken in the west.</p>

<p>A sort of depression had fallen on the party, because&mdash;as
was perfectly evident&mdash;of Anne&rsquo;s mood. She was distrait
and preoccupied; though now and then her dark eyes flashed with
what was unmistakably anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, Anne dear?&rdquo; said Archer,
who let himself go a little when Mr. Van Wyck wasn&rsquo;t
present.</p>

<p>Instead of evading or parrying his question, Anne spoke out
frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;David is
going to give away all his fortune. He&rsquo;s going to build and
endow a magnificent library for Crescent Falls Village&mdash;a
library out of all proportion to a tiny little place like
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All his fortune!&rdquo; I exclaimed, astounded.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean that, Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do mean just that! He calls it
philanthropy&mdash;that&rsquo;s his fad this year. If he were
really philanthropic, it would be different; but he has become
deeply absorbed in this ridiculous hobby for no reason at all
except that he&rsquo;s always dashing into some new and crazy
scheme. And he&rsquo;s so determined; he&rsquo;ll give away all his
money, and then afterward he&rsquo;ll be sorry, but he can&rsquo;t
get it back. He has had fads and foibles before, but though
sometimes they were trying, they never involved such an amount of
money as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Anne,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t mean
that he&rsquo;s going to give away all his money! How will he
provide for you and his two children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says I&rsquo;ve got to strike out for myself,&rdquo;
growled Morland, who had been listening moodily, as with his hands
in his pockets he leaned against the terrace-rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s going to give nearly a million to the
library,&rdquo; said Anne despondently; &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
just about all he possesses. He says it&rsquo;s right to practise
philanthropy and give away one&rsquo;s fortune while one&rsquo;s
alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other good and great men have pursued that same
plan,&rdquo; said Beth Fordyce, with one of her exalted looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up Barbara Van Wyck angrily; &ldquo;but
the other good and great men had many millions to start with.
Father&rsquo;s going to give away all he has, except just enough
for us to live on in a very small way. It isn&rsquo;t fair to us,
and he has no right to do it, but he is simply immovable in the
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as Anne does,&rdquo; said Archer seriously.
&ldquo;If it were real, true philanthropy, it would be a noble
deed; but I know Mr. Van Wyck, and he is always rushing suddenly
and madly into some new project, which he as quickly abandons and
regrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Connie,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;if there were only a
hope of his abandoning this! But when he regrets it, it will be too
late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the committee-men are coming to-night, for the final
acceptance of the deed of gift, or whatever you call it,&rdquo;
said Barbara, in a tone of blended rage and despair.</p>

<p>I had thought Barbara Van Wyck was colorless, but in the
intensity of her feelings her eyes flashed and the red rose to her
pale cheeks until she looked like a veritable avenging angel. I
hadn&rsquo;t known she possessed so much energy, and I turned to
her, saying hopefully, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you persuade your father,
at least, to delay it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve tried every argument I know of, and so
have Morland and Anne. If Anne can&rsquo;t persuade him, nobody
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though this praise was grudgingly given, it was unmistakably
earnest; and it was clear to be seen that, though Anne and her
step-children were not congenial, and not even friendly, they had
common cause in this impending catastrophe.</p>

<p>And I could not blame them. Such ill-advised and misplaced
generosity was absurd, and seemed to me to argue Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s mind somewhat unbalanced. But as a comparative
stranger, I didn&rsquo;t like to offer suggestions, or even comment
very emphatically.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stelton, however, felt no such restraint. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
outrageous!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s contemptible! I
never heard of such a performance! If I were you, Morland, I should
have my father adjudged insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is insane on that subject,&rdquo; muttered Morland;
&ldquo;but what can I do about it? If you knew my father as I do,
you&rsquo;d know that, insane or not, he will have his own
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will,&rdquo; said Anne, sighing, and looking so
adorably pathetic that it didn&rsquo;t seem possible any one could
disappoint her as Van Wyck proposed to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he listen to you, Anne?&rdquo; I asked.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he care for your comfort and
happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne, and though she looked the picture
of utter hopelessness, she showed also a cool reserve that warned
me not to intrude too far upon her personal affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he cares for Anne,&rdquo; broke in Archer;
&ldquo;but I tell you, he&rsquo;s out of his head! He doesn&rsquo;t
know what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t out of his head, Connie,&rdquo; returned
Anne gently, &ldquo;and he does know what he&rsquo;s doing.
I&rsquo;m going to try once more, before the committee comes, to
make him change his mind, but I haven&rsquo;t much hope. Come,
people, we must go and dress for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer threw discretion to the winds and gazed frankly at Anne,
as he said, &ldquo;How can he refuse you anything? No man could, I
know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne, though her color rose a little, didn&rsquo;t even glance
at Archer, but, turning to me, walked by my side toward the house,
chatting lightly on trivial subjects.</p>

<p>Later, as we gathered around the dinner-table, one could
scarcely believe there was such an undercurrent of trouble among
the Van Wycks. Our host was unusually bland and affable, Barbara
was placid, and Morland was the debonair man of the world that
society requires.</p>

<p>As to Anne, she was a marvel. In a dinner gown of pale yellow
satin, which suited especially well her exquisite coloring, her
wonderful hair coiled low, and her great eyes shining, she seemed
animated by some unusual energy. She was roguish and dictatorial by
turns. She was dignified one moment and softly pathetic the next. I
couldn&rsquo;t make her out. Either she had persuaded her husband
to abandon his plan, or the matter was still undecided. At any
rate, she could not have tried and failed, and still have shown
this vivacity.</p>

<p>But I did not yet know my Anne. I sat next her, and dinner was
not half over before she confided to me the news of her total
failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only did David refuse to listen to me,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but he forbade me to speak to him again on the
subject; and he spoke to me in such a way and in such language that
I can never forgive him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne!&rdquo; I exclaimed, for, though smiling, her smile
was assumed for the others&rsquo; benefit; and her low tones, heard
only by me, were full of bitterness and desperate grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; I murmured involuntarily, &ldquo;let me help
you. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;No one can help
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the pathos of the situation, perhaps it was her
marvellous beauty, enhanced by the dramatic moment, or perhaps it
was inevitable, but I fell in love with Anne Van Wyck then and
there. Or, rather, it was an awakening to the fact that I had
always loved her, even when we were school time friends. Naturally,
I had sufficient self-control not to disclose this secret even by a
glance, but repeated in carefully modulated tones my desire and
willingness to help her, if possible; and then, with an effort, I
turned to talk to my neighbor on the other side. It proved to be
Beth Fordyce, and her pale blue eyes lighted as she began to talk
eagerly to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us make a pact, Mr. Sturgis,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I, too, want to help Anne, and surely together we can do
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite evident that she had overheard my words, and this
annoyed me; and I answered that, with all the willingness in the
world, I failed to see how Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s guests could do
anything in this matter. She took the hint, and changed the
subject, but almost immediately after Mrs. Stelton&rsquo;s shrill
voice was heard addressing the table at large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re perfectly horrid, Mr. Van
Wyck!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shaking a beringed hand at him.
&ldquo;To give away all that lovely money that ought to belong to
Anne and Barbie and Mr. Morland!&rdquo; The last name was
accompanied by a coquettish glance in Morland&rsquo;s direction,
but she went on, addressing her host: &ldquo;Why, if a husband of
mine did that, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d shut him up on bread and
water for a week!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he would enjoy the rest, Mrs. Stelton,&rdquo;
said Van Wyck, gazing at her blandly. The man had a way of saying
these things, which, though rude, was rather enjoyable to
disinterested hearers.</p>

<p>Good-natured Mrs. Stelton laughed. &ldquo;Oh, what
waggery!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But if it brought him to his
senses, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;ve a notion to shut you up
for a week, Mr. Van Wyck, and let you think this matter
over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I always enjoy your witty chat, my dear Mrs.
Stelton, I must beg of you to drop this subject;&rdquo; and this
time Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s air of finality brought us a respite from
Mrs. Stelton&rsquo;s silly observations. But Morland gave one
parting shaft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do this thing, Dad,&rdquo; he growled,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be mighty sorry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence fell. It was not so much what Morland said, but the
quiet intensity of his tone, which seemed to convey a definite
threat. Indeed, his father must have felt it, for he looked up
quickly at his son; but he only said sarcastically, &ldquo;I thank
you for your warning,&rdquo; and then the subject really was
dropped.</p>

<p>Anne resumed her gayety, though I now knew for a certainty it
was all a pretense. Con Archer nobly helped her out, and chatted
lightly and gracefully. Barbara continued to sulk in silence, but
all the rest rose to the occasion, and only appropriate
dinner-table talk was heard.</p>

<p>Coffee was served in the drawing-room for the ladies, while the
men remained at table.</p>

<p>Perhaps from a sense of duty, Archer made one more effort</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Van Wyck,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I know
it&rsquo;s none of my business, but mayn&rsquo;t I suggest as man
to man, that you think this matter over a bit longer before making
your decision? You know, to a disinterested observer, the gift you
propose to make seems out of all proportion to its object; and I
can&rsquo;t help thinking that on second thoughts you would agree
to this yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Archer,&rdquo; said Van Wyck coldly, &ldquo;the only
one of your remarks to which I agree is your first one: that it is
none of your business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Condron Archer flushed, but as David Van Wyck&rsquo;s guests
were not unusued to his scathing speeches, this one was not openly
resented; and Archer said nothing further.</p>

<p>And then, seemingly unable to control himself, Morland blurted
out, &ldquo;I say, Dad, you just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and the elder Van Wyck raised his
eyebrows at his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <em>can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</em> Morland went on, blindly
angry now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heathenish! It&rsquo;s a crime against
your wife and daughter, to say nothing of me. I tell you, you
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>David Van Wyck&rsquo;s clear, cutting tones fell like icicles:
&ldquo;If you will be present, Morland, at the meeting this
evening, I shall take pleasure in showing you that I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;ll be there!&rdquo; and Morland looked
almost like a belligerent boy as he met the cold stare of his
father&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you accept my invitation; and now shall we
join the ladies?&rdquo; Rising from the table, we crossed the hall
to the drawing-room; and perhaps four angrier men never wore the
smiling mask of politeness.</p>

<p>Anne, seated in a carved, high-backed chair, made an exquisite
picture, and she turned her beautiful, appealing eyes to her
husband as he entered. David Van Wyck crossed the room straight to
her. Placing his hands on the two carved griffins&rsquo; heads that
formed the arms of the chair, he leaned over the beautiful face
upturned to his, and whispered a few words in Anne&rsquo;s ear.
Then he lightly kissed her on the cheek, and, without a word to any
one else, strolled out of the room toward the study.</p>

<p>What he said to her nobody knew, but Anne turned deathly white,
and grasped the carved chair-arms as if in extremest agony.</p>

<p>I was uncertain whether to notice this and go to her assistance,
or whether to keep up the farce of gay conversation in an endeavor
to cover her agitation.</p>

<p>Morland gave his step-mother one glance, clenched his teeth,
and, muttering, &ldquo;Brute!&rdquo; strode off after his
father.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Archer drew a chair to Anne&rsquo;s side,
and, sitting down, took her hand in his.</p>

<p>But he erred, for Anne drew away her hand with a freezing
dignity, and, rising, came over and sat by Mrs. Stelton.</p>

<p>And then I was surprised by another of Anne&rsquo;s absolutely
inexplicable changes of mood. &ldquo;What a heavenly brooch!&rdquo;
she said, smiling at Mrs. Stelton. &ldquo;Florentine work,
isn&rsquo;t it? I perfectly adore those things! I have one
something like it, but a more conventional design. Don&rsquo;t you
just love to buy things in Florence, or in Naples, or indeed any
part of Italy? Italy is <em>lovely</em>, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Stelton stared at this flow of insane talk, and I suddenly
wondered if Anne were hysterical. I saw Archer move as if to
approach her and then turn on his heel again, doubtless fearing
rebuff. So I dared to venture, myself. &ldquo;Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you come with me for a little walk on
the terrace? I&rsquo;m sure the cool air will be
refreshing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Anne simply, and she went with me
at once, draping the long train of her gown over her arm as we
passed through the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; she said, a little wearily, as
we stepped out onto the terrace. &ldquo;How did you know I wanted
to get away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stifled an impulse to tell her that love helped me to read her
thoughts, and said quietly, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re troubled
about that plan of your husband&rsquo;s, but let us hope for the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no longer room for hope,&rdquo; she said dully.
&ldquo;Come, let us look in at the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I followed her along the terrace to the windows of the
great study. We could easily look in, and the deep colors of the
stained glass prevented our being seen by those inside. And, any
way, there was surely no harm in it. We saw Mr. Van Wyck and
Morland, and three other men, who doubtless represented the
committee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Anne musingly; &ldquo;there they
are. Mr. Millar, Mr. Brandt, and Mr. Garson. I do not blame them.
Of course, if David offers them this money, they&rsquo;d be foolish
not to take it. Mr. Brandt is the only one who has really
over-urged in the matter. In fact, he suggested it to David first.
Oh, Raymond, isn&rsquo;t it too bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had called me by my first name, and I
felt a thrill that blotted out all thought of Van Wyck or his
money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m selfish or ungenerous. If David were honestly
a philanthropist, or if I weren&rsquo;t so sure that he&rsquo;d
regret this later, as he does all his erratic impulses, I&rsquo;d
feel different about it. But you see how it is, don&rsquo;t you,
Raymond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anne, I see how it is.&rdquo; And though I spoke
quietly, my heart was in a tumult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Morland is getting
angry! He is quarrelling with his father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Morland can
never get the better of that man. His father will not mind anything
he says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was evident that Morland had said something that his
father did mind, for the elder man&rsquo;s temper was roused, and
the two were certainly in deadly earnest. We could hear no word
that was spoken, but the three visitors looked appalled, and were
evidently trying to pacify the combatants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come away, Anne,&rdquo; I said, sick at heart over the
whole matter. &ldquo;You can do nothing&mdash;why torture yourself
by looking on? Let me tell you what I brought you for a
gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, but without interest I led her
back across the terrace, as I told her of a beautiful piece of
Venetian glass that I had brought for her. It was a gem, rare and
valuable, but I would not have lauded it as I did except in an
endeavor to distract her mind from the sight she had just seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; she asked, at last, faintly
interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it to a footman when I came,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he will have given it to my maid, and it will be in
my room,&rdquo; she said; then, hesitatingly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
think it strange, will you, if&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t tell David
that you gave it to me? He is&mdash;he is peculiar, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealous, you mean,&rdquo; I said, laughing. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, and, truly, I&rsquo;m glad of the fact
that I can make him jealous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure that Anne heard this, so preoccupied was
she with her own thoughts. We returned to the drawing-room, but it
was not long before we all went to our rooms.</p>

<p>Anne bade me good-night on the stair-landing. &ldquo;David and
Morland are still shut up with that committee,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;and I am going at once in search of the gift you brought me.
I know I shall love it &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the sake of the giver,&rdquo; I interrupted, with a
gay foolery that sounded as if I didn&rsquo;t mean it; but I
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Anne saucily. &ldquo;I shall love
it only for its beauty and intrinsic worth. And if it&rsquo;s
Venetian glass, it must have both. I hope to goodness it
isn&rsquo;t smashed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not; I had it packed carefully. Goodnight,
Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said, her long lashes sweeping her
cheeks; and then added, as an afterthought,
&ldquo;Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as she disappeared, I wondered whether she had spoken my
name from pure coquetry, or&mdash;what?</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="V" id="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
The Crime In The Study</strong>
</h3>

<p>There are few things, to my mind, more delightful than being
wakened soon after daybreak, on a perfect spring morning, by the
songs of birds.</p>

<p>As I was thus brought to my senses, it took me a moment to
realize just where I was, but a glance from my window reminded
me.</p>

<p>I sprang up and threw aside the curtains, and revelled in the
flowery breath of the morning air. Again, the view enchanted me.
The distant hills, the nearer rolling fields and bits of woods, and
closer yet, the wonderful park that surrounded the home of the Van
Wycks.</p>

<p>Surely, I thought, Anne Mansfield was justified in marrying for
a home, when one considered the home.</p>

<p>And that that was Anne&rsquo;s reason for accepting David Van
Wyck, I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt. Anne had been
uncomfortably poor, as a girl, and I knew how she had always craved
luxurious surroundings.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t for a moment believe she loved her husband. But I
knew her well enough to be sure that her sense of honor and loyalty
would keep her a true and devoted wife to him. If she flirted with
Archer,&mdash;if she even coquetted with me,&mdash;it was only the
natural amusement of a beautiful woman, who was frankly fond of
admiration.</p>

<p>And thus I made excuses for her, as I stood looking out of my
East window, and the sun grew more and more dazzling in its early
morning splendor.</p>

<p>Beneath me spread the beautiful lawn, that would have done
credit to an English ancestral castle. Here and there, I saw a
gardener or other servant moving about, and I concluded the place
was under good discipline. I looked backward to the East wing.
Since I had been inside the study, I could judge better of its
noble proportions and impressive lines. Yet, it looked forbidding.
Not exactly sinister, but grim and rather awesome.</p>

<p>The long, narrow windows gave it a gloomy air, and as there was
no entrance visible from where I looked, it seemed almost like a
prison.</p>

<p>Ivy trailed over its casements, and the birds flew in and out of
the vines, twittering.</p>

<p>It was really too early to dress and go downstairs, but I
suddenly became possessed of a wild hope that Anne might be in the
habit of strolling in the gardens before breakfast. I had not the
least reason to suppose this, but a strange impatience urged me to
go down and see. So, completing a leisurely toilet, I went
downstairs, and through the great hall to the front door. A
parlor-maid, who was dusting about, opened the door for me, and
though I thought an expression of surprise showed for a moment on
her face, she quickly suppressed it.</p>

<p>I stepped out into the beautiful morning, with a feeling of
gladness that I had come down, even if I were doomed to solitude. I
saw no sign of Anne, nor of any one else, save a few caretakers,
and I started off for a long ramble through the grounds. Their
interest and beauty well repaid me, and as I returned toward the
house, I sat down upon a stone seat overlooking a picturesque
ravine. Not far away, I could see the stables and garage, but there
was no one stirring in their vicinity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late risers, here,&rdquo; I thought to myself, surprised
that the stablemen should not yet be about.</p>

<p>And then I saw a woman peering in at the window of one of the
buildings. My heart gave a leap, hoping that it might be Anne, but
it was not. I saw, in a moment, that it was the housekeeper, Mrs.
Carstairs.</p>

<p>She wore a smart white linen morning gown, so trig of appearance
that she looked like some Parisienne dressed for an outing. The
skirt was short, showing dainty white shoes and stockings, and
altogether, she looked as little like an English housekeeper as
could be imagined.</p>

<p>And then I recollected, no one had told me she was English. The
valet had been called so, and doubtless his father was an
Englishman, but this mysterious mother of his was certainly French,
or I never saw a Frenchwoman. Then my musing concerning her
nationality gave way to an interest in her present
occupation,&mdash;for, surely, she was acting strangely.</p>

<p>She went round the garage, peering in at each window; now and
then casting furtive glances, as if in fear of being observed. She
could not see me, as I was hidden by some foliage plants. Then,
leaving the garage, she walked back along the driveway toward the
house, her eyes on the ground, as if looking for something.</p>

<p>Natural chivalry prompting me to assist her, I rose and walked
rapidly toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I help in your search, Mrs. Carstairs?&rdquo; I said,
in my most Chesterfieldian tones.</p>

<p>Apparently she had not heard my approach, for she turned as if
greatly startled, and said, fairly gasping for breath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;oh; I thought you were&mdash;you&mdash;were
someone else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m myself,&rdquo; I said, smiling, for we had
met, for a few moments the evening before, and I was not at all
unwilling to speak to her again. &ldquo;Have you lost
something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only my self-possession,&rdquo; she returned, with such
apt repartee, that I said, impulsively, &ldquo;You <em>are</em>
French, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; she replied, looking at me in surprise at
my evident interest in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t lost anything else,&mdash;not so
easily replaced?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught my allusion and smiled; then, as if recollecting
herself, she assumed a severely correct manner, and said:
&ldquo;No, thank you. I have lost nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve been studying the ground all the way
from the garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned on me like a fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with flashing
eyes. &ldquo;How dare you say so? Why should I study the
ground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a
crime to study the ground, is it? Why shouldn&rsquo;t you, if you
choose to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> choose to! I have no interest in
the ground. I was&mdash;I was looking at the sky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t contradict you,&rdquo; I said, politely,
though aghast at this whopper. &ldquo;Have you perhaps lost
something in the sky, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; a couple of Pleiads,&rdquo; she replied, with an
irrepressible laugh, and I marvelled afresh to hear a housekeeper
talk in this strain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly destined to get no &lsquo;Lost and Found
Information,&rsquo; &rdquo; I said, though uncertain as to whether
I ought to talk to her in this companionable way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you out for information this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm really out to see if the Poets sing true about the
delights of early rising. But I&rsquo;m always glad to absorb
information if it comes in my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want it on any especial subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned, daringly. &ldquo;I want to know
why you detest Mrs. Van Wyck so intensely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s face after
this. First, she gave me a stare of blank amazement; then, a flash
of indignation burst from her stormy eyes; then, like a ray of
sunlight, she smiled sweetly, and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t detest
her; I <em>adore</em> her!&rdquo; And then she turned from me, and
walked swiftly down a by-path.</p>

<p>I looked after her. She walked beautifully, without haste, but
with a rapid, graceful movement. I knew perfectly well she had told
me an untruth. She <em>did</em> detest Anne, and she had chosen a
most clever way to deny it, and to close the conversation at the
same time.</p>

<p>The path she took led toward the kitchen quarters, and she soon
disappeared inside, while I went on, across the terrace and in at
the rear door of the great hall.</p>

<p>A footman showed me to the breakfast-room; a cheery, sunny
place, much cosier than the big room where we had dined the night
before. I followed him, with a comfortable sense of having a
healthy, hearty appetite.</p>

<p>When I entered the breakfast-room Archer and Morland Van Wyck
were already at the table. The ladies, Morland informed me,
breakfasted in their own rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your father?&rdquo; I asked, as I seated myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad&rsquo;s usually the earliest bird about. His
interview with that precious committee last night must have worn
him out, and he&rsquo;s sleeping late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, the committee succeeded in their fell
design?&rdquo; asked Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they succeeded, but you mustn&rsquo;t say fell
design. Dad was in no way coerced by those men. In fact,
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He coerced them to take his money?&rdquo; I asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; returned Morland; &ldquo;but they
were very fair about it. They put it to him squarely that he was
doing injustice to his family by such a gift. You know what Dad is.
The more they objected, the more determined he was to have his
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they had seemed eager for the money,&rdquo; observed
Archer, &ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck might have reconsidered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly that,&rdquo; agreed Morland.
&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s very perversity made him insist on carrying
out his plan. So, he made out a deed of gift, and though the whole
matter wasn&rsquo;t entirely settled up, yet it is practically
decided, and we Van Wycks are no longer rich people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage!&rdquo; I cried, thinking of
Anne&rsquo;s deprivation. &ldquo;Is Mr. Van Wyck a
Socialist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Morland; &ldquo;not a bit of that.
Mrs. Carstairs is the only Socialist in this household.
Father&rsquo;s idea is philanthropy,&mdash;and he suddenly took a
notion that the time to practise that, is during one&rsquo;s
lifetime, and not by a will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Carstairs a Socialist?&rdquo; I inquired, my mind
going back to her strange, almost weird personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said
Morland, with a grim smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to
understand her. But I do know she has some peculiar influence over
my father. I&rsquo;m not <em>sure</em> she persuaded him to give
this Library to the town, but I know she had a hand in
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should she want him to do such a thing?&rdquo; I
asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Morland glanced about, and as there seemed to be no servant in
hearing, he said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hates Anne, and she wants Dad&rsquo;s money to go
anywhere, rather than to his family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she hate the rest of you?&rdquo; I asked, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s indifferent to Barb and me. But she&rsquo;s
actively hostile to Anne. Of course the presumption is, that she
hoped to catch Dad in her own net, and failing, resented his
marriage to another woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem to show any especial interest in
your father,&rdquo; commented Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t judge,&rdquo; Morland said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a deep one; I never saw such a woman. She must
be over forty, and she looks like a girl. I steer clear of her
always. She&rsquo;s too many for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly has a strange manner,&rdquo; I began, and
then paused, as I heard a step behind me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morland,&rdquo; said a low voice from the hall, and I
looked up to see Anne standing in the doorway. She wore a
rose-colored boudoir gown and a lacy cap. She was pale, and her
small white hand grasped nervously at the portiere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Anne?&rdquo; said Morland, as we all
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father&mdash;he&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t been in his
room all night. He&rsquo;s locked in the study, and Carstairs
can&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carstairs, the young English valet, was behind Anne, and, though
his expression was the conventional blank, his face was white and
his eyes showed a vague fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Morland. &ldquo;Stayed in there
all night! Must have fallen asleep after his committee
meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Carstairs has pounded on the door, and I&rsquo;ve
called and called,&rdquo; said Anne, nervously. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland went at once, and Archer and I hesitatingly
followed.</p>

<p>We paused as we passed through the drawing-room, but then,
hearing Morland&rsquo;s loud calls, with apparently no response, we
went on through the corridor that led to the study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; said Morland, as we approached; and
though his tone was light, I saw that he was seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get in the other door?&rdquo; I suggested;
and Archer added, &ldquo;Or a window?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not through the windows, sir,&rdquo; said Carstairs.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all fastened inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The outside door, then,&rdquo; said I, and Archer
followed me as we went back through the corridor, out on the
terrace, and tried to open the massive doors of the study. But we
might as well have attempted to enter a locked cathedral. We tried
to peer in at the windows, but the inner blinds were drawn, and we
could see nothing. We returned to the house, where Anne and Morland
were still endeavoring to get a response to their repeated
calls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks queer,&rdquo; said Morland, shaking his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid old Dad has had a stroke or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone seemed to me altogether too careless for the
possibility he was suggesting, but my interest and attention were
centred on Anne. She was trembling violently, her face was white
and drawn, and her eyes had a haunted look, as of a terrible
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must get in,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Something
must have happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we break down the door?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Archer. &ldquo;I doubt if six men
could break in that door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;These old
doors are not the flimsy sort they make nowadays. We must pick the
lock. Carstairs, go for Ranney, the garage mechanician. He can
manage it. Tell him to bring tools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The valet made a queer, unintelligible sound in his throat, and
trembling greatly, leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;c-can&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; he said, and really,
the man seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Morland; &ldquo;you must! No nonsense!
Go at once for Ranney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; I volunteered, for Carstairs was
positively unable to move.</p>

<p>I ran to the garage and called Ranney, making as little fuss as
possible, for I didn&rsquo;t want a panic among the stablemen. I
felt sure that David Van Wyck had suffered an apoplectic or
paralytic stroke, and the immediate necessity was to get to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; said Ranney, touching his cap as
he came forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring some tools,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to force open a
locked door. And then, come on to the study, with no
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment I had rejoined the group of people clustered at the
study door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go to your room, Anne,&rdquo; Archer was
saying, gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it would be
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your
maid? . . . Here, Jeannette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as the frightened maid appeared, Morland said, &ldquo;Take
care of Mrs. Van Wyck. Take her to her room, stay with her, and
don&rsquo;t chatter to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suite of rooms occupied by Anne and her husband were close
at hand, and as maid and mistress disappeared, Ranney came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get to work and open that door,&rdquo; ordered Morland.
&ldquo;Pick the lock or cut it out, whichever is necessary, but get
us in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ranney picked the lock skilfully and rapidly, but still the door
refused to open. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bolted,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut out the bolt,&rdquo; said Morland, on whom the
suspense was beginning to tell.</p>

<p>Ranney obeyed, and, though marring and spoiling the beautiful
door, he succeeded at last in throwing it back on its hinges, and
we went in.</p>

<p>David Van Wyck sat in his desk chair, motionless, with a stain
of blood on his shirt-front and waistcoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; exclaimed Morland, springing forward.
&ldquo;By some of that blamed committee! I&rsquo;ll be revenged for
this!&rdquo; As he spoke, he was feeling for his father&rsquo;s
heart and pulse, though there was no possible doubt that the man
was dead.</p>

<p>As we all stood in horror-stricken silence, my mind worked
rapidly. &ldquo;Hold on, Morland,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be murder, with this room locked up as it was. Your
father did this himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland turned from his father and stared at me.
&ldquo;Suicide!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Absurd! Why should Dad
want to kill himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;but as we couldn&rsquo;t get into this locked room, how
could a murderer have done so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you it was one of that committee,&rdquo; declared
Morland. &ldquo;My father had no reason and no desire to kill
himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; put in Archer, &ldquo;why should those
men of the committee want to kill him? He was about to give them
his money. And, as Sturgis says, no one could have murdered him and
got away, leaving this room entirely locked on the inside. But
something ought to be done. You ought to send for a&mdash;a doctor
or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good could a doctor do now!&rdquo; said Morland,
looking a little dazed. &ldquo;But I suppose it is the right thing
to do. Carstairs, telephone for Doctor Mason and tell him to come
at once. Don&rsquo;t tell him what for&mdash;there&rsquo;s no use
of this getting all over until we know something more about it
ourselves. Use this telephone here on the desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With difficulty, Carstairs controlled himself sufficiently to
obey orders. Morland strode about the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Every window is fastened with these
enormous bolts, that are more than burglar-proof. And this outside
door, as you see, is bolted like a barricade. There is no other
possible entrance except the door at which we came in, and you all
know how secure that was. Consequently, it <em>must</em> be that my
father killed himself. But why should he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did he do it?&rdquo; said I, suddenly realizing
that there was no weapon lying about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; and
with a groan Morland flung himself into a chair and buried his face
in his hands. He seemed like a man who had utterly collapsed after
passing through a terrible ordeal, and I said to Archer,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave him alone, and do what we can
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; said Archer. &ldquo;We
mustn&rsquo;t touch anything, you know, until the coroner
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coroner!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Good gracious, does
he have to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he always called, in case of a mysterious
death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is certainly a mysterious death, if ever there
was one,&rdquo; I declared; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe that,
about not touching anything until the coroner gets here. I&rsquo;ve
heard it&rsquo;s a mistaken notion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you like, on your own responsibility,&rdquo;
said Archer; &ldquo;if you think you can discover a clue to the
mystery, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
Surmises</strong>
</h3>

<p>But I could discover nothing, except to confirm the fact that
there was no possible way for an intruder to have left that room
locked up as it was; and that consequently it must have been either
accident or intentional self-destruction.</p>

<p>But I looked in vain for a weapon. There was no revolver on the
desk or on the floor, near the dead man. I scrutinized carefully
the soft, thick rug, and was rewarded at last by finding a
clue.</p>

<p>Without disturbing Morland, who still sat, with hidden face, I
went near to Archer, and spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, I know what killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; and Archer looked amazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was shot,&rdquo; I said, trying to hide my pride in my
own discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look on the floor. There, near his chair, are five or six
small shot. See them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer stared at the floor and saw the shot almost at Van
Wyck&rsquo;s very feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how on earth&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when Doctor
Mason came into the room.</p>

<p>His professional calm a little upset by this tragedy, the
doctor&rsquo;s hand trembled as he examined the body of David Van
Wyck.</p>

<p>It took but a few moments, for the red stain on the white shirt
bosom told its own story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide?&rdquo; he inquired, as he completed his
task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have been,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;as he was
locked in here alone. How was he killed? What is the
wound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Doctor Mason, looking
puzzled. &ldquo;He may have been shot by a very small calibre
pistol, or he may have been stabbed by some sharp instrument. You
see, this small hole in his shirt-bosom is perfectly round; but
there are no powder-marks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I called the doctor&rsquo;s attention to the shot on the floor,
and he looked more puzzled still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t shot with a shotgun,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;In fact, I incline to the opinion that he was stabbed with
some sharp, round instrument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hat-pin,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor impatiently; &ldquo;there
isn&rsquo;t one hat-pin out of a hundred made that could go through
a stiff shirt-bosom without bending. But something like that, only
rather thicker. You see the size of the hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t it be a bullet-hole?&rdquo; said
Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be. At any rate, we must send for the coroner.
Wake up, Morland.&rdquo; The doctor had crossed the room and laid
his hand not unkindly on Morland Van Wyck&rsquo;s shoulder. He
shook him slightly, and Morland raised his white, drawn face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must we have the coroner?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we call it a stroke or something, and not have
any publicity? It&rsquo;s going to be awful hard on&mdash;on
Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tone made me realize Morland&rsquo;s feeling
for his father&rsquo;s beautiful young wife. Doubtless he had
concealed and even tried to overcome it, but now in his hour of
trial his first thoughts flew to her. This explained to my mind his
sudden collapse after his earlier attitude of bravado.</p>

<p>I had thought he resented his father&rsquo;s second marriage,
but now I believed that he himself had succumbed to Anne&rsquo;s
irresistible fascination.</p>

<p>I, too, felt it would be desirable to spare Anne the horrors of
publicity, if possible, so I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can the matter be hushed up, and made to appear an
accident or a natural death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dr. Mason bluntly. &ldquo;I could not
give my professional sanction to any such course. And I think Mrs.
Van Wyck should be told of this matter at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Anne came into the study. She had seen Doctor Mason
arrive, and considered it her right to know what had happened to
her husband. She wore a simple morning-gown, and her maid Jeannette
hovered behind her with a vinaigrette of smelling-salts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; said Anne, advancing steadily
into the room. And then, as she saw the still figure of David Van
Wyck, she looked at each of us in turn. Seeming to make a choice,
she went to Doctor Mason, and, putting her hands on his arm, said
simply, &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo; said the old doctor,
straightforwardly, &ldquo;your husband is dead. We do not know
exactly the means of his death, and I&rsquo;m afraid it will be
necessary to put the matter into the hands of the
coroner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s slender figure swayed a little, but she did not
faint, and Doctor Mason gently steadied her, as he went on talking:
&ldquo;There is nothing you can do, Mrs. Van Wyck, and as your
physician, I advise you to go to your room and lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will not go to my room and lie down,&rdquo; Anne
declared; &ldquo;who killed my husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was strangely calm,&mdash;so calm, that I knew she was
straining every nerve to preserve her poise, and I feared her
sudden breakdown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is yet to be discovered,&rdquo; said Doctor Mason;
&ldquo;if, indeed, we do not find out that he took his own
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not do that,&rdquo; said Anne; &ldquo;he never
would do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was almost inaudible, and her face was white as death.
She still clutched the old doctor&rsquo;s arm, as if unable to
stand alone.</p>

<p>We three men stood, looking at her. I felt sure all three loved
her; Archer, Moreland and I. It was a strange situation, for a
subtle sense told me that we all wanted to go to her assistance,
but none dared do so. We seemed, almost, to be waiting, till she
should make a choice of one of us.</p>

<p>But she did not heed us. Addressing herself entirely to the
doctor, she rambled on, not hysterically, but with a far-away look,
as if only half-conscious of what she was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; David would not commit suicide,&mdash;of that, I am
sure. Somebody killed him,&mdash;murdered him,&mdash;but who? Could
it have been&mdash;&rdquo; her voice died away in an unintelligible
murmur, and she fainted.</p>

<p>Doctor Mason held her in his arms, as we all sprang forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morland,&rdquo; said the doctor, making his own choice,
&ldquo;help me carry Mrs. Van Wyck to her room. Where is her
maid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took Anne away, and I turned to Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her bedroom is on this floor?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Van Wyck used to have his rooms on the second floor.
But when he married his present wife, he had a magnificent suite of
apartments furnished for them on this floor. Partly because they
are beautiful rooms, and partly to be nearer this study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems strangely appropriate that he should die in this
room,&rdquo; I said, glancing toward the still figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems appropriate that he should die
<em>anywhere!&rdquo;</em> Archer muttered, in a savage undertone.
And in answer to my look of surprise at this outburst, he added:
&ldquo;He was a brute to his wife. I&rsquo;m sorry his death
occurred in this horrible way, but I am not sorry he&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could make no reply; for, though I never should have put it
into words, my feeling was the same.</p>

<p>But the death <em>had</em> occurred in a horrible way, and the
exigencies and consequences of it must be met.</p>

<p>Doctor Mason reappeared, and in response to our inquiries, he
said that Mrs. Van Wyck had regained consciousness, and was being
looked after by her maid and by Mrs. Carstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall now telephone for the coroner,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;I assume that Morland will take charge of his father&rsquo;s
affairs; and I think that Miss Barbara should be told at once what
has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help admiring the poise and practical good
sense of Doctor Mason. He had been the family physician of the Van
Wycks for many years, and whatever his personal feeling toward the
head of the house, he now remembered only his professional
responsibility and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>While he was telephoning the coroner, a young man came into the
study, who was a stranger to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Lasseter?&rdquo; said Morland, looking up.
&ldquo;A tragedy has occurred, and my father has been killed; by
himself or another, we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Morland spoke
mechanically, almost as if he felt it incumbent upon him to explain
the situation.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that Barclay Lasseter was Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
secretary. He did not live in the house, but came every morning to
the study. He was the tallest man I had ever seen; of slight build,
with a dark, somewhat sinister face. I couldn&rsquo;t help
wondering if he were in any way implicated in the tragedy. Like the
rest of us, he was self-possessed, and, though shocked, seemed
anxious, principally, to do anything he might to help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it have been the work of burglars?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Has anything been stolen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied, as no one else
spoke. &ldquo;Do you miss anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lasseter glanced over the desk, and, taking some keys from his
pocket, opened one or two drawers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Check-book and petty cash all right,&rdquo; he said
briefly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you looked in the safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morland; but he made no move to follow up
Lasseter&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>I heard no sound at the doorway, but seeing Doctor Mason&rsquo;s
eyes turn from the telephone in that direction, I looked, too, and
saw Mrs. Carstairs come in.</p>

<p>She entered noiselessly, as she always moved, and though she was
wearing the same white gown I had admired earlier that morning, she
appeared altogether different. No longer was the smartness of her
costume its chief characteristic. But,&mdash;and it must have been
owing to the woman&rsquo;s wonderful dramatic ability,&mdash;her
white linen garb had the effect of the uniform of a trained nurse.
With a swift, comprehending glance, she looked in every one of our
faces, and then, without a word glided to the chair where sat the
still figure of David Van Wyck.</p>

<p>She betrayed no trace of self-consciousness, indeed, she seemed
unaware of our presence, as she stood looking at the dead
man&rsquo;s face. Then she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was suicide,&rdquo; she said, with an air of
certainty. &ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck was an unhappy man, and he sought
refuge in death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time, she assumed a melodramatic pose, and stood,
looking at us all, as if to challenge contradiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean!&rdquo; began Morland hotly;
&ldquo;but it is not true! My father was not an unhappy
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs merely gave a Frenchy shrug of her well-formed
shoulders, and said nothing. With her hanging hands lightly clasped
in front of her, she stood, cool and self-possessed, while Morland
went on, irately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you have said that, Mrs. Carstairs, please explain
yourself. Why do you say my father was unhappy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak of what I know,&rdquo; she returned, her gaze at
him not flinching. &ldquo;But I deny your right to question me
concerning my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know anything that can help to throw any light on
this sad occurrence, it is your duty to tell it, Mrs.
Carstairs,&rdquo; said Doctor Mason, speaking rather sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I am questioned by authority, it will be time for me
to speak,&rdquo; she returned, calmly.</p>

<p>Her manner and voice,&mdash;even her words,&mdash;seemed to
betoken that she was in possession of great secrets, but I had an
intuitive conviction that it was only pretense. I felt sure she
wanted to appear sensationally important; and I wondered if she
meant, in any way to make trouble for Anne.</p>

<p>I think the same notion was in Archer&rsquo;s mind, for he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any facts you may know, Mrs. Carstairs, must be told at
the inquest. But opinions or fancies carry no weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a glance that seemed tinged with mockery, but she
only said: &ldquo;Mine is not a nature to exploit opinions or
fancies.&rdquo; Then she turned to Doctor Mason, and speaking in
her capacity of housekeeper, asked him concerning the removal of
the body to another room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until the coroner gives permission,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;He will be here shortly; and until then, we can
make no changes or definite plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara came to the study door, accompanied by Mrs. Stelton and
Beth Fordyce. Mrs. Carstairs moved swiftly to meet them, but though
she admitted Barbara, she refused entrance to the others. I did not
hear her words, as she spoke with them, but they seemed willing to
accept her dictum, and turned away together. I couldn&rsquo;t help
admiring her wisdom and tact in keeping them out, for they were
emotional women, and their exclamations would have jarred the
overwrought nerves of us all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs was charming. She told Barbara in a few words,
all that we knew, and clasped her arm in an unobtrusive, but
helpful sympathy.</p>

<p>But Barbara shook her off, almost rudely, and going straight to
her father&rsquo;s side, looked at him long and silently. Then she
went over and sat down by Morland and they conversed in
whispers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs was apparently not at all offended by
Barbara&rsquo;s manner, and placidly continued her role of general
director of affairs. She straightened a small rug, emptied an ash
tray into a waste basket, and was about to tidy up the desk, when
Condron Archer said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be wiser, Mrs. Carstairs, not to move anything,
before the coroner arrives. He must see the room as it is. There
may be clues to the&mdash;the intruder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no intruder,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, in a
tone of quiet assurance. &ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck died by his own
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she ceased fussing among the desk appointments, and sat down
near the door. She leaned her head back, and closed her eyes,
looking the picture of sphinx-like inscrutability.</p>

<p>But she was alert enough to be at the door, as the coroner
entered a moment later. She ushered him in, and seemed about to
lead him toward the desk, when Doctor Mason rather peremptorily
took matters in charge, himself.</p>

<p>The coroner, whose name was Mellen, was a brisk and somewhat
aggressive man. He went at once to the body of the dead man and
began his examination. He agreed with the doctor that it was
difficult to tell what had caused death, except by an autopsy, but
he at once began a search for the weapon. At his request, Archer
and I joined him, but in the whole great room we could find no
pistol nor any instrument of the nature of a stiletto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, it must be the work of an intruder,&rdquo; declared
the coroner, &ldquo;who took the weapon away with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;for
this room was absolutely secure in its locks and bolts against any
intruder. Nobody could possibly have gotten in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is equally impossible that a man could have killed
himself and left no trace of the weapon,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellen
doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could he have stabbed or shot himself and then thrown the
weapon far from him?&rdquo; asked Archer, looking deeply
thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death was almost instantaneous,&rdquo; said Doctor Mason;
&ldquo;but I suppose that by a spasmodic muscular effort he could
have done that. However, the relaxed position of his hands and arms
does not make it seem probable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is the only explanation,&rdquo; said I eagerly.
&ldquo;Come on, Archer, let us make a more thorough search. Perhaps
Mr. Lasseter will help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barclay Lasseter agreed, though he seemed rather half-hearted
about it</p>

<p>Barbara and Morland looked at us, but made no offer of help.</p>

<p>The search was fruitless. Neither floor nor walls showed any
bullet holes or powder-marks. There was no weapon to be found;
though I produced the few small shot I had found on the floor, they
seemed meaningless in the absence of any gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very absence of a weapon precludes all idea of
suicide,&rdquo; said Coroner Mellen, at last; &ldquo;and, though
I&rsquo;m not prepared to say how the murderer got in or out of
this room, I believe that he did do so, and that David Van Wyck did
not die by his own hand. Has anything been stolen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lasseter opened the safe door, and I expressed surprise that it
was unlocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often is,&rdquo; returned the secretary carelessly.
&ldquo;Most of the valuable things are in inner compartments, with
complicated locks of their own. And, too, there never are
burglaries in this peaceful village, and a man grows careless. But
I can&rsquo;t see that any securities are missing. All these papers
seem undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pearls!&rdquo; cried Morland, starting up suddenly.
&ldquo;Are they there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the box,&rdquo; said Lasseter, handing a
jewel-case to Morland. &ldquo;Open it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland opened it and gave a cry of despair, for the satin-lined
case was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pearls gone!&rdquo; said Barbara, with an
awe-stricken look. &ldquo;Then, it was a burglar, after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it couldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; I began, when the
coroner cut me short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If pearls have been stolen, of course it was a
burglar,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and a professional cracksman, if he
could get into this room and out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I declared emphatically,
glancing at the windows and doors.</p>

<p>Still the coroner refused to heed me, and said abruptly,
&ldquo;What were they worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were practically priceless,&rdquo; Morland stated.
&ldquo;My father had been collecting and matching them for years.
It was a triple necklace composed of three strands of the finest
and largest pearls he could procure. One hundred thousand dollars
would be a conservative estimate of their value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a man kept such jewels as that in an unlocked
safe?&rdquo; said the coroner incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must have been there temporarily,&rdquo; said
Morland, as if puzzling the matter out himself. &ldquo;And, too,
I&rsquo;ve no doubt my father intended to lock the safe before he
left the study. But he was murdered first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any theory, Mr. Van Wyck, how a murder could
have been effected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morland; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. I know,
even better than the rest of you, how absolutely this room is
protected against forcible entrance. And that is one reason why my
father was sometimes careless about locking the safe. He knew no
one could get into this room from outside. Of course, upon leaving
it at night, he always locked the door that communicates with the
house, and kept the key himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no duplicate key?&rdquo; asked Mr. Mellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Morland positively. Then Barbara Van
Wyck made a suggestion. &ldquo;If Father did&mdash;did kill
himself,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly, &ldquo;possibly he himself
had taken the pearls from the case and hidden them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I realized at once what she meant. If David Van Wyck had taken
his own life, it would have been quite in keeping with his cruel
nature to hide the pearls where his family might not easily find
them.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>Chapter
VII<br>
The Mysterious Motor Car</strong>
</h3>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Carstairs, impetuously;
&ldquo;David Van Wyck would <em>not</em> do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem very certain,&rdquo; said Morland, looking at
her coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certain,&rdquo; she retorted, with a flush of her
dark eyes. &ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;ve lived under David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s roof all these years, without learning his nature
fairly well? He was a hard man and severe,&mdash;but he was just,
and above such meanness as you ascribe to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have already expressed an
opinion that Mr. Van Wyck died by his own hand. Now, if the pearls
were stolen by a burglar, it is a strange coincidence that the two
crimes should occur the same night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs looked at me with her face full of baffled rage.
Her theories were indeed at variance. If an intruder took the
pearls, undoubtedly David Van Wyck had been murdered. If, on the
other hand, he had committed suicide, he would seem to be himself
responsible for the disappearance of the jewels.</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Carstairs sat motionless, though it was
evident her mind was working rapidly. The rest of us sat watching
her, and I, at any rate, began to feel a dawning hope that what she
might say next would throw a little light on the mystery.</p>

<p>At last she burst out, in a voice low, but tense with feeling:
&ldquo;I am sure David Van Wyck killed himself. I am sure that if
before his death he secreted that valuable pearl necklace, he was
entirely justified in doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo; demanded Archer,
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you all know, without being told,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Carstairs, and her lips curled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you shall tell!&rdquo; and Archer&rsquo;s
voice fairly quivered with indignation. &ldquo;Speak out before us
all, and say what you mean by your insinuation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs looked at him with an air half supercilious and
half amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, Mr. Archer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you
should arraign me, in this manner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you,&rdquo; thundered Archer, &ldquo;that you
should presume to cast aspersions at any of the Van Wyck
family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen broke in upon this controversy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What position do you hold in this house, Mrs.
Carstairs?&rdquo; he inquired, in a tone of such authority that it
compelled a respectful answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s housekeeper for seven
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were here, then, before he was married to the present
Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five years before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very tones of the housekeeper&rsquo;s voice, the reminiscent
look in her beautiful mysterious eyes, and the almost insolent toss
of her well-poised head, fully confirmed my previous thought that
she had deeply resented the advent of Anne.</p>

<p>Coroner Mellen looked at her a moment, and then said, as if
dismissing her, &ldquo;You will, of course, be called upon to give
your testimony at the inquest.&rdquo; His curt nod of dismissal was
sufficient to send Mrs. Carstairs from the room, but she paid no
heed to it, and remained sitting in her chair, without a trace of
embarrassment or self-consciousness.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help admiring her aplomb,&mdash;her wonderful
self-poise; nor could I help wondering whether she knew anything
about the tragedy, or whether her sensational nature made her wish
to appear mysterious.</p>

<p>I began to like the coroner. He was not prepossessing in
appearance, being extremely young for his position, and of a
sandy-haired, freckle-faced type that made him look like a blushing
school-boy. But his blue eyes showed a quick intelligence, and I
jumped to the conclusion that he was bright and intuitive, but
inexperienced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must ask a few preliminary questions,&rdquo; he said,
and there was a little nervous hesitation in his manner, &ldquo;and
I will hold my inquest this afternoon. Doctor Mason, can you tell
me at what time the death of Mr. Van Wyck probably
occurred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been dead, fully nine or ten hours,&rdquo; replied
the doctor; &ldquo;it is probable that he was killed about or after
midnight. I refuse to accept the theory of suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was death instantaneous?&rdquo; went on Mr. Mellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was; though I shall make further examination, I am
already convinced that Mr. Van Wyck was stabbed with a sharp weapon
by some one with murderous intent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nobody could get in!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Carstairs,
and she sat forward, grasping the arms of her chair and gazing
intently at the doctor, as if she would hypnotize him.</p>

<p>Although I had begun to dislike the woman, I was forced to admit
to myself her marvellous charm. Every pose she assumed seemed more
graceful, more picturesque than the one before; and yet I
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that her effects were all carefully
premeditated. She showed no self-consciousness, but her
self-reliance and self-sufficiency were so marked, that I believed
her a consummate actress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not considering that now,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellen,
looking at her keenly, and then turning to Morland, he said,
&ldquo;Who discovered your father&rsquo;s body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland told briefly the circumstances of breaking in the door,
and the coroner listened attentively and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Summon the valet,&rdquo; he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs rose with a sudden start and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Why do you want him? He is in no way implicated in this
matter! He did not attend his master last evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, madam,&rdquo; said the coroner, amazed at
this outbreak, &ldquo;nobody has accused him! Pray, calm yourself.
Why do you object to his presence here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my son,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he is, that is no reason he should not be
questioned.&rdquo; Mr. Mellen gave a grim smile, and shook his head
slightly, as if to imply that Mrs. Carstairs was a woman beyond his
ken.</p>

<p>Morland had touched a bell, in response to which the valet
appeared. He had little to tell, save to corroborate
Morland&rsquo;s story of the morning; but had he, himself, been
guilty of crime he could not have acted more frightened. I
remembered, however, that he had shown the same behavior when the
alarm was first raised, and I concluded that it was merely a
natural horror of death; and perhaps he had inherited his
mother&rsquo;s emotional disposition.</p>

<p>But whatever Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s attitude toward David Van
Wyck or his family, I now perceived that the woman&rsquo;s
all-absorbing passion was her son. She watched him with intensity.
Her mobile face unconsciously followed the expressions of his
countenance. She prompted his speech when he hesitated; and she
interrupted, and spoke for him so frequently that Mr. Mellen was
obliged to reprimand her.</p>

<p>But between the trembling valet and his anxious and apprehensive
mother, nothing was learned that seemed to be of the least
importance.</p>

<p>It seemed, that as Mr. Van Wyck expected to be up late with the
committeemen, he had excused Carstairs from attending him when he
retired, and the valet had had the evening to himself. When he went
to his Master&rsquo;s bedroom that morning, he found it had been
unoccupied through the night, and he had raised an alarm. The rest
of his story was exactly the same as Morland&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I could not see why his mother should be so wrought up over the
matter of his appearance, but I set it down to an excessive
maternal solicitude, lest he should be suspected of implication in
the tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This committee,&rdquo; went on Mr. Mellen, his brows bent
in perplexity, &ldquo;who were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three gentlemen from the village,&rdquo; said Morland.
&ldquo;They met with my father last night, to discuss a business
matter. They all went away before I left this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Lasseter made an announcement He had been looking over
the papers that lay on the desk, and he said abruptly, &ldquo;The
deed of gift is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Coroner Mellen, alert for
further information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said Lasseter, &ldquo;I was here
during the conference of the gentlemen from the village and Mr. Van
Wyck. He made out to them a deed of gift of a large sum of money.
However, he retained this paper after his visitors had left. He may
have put it away after I left myself, but so far I cannot find
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time did you leave?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost exactly at midnight,&rdquo; returned the
secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where was the deed you speak of then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lying on this desk, in front of Mr. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was here when you left, besides Mr. Van
Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only his son, Morland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Morland, springing
up. &ldquo;When I left this room at midnight, you were here alone
with my father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my surprise, the coroner did not question these contradictory
statements. He looked at the two men without speaking, though his
sharp blue eyes showed that he had understood what they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The case is most mysterious,&rdquo; he declared;
&ldquo;and I think it wiser to have no further discussion or
investigation until I can hold the inquest and hear definite
testimony. The facts of the absolutely inaccessible room and the
entire absence of the fatal weapon are so irreconcilable, that I
confess I am baffled. I think the only course to pursue, is to
engage the services of a clever and experienced
detective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for such a thing,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Carstairs, quite as if she were in authority; &ldquo;I object to it
very decidedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner looked at her appraisingly, and then turned to
Morland Van Wyck. Though he said no word, it was quite evident he
was inquiring from whom he should take orders. My liking for Mr.
Mellen deepened. He showed brains and commonsense, two qualities
not always found together, and not universally the attributes of
coroners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your opinion is not wanted, Mrs. Carstairs,&rdquo;
Morland said pettishly, but I noticed he did not look at her.
&ldquo;I, too, think we should have a detective. What do you say,
Barbara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Van Wyck hesitated. &ldquo;I hate the publicity of
it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I think we ought to find the
pearls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at her in surprise. Were her thoughts all for the
jewels, and had she no desire to find and bring to justice the
murderer of her father? Then I remembered that her theory was, that
David Van Wyck had secreted the pearls and then killed himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only the pearls,&rdquo; Morland was saying; &ldquo;we
must lay bare the whole mystery. I cannot live, not knowing how my
father met his death. If some villain killed him, the murderer must
be brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland strode up and down the room as he talked, and I thought
I had never seen him look more manly. I felt a new respect for him,
and a willingness to help him in any way I might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Morland went on, &ldquo;we must not
make definite arrangements without consulting my Mrs. Van Wyck. It
is for her to say whether we shall engage a detective.&rdquo; He
flashed a defiant glance at Mrs. Carstairs, as he spoke, but it did
not ruffle the calm of that self-reliant personage.</p>

<p>Barbara went away to confer with Anne on the subject, and soon
returned saying that her stepmother expressed entire indifference
in the matter. She was perfectly willing that the detective should
be engaged, if Barbara and Morland wished it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of a good detective, Mr. Mellen?&rdquo; I
asked, while my thoughts flew to Fleming Stone and his marvellous
ability. But that great detective was far away, and so,
unavailable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of none in Crescent Falls Village,&rdquo; returned
the coroner, &ldquo;but I can send for a very good man from the
city. His name is Markham, and I have reason to know he is
exceedingly clever and successful; and though not a low-priced man,
his fees are not exorbitant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Mellen,&rdquo; said Barbara, simply;
&ldquo;that is the kind of man I should like to investigate this
case. I am sure I am correct in my beliefs, and I think a detective
can find the pearls for us. There is no other crime to be
discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I think!&rdquo; And moved by a sympathy of
opinions, Mrs. Carstairs glided up to Barbara and took her hands.
But she found herself coldly repulsed, as Miss Van Wyck said
curtly, &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; And drawing her hands from the clasp
of the housekeeper, she moved slowly toward the door, with a
backward glance at the still figure of her father.</p>

<p>And then came the undertaker and his men, and the coroner
dismissed all of us, except Doctor Mason.</p>

<p>As we all walked silently through the corridor, Morland and
Barbara turned aside into Anne&rsquo;s room. I asked them to assure
Mrs. Van Wyck of my sympathy, and to tell her how glad I would be
if I might do anything for her. The message sounded perfunctory,
but I think I had never said sincerer words.</p>

<p>The rest of us went various ways, Archer going off to his own
room, and Mrs. Carstairs toward the servants&rsquo; wing.</p>

<p>I went to the library, and after a short time, Morland joined me
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s composed,&rdquo; he answered briefly;
&ldquo;but exhausted from the shock. She is entirely unable to
discuss details of arrangements, and says for Barbara and myself to
manage things as we choose. She sends thanks for your kind message,
and hopes to see you later in the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart gave a throb at this, for though I was longing to see
Anne, I wanted the suggestion to come from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then of course you will take complete authority,&rdquo; I
said to Morland, who sat on the edge of a table, moodily swinging
one foot back and forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said angrily, &ldquo;if I can circumvent
that Carstairs woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had resolved to be very discreet on this subject, so I only
said, &ldquo;She is a strange personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a serpent!&rdquo; Morland muttered, and just
then Mrs. Stelton and Miss Fordyce appeared at the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t we come in?&rdquo; begged Mrs. Stelton, in
her pouting, childish way; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re so frightened and
lonesome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beth Fordyce said nothing, but her big blue eyes were full of
tears, as she looked at Morland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said, rising; &ldquo;please come in
and talk to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter speech seemed necessary, for at their entrance,
Morland walked out of the room without a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Morland,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stelton, wringing her
little hands, fussily; &ldquo;I am so sorry for him! I wish I could
comfort him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he likes best to be let alone,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;aside from his natural sorrow, he is suddenly loaded with
grave responsibilities; enough to overwhelm any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not overwhelm him.&rdquo; It was Miss Fordyce
who spoke, and her eyes had the far-away look that always showed in
them when her mood was occult. &ldquo;I shall care for his spirit,
and sustain him in his hour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Beth, let up on that rubbish!&rdquo; And Mrs.
Stelton was so in earnest, that she forgot to flutter. &ldquo;You
tell Mr. Sturgis what you have to tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to tell,&rdquo; and Miss Fordyce
looked positively dreamy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you <em>have</em>!&rdquo; and Mrs. Stelton took her
arm and shook her slightly. &ldquo;Wake up, now, and stop your
nonsense! Tell Mr. Sturgis what you saw last night&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a vision?&rdquo; I asked, resigning myself to one
of her usual psychic experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did have a vision&mdash;&rdquo; the girl began, but
Mrs. Stelton interrupted her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind your vision,&mdash;stick to plain facts! You
tell Mr. Sturgis the story, just exactly as you told it to
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, interested now, and hoping it
might be something of real importance. &ldquo;Please tell me at
once, Miss Fordyce, for some one may come in here at any
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she frequently did, Miss Fordyce changed her manner suddenly,
and spoke with alert energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only this. I was wakeful last night, and I
rose and sat by my window for a long time. The moon was bright, and
everything looked so beautiful, it did my soul good. Well, as I sat
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me a moment, Miss Fordyce, which is your
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly over this,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;on the
second floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the front room on the other side of the second
floor,&rdquo; I said, realizing that she could not see the East
wing from her window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stelton; &ldquo;you have
the room directly over Anne&rsquo;s. Mr. Archer&rsquo;s room is
over Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s bedroom. Mr. Van Wyck used to have the
room Mr. Archer has now, before he married Anne. Then he had the
first floor suite done up, and positively the rooms are of regal
splendor. Why, Anne&rsquo;s dressing-room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with your story, please, Miss Fordyce,&rdquo; I
said, taking advantage of one of Mrs. Stelton&rsquo;s pauses for
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I sat by my window,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;I
saw a very large motor car come slowly along the main road. It
halted now and then, not as if because of any mechanical trouble,
but as if its driver hesitated about proceeding. After stopping two
or three times, it finally came into the grounds, and up our main
road. But it continued to pause now and then until at last it made
a mad dash around the house, passing right under my window. I
didn&rsquo;t see the car again, but a few moments later, I saw some
person wrapped in a large coat, walk stealthily by my window. I
don&rsquo;t know whether it was a man or a woman, but whoever it
was, seemed afraid of being seen. For the dark figure hid twice
behind trees, and then suddenly ran swiftly away in the same
direction the motor car had gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time did all this happen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure; but it was not far from midnight. At
any rate, between twelve and one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Fordyce,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as you know, a great
mystery at present surrounds the death of Mr. Van Wyck. This
incident you saw, may have a bearing on the matter, and it may not
But won&rsquo;t you promise me not to speak of it to anyone else?
And at the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, which will be held this
afternoon, won&rsquo;t you tell this story simply and
straightforwardly, as you have told it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the inquest!&rdquo; Miss Fordyce exclaimed; &ldquo;oh,
I just <em>couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can!&rdquo; I answered her, sternly, &ldquo;and
you <em>must.</em> If you do it rightly, you may be of great help
to the whole Van Wyck family; while, if you are foolish about it,
you may impede justice and cause untold trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I told you so!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Stelton. &ldquo;I
knew it was important Now, Beth, you come along with me. I&rsquo;ll
see to it, Mr. Sturgis, that this girl tells her story and tells it
right, when she is called upon to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Stelton,&rdquo; I said, heartily, and I
had never liked the little lady so well before. &ldquo;Keep Miss
Fordyce up to the mark and don&rsquo;t let her slip away into her
dreams and visions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two went away together, and I started off for a stroll by
myself, to see what a little fresh air would do towards
straightening out the complex questions that were baffling my
brain.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>Chapter
VIII<br>
Enter, A Detective</strong>
</h3>

<p>I walked along the paths, my eyes cast down, and my hands behind
me, while I brooded over the situation. I had the grace to be
utterly ashamed of the fact, that beneath all other considerations,
I was conscious of a realization that Anne was now free. I would
not allow myself to put this thought into words; I tried to evade
and ignore it; but it brought a peace to my soul that shone
steadily through all the disturbing problems that filled my
consciousness.</p>

<p>First, was the great problem of Van Wyck&rsquo;s death. Was it
suicide or murder? And then I thought, how futile even to wonder
about that, until the inquest, when unexpected disclosures might
immediately solve the mystery.</p>

<p>Next was the problem of what Anne would do. But that, it seemed
to me, was an indelicacy even to think about, at present. So I
resolutely put it away from me, and turned my thoughts to the story
Beth Fordyce had told. It was certainly strange that a motor should
come into the Van Wyck estate at midnight, and that it should
alternately halt and proceed in such a mysterious manner. Also that
its entrance and disappearance should be followed by the presence
of a stealthy, cloaked figure.</p>

<p>But again, was Beth Fordyce&rsquo;s word reliable? I had no
doubt of her integrity;&mdash;but the girl had such strange fancies
and such a vivid imagination, that I could not place implicit
reliance on the story as she had told it.</p>

<p>To her distorted mental vision, a belated pedestrian might
assume the mystery of a prowling marauder. And yet, she had said
the figure passed under her window, which would of course mean some
one intending, either rightly or wrongfully, to enter the house.
And, too, the strange proceedings of the motor car,&mdash;though
perhaps exaggerated by her,&mdash;could scarcely be all
imagination, unless the girl had wilfully made up this story, which
I did not believe.</p>

<p>But again, if the occupant of the motor car had indeed been a
criminal,&mdash;a thief and a murderer,&mdash;with fell intent
against David Van Wyck, how had he entered the study, committed his
crimes, and departed again, leaving, every outlet of the room
securely fastened on the inside?</p>

<p>This question proved unanswerable, so I gave it up and began to
retrace my steps toward the house.</p>

<p>As I neared the stables, I noticed a man coming along the same
road that I had seen Mrs. Carstairs slowly following, early that
same morning. I paused a moment to watch him, and I saw that it was
Carstairs, the valet. To my surprise, he repeated exactly the
procedure of his mother. He stepped along slowly, carefully
examining the ground, and had every appearance of a man searching
for some small, lost article. He had a stick in his hand, and he
even scraped the dirt of the road now and then, peering closely, as
if in a desperate search.</p>

<p>I determined to come upon him suddenly, as I had surprised his
mother, and see if he were as apt at explaining himself as she had
been.</p>

<p>I approached very quietly, and as I was just at his elbow, I
said, &ldquo;What have you lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man dropped his stick, and raised a white, startled
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-nothing,&mdash;sir. I assure you,&mdash;I have lost
nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for, then? I will help you find
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I picked up the stick he had dropped, and began poking in the
dust, myself. But he said, stammering, and with a pleading
expression:</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no! I have not lost anything, sir. Give me back my
stick, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Carstairs, it&rsquo;s no crime to lose
anything. But to be so secret about it, and so rattled, betokens a
guilty conscience of some sort&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; very good, sir. I&rsquo;m not rattled,
sir,&mdash;and indeed, indeed, sir, I have not lost
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clearly the man had not his mother&rsquo;s faculty for rising to
a situation. Without a doubt they had both been searching for the
same thing, as I saw them both closely examining the ground in the
same place. But she had tossed off my questions with witty
repartee, while he was the embodiment of agonized
embarrassment.</p>

<p>I went on toward the house, with a new problem added to my brain
collection,&mdash;the problem of the two searchers, who both denied
having lost anything, and who were mother and son. Collusion and
secrecy were certainly shown here. I had no clue to the solution of
this mystery, and thought that very likely it was a matter of no
importance, anyway.</p>

<p>When I reached the house, Barbara met me with the welcome news
that Anne desired to see me. I was conducted to her dressing-room,
and as I entered, I realized the truth of what I had been told
regarding the Van Wycks&rsquo; apartments. A more exquisite gem of
a room, I never saw. It was furnished entirely in Louis Seize
effects and was a miracle of gilded carving and rose-colored
brocade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you call this a dressing-room!&rdquo; I said,
endeavoring to be casual; &ldquo;I think <em>boudoir</em> a more
appropriate term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne smiled. &ldquo;I hate a French word,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;when English will do as well. And I especially dislike the
term &lsquo;sitting-room,&rsquo; so what could I do? And it is my
dressing-room, as you see.&rdquo; She waved her hand toward a
daintily appointed toilet-table, glittering with glass and
gold.</p>

<p>I scarcely knew whether to continue the conversation on trivial
matters, or whether to speak of the tragedy. Anne herself was
perfectly composed; though pale, and with an air of forcing herself
to be quiet and natural.</p>

<p>But after a few moments of beating time, I said,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not evade the subject that fills both our minds.
May we not speak of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice you are!&rdquo; said Anne, and her eyes beamed
with gratitude. &ldquo;You always do the right thing, Raymond. My
heart is bursting to talk of these things, yet everyone thinks I
don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk to me,&rdquo; I said, gently, &ldquo;just as you
will. Say anything that is in your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was on dangerous ground, and I knew it, but I held myself well
in hand. Anne looked lovelier than ever, in a white lacy sort of
boudoir gown and a lace cap on her beautiful hair. Also she looked
pathetic and as if greatly in need of some one to lean on for
sympathy and counsel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us talk it over freely,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you
cannot be brave and courageous, Anne, as you must be, if you are
afraid to face the facts. You don&rsquo;t think your husband took
his own life, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he did not. David had no reason for such
an act. He was a man fond of life; and beside, he had this project
of the library in mind, and he was more than anxious to carry it
through. There is no reason,&mdash;there can be no
reason,&mdash;why he should kill himself. But Raymond,&rdquo; and
her white brows drew tensely, &ldquo;how <em>could</em> anyone kill
him and get away afterward, leaving the study locked? I&rsquo;ve
thought over that until I&rsquo;m nearly crazy. You see <em>I</em>
know how perfectly impossible it is to get into that room when the
door is locked. Because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; I gently prompted her.</p>

<p>A look of pain came into her eyes, followed by a sudden
determination; and she went on: &ldquo;I may as well tell you;
because my husband and I have had some fearful quarrels. Invariably
he would go and shut himself in the study afterward. I knew it was
my duty to try to make peace with him and often I have tried to get
into the study in spite of him. I have even tried to get in at a
window, while he would sit inside and smile at me in
mockery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you have been through with that man!&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and yet he was often very good to me. At times he
was a perfect brute, but it was because of his really ungovernable
temper. Then again he would fairly spoil me with kindness. But of
late his kindness had become more and more rare, and he was
sarcastic and cruel much of the time. I tell you this, Raymond,
because I want you to understand, that while I respected and
admired David in many ways, I cannot mourn him as I would mourn a
man I loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This admission brought joy to my own heart, but I knew this was
no time or place to let it be known, and as a matter of precaution,
I hurriedly changed the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a strange woman Mrs. Carstairs is,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;had she an especial interest in Mr. Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she adored him,&rdquo; and Anne spoke carelessly as
if it were a matter of no moment to her. &ldquo;At one time she
hoped to marry him, but David had no such intention. So of course
she resented my presence here, and has never been nice to me. It
didn&rsquo;t bother me much, though she <em>is</em> annoying. I
tried to have her dismissed, but Carstairs is such a perfect valet,
David would not give him up, so they both remained. Now they can
both go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne spoke with a sudden vindictiveness, and just at that moment
Mrs. Carstairs appeared in the open doorway. Her arrival was so
opportune that I felt positive she had been listening outside the
door. She did not seem angry, but there was a feline note in her
voice as she said, &ldquo;You were speaking of me, Mrs. Van
Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a tribute to Anne&rsquo;s wonderful poise that she was in
no way ruffled. She spoke quietly, as she replied, &ldquo;Yes, Mrs.
Carstairs, since you chanced to overhear, I am quite willing to
repeat what I said. As there is no longer any occasion for your
son&rsquo;s services, you will doubtless prefer to go away with
him. But I beg you will consult your own pleasure as to the time of
your departure, and not feel obliged to make inconvenient
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a clash of superior forces. If Anne showed self-control,
the housekeeper was even more absolutely at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo; she returned, in silvery
tones; &ldquo;I shall take advantage of your kind permission, and
remain here, at least until we have discovered the solution of the
mystery that surrounds the death of Mr. Van Wyck. It may be that I
can be of assistance to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely think that,&rdquo; and Anne&rsquo;s slight
smile would have rasped a saint; &ldquo;but you are at liberty to
stay as long as you choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter part of the speech was almost patronizing, and
distinctly in the manner of a mistress to a servant, and it scored.
Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and she winced as if flicked
with a whip; but in an instant she had dropped her eyelids, and
though she merely said &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and left the room,
her air was so unvanquished, even victorious, that she really had
the final word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Anne, spreading her hands,
deprecatingly, &ldquo;one cannot contend with that sort of thing,
except between equals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate that perfectly,&rdquo; I returned, very
seriously; &ldquo;but you must realize, Anne, that she is a
dangerous woman. You are no match for her; because, though you have
marvellous perceptions and mental powers, yet you are innocent and
right-minded. That woman is all wrong. I don&rsquo;t know in what
respects,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know anything about her. But she is
capable of crime!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my consternation, Anne turned white to the very lips. She put
her hands before her eyes as if to shut out some dreadful sight,
and she moaned in a whisper, &ldquo;Oh, Raymond, I am capable of
crime, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; I said, soothingly, &ldquo;that
woman has wrought on your nerves. For that matter, child, everybody
is capable of crime. I had no business to say what I did. I&rsquo;m
a churl,&mdash;a mischief-maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne lifted her eyes and almost smiled at my self-abasement, and
then, as her maid entered the room, she said, &ldquo;What is it,
Jeannette?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Archer, madame. He wishes to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come in,&rdquo; said Anne, graciously, and
then herself added, &ldquo;Come on in, Connie. There&rsquo;s no one
here but Mr. Sturgis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer came in, looking preoccupied. With scant ceremony he
threw himself into a chair, and said abruptly: &ldquo;Now, look
here, Anne, how about this detective? Do you want him to
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so. Now Mellen has sent for him, and unless we
telephone contrary orders or something, he&rsquo;ll be here
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want him, Anne?&rdquo; I asked, in
astonishment. &ldquo;I think it is necessary to have him. The
mystery must be cleared up, and, too the missing pearls must be
found. Surely a detective could help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let him come!&rdquo; Anne spoke almost
pettishly, and I suddenly realized that her composure was forced,
and her self-control was beginning to give way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Archer to me, &ldquo;that Mrs. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s wishes should be law in this matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;but perhaps Mrs. Van
Wyck doesn&rsquo;t realize how customary it is, and how necessary
it is to employ a detective in such a case as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t see him, need I?&rdquo; asked Anne,
raising imploring eyes to mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I began, when Archer interrupted: &ldquo;Of
course you&rsquo;ll have to see him, and he&rsquo;ll ask you all
sorts of questions, and tangle you up so that you won&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As usual, Anne did the unexpected. She suddenly assumed a
dignified, even haughty air, and said: &ldquo;Let him come. Let him
question me as much as he likes. I&rsquo;m not afraid of such
questioning! When will he arrive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;probably
this afternoon, or perhaps before luncheon. I&rsquo;m glad
you&rsquo;re getting your nerve back, Anne, for the inquest will be
held this afternoon, and you will have to testify. Now don&rsquo;t
let yourself get rattled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not get rattled,&rdquo; Anne said, slowly.
&ldquo;But, Connie, I don&rsquo;t want to testify, or whatever you
call it. Why should I? I don&rsquo;t know who killed David, or
anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will be called on,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;and
you must keep your head. Don&rsquo;t break down or anything. Answer
the questions directly and shortly, and you&rsquo;ll soon be let
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was good, sound advice, and I was glad Archer gave it to
her. I wished she would look to me more for counsel or help, but
she seemed to depend on Archer, as on an old friend. Indeed, after
a time, she said, &ldquo;Run away now, will you, Raymond; I have
some things I want to talk over with Connie alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This summary dismissal nearly took my breath away, but I rose
and went off nonchalantly, hiding my chagrin as best I could.</p>

<p>Immediately after luncheon the detective came. Mr. Markham was a
commonplace-looking man, of a manner somewhat self-assured. He was
perhaps even a trifle conceited, but he seemed to have commonsense
and a good grasp of the logical. He was quick and alert of manner
and went about his work in a systematic and methodical way. The
household was divided as to the necessity for his presence. Morland
and Barbara seemed to want him, but Anne and Archer refused to see
him unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>For some reason, Barclay Lasseter appeared deeply incensed at
his presence. Indeed, the secretary abruptly took his hat and went
home when Mr. Markham arrived, saying he would return for the
inquest.</p>

<p>For myself, I listened eagerly to the detective&rsquo;s
opinions. Of course, he was allowed immediate access to the study,
and of course, he made a careful examination of the whole room. But
he found nothing that would throw any light on the mystery, and I
felt a little disappointed at his non-committal attitude. He spent
much time examining locks and bolts and inquiring as to keys. But
he only proved, what we had known before, that the study was
absolutely inaccessible to an intruder. Then, of course, he
declared it must have been a suicide. Then, when he was convinced
of the utter absence of any weapon, and the practical impossibility
of the wound being self-inflicted, he returned to the theory of
murder. He was greatly enthused over the mystery of the case and
the contradictory evidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I may say so,&rdquo; he observed, pompously, &ldquo;I
have been especially fortunate and successful in the criminal cases
which I have undertaken. I have the instinct of a sleuth, and I
discover clues where none seems to exist. But I never before have
had the kind of a case that depends upon proving the presence of an
intruder in a locked room. Now, we know that no one could have
entered this room and left it, locked as it was. And yet, if not a
case of suicide, some one <em>did</em> do so. It is for me to
discover how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Markham made this speech with such an air of having made a
discovery, that I was not surprised when Morland said,
brusquely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We knew already, Mr. Markham, that my father&rsquo;s
death was either a suicide or a murder. We knew, too, that this
room was so securely barred and bolted that we had to force an
entrance. Now we have sent for you to learn if possible the truth
of the matter. But what we want, is not the propounding of the
problem, but its solution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Markham did not appear at all offended by this, and only
said, &ldquo;Quite so, quite so, Mr. Van Wyck. Now I must remind
you that aside from the crime of murder, we have the loss of the
pearls to consider. I must not only solve the mystery of your
father&rsquo;s death, but I must recover those valuable gems. Very
well. I am not, of course, able to do these things in a moment, but
by careful investigation and some shrewd deduction, I hope to
succeed, in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr. Markham,&rdquo; said Morland, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect results at once. Pursue your own methods and
call on any of us for such information or help as you may desire.
Pray consider the house at your disposal, interview the servants if
you choose, and feel at liberty to do what you will,
unquestioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall also,&rdquo; returned the detective,
&ldquo;expect to be allowed to interview members of the family or
guests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, of course,&rdquo; said Morland; &ldquo;but I must
ask of you to spare the feelings of the family as far as you
possibly can, and to intrude upon the guests as little as may
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not surprised at this from Morland, for it seemed to me
that the detective was of a nature so zealous and so unheedful of
others&rsquo; feelings, that he might easily prove an annoying
interviewer.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
The Inquest</strong>
</h3>

<p>Luncheon was served informally. The members of the household and
the guests drifted in and out of the dining-room, where the footmen
served them from a buffet. It chanced that I sat down with Morland
and Archer.</p>

<p>We all said little, but though Morland was quiet, it seemed as
though we were endeavoring not to talk, though he really wanted
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you rather we went away?&rdquo; Archer asked of
him; &ldquo;perhaps you would prefer not to have any guests at
present&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Morland a little irritably.
&ldquo;You two fellows stay on, of course. Perhaps you can help me,
and Lord knows I need help. As to the ladies, they must do as they
choose. Mrs. Stelton wants to remain; but I fear these awful scenes
will prove too much for the nerves of Miss Fordyce. She is so
highly strung&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These scenes are enough to shake the nerves of
anybody,&rdquo; I put in; &ldquo;and you know, Morland, without
being told, that Archer and I stand ready to help you in any way we
can. But I confess I can&rsquo;t find anything to do by way of
assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;but if our presence
here makes it any easier for you, here we stay as long as you wish.
At any rate we can meet some of the visitors, and save you or Mrs.
Van Wyck that annoyance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course everyone in the village knew of the tragedy by this
time, and flocks of curious people were gathering in and about the
house. Soon the whole place was in a turmoil. Neighbors and village
people were coming and going, and everybody was making suggestions
or propounding theories.</p>

<p>Barbara and Morland quarrelled openly; Anne refused to see
anybody; Archer stood around, moody and taciturn; the languid
figure of Beth Fordyce could be seen strolling about the gardens,
wringing her hands in picturesque despair; while Mrs. Stelton
fluttered about everywhere, asking absurd questions and making
herself a general nuisance.</p>

<p>I longed for a little talk with Anne, but decided not to bother
her, so I employed myself answering the questions of the curious
visitors who came and went.</p>

<p>The whole village was up in arms. And yet nobody seemed to care
very much that David Van Wyck was dead. Their all-absorbing
interest was the mystery of the thing. They positively gloated over
the seemingly contradictory facts that a man had met his death in
an inaccessible room and yet apparently not by his own hand.</p>

<p>Dozens of explanations were offered, some ingenious, some
ridiculous; but I listened to them all, hoping that perhaps a
chance shot might hit the truth. For I too was deeply interested in
solving the mystery. Quite apart from my personal connection with
the matter, I felt a stirring of the detective instinct to solve
the problem. And not the least curious phase of it was that
apparently nobody accused or even suspected any individual. The
whole argument seemed to be that it must have been the work of an
expert burglar, and yet that the entrance of such an intruder was
impossible!</p>

<p>Buttonwood Terrace, hitherto so exclusive, was thrown open to
all. Beside the curiosity seekers from the village, many personal
friends and some distant relatives arrived at the house.</p>

<p>As both Anne and Barbara declined to see anybody, Mrs. Carstairs
acted as hostess. She was serene and composed, but with an air of
calm determination that made me wonder what her thoughts might be.
At one time I saw her in earnest colloquy with Mr. Markham. I
burned to know what she was talking about and I asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t want to
testify at the inquest, and she doesn&rsquo;t want her son to,
either. But of course they&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he or they be implicated?&rdquo; I asked, with
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not. More likely it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s
natural instinct to dread such an experience both for herself and
for anyone dear to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought then of the peculiar circumstances of Carstairs and
his mother both hunting for something in the road, and both denying
that they had lost anything. I was about to tell this to Mr.
Markham when he was called away on some matter. And I thought too,
perhaps it was better not to mention the subject until I should
discover what developments might result from the inquest.</p>

<p>Coroner Mellen proved himself capable of conducting matters in a
business-like way. If he appeared hard and heartless it was
probably necessary, considering the work he had to do. The inquest
was to be held at half-past two, and there was much to be done by
way of preparation. The jurymen were arriving, also several
policemen and a number of reporters.</p>

<p>The incoming trains brought people from the city, and many of
the principal men of the village were in attendance. Not everyone
was allowed to enter the house, but the grounds were thronged with
curiosity-seekers and idlers.</p>

<p>As the time neared for the inquest, the great hall began to be
filled with people. A table had been placed in the centre for the
use of the coroner and the reporters, and a group of chairs near by
were intended for the jury.</p>

<p>Seats were reserved for the members of the household, and the
rest of the room was quickly filled by an interested if horrified
audience.</p>

<p>The coroner and the jurymen filed in and took their places, and
as if by the touch of a magic wand, the beautiful reception hall
was transformed into a court-room.</p>

<p>The arrival of the family upon the scene created a decided stir
amongst the audience.</p>

<p>Anne came first, walking with Condron Archer. Her beautiful face
was white, but her eyes were not cast down; instead, she looked
straight ahead of her, but with an unseeing gaze, as if walking in
sleep. Archer led her to a chair and sat down beside her. They were
followed immediately by Barbara and Morland, who were whispering
together as they came in. This brother and sister were often at
variance in their opinions and apparently the present occasion
offered them opportunity for differing views.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stelton and Miss Fordyce followed them, both looking very
much disturbed and embarrassed.</p>

<p>I, myself, came in with Markham, the detective, and behind us
were Mrs. Carstairs and her son. The other servants were
congregated in a nearby room, but Mrs. Carstairs had insisted on
having her son by her side and it had been allowed.</p>

<p>Coroner Mellen was short and sharp in his speech, and wasted
little time in preliminaries. His jury was sworn, and his first
witness on the stand, almost before I realized that the inquest had
begun.</p>

<p>The valet, Carstairs, was the first one questioned. He answered
the coroner in a nervous and agitated manner, and it was clear to
be seen that he was exceedingly ill at ease. To me, however, this
was only a natural result of finding himself implicated in such a
tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the story in your own way,&rdquo; said Coroner
Mellen, speaking a little more kindly, as he observed the
man&rsquo;s demeanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to the master&rsquo;s room this morning, sir, as I
always do, and he wasn&rsquo;t there, and his bed hadn&rsquo;t been
slept in. So as I couldn&rsquo;t think of any place he might be,
except in his study, I went there, sir, and it was locked, and I
couldn&rsquo;t get in. I knocked several times, but nobody
answered; so I went and told Jeannette, and she told Mrs. Van
Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Jeannette?&rdquo; asked Mr. Mellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s maid, sir. And then the
gentlemen came from the dining-room, and they ordered the door
broken in, sir. We called Ranney for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that now; tell us of last evening. When
did you see Mr. Van Wyck last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he was dressing for dinner, sir. And he told me then
that I needn&rsquo;t attend him when he retired. He said he
expected some visitors in the evening, and as he should be up late
I needn&rsquo;t wait up for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you hesitate at that reply?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did. What time did you go to bed yourself last
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At&mdash;at about midnight, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where were you all the evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was down in the village. I went to a ball
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And returned home about midnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The valet did seem disingenuous, and I felt sure that the
coroner doubted his truthfulness. But to my mind the man was merely
confused by the questions shot at him.</p>

<p>During the examination Mrs. Carstairs sat looking at her son.
Her hands were clasped in the intensity of her attention, and I
could see that she was controlling her agitation by sheer force of
will. I had no reason to think the valet had killed his master, but
I couldn&rsquo;t help surmising that either he or his mother, or
both, knew something of the mystery that the others did not. I saw
the coroner was about to dismiss the witness, and I scribbled a
hasty line and passed it to Mr. Mellen, advising him to ask the
valet further questions about the evening before.</p>

<p>The coroner seemed a little at sea in the matter, but he
followed my advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any of the members of the household on your
return last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no&mdash;sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Either the man was actually scared out of his wits, or he was
concealing something; for a more stammering, frightened witness I
never saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An affirmative nod was the only answer, and the valet&rsquo;s
fingers laced and interlaced until I feared he would injure
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The servants,&mdash;did you see any of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; and Carstairs&rsquo;s eyes
rolled wildly, as though he had made a terrifying admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Jeannette, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the servants&rsquo; dining-room, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was she doing there, at midnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was just about to go to attend on Mrs. Van Wyck,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw Jeannette&rsquo;s white face peeping in from the next
room, and she looked about as terrified as the valet himself. In an
undertone, I drew Mr. Markham&rsquo;s attention to this fact, but
he seemed to think it unimportant, and said that servants were
always rattled at being made publicly conspicuous.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t entirely agree with him, and I felt fully
convinced that Carstairs and Jeannette had knowledge of some sort
bearing on the tragedy. I glanced at Anne, and found that she, like
Mrs. Carstairs, was simply holding herself together by strong will
power.</p>

<p>The others were not so deeply affected. The Van Wyck brother and
sister were quiet and composed, though Morland had that same effect
of being ready to break out indignantly at any moment. Mrs. Stelton
was frankly interested in the proceedings, and showed it in her
eager countenance; but Miss Fordyce sat with closed eyes, as if
overcome by the whole affair. Archer looked grave, but as he
continually glanced toward Anne, I was certain that he felt even
more solicitude for her well-being than for the developments of the
case.</p>

<p>Apparently the coroner thought the valet&rsquo;s evidence not of
crucial importance, for he concluded by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any of the members of the household on your
return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None but the servants, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see Mr. Van Wyck in his room or in his
study?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This answer, at least, was given without hesitation, and,
apparently satisfied, the coroner dismissed the witness.</p>

<p>Ranney, the garage mechanician, was next called. His testimony
was straightforward, and he was entirely unembarrassed, and indeed
seemed almost uninterested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morland called me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and ordered
me to pick the lock of the study door. Of course, with my knowledge
of mechanics, I could do this; and as it was then bolted, he
ordered me to saw out the piece of wood containing the bolt. This I
did, and we opened the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live in the house?&rdquo; asked Mr. Mellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I live in a cottage near the stables and
garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did you retire last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early, sir; between nine and ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you awake at or about midnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before replying, Ranney gave a long steady glance at Carstairs.
The valet returned it with a belligerent stare that seemed to
convey a threat. I was surprised at the directness of this glance,
after Carstairs&rsquo;s exhibition of nervousness. Apparently it
was entirely intelligible to Ranney, for he set his jaw with grim
determination, and proceeded to answer the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wakeful off and on, all night, sir. I can&rsquo;t
say as I was awake at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and I can&rsquo;t say
as I wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a light sleeper, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you would have heard if anything unusual was taking
place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean here at the house, sir? Because my cottage is
too far away for me to hear burglars or anything like
that&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear or see anything unusual at any time during
the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Ranney hesitated, again he looked at Carstairs, this time
including Mrs. Carstairs in his glance.</p>

<p>To my surprise, while the valet still had a threatening aspect,
his mother smiled slightly at Ranney. It was a strange smile, a
little coaxing and of a persuasive charm.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether anyone else noticed this by-play, and
the detective paid no attention to it whatever, but it interested
me. And I thoroughly believed that it was in response to Mrs.
Carstairs&rsquo;s beseeching glance, that Ranney said, firmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, nothing did I hear or see all night
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe him. To me it was a palpable untruth, but
I saw a quiet smile of satisfaction on Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s face,
and a victorious gleam in the eyes of her son. What it all meant, I
didn&rsquo;t know, and I began to think perhaps I was making too
much of it, when suddenly I remembered Miss Fordyce&rsquo;s account
of the motor car and the man she had seen from her window. Could
Ranney or Carstairs know anything about this, and did it bear on
the mystery? I glanced at Miss Fordyce, but she still sat with
closed eyes, and looked like one in a trance. I doubted if she had
even heard Ranney&rsquo;s evidence, or that of the valet.</p>

<p>But I argued to myself that it would be wiser for me to say
nothing, and wait until the testimony of Miss Fordyce should be
called for; when she would have to tell about the motor car, and I
could then see if either of these servants showed any guilty
knowledge.</p>

<p>Next came the evidence of the doctor.</p>

<p>He deposed that he had been the Van Wyck family physician for a
great many years. He told of being called that morning to
Buttonwood Terrace, and of his seeing the body of David Van Wyck.
It was his opinion after examination that Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
death occurred about midnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what cause?&rdquo; asked the coroner. &ldquo;I
frankly admit,&rdquo; said Doctor Mason, &ldquo;that I am puzzled
as to the instrument which caused Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s death. I
have made an examination of the body, and I find no bullet or shot.
I conclude, therefore, that he was stabbed with some sharp, pointed
instrument which has left a small circular hole in the clothing and
the flesh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it have been a hat-pin?&rdquo; asked the
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it could not,&rdquo; declared the doctor, a little
shortly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why people are so ready to
assume a hat-pin. As a matter of fact, a hat-pin is a most
impracticable weapon. It would either bend double or break off if
used for such a purpose. Nor was it a dagger&mdash;of any usual
description. A dagger or a knife would leave a slit-like incision,
and the mark in question is absolutely circular. I can only say
that the weapon must have been sharp-pointed and round. Further
than that, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could the wound have been self-inflicted?&rdquo; asked
the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far as its position is concerned, yes; but it is
improbable that a man could have sufficient force of nerve to stab
himself in that manner, for it meant a sure, strong drive of the
weapon. Also, it is improbable that after that thrust the victim
could live long enough to draw out the weapon and hide or dispose
of it. And I understand it has not been found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mr. Mellen; &ldquo;it has not yet
been found, but it may be eventually discovered. It is your
opinion, then, Doctor Mason, that David Van Wyck was not a
suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my opinion,&rdquo; returned Doctor Mason
positively.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="X" id="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
Further Evidence</strong>
</h3>

<p>Next came Barclay Lasseter, the secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name and position?&rdquo; asked the coroner,
curtly.</p>

<p>For some reason the young man showed rather a defiant
attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Barclay Lasseter, and my position was that of
secretary to David Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confidential secretary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, private and confidential secretary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For how long have you held that position?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little over a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are your duties?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My duties have been, to do whatever Mr. Van Wyck required
of me in the way of attention to his correspondence and business
affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I board in the village. But frequently, at Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s request, I&rsquo;ve stayed here over night, or for a
few days at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When were you last with Mr. Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last evening, when a committee of three gentlemen visited
him in his study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s intention to make a gift of
nearly a million dollars for a village library, and three prominent
men of the village were a committee to accept this gift and
superintend its disposal as directed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This evidence caused a decided sensation in the audience. The
library plan had been a secret until now, and the village people
were astounded at the news. The coroner went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As confidential secretary you must know all about the
details of this plan for the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only know that it was Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s positive
intention to make the gift. Papers were drawn up to that effect
last evening, but they were not completed and not
signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And those papers have been stolen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning that Mr. Van Wyck may have disposed of them
himself, before he died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning nothing, but that the papers are missing, and I
have no way of ascertaining whether they were stolen or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Van Wyck pearls? They are also
missing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were always kept in the safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always, but usually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When not in the safe, where were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the possession of Mrs. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she prefer to keep them in her own
possession?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question seemed to me too personal, and I noticed both
Archer and Morland showed frowning faces at the coroner&rsquo;s
words.</p>

<p>But Lasseter answered decidedly: &ldquo;She certainly did. The
possession of the pearls was a constant source of disagreement
between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This roused me to extreme indignation, but as I looked at Anne,
and saw the calm, even supercilious expression on her face, I
concluded I was too sensitive in the matter, and probably it was
necessary that these things should come out in the evidence. I knew
David Van Wyck&rsquo;s disposition, and it was not at all
astonishing that he and Anne should have quarrelled about the
pearls. I knew they were hers in the sense that he had given them
to her. But I knew, too, that he claimed the ownership of all and
any of her property. However, it was very ungracious of Lasseter to
volunteer the information as to marital disagreements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you last see Mr. Van Wyck alive?&rdquo; Mr.
Mellen next inquired of the witness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was present at his conference with the committee. Those
gentlemen stayed until well after eleven. I then remained with Mr.
Van Wyck until very nearly twelve, leaving for home, I should say,
at about ten minutes before midnight&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s study, and went directly to
your home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; returned Lasseter, and, though the answer
was prompt, there was something about the man&rsquo;s voice that
made me doubt his integrity. I had no reason to question the truth
of his statement, but his wandering eye, a certain nervous working
of his features, and his restless clasping and unclasping of his
hands made me wonder whether or not he had anything to conceal. But
I also realized that the curt, almost aggressive manner of Coroner
Mellen was enough to disturb the poise of the most innocent
witness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left Mr. Van Wyck alone in his study?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so. His son, Morland, was with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not!&rdquo; declared Morland, starting up from his
seat not far from me.</p>

<p>Lasseter paid no attention to this interruption, and the coroner
said, &ldquo;Why does Mr. Morland Van Wyck contradict you, Mr.
Lasseter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the secretary. &ldquo;I
repeat that when I left the study, I left Mr. Van Wyck and his son
there, and I said good-night to both as I went out of the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they respond to your good-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The elder Mr. Van Wyck said, &lsquo; Good-night,
Lasseter,&rsquo; in his offhand way, and immediately followed it
with a remark to his son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the remark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;You see, Morland, I have proved that I
could carry out my intention, after all.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did Mr. Morland Van Wyck reply to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot say, as I was by that time outside the door
and had closed it behind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing more of this matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time I saw Mr. Van Wyck was when I arrived here
this morning and found him dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are positive that when you left last night Mr.
Morland Van Wyck was in the study with his father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a breathless silence. It was quite evident from the
expressions on the faces of the audience that they had leaped to
the conclusion that Morland Van Wyck had killed his father because
of the plan for endowing a library. The villagers had become aware
of the situation so suddenly, and had been so astonished at the
munificence of the gift, that it seemed to them but natural that
the Van Wyck family should resent this disposal of a fortune. But
the thought of Morland committing a crime because of it appalled
them, and looks of horror could be seen on every face. Morland Van
Wyck was next called as a witness.</p>

<p>The sight of his livid, angry face seemed to render the coroner
incapable of definite questions. &ldquo;What have you to say for
yourself?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have this to say,&rdquo; thundered Morland:
&ldquo;Barclay Lasseter lies when he says he left me with my
father! The truth is, I left the study before Lasseter did. I left
him there with my father, and if he states the contrary, he has his
own reason for doing so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are implying&mdash;&rdquo; began the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m implying nothing!&rdquo; Morland stormed on.
&ldquo;I am stating that I left my father and his secretary alone
in the study. And I am stating nothing but that.&rdquo; He threw a
defiant look at the secretary, who returned it in kind. Coroner
Mellen was decidedly nonplussed. He seemed to fear an outbreak of
personal hostilities between these two, and he said hastily,
&ldquo;Let us not pursue this further. One of you gentlemen must be
mistaken. Mr. Van Wyck, have you any opinion or theory as to the
cause of your father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought this rather clever of the coroner, for it would bring
forth either an accusation of the secretary or a tacit implication
of freedom from suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My opinion is the only one possible to hold. My father
was murdered by some evil-minded intruder. Presumably an expert
burglar, because valuable jewels and valuable papers have been
stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how, in your opinion, could this intruder commit his
crimes and get away, leaving the room securely locked and bolted on
the inside, with no possible means of ingress or egress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not prepared to say how he did it; the fact
remains that he did do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point a juryman made a remark. He was a shrewd-faced
young fellow, and seemed imbued with a sense of his own
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that we should
like at least a suggestion as to how the murderer could have
escaped from a room which we may call hermetically
sealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland turned on him with an impatient gesture. &ldquo;I hate
that term &lsquo;hermetically sealed&rsquo;! It is absurd, to begin
with. That my father&rsquo;s murderer did get out of the room is
proved by the fact that the instrument of death cannot be found.
Therefore, since the murderer did get out, the room cannot be
hermetically sealed, however much it may appear so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can there be any secret or concealed entrance?&rdquo;
asked the alert juryman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Morland; &ldquo;there is nothing of
that sort in the house. And the study is really a separate
building, only attached at one corner. Moreover, a burglar, however
enterprising, could hardly know of a secret entrance of which we
did not know ourselves! I tell you, Mr. Coroner, the murderer got
away after the clever fashion of a cracksman who knows his
business. How he did it, I cannot tell you; but he killed my
father, stole the Van Wyck pearls, stole also the deed of gift
which had been drawn up for the village library, and then escaped.
Escaped, Mr. Coroner, and is therefore still at large! But he must
be found, and no effort must be spared to find him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at Morland in astonishment. He had assumed a rather
pompous attitude and seemed to be giving orders instead of giving
evidence.</p>

<p>Coroner Mellen looked greatly disturbed. I felt sure that he was
beginning to realize that the case was more than he could cope
with. His limited intelligence could not grapple with the mysteries
and contradictions that confronted him.</p>

<p>Also, he began to realize that Morland had a high temper, and
that if aggravated much further he might create an unpleasant
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are even now using our best efforts to discover the
criminal, Mr. Van Wyck,&rdquo; Mr. Mellen went on. &ldquo;And I
count upon you for assistance in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I assist you?&rdquo; Morland blazed. &ldquo;If I
knew anything at all about the matter I should volunteer the
information, without having it dragged out of me! You must hold
your inquest, of course; but it will tell you nothing, for the
problem is too deep and too mysterious to be solved easily. We have
engaged a detective in whom I have confidence; but the truth cannot
be learned by questioning witnesses. However, Mr. Coroner, proceed
with your duties and get them over as soon as may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I am doing,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellen, with a
sudden accession of dignity. &ldquo;And in order to proceed
properly, I must insist upon asking you some further questions,
even at the risk of being considered personal. Were you on good
terms with your father at the time of his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; thundered Morland. &ldquo;Of course I was! I
have never been on anything but good terms with my father. To be
sure we&rsquo;ve had differences of opinion, and we never hesitated
to state plainly our views to each other, but I don&rsquo;t call
that being on bad terms with him. In case of a disagreement we
fought it out as man to man. Naturally, I objected to his foolish
plan of founding a library of proportions and values altogether too
great for a tiny village like Crescent Falls. Naturally I told him
so. As he was very determined in the matter, we had high words on
various occasions; and last night matters came to a
climax.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by came to a climax?&rdquo; The coroner
fairly pounced on this phrase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say! The climax of my father&rsquo;s plan
was reached, when he called the committeemen to meet him and accept
his absurd gift! I do not blame these gentlemen. They would have
been foolish, indeed, to refuse a gift so freely offered to them. I
was present myself at the interview, and I used every argument I
could think of, to dissuade my father from his project. But I think
I may say, and I think the gentlemen of the committee will bear me
out in this, that every objection I raised, only made my father
more determined to have his own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three men who had represented the committee were all
present, and they nodded their heads in confirmation of
Morland&rsquo;s statement.</p>

<p>I looked at Morland thoughtfully. At one moment I would feel
convinced that he was really a good son, and that it was beyond
belief that he should have raised his hand against his own father.
And then I realized his ungovernable temper, and his uncontrollable
fits of passion, and knowing that last night had been indeed the
climax of the whole subject, I wondered if a sudden spasm of
passion could have made Morland so beside himself with rage, that
he was almost irresponsible, and had in a frenzy committed the
awful deed. And then rose in my mind the old question; even
supposing he had, how did he get out of the locked room? It seemed
to me that the theory of murder was impossible, unless we could
discover some means of exit from that sealed study.</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen looked very much perturbed. He seemed unwilling to
accuse Morland, and he had no evidence whatever against him. There
was a breathless silence in the room, and I could not blind myself
to the fact that there was a hostile atmosphere toward young Van
Wyck. It was quite evident, too, that he noticed this himself, and
assumed a defiant air in consequence. His whole nature was touchy,
and it was characteristic of him to show bravado when an accusation
was even implied.</p>

<p>Coroner Mellen looked at him intently and seemed uncertain what
to do next.</p>

<p>But he must proceed, and so, with a baffled air, he dismissed
Morland and called Barbara Van Wyck.</p>

<p>The girl took the stand with no apparent trepidation, and calmly
awaited questioning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you tell us of this affair?&rdquo; asked the
coroner briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you no facts that you do not already
know,&rdquo; returned Barbara, in even tones and with perfect poise
of manner. &ldquo;But I wish to advance a theory totally different
from my brother&rsquo;s. To repeat the phrase already used, my
father&rsquo;s study <em>was</em> &lsquo;hermetically
sealed.&rsquo; It was <em>impossible</em> for an intruder to get in
and out again, leaving the room as we found it this morning. I
myself examined the windows and doors, and I assure you that not
only are the locks and bolts especially strong, but they are so
complicated as to make it impossible to manipulate them from the
outside. I hold, therefore, that my father was not murdered, but
that he took his own life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the robberies?&rdquo; suggested the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were no robberies. The pearls have disappeared, but
I am positive that my father hid them, and that they will yet be
discovered. The deed of gift he doubtless destroyed himself, and
then took his own life. My father was a very eccentric man, and it
is my opinion that at the last his brain gave way, and for what he
did he was not mentally or morally responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something in the girl&rsquo;s words and manner that
carried conviction. Her quiet, dignified composure was so different
from Morland&rsquo;s belligerent insistence that the sympathy of
all present seemed to go out to her. All over the room heads were
nodding approval of her theory, and it seemed quite in keeping with
the erratic career of David Van Wyck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Van Wyck,&rdquo; said the coroner, and he
seemed to speak with a certain diffidence, &ldquo;if your theory is
right, what became of the weapon used by your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, nor do I know what that weapon could have
been. But I hold that that may yet be discovered, and I hold too
that the absence of that weapon is not so inexplicable a mystery as
is the question of how a burglar could escape from that
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true so far as it went. We were confronted by two
seeming impossibilities: if a suicide, the weapon could not have
disappeared; if a murder, the murderer could not have made his exit
from that sealed room. As theories, one might take one&rsquo;s
choice!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think, then,&rdquo; Mr. Mellen was saying, &ldquo;the
missing pearls will yet be found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Barbara. &ldquo;I think
that my father hid them with the unnatural cunning of a diseased
mind. For I am perfectly certain that my father was not sane when
he took his own life. And if the same ingenuity which marked the
manner of his death prompted his hiding of the pearls, it may well
be possible that we shall never find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at Miss Van Wyck in amazement. The girl I had thought
so colorless and inane was proving possessed of an unsuspected
strength of character. Her simple, logical statements carried great
weight, and, though she left unsolved a principal point, many of
her listeners showed a decided willingness to subscribe to her
theories.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
Archer&rsquo;s Theory</strong>
</h3>

<p>For some reason best known to himself, the coroner next called
upon the three men who formed the village committee. These were Mr.
Millar, Mr. Brandt and Mr. Garson. As he had been chairman of the
committee, Mr. Brandt was chosen to speak for the three.</p>

<p>The witness was a middle-aged and dignified-looking man of a
fine presence. He told in a straightforward manner of the proposed
gift from Mr. Van Wyck to the village. He said further that the
committee thought the project was extravagant, and they felt much
hesitation on accepting the library. But, he said, the more they
demurred, the more insistent Mr. Van Wyck became. And he finally
persuaded them that they had no right to refuse so valuable an
institution for their village, and so, he concluded, they had
decided to accept it and had come the night before to attend to the
formalities.</p>

<p>It was clearly impossible to connect these gentlemen in any way
with the crime, but I surmised that Mr. Mellen hoped to get some
important evidence from them. He questioned Mr. Brandt closely as
to the attitude and behavior of Morland Van Wyck during the
evening, and also inquired concerning the secretary.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brandt said nothing enlightening. He admitted that the
Van Wycks, father and son, had discussed the project hotly, he even
admitted that the discussion could properly be called a quarrel. Of
the secretary he had nothing to say, as he had merely performed
clerical duties and took no part in the actual business of the
meeting.</p>

<p>The necessary papers, constituting the Deed of Gift had been
drawn but not signed. For technical reasons they had been left over
night in the possession of Mr. Van Wyck, who had said he would put
them in his safe.</p>

<p>Mr. Brandt further testified that the three committeemen had
left at about quarter after eleven, and that Mr. Van Wyck had
bidden them a hearty and pleasant good-night. Mr. Brandt spoke for
his committee in expressing regret that the Deed of Gift was
missing. And indeed it was quite evident that that regret occupied
the minds of the three men almost to the entire exclusion of the
more tragic happening.</p>

<p>This shocked me, until I remembered that they were only slightly
acquainted with David Van Wyck, and even that acquaintance was not
of a friendly character. Perhaps, then, it was not to be wondered
at that they felt more keenly the loss of the projected gift than
the loss of its giver.</p>

<p>I was secretly glad that the Deed of Gift was lost, although
being unsigned it was probably valueless. But since David Van Wyck
was dead, I felt a decided satisfaction that his fortune must
necessarily remain in his own family instead of being given
away.</p>

<p>Next to give evidence were the guests of the house. Mrs. Stelton
seemed almost to enjoy the importance of being questioned as a
witness, and answered volubly and with an evident intention of
making a good impression on the audience. She spoke to them rather
than to the coroner, and showed a certain personal interest that
was clearly meant to imply that she was or would some time be a
permanent member of the Van Wyck household. And yet, though she
cast frequent glances at Morland, they were not always responded
to, nor did he seem absorbedly interested in what she was saying.
Then, too, her testimony was of no importance whatever. She could
tell nothing that was not already known, and her opinions were
absolutely valueless.</p>

<p>She was soon dismissed, and Beth Fordyce took her place.</p>

<p>As she rose from her seat and went slowly forward to the chair
indicated for her, she looked so listless and distracted that I
wondered if she would be able to repeat the story she had told
me.</p>

<p>I think Mr. Mellen gathered from her appearance that her
evidence would not be of much importance, for after a few
preliminary details, he said in a most uninterested way, &ldquo;Can
you tell us, Miss Fordyce, of any circumstance or evidence bearing
on the case that we have not already heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly can,&rdquo; and Beth Fordyce&rsquo;s blue
eyes lighted up as if with a realization of her own
self-importance.</p>

<p>And then in a manner which amazed me, she gave a clear and
definite account of the motor car, and the strange man she had seen
the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not sure it was a man,&rdquo; she said, as she
came to that part of her story. &ldquo;I saw only a medium-sized
person with a long coat on, and as the figure crawled stealthily
along in the shadow of the house, I could not discern if it might
be a man or a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is indeed most important, Miss Fordyce,&rdquo; said
the coroner, evidently pleased to find something to work on.
&ldquo;It is extremely probable that the figure you saw, was that
of the criminal we are seeking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what good does that do,&rdquo; inquired Miss Fordyce,
earnestly, &ldquo;Since you have no idea who the person could have
been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we may be able to find out. At least we have a
tangible clue to work upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clue seemed to me a most intangible one, and I
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that any story of Beth Fordyce&rsquo;s
would have to be corroborated by some one else, before it could
have much weight with me. I glanced at Markham and saw that he was
intently studying the face of the witness as he made a few notes on
a bit of paper. Without a doubt he meant to interview her alone
later. Of course the appearance of a strange motor at midnight was
exceedingly important, if true. But who could say it was not one of
the hallucinations or visions to which Miss Fordyce was
unfortunately subject?</p>

<p>I looked at the others. Barbara and Morland looked frankly
incredulous. They knew the girl, and I know they thought her story
might be true and might not. Anne looked eager, as if hoping that
here was at least a beginning of the solution of the mystery.
Archer looked uninterested, and kept his eyes on Anne, as if trying
to read her thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs and her son were greatly agitated. Mrs. Carstairs
controlled it and the valet did not. But as they had been agitated
during most of the inquest, I could not tell whether Miss
Fordyce&rsquo;s story had made any special impression on them or
not. And then, again, I remembered their search in the road. Could
there be any connection between their mysterious searching and the
mysterious motor car?</p>

<p>But Miss Fordyce was still on the witness stand. The coroner
evidently thought that she was an important witness after all and
questioned her on many subjects. In response to one of his
inquiries, she repeated a remark which Morland had made to his
father at dinner the night before. This speech was to the effect
that Mr. Van Wyck would be sorry if he carried out his plan. I
couldn&rsquo;t believe that Beth intended even to cast a shadow of
suspicion in Morland&rsquo;s direction, but, to the eager crowd
waiting for a straw to show which way the wind blew, this speech
was indicative. And yet, quite unconscious, apparently, of having
said anything by way of suggestion, Beth took her seat, placid and
unruffled.</p>

<p>But to Morland, evidently the shaft had struck home. He
remembered he had said that to his father, he realized that it
might react against him. I thought of this, too, and then I
remembered that Lasseter had sworn that he had left Morland alone
with his father, and Morland had given him the lie!</p>

<p>But already Archer was testifying. The gist of his evidence was
practically the same as the others, but he related it in a concise,
straightforward way that held the attention of his hearers. He said
that he had said good-night to the ladies at about half-past ten
the night before, and that then, in company with me, he had gone to
the smoking-room, where we stayed for perhaps half an hour, both
going to our rooms at about eleven o&rsquo;clock. He then told of
our meeting again at the breakfast-table, and of Anne&rsquo;s
coming to the dining-room to tell us of Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
non-appearance. Of course the rest of his story was practically a
repetition of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any theory regarding the crime?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Mellen, and the oft-repeated question took on a new interest as
Archer said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly a theory, but I should like to suggest
an idea that may or may not be plausible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the coroner, with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will sound absurd,&rdquo; said Archer
slowly and seriously; &ldquo;but it is the only explanation I can
think of, which would be even a possible solution of the mystery.
Though I&rsquo;m not a detective, nor can I deduce facts from
circumstantial evidence or clues, yet this possibility I speak of
is merely an adaptation of a story I once read. In this story, a
well-known work of fiction, a young woman was found murdered; and
the weapon could not be discovered, although it had left a small,
round hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Intense interest was manifest all over the room. Necks were
craned to get a better view of the speaker. The listeners fairly
hung on his words, and many felt that the mystery was about to be
solved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; went on Archer, &ldquo;the weapon used
was a sharp, slender icicle. As you may readily understand, it
performed its fatal deed and then melted, leaving no trace. As you
can see, this is not only possible, but both credible and
plausible. At this season there are no icicles, but I offer, merely
as a suggestion, that if Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s death is a suicide,
may it not be that the weapon was an icicle, shaped, let us say, by
his own hand, from a piece of ice taken from the water
pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; The whispered exclamation came from
Lasseter, the secretary. He was staring at Archer, and muttering
beneath his breath. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s struck it!&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only solution, and it must be the
right one! Clever fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t deduce it,&rdquo; I whispered back to the
secretary, for, to tell the truth, I was a little jealous that I
hadn&rsquo;t thought of it myself; for I, too, had read the book in
question. &ldquo;He merely remembered having read of such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; returned Lasseter;
&ldquo;and I wish I&rsquo;d thought of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner was greatly impressed with this new idea. He turned
to Doctor Mason and asked his opinion.</p>

<p>The old doctor looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it
was impossible; but you must remember, gentlemen, the hole left by
the weapon in this case is small and perfectly round. Would it not
be difficult to make, artificially, a smooth, round icicle, strong
enough to pierce clothing and flesh, and strike the heart with a
fatal blow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult,&rdquo; said the coroner,
&ldquo;but I must admit it seems to me the only solution. By the
process of elimination, we must conclude that this is the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective, Markham, who had
scant patience with the coroner&rsquo;s pompous manner.
&ldquo;Consider the facts. Let us suppose a pitcher of ice water
had been brought into the room. Was it?&rdquo; he looked round
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morland; &ldquo;Father rang for it, and
the butler brought it in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock, I should say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; triumphantly went on the detective,
&ldquo;then I hold that after twelve o&rsquo;clock there would not
be sufficient ice left in the pitcher from which to make this
deadly icicle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Mason nodded his head, and, indeed, we all felt that the
icicle theory was rather untenable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;it is merely a
suggestion toward the explanation of the mystery. It may or may not
be the correct solution. But what seems to me more important is to
learn who was the last person to see Mr. Van Wyck alive. The
absence of that deed of gift seems to me a very peculiar feature. A
burglar would take pearls or money, but he would have no reason for
taking that deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner looked thoughtful. &ldquo;If Mr. Van Wyck was
murdered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there must have been a motive for
the deed. It is true that a burglar would desire only money or
valuables. We must conceive, then, the deed being done, that the
murderer&mdash;if it is a murder&mdash;must have been some one
interested in keeping Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s fortune away from the
library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner had only put into words what everybody present had
been uneasily thinking. The missing deed seemed to prove that the
murderer was one of the household. For who, except the members of
the family, would care whether Mr. Van Wyck gave away his money or
not.</p>

<p>Of course my glance flew straight to Anne, to see how she took
this blow. She sat very still, and her face was white even to the
lips. I could see it was only by a brave exercise of will-power
that she kept herself from collapse. Morland looked angry and
belligerent He glared at Lasseter, and the secretary responded with
a stare equally unfriendly. Barbara looked horror-stricken. She
seemed about to speak, and then shut her lips tightly, as if
determined to say nothing at this crisis. In agony, my heart cried,
&ldquo;Anybody but Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was unable to keep still. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;You are theorizing without data. Your implication is
unwarranted and false.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner looked at me, not reprovingly, but as if deeply
interested. Then he dismissed Archer from the stand.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>Chapter
XII<br>
Anne&rsquo;s Testimony</strong>
</h3>

<p>Mrs. Van Wyck was next called to testify. If Barbara had
appeared calm and composed, the same could not be said of Anne. She
was white and trembling to the very lips; she tottered as she
walked, and with an audible sigh she sank into the chair placed for
her. But all this, at least to my mind, in no way impaired her
strange, eerie beauty. Her large gray eyes looked almost black
against the whiteness of her pallor, and as she swept a mournful,
unseeing glance round the room, I endeavored to intercept her gaze
and give her a nod of sympathy and help. But she did not look at
me, and, clasping her hands in her lap, prepared to meet the ordeal
of the coroner&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen looked at her for a moment before he spoke, and his
hard face took on a slightly softer expression at the sight of her
evident distress.</p>

<p>In what he doubtless meant to be a gentle voice, he said,
&ldquo;When did you last see your husband alive, Mrs. Van
Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my surprise, Anne showed a decided agitation. She clasped her
hands tightly to her breast, and in a choked, almost inaudible
voice she replied, &ldquo;When he left me after dinner, to go to
his study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was then in good health and spirits?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Mellen, and a more inane question I never heard. It seemed
perfunctory, as if the man scarcely knew how to broach the
subject.</p>

<p>For a moment Anne simply stared at her questioner, as if trying
to control her voice. Then she said, &ldquo;My husband was in
perfect health, and&mdash;yes, I think I may say he was in good
spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were his last words to you as he left
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If this were a random shot, it was certainly a peculiar
coincidence. For we all remembered how, as he left the room, David
Van Wyck had whispered to his wife something that had caused her
the deepest emotion.</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s great eyes looked at each of us in turn. After the
briefest glance at the others, she gazed longer at Archer. It may
have been my imagination, but I thought he gave to her an almost
imperceptible negative shake of his head. She looked frightened,
and then her glance met mine. I so feared that any appearance of
secrecy on her part would be prejudicial to her, that I nodded my
head affirmatively, meaning for her to answer the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I tell that?&rdquo; she asked in a pained voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellen; &ldquo;especially if it has
any bearing on Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Anne did not hear the coroner&rsquo;s words. She was nerving
herself for her reply, and she said in a low voice, but distinctly,
&ldquo;As he left me, my husband whispered to me that he would give
the Van Wyck pearls as well as his gift of money to the library
committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wave of indignation swept over the audience. Anxious as the
villagers were for the gift of the library, not one of them would
have wished Anne Van Wyck&rsquo;s jewels sacrificed in its
cause.</p>

<p>Elated by the sensational answer, the coroner continued.
&ldquo;Did he say anything more?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I tell that?&rdquo; Anne scarcely breathed, her face
as white as the handkerchief she held.</p>

<p>And the coroner said inexorably, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had Anne looked toward me then, I should have shaken my head,
for I feared from her expression that the revelation would be a
startling one. She looked dazed, she spoke almost as one in a
trance, but she said clearly, &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;<em>Now</em>
don&rsquo;t you wish I was dead?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubtless it was unconscious and involuntary, but Anne had
reproduced almost exactly the jeering tones of David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s sarcastic voice, and not one of us doubted that those
were the very words and the very inflection that had sounded in her
ear as he had whispered to her just before leaving the
drawing-room. I well remembered the agonized expression on her face
as he turned away from her, and I knew that at this moment she was
vividly seeing a picture of the scene.</p>

<p>The audience fairly rustled with this new sensation. The coroner
seemed spurred, and with great enthusiasm continued his
catechising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did he say that?&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;Had
you wished him dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of indignation was heard from the audience, and both
Archer and Morland started as if about to protest.</p>

<p>But Anne raised her clear eyes to the coroner&rsquo;s face, and
said coldly, &ldquo;No, I had never wished such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did he speak that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck was quick-tempered and very sarcastic of
speech,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I can only explain his remark by
assuming that it was prompted by anger and sarcasm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck was angry, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was angry because the members of his family were
opposed to his plan of giving away practically all his fortune to a
public institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then Mr. Van Wyck left you, and you never saw him
again alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that is so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Except for a slight hesitation, the statement was direct, but it
was manifestly untrue. Anne&rsquo;s eyes fell, the color came and
went in her cheeks, her foot tapped nervously on the floor, and she
was rapidly tying her handkerchief into knots. A more agonized,
indeed a more guilty, demeanor could not have been manifested.</p>

<p>At that moment my eyes met hers, and it flashed across me that
she and I had looked in at the window of the study and had seen Mr.
Van Wyck in colloquy with the committee. Perhaps it was telepathy
that carried the same thought to her, for she said suddenly, and I
know she spoke truly, &ldquo;Oh, yes, I did see him again after
that! I was walking on the terrace later, and I saw him through the
study window, talking with his visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour was this?&rdquo; inquired the coroner, as if
the exact time of the incident were the turning-point of the whole
case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Anne carelessly.
&ldquo;Perhaps about half-past nine or quarter of ten, I should
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen looked a little crestfallen, as if an important bit
of evidence had gone wrong. To my mind, he certainly was a
block-head, but, after all, he was merely there to ask questions,
and, if the jurymen desired, they could supplement his inquiries. I
glanced at the detective, Markham, to see how he took it. He was
exceedingly attentive to what was going on, and sat with his head
slightly forward and his eyes alert, apparently gleaning more
information than was offered by the mere spoken words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; pursued the coroner, &ldquo;after that
glimpse through the window, you never saw your husband again
alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne answered this in the negative, but so low and uncertain was
her voice that she was obliged to repeat it twice before the
coroner was satisfied with her reply. I felt a vague alarm. If Anne
were speaking the truth, why should she act so strangely about it?
And if, by any chance, she was not veracious, she must know that
her manner was unconvincing. I had no interest in any one else who
might be implicated in the tragedy, but my heart again cried out,
&ldquo;Anybody but Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time did you retire, Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo; went
on the questioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to my room about half-past ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you retired then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not. I read for a time, and wrote some letters, and
went to bed about midnight. Or perhaps it was later&mdash;I dare
say it was one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t notice the time. Perhaps my maid can
tell you. She was with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So casual was Anne&rsquo;s manner now that the coroner seemed to
realize his questions were not of particular importance, and he
tried a new tack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your husband kind to you, Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne stared at him coldly for a few seconds, and then spoke with
great deliberation: &ldquo;I decline to answer such a question, and
I&rsquo;m sure you are overstepping your rights in asking
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her manner even more than her words abashed the coroner, but to
cover his chagrin he became insistent. &ldquo;It is necessary that
I should know if there was harmony between you,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;I regret that the circumstances make it necessary for me to
press the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s eyes flashed. Her agitation was gone now, and her
poise and calmness seemed to disconcert her inquisitor even more
than her embarrassment had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was perfect harmony between us,&rdquo; she said,
holding her head proudly and looking straight at the coroner,
&ldquo;with the exception of this matter of the library. I tried to
dissuade my husband from his intent, for his own sake quite as much
as for my own, for I felt sure he would regret such quixotic
generosity. But he was determined to proceed in his plan, in spite
of my protests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And at the last moment he decided to add the valuable
jewels to his gift?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; his words to me last evening were the first
intimation I had had that he meant to give away the Van Wyck
pearls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you any reason to doubt your husband&rsquo;s
sanity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None, except in this matter of the library gift. Nor do I
call that insanity; but rather a monomania which possessed him
temporarily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think your late husband hid the pearls, or do you
think they have been stolen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can form no opinion, as my husband&rsquo;s death is so
wrapped in mystery. He may have secreted the pearls or they may
have been stolen by an expert burglar. Personally, I have no
theories on the subject. It is all utterly mysterious to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne passed her hand wearily across her brow with a gesture of
exhaustion. I think this roused the coroner&rsquo;s sympathy, and
he excused her from further questioning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs was next called as a witness. There was a stir
among the audience as she rose and walked slowly to the witness
chair.</p>

<p>It was quite evident that considerable curiosity was felt
regarding this woman.</p>

<p>I expected she would appear perturbed, but instead, she had a
calm air of superiority and held her head high as if entirely
mistress of the situation.</p>

<p>In spite of myself, I was obliged to admit that her face was
fascinating in its expression, quite apart from the real beauty of
her features. And then I suddenly realized that this remarkable
woman was deliberately trying to charm the coroner by her
demeanor!</p>

<p>She was beautifully gowned, as always, in black lustreless
<em>cr&ecirc;pe de chine</em>, which clung to her beautiful figure
in long sinuous lines and which, to my imagination, gave her the
effect of a beautiful serpent. Her personality affected me
unpleasantly and yet absorbed my attention entirely. She was so
evidently conscious of the effect she produced, that it was as
interesting as a play to watch her.</p>

<p>The very way in which she sat in her chair was a picture of
itself. But it was no strained or forced pose, merely the careless
grace of a perfectly poised woman. I glanced at Anne, and was
surprised to see that she, too, was looking at Mrs. Carstairs
admiringly. The two women were deadly enemies at heart, and it
seemed to me to indicate a fine, generous nature in Anne to forget
her prejudice in an honest appreciation of the other&rsquo;s
charm.</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen looked at his witness a little uncertainly. Clearly
he did not understand Mrs. Carstairs, and was not sure how to
address a woman of this type.</p>

<p>After the preliminary questions, as to her position and length
of sojourn in the family, he said, almost abruptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Mr. Van Wyck was a suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Carstairs, in low, musical
tones. &ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck had reason to wish to die. And there are
those who wished him dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she said these words, Mrs. Carstairs dropped her eyes and sat
quietly awaiting further questions. Her speech almost amounted to
an accusation, and Morland looked at her with a face full of rage
and with clenched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you explain that implication, Madam?&rdquo; asked
the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was no implication, it was merely a
statement&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, amplify it. Who are those, who, in your
opinion, wished the death of David Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs assumed an expression of gentle pathos, which,
while beautiful to behold, seemed to me the quintessence of
hypocrisy. In a sad, low voice, she said, slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s foes shall be they of his own
household.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mellen stared at her. &ldquo;It is your opinion,
then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that David Van Wyck&rsquo;s death may
have been brought about by some one who lived under this
roof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think so?&rdquo; and the question was
accompanied by a grave look, of infinite pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are here to answer questions, not to ask them. Nor
are you invited to give unsupported opinions. If you know of
anything, madam, definite and positive, that would lead you to
suspect the thing you mention, tell us of it at once. But if not,
kindly refrain from insinuation or implication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs looked amazed rather than reproved. To my mind,
she was suddenly confronted by a man who could not be cajoled by
her fascinations, and who was outspoken in reply to her veiled
hints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly I know of nothing definite, or I should have
divulged it sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your knowledge, had Mr. Van Wyck an enemy in his own
household?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enemy is a harsh word. But the man was far from happy
with one who should have been his closest friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning his wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning his wife.&rdquo; Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s face was
white, now, and her eyes had a steely glitter as she said these
words, looking straight at the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You state, then, that Mr. Van Wyck was not happy in his
marital relations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I state that, emphatically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of disapproval all through the room at the
trend of this conversation, and more than one was heard to whisper,
&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see that Archer, Morland and the others were restrained
from speech only by Anne herself.</p>

<p>As I had noticed before when these two women clashed, Anne won
by the force of her marvellous aloofness. She now sat regarding
Mrs. Carstairs with an expression of slight scorn, which said far
more strongly than words could have expressed, that the witness was
talking nonsense. Anne Van Wyck looked like a queen listening to
the prattle of a demented subject, and her absolute indifference to
the housekeeper&rsquo;s remarks was the one reason why her friends
did not at once put a stop to the testimony.</p>

<p>I saw at once that Anne&rsquo;s attitude was the best possible
refutation of the housekeeper&rsquo;s evidence; and I saw, too,
that Mrs. Carstairs was herself quite aware of this. I think
Anne&rsquo;s look of supercilious scorn, almost tinged with
amusement, acted as a whip to the housekeeper&rsquo;s burdened
soul, and spurred her to greater effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of what I am speaking,&rdquo; Mrs. Carstairs went
on, &ldquo;for David Van Wyck was engaged to me, when he met and
wooed the lady he made his wife.&rdquo; She flashed a dazzling
smile at the coroner, which went far to disturb that
gentleman&rsquo;s equilibrium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was then&mdash;it was then, a breach of
promise?&rdquo; he said, half involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&mdash;yes. But of course I never sued him, or in
any way asserted my rights. He was sufficiently punished by his
unhappy marriage. His wife has always been jealous of me. She has
endeavored many times to have me dismissed from my position, but
with no success. However,&rdquo; and here Mrs. Carstairs turned her
direct gaze upon Anne, &ldquo;since the death of her husband, Mrs.
Van Wyck has asserted her intention of getting rid of me! I accuse
no one. I only state that there are several who would consider
themselves benefited by the death of David Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quiet intensity of the speaker&rsquo;s voice took away the
melodramatic effect of the scene, and made her seem like an
accusing angel speaking words of Fate.</p>

<p>There was a pause which was broken by Detective Markham, who
burst out, with something the effect of a bomb-shell: &ldquo;And
your son is one of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last something had disturbed Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;s calm. She
turned white to the very lips, and she trembled as if mortally
afraid. But she made a brave effort to control herself, and said,
distinctly, though in tones that quivered, &ldquo;My son is in no
way implicated!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what were you searching in the road for, early this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not searching&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Carstairs,
and then, as she saw me looking intently at her, she stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; declared the detective;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use your denying it! And later on, your son
was seen searching in the same place. What clue was he looking
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs could not speak. Her lips moved inaudibly, but
she was striving to pull herself together and would doubtless have
succeeded, when, breaking the silence, the voice of Beth Fordyce
was heard.</p>

<p>It sounded weird, and the audience listened breathlessly as Beth
said, in dreamy, far-away tones, &ldquo;Wheel tracks! He was
looking for wheel tracks! He was the man who came in the motor car!
I recognize him now,&mdash;it was Carstairs, Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
valet, who came into the grounds, at midnight, in a motor car. Who
stopped&mdash;and hesitated &mdash;and proceeded at
intervals&mdash;who left the car, and walked stealthily around the
house in the shadow of the eaves&mdash;evading the
moonlight&mdash;seeking the shadow&mdash;the
shadow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Fordyce&rsquo;s voice trailed away in a whisper, and I knew
that she was in one of the semi-trances, or whatever word might
express the strange condition that sometimes enveloped her. She was
perfectly conscious, but her mentality seemed dual. She envisioned
other scenes than those she might be among, and while she saw them
clearly she spoke as if through a mist.</p>

<p>The audience sat enthralled. Here at last was a hint of
something real and tangible! Wheel tracks were legitimate clues! If
Miss Fordyce&rsquo;s story were true, there was at last a way to
look for light on the mystery!</p>

<p>I glanced at Mrs. Carstairs, expecting to find her almost
collapsed; but instead, she had again risen to the occasion and
resumed her grasp of the situation. I saw, too, that it was the
alarm of her mother instinct, that had nerved her to a renewed
effort at composure, and she said quietly, &ldquo;There is no
meaning to the babble of a mind given to frequent
hallucinations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But apparently the coroner thought there was, for he abruptly
dismissed Mrs. Carstairs as a witness, and recalled her son.</p>

<p>The valet looked wretched, but seemed ready to answer
questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come into this place in a motor last night at
midnight?&rdquo; the coroner shot at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; and the answer was firm, though in a low
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have testified that you were at a ball in the
village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but I walked home. It&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t far,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you prove that you were at this village ball? Did any
of the servants of this house see you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does that happen?&rdquo; snapped the coroner;
&ldquo;were none of them present at the ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Look here, Carstairs, you weren&rsquo;t
at that ball at all! Where were you? Were you out in a
motor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; oh, no, sir!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s denial was
so emphatic and his manner so agitated, that it was palpably a
falsehood on the face of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you were,&rdquo; the coroner went on, &ldquo;and
as I doubt your word, I will ask some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the coroner called for Ranney, the garage mechanician.</p>

<p>This witness doggedly persisted that he knew nothing of
Carstairs&rsquo;s whereabouts the night before. But persistent
nagging by the coroner finally drew out the fact that the new
touring car had been taken out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it had?&rdquo; asked the coroner, and
Ranney seemed suddenly to decide that he would make a clean breast
of the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seen the wheel tracks, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know them from any other tracks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new car, sir, and it has peculiar tires. You
can&rsquo;t mistake the tracks, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw it all in a flash. Carstairs had taken the car out for a
&lsquo;joy ride,&rsquo; and in order to escape discovery, he had
endeavored to obliterate these peculiar tire marks from the dust of
the road. And without a doubt, his mother had been engaged in the
same work of precaution.</p>

<p>The detective also jumped to these conclusions, and after a few
of his questions, in conjunction with the coroner&rsquo;s
inquiries, they forced a confession from the valet.</p>

<p>Carstairs&rsquo;s manner became sullen as he owned up to his
wrongdoing. It seemed that the use of a motor car by any of the
servants was a most grave offense in the eyes of David Van Wyck.
And especially, to take out the big new touring car was a daring
thing to do!</p>

<p>Seeing that the valet was not making a good story of it, his
mother cleverly managed the coroner so that she told the story
instead. As Ranney had divulged the secret, she admitted that her
son had taken out the car the night before. She said that it was
wrong, and that she did not excuse him for it; but that since David
Van Wyck was no longer here to reprove or punish him, no one else
had the right to do so, and that the offense was a thing of the
past, and should be forgotten. She admitted that she had heard her
son return in the car, and that she was so worried about his wrong
deed that she had tried to eliminate any possible proof against him
in the matter of the wheel tracks. But, she concluded, this had no
bearing on the crime of the night before, as her son had returned
about eleven o&rsquo;clock and had put the car away and had then
retired. She overreached herself here, because the valet had
previously testified that he came home about midnight, and both
Miss Fordyce and Ranney agreed that the big car had arrived at
about twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>But when this was put to her, Mrs. Carstairs became excited
again, and insisted that the hour of her son&rsquo;s return was of
no consequence, as he had not gone to the study at all and knew
nothing of the occurrences there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to suspect him!&rdquo; she blazed out,
finally; &ldquo;it is wicked for you to do so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not said we suspected him, madam,&rdquo; said the
coroner, gravely, &ldquo;but if we do suspect him, or even feel
inclined to investigate his story, it is because he has not been
frank in the whole matter, and neither have you. And now I wish to
ask you further, did your son know that in the will of Mr. Van
Wyck, five thousand dollars was bequeathed to him, and twenty-five
thousand to yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be wiser for you to tell the truth,&rdquo;
prompted the coroner, &ldquo;as you know a lack of frankness has
not served you well so far. Now answer my questions
truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have both known of these facts for some
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all, madam,&rdquo; and to my surprise, Mr. Mellen
dismissed the housekeeper without a further word.</p>

<p>I did not quite understand his attitude in the matter, but I had
no time to think about it, for I was just then called to the
witness stand myself, and asked to give any information I could,
that might be of any assistance in solving the mystery.</p>

<p>I had not had time to consider this new phase of the situation
that included the valet&rsquo;s evidence, but I had previously made
up my mind what I should say when called upon.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>Chapter
XIII<br>
An Adjournment</strong>
</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you nothing in the way of facts that you do
not already know,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I wish to say that I
entirely coincide with Miss Van Wyck&rsquo;s opinion that her
father ended his own life. It is not incredible that his very
erratic mind gave way at the last. Nor is it surprising that he
should destroy the deed and hide the pearls under stress of sudden
insanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is your theory regarding the manner of his
death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no definite theory; but I wish to call attention
to the fact that I found several shot on the floor at Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s feet&rdquo;</p>

<p>My statement produced quite a sensation in the audience; for the
suggestion of shot seemed to imply at least a possible method of
the crime.</p>

<p>But the detective, Mr. Markham, interrupted me and said quietly:
&ldquo;It is not worth while, Mr. Coroner, to waste time in
consideration of the shot. There is a small receptacle on Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s desk, filled with that same shot, used as a
pen-cleaner. I observed that the shot found on the floor was the
same, as I have no doubt it was spilled by accident&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Coroner turned to Doctor Mason and inquired if Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s death could have been brought about by shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the doctor positively. &ldquo;I probed
the wound and found no bullet or shot. David Van Wyck was stabbed,
and the weapon was afterward withdrawn. I cannot subscribe to the
icicle theory, though I do not say it would be impossible. But the
deceased was most assuredly not shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt crestfallen and a little ashamed. For, having picked up
the shot, I should have noticed the same among the furnishings of
the desk. The coroner asked me only a few more questions, of
relative unimportance, and was about to dismiss me when he added,
as an afterthought, &ldquo;When did you last see Mr. Van Wyck
alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the query I had been dreading. But there was nothing for
it except to tell the truth. Involuntarily, I glanced at Anne, but
her eyes were cast down, and she paid no heed to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I was with him at dinner,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and after dinner he left us to go to the study. After that I
saw him a moment when from the terrace I glanced in at the study
window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You glanced in? For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No particular purpose. Mrs. Van Wyck and I were strolling
by, and merely chanced to look in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Mr. Van Wyck doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conferring with the committee from the village, I
assumed. We could not hear his words, of course, nor did we try
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s apparent
attitude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed to be angry,&rdquo; I felt myself obliged to
say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry at the gentlemen of the committee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was indeed sorry to give this evidence, but I was forced to do
it. To decline to answer would be absurd, and, after all, everybody
knew that Morland and his father were at odds in the matter. So I
said, &ldquo;No, he was addressing his son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! And he seemed to be angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, they were quarrelling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, I cannot say. I merely tell you what I saw:
that Mr. Van Wyck was addressing his son, and that he had the
appearance of being angry.&rdquo; The coroner excused me then, and,
turning to Morland, said directly, &ldquo;Did you quarrel with your
father last evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him what I thought of his procedure,&rdquo;
replied Morland. &ldquo;I make no secret of the fact that I tried
my best to persuade my father not to give away his
fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you persist in your assertion that when you left
your father at midnight his secretary was still with
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Morland firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you deny this, Mr. Lasseter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied the secretary, quite as positively.
This deadlock was a peculiar feature of the situation. Both men
could not be telling the truth, and, considering Morland&rsquo;s
greater reason for desiring that the great gift should not be made,
perhaps it was not strange that many of the audience began to turn
upon him the eye of suspicion.</p>

<p>Everybody now had testified, and the coroner began summing
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had no direct evidence,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that would tend to cast suspicion on any person. I think we
must all admit that since the room was locked and barred on the
inside, Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s death was not a murder. I think the
erratic mind of the deceased gives us reason to assume a sudden
attack of insanity. I think we must agree that if it was suicide,
there was no possible means or method, unless we accept the really
clever suggestion of the icicle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Markham interrupted! the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we may discard the icicle theory,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;as I have found the weapon with which the crime was
committed. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stepping forward, he laid on the table in front of the coroner a
small, sharp implement partly covered with brownish stains.</p>

<p>The coroner looked at it as if he could scarcely believe his
eyes. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, picking it up
gingerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an implement used in embroidering,&rdquo; said Mr.
Markham. &ldquo;It is called a stiletto, and it forms part of every
lady&rsquo;s sewing equipment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The audience were fairly breathless with suspense. Swayed by the
slightest hint, they were quite ready to drop suspicion of Morland
and turn it toward the women of the family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo; said the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s dressing-room,&rdquo; returned
the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it your property?&rdquo; asked the coroner of
Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, after a glance at the stiletto.
&ldquo;It belongs in my work-basket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you account for these stains upon it?&rdquo; pursued
the coroner, and he showed far more agitation than did the woman he
addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; she replied coldly. &ldquo;I have never
used it except for embroidery purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, of course if Anne Van Wyck had used this implement for the
purpose of killing her husband, she could scarcely be expected to
say so. And so her flat denial carried little weight</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where in the dressing-room was it found?&rdquo; asked the
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hidden beneath a pile of towels in a cupboard,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>Whereupon the coroner inquired of Doctor Mason if the stiletto
would have been a possible instrument of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Wyck was stabbed with some weapon about that
size,&rdquo; replied the doctor gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are these brownish stains upon it stains of
blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell without subjecting them to
analysis,&rdquo; returned the doctor, but his hearers were
impressed with the thought that he was endeavoring by delay to give
Anne the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; went on the coroner, in a hesitating
manner, &ldquo;that this piece of evidence must change the trend of
our inquiries. Mrs. Van Wyck, did you or did you not put this
stiletto in the place where it was found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; replied Anne quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who did place it there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;the discovery
of this instrument in this condition does not necessarily implicate
its owner. Other hands might have used it and secreted it where it
was found, perhaps with the intent of diverting suspicion. Who has
the care of your dressing-room, Mrs. Van Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My maid, Jeannette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her be summoned,&rdquo; the coroner ordered. But
Jeannette was nowhere to be found. She had disappeared, no one knew
when or where. To the minds of most present, this looked
suspicious. It was easily to be seen that the villagers were quite
ready to denounce Anne Van Wyck as the slayer of her own husband.
Anne had never been popular with the village people. Clever and
highly strung as she was, she had found little in common with their
ordinary and, to her, stupid pursuits. And now they were quite
ready to believe the worst of her.</p>

<p>Anne herself looked supercilious and scornful. &ldquo;I have no
notion where my maid has gone,&rdquo; she stated, &ldquo;but I am
positive that she is in no way implicated in this tragedy. She may
have gone on some errand, and will doubtless return soon. I am
entirely sure she can give you no information or enlightenment as
to the crime that has been committed in this house, any more than I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can tell us nothing, Mrs. Van Wyck, more than we
know already?&rdquo; the coroner said, floundering a little in the
complexity of his emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Anne quietly.</p>

<p>The coroner fidgeted uneasily, and then said, &ldquo;It is
impossible to carry matters further without the testimony of the
maid, Jeannette. I therefore declare this inquest adjourned for a
few days, by which time I trust we may have further and more
definite evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jury, to a man, looked decidedly relieved, but it was a
rather disappointed audience that filed slowly out of the house. To
my mind, the coroner&rsquo;s reason for adjourning the inquest was
a pretext. I think he felt sure that if the jury had had to decide
then and there, they must have accused Anne of the murder. And the
evidence was certainly incriminating. While I felt, with every
fibre of my being, the wish and desire to hold Anne innocent, yet
there was something terribly convincing of guilt in the fact of
that hidden stiletto. But again, the absurdity of it! How was it
humanly possible, even granting that Anne had used the fatal
instrument, for her to leave the study so securely locked and
bolted on the inside? But that was the old question, and the one to
which no one had an answer. But how I hoped the answer might
incriminate anybody but Anne!</p>

<p>That evening was a strange one. As an experience of my life, I
shall never forget it The members of the household all seemed to be
at cross purposes. There were a great many people about, with the
result that the Van Wycks and their house guests chose the music
room for themselves and denied the others admission.</p>

<p>In the library were gathered the coroner and Mr. Markham in
confab with Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s lawyers, and some directors of the
companies with which he had been identified.</p>

<p>The ceremony of dinner had been a great strain on us all, but
now that we were by ourselves, the tension was loosened a
little.</p>

<p>Anne was verging on the hysterical. She had borne up so long and
so bravely against the onslaughts of Mrs. Carstairs that a reaction
had set in, and she seemed to lose all her defensive courage. As a
result, we all tried to comfort or cheer her, and avoided referring
to painful subjects.</p>

<p>Archer was gentle and deferential, but he said little to her,
and seemed to content himself with, watching her closely.</p>

<p>Barbara and Morland were in quarrelsome mood, a condition not
unusual with them. Of course it was necessary they should make
certain arrangements, pertaining to the funeral of their father,
and naturally they deferred to Anne in many matters. But Anne
listlessly declined to express any opinions, and insisted that they
should use their own judgment and settle all questions between
themselves.</p>

<p>The subject of the stiletto was not so much as mentioned, and
indeed, the whole great matter of the tragedy and the inquest, was
not even touched upon.</p>

<p>Beth Fordyce was the only one who seemed inclined to open the
subject, and she occasionally declared with insistence that
Carstairs had killed his master.</p>

<p>As we were awaiting the detective&rsquo;s investigation of the
valet&rsquo;s affairs, we had no wish to discuss this. Or at least,
if some of us had, we did not want to do it in the presence of the
Van Wyck family. I made up my mind to talk alone with Archer later,
but at present, I considered it my duty to do anything I might to
avoid serious or tragic considerations.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Anne became more and more drooping, and at
last I begged of her to go for a short walk on the terrace. She
agreed more readily than I had hoped, and we went out together. It
was an exquisite night, the air soft and balmy, and the moon
overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for a little while, Anne,&rdquo; I said gently,
&ldquo;forget it all, can&rsquo;t you? A short respite from these
harrowing thoughts will clear your brain and heart, and make you
stronger to bear what must come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke suddenly, repeating my words in a frightened tone:
&ldquo;What must come to-morrow! What do you mean,
Raymond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to speak of that tell-tale
stiletto, so I said, &ldquo;The whole dreadful business, Anne. The
conclusion of the inquest, the detective work that must follow, the
funeral, and all the thousand and one accompaniments of this
tragedy that has come to you. Just for an hour, put it out of your
mind, and I know it will help you. Let us talk of things far off
and unassociated with this place. Let us talk of when we went to
school together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had left the terrace, and were walking down a path through
one of the formal gardens. She gave me a look of trust, as she
said, softly, &ldquo;You are very good to me, Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your friend, Anne; it is not being good, as you
phrase it, to want to help you in your sadness and
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my friend?&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;Does
that mean you trust me,&mdash;you have faith in me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have! I trust you infinitely. I have
unbounded faith in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper, and she tremblingly said,
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t if you knew! Oh, Raymond, that is the
pity of it&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;if you
<em>knew</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was appalled. Not so much by her words as by the despair in
her voice. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it to myself, it was like
the wail of a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>Like a flash, I remembered the peculiar tone of her voice when
she had said to me, &ldquo;I am capable of crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Nothing could make me believe
it,&mdash;not even Anne herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; I said to her; &ldquo;you are
overwrought, to-night. You can&rsquo;t see things at their proper
value, and you&rsquo;re exaggerating something to yourself. Now I
command you,&rdquo; and I endeavored to be playful, &ldquo;to talk
about the moon. How large do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne smiled involuntarily, for she remembered, as I did, that in
our school days, it had been one of our games to discuss the
apparent size of the moon.</p>

<p>But my project was unsuccessful. After a fleeting memory, Anne
forgot the moon, and burst out, passionately: &ldquo;<em>Why</em>
does that woman hate me so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw that it was useless to try to divert her thoughts, so I
concluded to talk with her, and it seemed to me that a direct
common-sense attitude would be the best for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know very well why she
hates you. You know that, whether she told the truth or not when
she said Mr. Van Wyck had promised to marry her, she certainly
hoped that he would do so; and when he married you instead, it is
not surprising that it should anger her against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more than that,&rdquo; said Anne, musingly;
&ldquo;she has for me an animosity beyond that of a jealous rival.
She seems uncanny, sometimes, and looks at me with what I think
must be the evil eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, granted it is so, Anne, you must rise above it.
However she has troubled you in the past, she cannot trouble you
any more. After a short time she will go away from here and you,
Anne,&mdash;you don&rsquo;t expect to stay on here, do
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I haven&rsquo;t thought about
it,&rdquo; and Anne gave a weary little sigh. &ldquo;I wish I had
some one to help me decide these things. Morland and Barbara are so
fiery-tempered that I can&rsquo;t discuss plans coolly with them. I
don&rsquo;t know how the will reads exactly, but I suppose it is
thirds. They may have Buttonwood Terrace, if they want it, I
don&rsquo;t care. But I don&rsquo;t know where to go,
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a tribute to my own self-control that I didn&rsquo;t tell
her what was in my heart concerning her future welfare, but I knew
from the tone of her voice that no thought of me as a factor in her
future had yet entered her mind. Whether she thought thus of
Archer, or not, I did not know; but surely while David Van Wyck lay
dead in the house, no one could speak of love to his widow. And yet
I had a brave hope that time might bring me that for which I longed
with my whole heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the future take care of itself,&rdquo; I responded,
gently. &ldquo;What I want, Anne, just now, is for you to pluck up
your courage and carry yourself through the ordeal of the next few
days as bravely as may be. I have seen you rise above the annoyance
of Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo; presence and vanquish her with your own
superiority. What you have done, you can do again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was before last night!&rdquo; and Anne fairly
moaned in despair. &ldquo;Oh, Raymond! you don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment we heard a slight sound behind us, and a dark
clad form glided by. It was Mrs. Carstairs herself, and as she
passed, she murmured, &ldquo;But I know, Anne Van
Wyck!&mdash;<em>I</em> know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She passed away as swiftly as she had come, and as silently, and
I felt Anne&rsquo;s form grow limp and lean against me. I could
have carried her to the house, but I did not wish to subject her to
a possible mortification. So, instead, I grasped her arm firmly,
and whispered in her ear: &ldquo;Brace up! now is the time to show
what you&rsquo;re made of! call upon your pride, your dignity, your
scorn,&mdash;whatever you will &mdash;but succeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The force of my voice must have nerved her, for she straightened
up and walked with a steady step toward the house. I kept my hold
on her arm, till we reached the door, and then, seeing one of the
maids in the hall, I bade her take Mrs. Van Wyck to her room.</p>

<p>Then I went to the smoking-room, and though I would not allow
myself even to surmise what Anne had meant by her strange words,
nor what Mrs. Carstairs had meant by her threatening whisper, I
said over and over from the depths of my soul, &ldquo;Anybody but
Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>Chapter
XIV<br>
A Mysterious Disappearance</strong>
</h3>

<p>I found Archer in the billiard room and joined him in a chat and
a smoke. Though our desultory conversation could scarcely be called
a chat, so uncommunicative were we both.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be little to say. We agreed that the mystery
was inexplicable. We agreed that the criminal, if there had been
one, must be tracked down. We agreed that Markham, while a shrewd
man and a reasoning one, hadn&rsquo;t done much as yet,&mdash;but
we further agreed he should be allowed more time to show his
prowess.</p>

<p>I certainly had no intention of telling Archer what Anne had
said to me out on the terrace,&mdash;nor yet what Mrs. Carstairs
had said, as she so suddenly appeared and disappeared.</p>

<p>And if Archer had any secret information he was equally
determined not to confide in me.</p>

<p>We told each other of our intention to remain at Buttonwood
Terrace for a few days after the funeral, in the hope of being of
some assistance to the family. If to both of us, &ldquo;the
family&rdquo; was merely a euphemism for Anne Van Wyck, neither of
us said so.</p>

<p>The talk turned again to Mr. Markham, and I compared him to
Fleming Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Stone would have found the
criminal by this time, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Archer; &ldquo;there are no
clues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is mystery. I once heard Fleming Stone say that
mystery in a case always spurred and enthused him. I wish the Van
Wycks would engage him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought somebody said he had gone West,&rdquo; returned
Archer, moodily, blowing smoke rings into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when he was here yesterday, he said he was to start
at once. But if Markham doesn&rsquo;t do something soon, I shall
advise employing Stone. It&rsquo;s all very well to say Markham
must have more time, and all that, but I know what a value Stone
places on looking into things before the clues have been destroyed.
As you very well know, Archer, he really deduced a lot of truths
from that foolish fan business, yesterday, and you must admit
he&rsquo;s unusually clever in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never denied it; I think he is a wonderful detective.
But isn&rsquo;t he very expensive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, I believe; but the Van Wycks are rich, and they
ought to have the best possible expert advice in this
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I was speaking, Morland came into the room. The young
fellow looked worn and tired, but he had his customary belligerent
air, as he flung himself astride of a chair and glared at us over
its back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we are rich, but I don&rsquo;t mean to throw
money away on spectacular detectives! I heard what you were saying,
Sturgis, and I think it&rsquo;s tommyrot to get in that omniscient
sleuth you&rsquo;re talking about. My father was killed by
somebody. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know who did it, but if
Markham can&rsquo;t find out, nobody can. I don&rsquo;t mean by
that, that I consider Markham such a great detective; but I mean,
that I think the case is one that can never be solved,&mdash;and
perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well that it shouldn&rsquo;t
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Van Wyck sighed deeply, and then frowned, as he went on:
&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m master here now, in a way. I don&rsquo;t
mean to question my stepmother&rsquo;s position or authority, but
I&rsquo;m the man of the house, and my wishes ought to have some
weight. Especially, as Mrs. Van Wyck declines to take any part in
the settlement of questions that arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;that the
services of a good detective are really necessary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Morland thundered; &ldquo;not since that
stiletto business! Good Heavens, man! Do you want to run down
<em>that</em> clue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer looked at the speaker as if he would jump at his throat.
&ldquo;You mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; he blazed, and then stopped,
unable to voice his own meaning.</p>

<p>I felt equally incensed, and thought it better to speak
plainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morland,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d state
in plain terms what you do think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything! and if I did I
shouldn&rsquo;t say it! but you must see, both of you, what it all
means. And I want to shield Anne in every way I can. Oh,
let&rsquo;s not even speak of it,&mdash;it drives me crazy to think
about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s face,&mdash;for Morland was really not much more
than a boy,&mdash;was pathetic. He was afraid to face the
conclusions which the finding of that stiletto must lead to.</p>

<p>Not so, Archer. The older man was quiet and composed as he said,
straightforwardly: &ldquo;Nothing can be gained by shirking the
issue. If we refuse to consider the case, others will do so.
Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s wiser to learn all we can
ourselves, and be ready to meet any detective on his own ground?
Now look here, Morland, if you are really anxious to shield Mrs.
Van Wyck from suspicion, the best way to go about it is to face
that stiletto business and run it to earth. I don&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s anything in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; and Morland&rsquo;s eyes
showed a gleam of hope. &ldquo;But you fellows don&rsquo;t know how
Anne hated the governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Archer, sternly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say
such things as that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Morland insisted, doggedly.
&ldquo;You fellows don&rsquo;t know anything about it. At first,
they got along pretty well, but lately,&mdash;well, it wasn&rsquo;t
all Anne&rsquo;s fault; Dad certainly made it hard for her, with
his domineering ways and unjust rules. But Anne tantalized him,
too. And lately they had a lot of quarrelling over those pearls.
Now I&rsquo;m terribly fond of Anne,&mdash;perhaps more so than I
ought to be,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t help seeing things as they
are. Why, it was a crisis! Last night the governor was going to
give away an enormous sum of money. And, whether he intended to
give the pearls too, I don&rsquo;t know; but he told Anne that he
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland ceased speaking, and indeed no more words were needed.
Whatever the facts, he had set forth a theory that was at least
plausible.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe a word of it; my heart refused to
harbor the faintest suspicion of Anne,&mdash;but I knew it was only
my heart that refused. My brain saw clearly the logic and truth of
what &nbsp;Morland had said, and, too, my brain refused to forget
Anne&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m capable of crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, with my heart and brain in dire conflict, I
couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>

<p>But Archer spoke. In a cold even cutting voice, he said:
&ldquo;You are of course entitled to jump to a conclusion if you
wish. You are of course at liberty to put the worst possible
construction on the evidence of the stiletto. But would you mind
informing us how, in your opinion, Mrs. Van Wyck accomplished the
diabolical act which you attribute to her, and left the study
locked on the inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland passed his hand wearily over his brow. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nobody knows. But you must
admit that whoever did the diabolical deed, managed in some way to
leave the study door locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then until you can discover how that was done,&rdquo;
Archer went on, &ldquo;I think it will be wise for you to refrain
from making accusations. I&rsquo;m an older man than you are,
Morland, and I think I have a right to call you down, when you
pursue such a dangerous course. Even though you feel sure your
suspicions are correct, I beg of you do not shout them from the
housetop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rdquo; began Morland, but I
interrupted. &ldquo;The very fact that the study was left locked,
so positively points to suicide that I think it would be better to
let it go at that. Why not call off the detectives and insist upon
a verdict of suicide. The fact that the weapon is missing is no
more inexplicable, if as much so, as how the murderer
escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m willing to let it go at
that,&rdquo; said Morland, who was now pacing up and down the room
with his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to stop
investigations at once, but I doubt if that&rsquo;s
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s Carstairs,&rdquo; said Archer;
&ldquo;that chap certainly has a guilty conscience, if anybody ever
had. If investigation must be made, can&rsquo;t it be turned in his
direction? If he&rsquo;s innocent, it can do no harm; and if
he&rsquo;s implicated, we ought to know it. You see he knew both he
and his mother would get big benefit from the death of his
master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, Morland,&rdquo; I said, rather crossly, for
my nerves were on edge, &ldquo;do keep your mouth shut about your
suspicions. And if you&rsquo;re head of the house, and if your
influence counts for anything, for heaven&rsquo;s sake direct the
trend of investigation toward suicide or Carstairs or a burglar, or
anybody but Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well enough to say, but I&rsquo;m confronted
by new suspicions all the time. I have to look over my
father&rsquo;s papers of course, and I have already found enormous
bills of Anne&rsquo;s,&mdash;still unpaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recent bills?&rdquo; asked Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairly so. Within a few months. I&rsquo;ve only looked
over the papers in the safe, so far. Those on the desk I&rsquo;m
going to tackle to-morrow. Of course they will be the most recent
bills. But I daresay there&rsquo;ll be plenty of them. I suppose
all beautiful women are extravagant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, Mrs. Van Wyck has money enough now to pay
her own bills,&rdquo; I suggested, a little shortly, for I thought
Morland unduly interested in the particular matter of Anne&rsquo;s
extravagance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Morland, and turning on
his heel, he strode out of the room.</p>

<p>Archer and I were silent after young Van Wyck left us, and it
was but a few moments before my companion threw his half-smoked
cigar into the fireplace and announced abruptly, &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll turn in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up, too,&rdquo; I said, rather relieved
that no further conversation was begun.</p>

<p>I followed Archer up the small side staircase, which led
directly to our quarters, more conveniently than the grand
staircase opposite.</p>

<p>Archer&rsquo;s room chanced to be directly over David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s bedroom, while mine was over Anne&rsquo;s. There were
one or two rooms between, I believe, but I don&rsquo;t know who
occupied them.</p>

<p>We paused for a brief word of good-night at the head of the
stairs, and then turned our opposite ways. I heard Archer&rsquo;s
door close as I was about to open my own, when I suddenly bethought
myself that I had meant to ask him what he thought about those
contradictory stories of Morland and Lasseter, as to which had been
left alone with Mr. Van Wyck the night before. It seemed to me that
a good deal might hinge on that question, and I wanted
Archer&rsquo;s opinion. I didn&rsquo;t altogether like Archer, but
I was just enough to know that it was largely due to my jealousy of
his friendship for Anne, and in spite of this I had great regard
for his opinions, as I had usually found them logical and
right-minded. I turned back and walked along the corridor. It was
but a moment since we had parted, and I assumed he could not yet be
disrobing.</p>

<p>I tapped lightly at his bedroom door, but he didn&rsquo;t
answer, so I tapped again.</p>

<p>Receiving no response, I was a little surprised, but I figured
that he thought it was some one else, and not wanting any further
discussion that night, he was pretending to be asleep.</p>

<p>So I tapped again, saying in a low tone, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Sturgis; let me in a minute, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, he didn&rsquo;t answer, and in a moment of irritation at
his silence, I turned the doorknob.</p>

<p>The door opened, and as the room was brilliantly lighted, I
stepped inside. I didn&rsquo;t see Archer, but across the room a
door was opened into a bathroom, and I assumed he was in there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Archer,&rdquo; I called out, &ldquo;but I do
want to see you a minute, if I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still there was no reply, and feeling that the strangeness of
the situation justified it, I went to the bathroom door and looked
in. The light was turned on, but there was no one in the bathroom.
I was bewildered, for I knew that Archer had come in, and I could
not imagine what had become of him. There was a door at the farther
end of the bathroom and involuntarily I opened it. However, it was
only a clothes-closet, of good size, but as it contained only a few
garments, I closed the door again and returned to Archer&rsquo;s
bedroom. As he couldn&rsquo;t have jumped out of the window, it
naturally followed that he had left his room and gone downstairs
again, while I had stood for a moment in front of my own bedroom
door. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible, for the hall was brightly
lighted, and I was sure I should have seen or heard him had he
passed so near me. I spoke aloud, &ldquo;Archer,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;are you under the bed? or where? If you are, come
out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again I called his name a trifle louder, and then went out of
his room into the hall, closing the door behind me. I walked slowly
along toward my own room, pausing at the staircase to look down. At
that very moment I heard the click of Archer&rsquo;s door, and
turning, I saw him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want me, Sturgis?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Was
that you calling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went slowly back and entered his room, and he closed the door
behind us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; I said, staring around
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was I, when?&rdquo; he returned, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was in here a moment ago? I tapped three times and
you didn&rsquo;t answer, so I took the liberty of entering, and you
weren&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was in the bathroom,&rdquo; he said lightly;
&ldquo;what is it you want? Cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t in the bathroom, for I looked in
there,&rdquo; I persisted, ignoring his question.</p>

<p>He looked at me curiously. &ldquo;You did!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Well I chanced to be in the clothes-closet of the bathroom.
It&rsquo;s rather large for the limited wardrobe I brought with me,
and I expect I got lost in its depths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; I said, looking
straight at him, &ldquo;for I looked in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can only say your behavior is most ill-bred, I
consider you unwarrantably intrusive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer&rsquo;s manner was distinctly haughty and his tone even
offensive, but the rebuke was deserved, and I responded, &ldquo;You
are quite right; I beg your pardon. And now I will tell you why I
came. If you don&rsquo;t mind discussing it, I&rsquo;d like to know
what you make of those conflicting statements of Morland and his
father&rsquo;s secretary, as to which remained in the study last
night after the other left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer considered seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought over
that, myself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and do you know, the thing
that most impresses me in connection with that, is that it seems to
prove them both innocent of any guilty knowledge of this
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I said wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why because if either of them were guilty,&mdash;not that
I suspect for a moment that either of them is,&mdash;but for the
sake of argument, let us suppose it, &mdash;or if either of them
should be concealing any bit of guilty knowledge, surely he would
not so flatly give the other the lie, because he would know that
such a course would invite investigation. A man with a guilty
conscience is plausible and endeavors to be casual. He never makes
such a sensational statement and sticks to it so
blatantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to be a detective yourself, Archer,&rdquo; I
said, looking at him admiringly; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve made a
very subtle point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t what are called detective methods,&rdquo;
he returned, &ldquo;but I do hold that reason and logic are the
mainstays of the profession. However, something more is needed. For
Markham has reason and logic, and yet I doubt if he will get
anywhere. I suppose ingenuity and originality are needed. Of course
your Fleming Stone has those. But, Sturgis,&rdquo; and
Archer&rsquo;s face grew very grave, &ldquo;do we want to push this
matter? Neither of us is willing to voice suspicions as Morland
did, but shall we not admit to each other that a cessation of all
movement in the matter, might be a good thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Archer;&rdquo; and I looked at him
thoughtfully; &ldquo;I see the force of your suggestion, and
yet&mdash;well, I want to think it over. I&rsquo;ll ponder on it
to-night, and I know you&rsquo;ll do so. To-morrow let us again
exchange ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer agreed to this, though I must confess he didn&rsquo;t
seem greatly impressed with the brilliancy of my plan, and I went
off to my own room.</p>

<p>This time I really entered it, and locked the door after me. I
threw myself into an arm-chair, and proceeded to my pondering at
once. But I may as well admit that my pondering began, not with the
mystery of the tragedy, but with the mystery of Archer&rsquo;s
absence from his own room that night. It was all very well for him
to say that he was in the bathroom cupboard,&mdash;but I
couldn&rsquo;t believe it, for I had looked in there and saw no
one. To be sure I didn&rsquo;t go inside, but Archer could scarcely
have been concealed behind the few coats or trousers that were
suspended from rods.</p>

<p>Unless he had been in one of his own suit-cases or hat-boxes he
couldn&rsquo;t have been in that closet, and the more I thought
about it, the stranger it seemed.</p>

<p>And then the jealousy lurking in my heart gave me a sudden
suggestion. Archer&rsquo;s room was directly over David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s bedroom. Before his marriage, David Van Wyck had used
for his own bedroom the very one Archer now occupied. Could there
be,&mdash;hinted my jealous heart,&mdash;a secret staircase
connecting the two? Could Archer descend secretly to David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s room, and so gain access to Anne&rsquo;s
apartments?</p>

<p>It was a tawdry thought,&mdash;it was melodramatic, &mdash;but
my heart was like a tinder-box, and the thought had struck a
fiendish flame. I didn&rsquo;t believe it with my brain, but my
foolish heart declared it to be the only possible explanation of
Archer&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>And then another thought followed it, which made me ashamed of
my evil imagination. The dead body of David Van Wyck lay in his own
bedroom. Surely no man would descend to that room on a clandestine
errand.</p>

<p>So I forced myself to believe Archer had told me the truth, and
that he had been in the cupboard, and as soon as he emerged had
answered my call. It was a strange circumstance, but not so strange
as the bizarre explanation I had conjured up.</p>

<p>Besides, Morland had distinctly stated there was no secret
staircase or anything of the sort in the house.</p>

<p>But, urged my unquiet soul, did Morland know? David Van Wyck was
quite capable of keeping such a secret to himself.</p>

<p>And then in a sudden practical mood, I seized a pencil and drew
a plan of the room as it must be. On the ground floor a corridor
ran between David Van Wyck&rsquo;s room and the south wall of the
house, to give access to the study. But as the study was two
stories high, having no second floor, there was no occasion for
this corridor on the second floor of the house; and in
Archer&rsquo;s room the corresponding space above the corridor, was
completely filled by the bathroom and the large clothes cupboard. I
knew a little of practical architecture and I proved to myself
beyond doubt that there was no space for the concealed staircase I
had imagined. The walls of the old house were substantial enough,
but they were by no means the thickness of walls necessary to
contain secret staircases or dungeons, such as those I loved to
read of in Mediaeval history. I could reckon plainly from what I
knew of the rooms, just how they connected with each other; and I
could account for every inch of space. Moreover, if a secret
staircase had led down from the bathroom or the cupboard of
Archer&rsquo;s room, it would have dropped plumb into the corridor
below, as there was simply no other place for its outlet. I thought
even of a spiral staircase, such as that in the study, at the end
of the musician&rsquo;s gallery. But, I reasoned, that was fully
four feet across; and the walls, as I computed them, were in no
case more than ten inches thick.</p>

<p>So with a certain feeling of reluctance, and yet with a sense of
relief, I gave up the idea of a concealed connection between
Archer&rsquo;s room and the room below, and turned the trend of my
ponderings toward the many and complex phases of the greater
mystery.</p>

<p>But when I finally fell asleep that night, my dreams were all of
rope ladders and secret stairways, and even vague visions of an
elopement on a pillioned white palfrey, with a beautiful lady, who
strongly resembled Anne Van Wyck.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
Who Wrote The Letter?</strong>
</h3>

<p>The next day was Sunday. As the inquest was not to be continued,
I hoped for a quiet day; but aside from the necessary arrangements
for funeral appointments, there seemed to be much going on in the
way of investigations. Mr. Markham had developed a tendency to
question everybody, right and left, and I continually ran against
him interviewing a servant, a guest or a caller.</p>

<p>I hung around somewhat listlessly, hoping to be permitted to see
Anne; but Miss Fordyce informed me that Anne refused to see anyone
except her two step-children.</p>

<p>I strolled out on the terrace, hoping to have a talk with
Archer, but instead, I met Mr. Markham and he proceeded briskly to
interview me.</p>

<p>I had no objection to this, as although there were a few things
I knew that I intended to keep from him, I was quite willing to
give him freely any other information I possessed.</p>

<p>But his talk after all, was a repetition of what I already knew,
or a verbose disquisition on his own theories and plans.</p>

<p>As we talked, Mrs. Carstairs came out on the terrace, and after
a cautious glance about, she glided up to us, with a mysterious
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I speak to you a minute, Mr. Markham?&rdquo; she
said, and though I disliked and distrusted the woman, I could not
help admiring her beauty and grace. She was truly unusual in her
charm, and Markham beamed on her with a smile at once admiring and
deferential.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I remain?&rdquo; I asked,&mdash;and for the life of
me I couldn&rsquo;t help speaking kindly to her,&mdash;&ldquo;or do
I intrude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I should be glad,
Mr. Sturgis, for you to hear what I have to say. I am in a dilemma,
and I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I ought to do. I found
this,&rdquo; and she produced a letter, which, with a hesitating
air, she offered to Mr. Markham. &ldquo;I hate to bring it to
you,&rdquo; she went on, half withdrawing it as he was about to
take it, &ldquo;and yet, I feel it my duty to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is your duty, madam,&rdquo; said the
detective as he somewhat eagerly took the letter from her hand.</p>

<p>I caught sight of the inscription and a fierce anger kindled
within me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a letter to Mrs. Van Wyck!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;You have no right to read it, Mr. Markham! Mrs. Carstairs,
where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My vehemence seemed to frighten her, and she clasped her hands
to her breast with a little fluttering motion. &ldquo;Oh, have I
done wrong? Shall I put it back? I thought&mdash;I thought that in
a case like this, you know, it was one&rsquo;s duty to tell, if one
found important evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this was enough for Markham, and he held the letter
firmly, with no intention of giving it up. But I made another
desperate attempt. &ldquo;Mr. Markham, you shall not read that
letter, without Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s permission! Have you read
it?&rdquo; and I turned and glared at the housekeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she said, softly, with a look of pain in
her deep eyes. &ldquo;Oh, believe me, I did not know it was wrong!
I thought I ought to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are right, madam,&rdquo; said the detective.
&ldquo;Mr. Sturgis knows you are right. It is only his personal
feeling that makes him want to withhold the information this letter
may give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that it?&rdquo; And Mrs. Carstairs did not glance
at me, but confined her attention to Markham. &ldquo;Then you will
read it, won&rsquo;t you, and tell me I was right in bringing it to
you. I was so uncertain what to do. If Mr. Sturgis does not want to
hear it, perhaps he had better go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In my indignation, I was quite ready to walk away rather than be
a party to this disgraceful act but as she spoke, Mrs. Carstairs
swept me a glance, in which, beneath its apparent frankness, I
thought I caught a malevolent gleam, and I promptly decided that I
preferred to know all that anyone else knew, either for or against
Anne.</p>

<p>The letter had been opened, and without further hesitation, Mr.
Markham drew the paper from its envelope.</p>

<p>It was a half sheet and its message was typewritten. The
detective did not read it aloud, but as I looked over his shoulder,
we two scanned its contents at the same time.</p>

<p>There was no address, no preliminary greeting of any sort, but
it was dated &ldquo;Friday.&rdquo; Then the message ran:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night is the time. After the comittee meeting.
Don&rsquo;t be afraid. You can never be found out. I will protect
you and look out for you.&rdquo; There was no signature. I read the
lines twice, but even then was unable to sense their purport. I
took the sheet from Markham and scrutinized it closely. Meanwhile,
he examined the envelope.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of its genuineness. It was addressed, in
typewriting, to Mrs. David Van Wyck, Buttonwood Terrace, Town, and
it bore the postmark of two days before, and of the Crescent Falls
Village Post-office. A postmark on the back showed that it had been
mailed Friday morning and received the same afternoon. It had been
opened neatly, and gave every evidence of being a letter received
and read by Anne Van Wyck on Friday. And it was on Friday night
that David Van Wyck had died.</p>

<p>The half sheet of paper was undoubtedly from the same box of
stationery as the envelope, both were of good style, rather
large-sized and of good quality.</p>

<p>Mr. Markham read it over several times, and at last he said,
&ldquo;This is of very grave import. You did quite right, Mrs.
Carstairs, to bring it to me. Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in a book, which lay on a table in Mrs. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s dressing-room. I chanced to pick up the book to put it
away in its place, and this letter fell out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you deliberately read it!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and I
daresay I glared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought not to have done so, Mr. Sturgis; but I
can&rsquo;t help thinking that in such a mysterious case as we have
before us now, certain conventional rules may be laid
aside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you, madam,&rdquo; said the detective,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t help thinking that this is a most
important piece of evidence. Is it your habit to look after Mrs.
Van Wyck&rsquo;s belongings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my duty to see that her rooms are kept in
immaculate order. And unless I show a certain amount of oversight,
sometimes the maids become a little careless in their care of the
appointments of her dressing-table and such matters. And so, as I
was in there this morning on a tour of inspection, I found this
letter, as I have told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was absolutely crushed. I felt as if a black mantle had fallen
over me like an enveloping pall. Not for a moment did I believe
Anne guilty, even of complicity in her husband&rsquo;s death; but I
realized that my refusal to believe it was based solely on my
unwillingness to do so. However, the thought flashed through my
mind that this letter was dangerous and it must be destroyed or
suppressed. I knew, too, that Mr. Markham was ready and eager to
make use of it and I concluded that the only thing I could do was
to beg for time.</p>

<p>So I said: &ldquo;I quite agree with you, Mr. Markham, that this
is a serious matter. So much so, that I think you will both be
willing to agree to my proposition, which is to say nothing about
it for a day or two. Let us, at least, wait until after Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s funeral, which takes place to-morrow afternoon. I
think it only decent courtesy that all investigation should be
postponed until after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Markham considered this matter. &ldquo;It might be well to
adopt that course,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;though of course
I shall conduct personally and privately any investigation I
choose. But I&rsquo;m quite willing to agree that the whole matter
shall not be mentioned to any member of the family until after the
funeral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it need never be mentioned,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Carstairs, and her face was drawn with sorrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just beginning to realize what it would mean if this discovery of
mine were made public. Why, it is practically a condemnation of
Anne Van Wyck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing of the sort!&rdquo; I cried out, angrily.
&ldquo;It is doubtless a harmless communication on a totally
different subject. There is really nothing to connect it with the
crime in the study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rubbish,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham,
testily. &ldquo;If ever a bit of evidence pointed straight to a
criminal, this certainly does. There can be no doubt of its
genuineness. The date and postmarks prove that Mrs. Van Wyck
received this letter on Friday afternoon. The fact that it was
found in a book which she had been reading, proves that she
received and opened it herself. If all this is not so, what is your
explanation of the incident, Mr. Sturgis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do tell us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carstairs, wringing her
beautiful hands. &ldquo;I should be so glad to put any construction
on it favorable to Mrs. Van Wyck. Would it be better to go to her
and ask her frankly what it means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I thundered; &ldquo;that poor woman is not to
be harassed any more than is necessary during these awful days. You
have both promised to keep this matter a secret until after the
funeral and I hold you to your word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my relief, they both agreed to this, and promised not to
mention that awful letter to any one at present</p>

<p>I looked curiously at Mrs. Carstairs. As always, she mystified
me, and yet I couldn&rsquo;t say how or why. Surely she had been
guilty of a breach of good manners in reading a letter addressed to
another. But in her opinion the occasion had justified it; and
doubtless many people would agree with her. Really, I could not
help distrusting her, in spite of the fact that she now expressed
so much sympathy for Anne and seemed so truly grieved at the
thought of her trouble that she seemed to be sincere. And again,
what could she have done with the letter better than to bring it
straight to the detective. It was the most logical proceeding and
the most just. If she had taken the letter to Morland or Barbara it
might have made infinitely more trouble. I walked away, leaving the
two on the terrace still conferring on the matter. As I turned
aside I heard Mr. Markham say, &ldquo;What was the book in which
you found the letter?&rdquo; And Mrs. Carstairs replied, &ldquo;A
Volume on Rose Culture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question struck me as absurd, for what difference could it
possibly make what the subject of the book might be.</p>

<p>I walked along the terrace and down into the gardens. Finding a
pleasant seat on one of the by-paths I sat down there to think it
over. I didn&rsquo;t need the letter to look at, its words were
branded into my brain.</p>

<p>Alone by myself, I was forced to admit that the letter, if
genuine, was definitely condemning. And it was genuine, beyond a
doubt. Anne had certainly received that letter on Friday. The
letter stated that after the committee meeting that same night was
the time for some preconcerted plan to be carried out. That the
plan was a dangerous one was proved by the wording of the letter.
And it was shortly after that committee meeting that David Van Wyck
had died a violent death.</p>

<p>I forced myself to face the matter squarely. Not because I
believed it, but merely as a necessary argument, I accepted the
implication that the letter conveyed. Then it would mean that Anne
had an accomplice, or at least an advisor in the matter.</p>

<p>Who could the accomplice be? But my mind refused to work in that
direction, and I resolutely pushed the matter out of my mind and
began to think what I could do to help and protect Anne if she
should be accused. I almost thought of urging her to run away with
me while she yet had opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>And as my thoughts were in this turmoil, Anne herself came
walking along the path near me.</p>

<p>Her soft, trailing black garments made her beautiful face seem
whiter than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Raymond,&rdquo; she said, as I rose;
&ldquo;talk to me a little, can&rsquo;t you? I feel dazed and
weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely this was no time to ask questions, so I talked to her
gently, on casual subjects, and after a time the conversation
veered around to the tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt a premonition something would happen that
night,&rdquo; said Anne, her large, dark eyes growing misty with
the memory. &ldquo;I was so restless I couldn&rsquo;t go to bed,
and I wrote letters and read until quite late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you reading, Anne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking through a book about rose growing. The
gardener had been asking me about some new varieties he had just
bought. I&rsquo;m interested in such things, and the book was well
written. But I never want to see it again,&mdash;or a rose
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a look of horror in her eyes, and I felt that the
rose-book brought back the scenes of that dreadful night so
poignantly that she could scarcely bear it.</p>

<p>I changed the subject, and persistently led her mind away from
the scene of the tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always do me so much good, Raymond,&rdquo; Anne said,
gratefully, as at last we started back to the house; &ldquo;you
always know just what to say to me. You&rsquo;re a real
comfort&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need and deserve comfort, Anne,&rdquo; I said,
gently, &ldquo;and I think you know you may always depend upon me
to give you all I can. And, Anne, if you ever want more of
me,&mdash;if you want real assistance,&mdash;or if you want to
confide in me,&mdash;you will do so, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to me with a startled look. &ldquo;Why what do you
mean?&rdquo; she asked, and her voice quivered, and she almost
gasped for breath.</p>

<p>I looked her straight in the eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean
anything,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except that I am your friend
through any circumstance that may come to you. In any trouble or
danger,&mdash;count on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if I have been wicked?&rdquo; said Anne, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, even then,&rdquo; but a pang shot through my heart,
not so much because of the words she said, as the look of horror
and despair that came into her eyes.</p>

<p>The days went by slowly. On Monday the funeral was held, and
with appropriate obsequies the body of David Van Wyck was buried.
The house guests had all chosen to remain at Buttonwood Terrace, in
response to Anne&rsquo;s urgent invitation that we should do so.
She seemed to have a dread of being left alone with her
step-children, and it became more and more evident that matters
were far from harmonious between her and David Van Wyck&rsquo;s son
and daughter.</p>

<p>The day after the funeral I had a long talk with Mr.
Markham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt in my mind,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;that Mrs. Van Wyck is the guilty party. We never can fasten
the crime upon her, for it cannot be explained how she left the
room locked up. But it must be that she did do so in some clever
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any such way,&rdquo; I objected.
&ldquo;If it were the mere turning of a key, it might be done from
the other side, but heavy bolts cannot be shot into their sockets
except by a person on the inside of the room. And again, waiving
the mystery of the locked room, we are as well justified in
suspecting Morland or Barbara as Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed Markham. &ldquo;But the
stiletto was found in her room, and her maid is missing, and then
there is that mysterious letter. That mystery must be sifted out.
To my mind it would be better to put the question plainly to Mrs.
Van Wyck and ask her what it means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d try some other way first,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being a detective, if you
can&rsquo;t trace a letter to its source without asking anybody.
Why, if Fleming Stone saw that letter he&rsquo;d soon tell you who
wrote it and what it all meant&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Markham didn&rsquo;t like this speech, and I didn&rsquo;t
blame him. I daresay I ought not to have said it. But he had so
little of what is known as the detective method that I
couldn&rsquo;t help speaking my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing I think about
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is, whoever wrote that letter to
Mrs. Van Wyck, was certainly her accomplice. Now who could that be,
but that valet, Carstairs? He has acted queer from the beginning,
and I&rsquo;m going to hunt him up and make him tell all he
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carstairs!&rdquo; I exclaimed in amazement. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t think Mrs. Van Wyck would stoop to receiving letters
from a servant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Van Wyck has stooped to crime, or participation
in crime, she cannot be very particular about her
associates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she hasn&rsquo;t stooped to crime! Good heavens, man,
don&rsquo;t condemn her unheard!&rdquo; But even as I spoke, I
remembered that Anne had asked me if I would stand by her even if
she were wicked! And I had said I would. Yes, and I would, too,
even if she were convicted of the worst crime in the calendar!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it was because of my reference to
Stone or not, but Markham seemed to acquire new energy. He
announced with great determination that he was going to find out
about that letter, whatever method he might have to pursue.</p>

<p>And it was partly to divert his sudden energy from this subject,
that I proposed again that we should make search for Jeannette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange about Jeannette,&rdquo; I observed.
&ldquo;Suppose we set out to trace her. That would be at least a
step in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been very few steps taken in any
direction,&rdquo; said the detective moodily. &ldquo;My own
movements are hampered by orders from the family. Of course
there&rsquo;s no one to say what I shall do, except Mrs. Van Wyck
and her two step-children. And every direction in which I wish to
investigate is forbidden by one or another of those three.
Sometimes I think they are all in connivance, and their
inharmonious attitude toward one another is a mere
bluff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a new idea to me, and I pondered it. But I
couldn&rsquo;t think it a true theory, and said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, maybe not,&rdquo; said Markham; &ldquo;but
they do act mighty queer. Miss Barbara, for instance, begged me if
I found any clues which might incriminate her brother, to suppress
them and tell nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she really suppose that you would do that?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was very much in earnest. But I haven&rsquo;t
found anything that points to Morland definitely. If I did,
I&rsquo;d show it up fast enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; I returned emphatically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d far rather suspect Morland of his father&rsquo;s
death than Mrs. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so should I. But it&rsquo;s a mystery, whichever way
one turns. I can&rsquo;t seem to make any start. But, as you say,
Mr. Sturgis, it would be a good idea to hunt for that
maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It proved not to be a difficult matter to find Jeannette, for we
soon discovered that she had gone to stay with her sister in a
neighboring village. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that Anne had
known all along where the girl was, for she seemed rather annoyed
than otherwise that we had made the discovery.</p>

<p>At any rate, Jeannette was brought home, and closely questioned
by Mr. Markham and myself.</p>

<p>And the result of the questioning was to eliminate entirely the
stiletto as incriminating evidence. Jeannette explained that she
had used that stiletto to dig a refractory cork out of a bottle of
bronze shoe-dressing. The bronze had given the metal a reddish
stain, which she could not remove, and she had hidden it, lest she
be scolded for having used the dainty implement for such a purpose.
Markham was frankly disappointed. I can&rsquo;t think he wanted to
prove Anne guilty, but his pride was hurt at having his cleverness
in finding the stiletto of no avail. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said to
Jeannette, &ldquo;why did you run away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ran away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I merely
went to visit my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you took a strange time to do that, when your
mistress was in such trouble and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; responded
Jeannette; and Markham jumped at this admission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you think it better to go?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>

<p>But Jeannette turned pale and looked very much frightened.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have any reason,&rdquo; she said, beginning
to cry. &ldquo;I just&mdash;I just thought I&rsquo;d go.&rdquo; We
tried every possible way to learn more from her, but without
success. She became hysterical and stupid by turns, and finally
refused to answer our questions. Markham declared that this
attitude on Jeannette&rsquo;s part was strongly against Anne, but
this I would not believe.</p>

<p>Finally I said, &ldquo;Jeannette, the reason you refuse to talk
is because you&rsquo;re afraid of Carstairs. Now I&rsquo;ll tell
you, it will be better in the long run, if you make a clean breast
of this matter and tell us all you know.&rdquo; And then between
her hysterical sobs Jeannette managed to stammer out that Carstairs
had said he would kill her if she told.</p>

<p>Certainly she was weak-minded, and I thought the best thing was
to scare her a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Jeannette,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;of course
Carstairs won&rsquo;t kill you. Don&rsquo;t be so foolish. But you
may get into very serious trouble if you don&rsquo;t tell this
thing that you&rsquo;re keeping back. How would you like to go to
prison for withholding evidence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl shivered at the thought, and a little more of this sort
of persuasion soon brought her to the point of saying that she
would tell all she knew, but that she knew nothing of
importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will judge of the importance,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;and what we want from you is a full account of anything you
know concerning last Friday night. In the first place, were you at
that ball in the village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; The answer, though in low tones, was
positive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Carstairs at that ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if the girl were hypnotized by my question,
for she spoke like one in a trance. Nevertheless her answers bore
the stamp of truth and it seemed impossible to doubt that she was
telling a straight story.</p>

<p>In the same low steady voice Jeannette went on: &ldquo;We both
went for a ride in Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s new car. This was
forbidden, of course, but Carstairs said his master would never
find it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went then, on what is called a &lsquo;joy
ride&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what time did you get home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was Carstairs that Miss Fordyce saw sneaking into
the grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, but Ranney saw us and Carstairs
made him promise not to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last we&rsquo;re getting at something definite,&rdquo;
said Mr. Markham, fairly rubbing his hands with pleasure at these
new developments. He then took up the work of questioning
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came into the house about twelve o&rsquo;clock that
night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stopped in the servants&rsquo; dining-room, sir, and in
a few minutes, Carstairs came in there after putting away the car.
He said nobody had seen us except Ranney and he wouldn&rsquo;t
tell. Then he told me I&rsquo;d better go and see if Mrs. Van Wyck
wanted me. So I started for Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s room, but before
I reached it, I saw her coming out of the study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming out of the study! Be careful what you&rsquo;re
saying, girl! Are you sure of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure. Mrs. Van Wyck had on one of her
boudoir gowns, and she was just coming through the study door into
the corridor as I saw her. I asked her if she wanted me to help her
undress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo; The detective was almost
breathless now in his excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;No, no! for heaven&rsquo;s sake go
away!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did she speak like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. She was greatly excited, and her
eyes were blazing like stars. She was clutching her hands and she
looked almost distracted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeannette,&rdquo; I said, very sternly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re telling the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the truth, sir. I was frightened at Mrs. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s appearance, but as she said she didn&rsquo;t want me,
I went straight back to the servants&rsquo; dining-room. I found
Carstairs there, and he looked frightened and white, too. I was all
upset, sir, at these queer actions, and I said good-night to
Carstairs and went right up to my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time was all this?&rdquo; asked Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I reached my bedroom it was half-past
twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Markham looked at the girl thoughtfully. &ldquo;I believe
your story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you will have to tell it
again under oath. And in the meantime I forbid you to mention a
word of this to anyone. Do you understand? I forbid you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have been here and given this evidence at
the inquest. Why did you go away just then? You may as well own
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jeannette hesitated only a moment, and then she said simply,
&ldquo;Mrs. Carstairs advised me to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carstairs! Why did she do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. She said for me to go to my
sister&rsquo;s for a day or two and make a little visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all for the present, Jeannette,&rdquo; said Mr.
Markham. &ldquo;You may go now, but remember you are not to say a
word about all this to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remember, sir,&rdquo; said Jeannette, and she went
away.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>Chapter

Telltale Typewriting</strong>
</h3>

<p>After the girl had gone Mr. Markham looked at me significantly.
&ldquo;We certainly have material to work on now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What do you make of it all, Mr. Sturgis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make anything of it,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;It has all come upon me so suddenly it makes my head whirl.
Of course I see, as you do, that this girl&rsquo;s story is pretty
strong evidence against Mrs. Van Wyck, but I, for one, am not
willing to take the unsupported evidence of a hysterical and
weak-minded servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you doubt it? The girl would never have made
up all that story. You don&rsquo;t question, do you, the fact that
she saw Mrs. Van Wyck coming from the study, soon after midnight?
Then how do you explain Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s presence there, after
the men of the committee had gone home and the secretary had also?
How do you explain the fact that she was wringing her hands, in a
state of great excitement, and even spoke sharply as she declined
the services of the maid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t explain these facts, if they are facts. But
as I said, I&rsquo;m not prepared to believe this story implicitly.
I do believe those two went on a &lsquo;joy ride&rsquo; and they
came home so frightened lest their misdemeanor should be
discovered, that they haven&rsquo;t a very clear recollection of
what happened. At least the girl hasn&rsquo;t, and as you may
remember the valet was decidedly nervous and uncertain of his facts
when he gave his own testimony. Besides telling an up and down lie
as to his whereabouts that evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all so,&rdquo; said the detective, musingly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both servants. They had both been doing wrong
and were both fearful of discovery. But all that would not cause
them to invent this story of the maid&rsquo;s about seeing Mrs. Van
Wyck coming from the study. Now if, as I think, Carstairs was mixed
up in the matter, may it not be that it was because she feared for
her son&rsquo;s safety that Mrs. Carstairs sent the girl,
Jeannette, away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pondered on this. I knew how Mrs. Carstairs idolized her son.
I knew she had been out early that next morning endeavoring to
obliterate the wheel tracks of the new car, which might tell the
tale of his wrong-doing. And knowing Jeannette&rsquo;s hysterical
nature, the housekeeper might very easily have felt afraid that the
maid&rsquo;s evidence would lead to suspicion of her son and so she
sent the girl away. It all looked plausible, so plausible that my
fears for Anne grew deeper, and the future looked very black
indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my theory is right,&rdquo; Markham went on,
&ldquo;that there is collusion between Mrs. Van Wyck and the valet,
I think the best plan is to question him. I think if sufficiently
frightened, he will tell the truth. And now he has no fear of
punishment for his stolen ride, he will probably make up some other
story and I may yet catch him tripping. But I think this, Mr.
Sturgis, I think it is high time we gave all this information to
the other members of the family. My way would be, to go straight to
Mrs. Van Wyck with the whole story; but if not that, I think at
least Miss Van Wyck and her brother, should be told all of this.
They are practically my employers and my report is due to
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a little more time,&rdquo; I begged. &ldquo;Wait
till to-night, won&rsquo;t you? If I could prove this girl&rsquo;s
story false, how much better not to have insulted Mrs. Van Wyck
with a recital of it&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Mr. Sturgis, that you&rsquo;re assuming a
great deal of responsibility in the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who else is there to take the helm? Morland Van Wyck
is not one to deal with such things, and the ladies could not be
expected to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then as it was tea-time, we joined the others in the
music-room.</p>

<p>Of course, since the tragedy, tea had not been served in the
study, and the beautiful music-room made an attractive setting for
the dainty function.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, there was an air of constraint over us
all; and instead of general conversation, we broke up into small
groups and conversed in low tones.</p>

<p>As was not unusual, Morland and Barbara were disagreeing on some
subject. A few words in their raised voices proved that they were
discussing the lost pearls.</p>

<p>Somewhat to my surprise, Mr. Lasseter took part in their
argument</p>

<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been a burglar,&rdquo; Lasseter
was saying, &ldquo;because he would never have stolen that Deed of
Gift. That theft proves positively the work of some one interested
in behalf of the family. And so Morland, as you can&rsquo;t believe
there were two thieves, I think you must agree that the criminal
was some interested party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you accusing me?&rdquo; burst out Morland. &ldquo;Do
you perhaps think that I raised my hand against my own
father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I accuse nobody,&rdquo; said Lasseter, &ldquo;but I think
we ought to make more progress toward discovering the criminal. I
cast no implication on Mr. Markham&rsquo;s work, but I do say that
it is a most mysterious case, and perhaps Mr. Markham himself would
like it better if he could have some one of his own profession to
consult with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was astonished that the secretary should so assert himself, as
to make this suggestion, for as a rule, he was rather reticent and
non-committal.</p>

<p>Moreover, I knew that the one he had in mind was Fleming
Stone.</p>

<p>Morland opposed this idea and said rather angrily that there was
no use throwing away any more money on detectives, when the one we
had didn&rsquo;t amount to anything.</p>

<p>I felt decidedly uncomfortable at this, for, if I had not held
him back, Mr. Markham would have told the family of his recent
discoveries.</p>

<p>The glance that the detective shot at me expressed this thought,
and I partly made up my mind that I would tell him to go ahead in
his own way.</p>

<p>I left the party and walked out on the terrace alone. It seemed
as if I must do something desperate. I had promised Markham that if
I discovered nothing about that letter by evening, I would consent
to his making the story public. I had vague thoughts of going
straight to Anne with it as it would be easier for her to hear
about it from me alone than from the detective in the presence of
others.</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to do this.</p>

<p>I tried to think what Fleming Stone would do if he had that
letter to puzzle over. And I thought at once, that he would examine
it to the minutest detail, even under a lens.</p>

<p>At any rate, it was something to try; so I asked Markham for the
letter and he gave it to me unnoticed by anyone else. Remembering
that there was a magnifying-glass in the study, I took the letter
in there.</p>

<p>Although the scene of the crime the great room was so beautiful
that it gave no sense of horror. I crossed the soft Turkish rug to
the desk that had been Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s. The lens was there,
and I read the letter through it. The magnifying of it told me
nothing, but as I reread the terrible lines, I could not believe
they were written to Anne in good faith. I believed the letter a
forgery of some sort, and I determined to find out.</p>

<p>I had heard Stone say that typewriting was almost as individual
as pen-writing. That no two typewriters produced the same script
and, indeed, no two operators wrote alike, even on the same
machine.</p>

<p>And so I set to work to note any peculiarities I might find in
the words or letters.</p>

<p>At the very outset I made a discovery. This was that the
typewriting on the envelope and inside the letter were not the
same! There could be no doubt that they were not done on the same
machine. The ink was the same color, the letters about the same
size; but the conformation, though similar, was not identical. I
wondered what this could mean, for surely the paper and envelope
belonged to each other, and why would anyone write a letter on one
typewriter and address it on another?</p>

<p>Spurred on by this discovery I scrutinized still more carefully,
and found that in the message the capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; was
imperfect. A tiny corner of one of its arms failed to print. This
was a small thing, but it was a certain thing. The &ldquo;T&rdquo;
on the envelope was perfectly clear and distinct.</p>

<p>I could find no other discrepancies of this kind, but I was
positive that the fact of two typewriters having been used, proved
chicanery of some sort.</p>

<p>Then, again, I thought perhaps a letter might print clearly at
one time and not at another.</p>

<p>As an experiment I went to the typewriter which stood on a side
table in the study, and hastily wrote a few lines. I did not copy
the letter or the address, but wrote a familiar quotation of some
sort, followed by a whole string of letters at random.</p>

<p>Removing my paper I could scarcely believe my eyes as I looked
at it. The capital &ldquo;T,&rdquo; in every instance, was
imperfect in precisely the same manner as the one in Anne&rsquo;s
letter. There was no doubt of this. I wrote a whole line of
&ldquo;T&rsquo;s&rdquo; and it was impossible to make the key print
it clearly. I made further examination of my slip of paper, and
found that every letter had the same peculiarities as the
corresponding letters in the mysterious note. They were
infinitesimal peculiarities, but they were indubitable. Whoever
wrote that letter to Anne Van Wyck, wrote it on that machine that
was now before me and no other! But the envelope was just as
certainly not addressed on that particular typewriter!</p>

<p>Now what did this mean, I asked myself. And it was a long time
before I could grasp the answer, but it finally came to me in a
flash of inspiration!</p>

<p>As I had suspected, the letter was a forgery; it had been
written on David Van Wyck&rsquo;s typewriter by some one who could
get access to it either secretly or openly; and it had been placed
in an envelope which had contained another letter already received
and opened by Anne! A plan of diabolical ingenuity! of wicked
cleverness!</p>

<p>I still sat by the machine, looking at the letter, when the
faintest sound caught my ear and I glanced up to see Mrs. Carstairs
gliding toward me. She was just at my elbow and was actually about
to snatch the letter from my hand. Indeed her fingers almost
touched it.</p>

<p>I stared at her, and said quietly, &ldquo;What does this mean?
Do you want this letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, and her face showed a cajoling
smile; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I do indeed! I thought you were
copying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if I was?&rdquo; I said, partly angry and wholly
mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; and her alluring face wore a
coaxing expression; &ldquo;please give me the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give you the letter! Why should I do that?&rdquo; She
went so far as to lay her hand on my shoulder, and said softly:
&ldquo;I know I did wrong. I ought never to have read it, but
having read it, I ought never to have shown it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite agree to all that, Mrs. Carstairs, but having
given it into the hands of the detective, you may not take it
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spoke sternly, even more sharply than I meant to, for I was
afraid the woman&rsquo;s wiles would get that letter away from me
against my will.</p>

<p>Then she said: &ldquo;Mr.
Sturgis,&mdash;<em>please,&rdquo;</em>&mdash;and no words can
express the persuasive power of her look and voice,&mdash;&rdquo;
won&rsquo;t you please do this, then? Copy the letter, if you want
to, but give back the original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, eying her closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m sure I did wrong to take it; and I want
to restore it to Mrs. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now of course I had no intention of granting her request, and
I&rsquo;m almost sure I should not have done so, but I may as well
admit that I was greatly relieved that Markham entered the room at
that moment.</p>

<p>She turned to the detective with a pretty pout that was almost
girlish. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have the letter, Mr. Markham?&rdquo;
she begged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the letter? Certainly not, madam! It is without a
doubt a most important clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely Mr. Markham was proof against her blandishments, and she
realized that there was no hope to regain possession of the
letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, lightly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s of
no consequence. If it gets Mrs. Van Wyck into trouble, I&rsquo;m
sure I can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ve done all I could to retrieve
what was perhaps a mistake on my part. Now, she may take the
consequences!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs glided from the room, seeming not at all
disappointed, but actually triumphant &ldquo;I give her up,&rdquo;
I said to Markham; &ldquo;do you think she really wanted that
letter back for Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s benefit, or for some other
reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any other reason; I think she
found the letter, and brought it to me from a sense of duty. Then I
think she felt sorry that she had given such awful evidence against
Mrs. Van Wyck and wanted to retract it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Markham,&rdquo; I said, abruptly, &ldquo;that letter was
written in this room, on David Van Wyck&rsquo;s own
typewriter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he write it himself?&rdquo; Markham seemed absolutely
unable to sense my statement, which must have accounted for his
absurd remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t write it himself!&rdquo; I said
impatiently; &ldquo;but somebody wrote it, on this very typewriter.
Here, I&rsquo;ll prove it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I showed Markham how I had discovered the fact, and proved to
him beyond any doubt, that whoever wrote the letter, it had
certainly been done on that machine. There were a dozen little
peculiarities that made it impossible to be otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; said Markham, looking
absolutely blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If the letter is in good faith, it
means an accomplice in the crime. But if the letter is a fake,
which I think it is, it is written by somebody who wants to throw
suspicion on Mrs. Van Wyck. As you see, the address on the envelope
is not done on this machine. That envelope, whatever its contents
may have been, was mailed and delivered from the village
post-office last Friday. Now, Mr. Detective, solve the
problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said Markham, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;if it was done in this room it must have been done by some
member of the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or some servant or some guest,&rdquo; I supplemented
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No guest would do it No servant would have opportunity to
do it; and beside, the diction and construction of the note is not
that of an uneducated person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go over all the members of the household. Of course
it was neither David Van Wyck or his wife. Equally of course, it
was neither of his children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, man, because that&rsquo;s impossible! Do
you suppose either Morland or Barbara connived with Anne Van Wyck
to kill her husband? Absurd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if the letter is merely a blind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even so. Neither of those two young people would do
this thing to incriminate their stepmother. Morland is more than
half in love with her; and I refuse to suspect Barbara. Go through
with the house guests. Archer and myself would move Heaven and
earth to shield Mrs. Van Wyck, rather than to bring trouble to her.
Mrs. Stelton and Miss Fordyce are simply out of the question. How
about the two Carstairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman was certainly not in league with Mrs. Van Wyck
for any purpose; but I&rsquo;ve already told you that I&rsquo;m
quite ready to suspect her son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The valet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; if he were in league with Mrs. Van Wyck, &mdash;now
keep your temper,&mdash;if they were accomplices in this matter,
would that not fulfil every condition of this letter? He wrote it
to her, we&rsquo;ll say, having access to this room at certain
times. Then, unable to give it to her himself, he mails it in the
morning, in most ordinary fashion, and she gets it in the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nearly throttled the man. &ldquo;Do you mean then, that after
this advice, Mrs. Van Wyck murdered her husband, being assured of
the aid and protection of his valet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo;&mdash;and Mr. Markham
gave me a quiet but meaningful glance, that quelled my anger as no
protestations could have done. I had to stop and think. I had known
Anne only a few days,&mdash;really; how could I tell of what she
might be capable? And I could never forget her assertion that she
was capable of crime! But to be leagued with a
servant,&mdash;against her husband,&mdash;it was unthinkable! At
last I burst out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it! I won&rsquo;t listen to it. And
you&rsquo;ve left out one member of this household! What about that
precious secretary? He has access to this room at all times. We
know almost nothing about him. Why may it not be he who connived
with his employer&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Markham, &ldquo;he is
devoted to Miss Barbara. I fancy they&rsquo;re engaged. But it may
be,&mdash;it may be that he is really in love with Mrs. Van
Wyck&mdash;I tell you, Mr. Sturgis, more crimes are committed for
love than for money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what about Carstairs?&rdquo; I countered. &ldquo;If
he had any motive it must have been the money that he knew he would
get at his master&rsquo;s death. He could have had no other reason.
You don&rsquo;t suppose, do you, that he lifted his eyes to his
master&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anything!&rdquo; and Markham passed
his hand wearily over his brow. &ldquo;I have nothing to do with
supposition. I must find tangible clues and positive evidence. I
have nothing but this letter to work upon. I am glad of your aid,
Mr. Sturgis, for I confess I find it a most baffling case. But
unless you are willing to look at the matter from all sides, you
can be of little assistance to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help you all I can, Mr. Markham, but I make this
condition. Don&rsquo;t tell of this letter quite yet. It is, as you
say, a tangible clue, and I think we ought to learn something from
it. But if you exploit it, you will only have panic as a
result!&rdquo; After a little further persuasion, Markham agreed to
say nothing of the letter just at present. He said we would both
try our best to discover the truth from it; and I curbed my anger
and indignation at his base suspicions, because I really wanted to
aid him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I was the only one who aided Markham in his
investigations, or who even seemed interested in their results.
Sometimes Anne would talk with us, but she was so contradictory and
made such untenable suggestions, that I could scarcely find out
what her desires or intentions were.</p>

<p>Barbara had taken the stand that she wished investigation
stopped. I could not learn her reasons for this, but I began to
think it was because she feared what might be learned from them.
Morland, I had reason to think, knew more about the matter than he
was willing to tell. Whether he was guilty himself, or whether he
knew the guilty person, I could not decide, but I was sure one or
the other must be the case.</p>

<p>I talked it all over with Condron Archer. He seemed to me to
look at the matter very sensibly. &ldquo;On the face of
things,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must admit, Sturgis, that it
looks as if one of the three Van Wycks must be implicated. So it
appears to me that if we can throw suspicion elsewhere, it would
save the Van Wyck family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you would advise that?&rdquo; I said in surprise.
&ldquo;You would willingly cast suspicion on an innocent person in
order to shield one of the Van Wycks?&rdquo; He looked straight at
me. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if it were
Anne who was in danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Look here,
Sturgis, what is the use of denying the truth to each other? You
are in love with Anne Van Wyck, and so am I. I don&rsquo;t for a
moment believe that she killed her husband, but if she did,
I&rsquo;d rather not know it. Now, should we not do anything in our
power to divert suspicion from her? I wouldn&rsquo;t accuse or
convict an innocent man, but if by directing suspicion away from
Anne we can save her, let us do so. And then afterward, let the
better man win her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had little doubt from Archer&rsquo;s assured air that he felt
certain he himself would prove the better man, but I was not so
sure of this. However, for the moment I must consider his
proposition. I told him that I would certainly do all in my power
to shield Anne, but it was because I believed her innocent, and not
because I feared she was guilty.</p>

<p>But he merely shrugged his shoulders at this, and gave me the
impression, without saying so, that he thought me insincere.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>Chapter

The Search For The Pearls</strong>
</h3>

<p>It was a strange sort of gloom that hung over us all at
Buttonwood Terrace. It was not exactly sorrow; indeed, there was
little evidence of real grief for David Van Wyck. His children, if
they mourned for him, did not do so openly; while his wife seemed
stunned rather than saddened. I could not understand Anne. She
seemed to pass rapidly from one strange mood to another. Now she
would be most anxious to discover the murderer and avenge the
crime, and again she would beg of us to discontinue all
investigation.</p>

<p>Archer watched her closely. It seemed to me he suspected her,
and wanted to make sure, but he wanted no one else to suspect
her.</p>

<p>David Van Wyck had died on Friday night, and the funeral had
occurred on Monday. It was now Wednesday, and the inquest would be
resumed in a few days. But to my way of thinking, we had little if
any more evidence to go on. Jeannette had explained the stiletto,
but who knew if she had told the truth? Doubtless she would lie to
shield Anne, for she was devoted to her mistress, and the reasons
she had given for going away seemed to me far from plausible.
Moreover, Anne had expressed no surprise or annoyance at the
girl&rsquo;s absence, which I was forced to admit looked as if the
mistress had thoroughly understood it.</p>

<p>It was on Wednesday morning that I was strolling along the
terraces, thinking deeply, when I became aware of voices below me.
I glanced down a winding, rustic stairway and saw Anne and Condron
Archer. He seemed to be pleading with her, and she looked disturbed
and a trifle defiant. I turned away, having no desire to be an
eaves-dropper, but as I turned, Archer&rsquo;s voice rose in
emphatic declaration, and I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing his
words.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Anne, I know you took the pearls. Now, promise
you will marry me some day, and so give me the right to shield and
protect you in this trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shock of his speech was so great that I involuntarily paused
for an instant, and I heard Anne say, &ldquo;I deny that I took the
pearls. If you think I did, you may search for them. I defy you to
find them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurried away from the spot, suddenly realizing that I was
listening; and I am quite willing to confess to a strong desire to
listen longer. But this I would not do, partly because my sense of
honor forbade it, and also because Anne was the woman I loved, and
I would not listen to a word of hers that was not meant for my
ears.</p>

<p>A moment later I met Barbara and Morland, and they too were
talking of the missing pearls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Mr. Sturgis,&rdquo; said Barbara,
&ldquo;that we ought to make a thorough and systematic search of
the house for those pearls before we consider putting the matter in
the hands of the police? They represent a fortune in themselves,
and I am sure that my father hid them after he had lost control of
his mind. It seems to me, then, that they must be somewhere in the
study, and we ought to be able to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can certainly do no harm to search,&rdquo; I
responded, non-committally, &ldquo;but I supposed you had already
done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have, in a general way,&rdquo; said Morland;
&ldquo;but Barb means to try to find some secret cupboard or
sliding panel hitherto unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
begin at once. Anything is better than doing nothing; and I do
think, Morland, that you&rsquo;re making very little effort to
solve the whole mystery. If I were you, I should call in Fleming
Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Barbara, so sharply that I was
surprised. &ldquo;There is no occasion for such a thing,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;Father killed himself. His mind gave way at the
last, and he was not responsible. Also, he hid the pearls, and we
can find them. Come on and let us begin the search. Here are Anne
and Mr. Archer&mdash;they will help, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After listening to Barbara&rsquo;s request, both Anne and Archer
heartily agreed to help in a thorough search. We went at once to
the study. Markham and Lasseter were already there, and we all went
to work with a will. I think I&rsquo;m safe in saying that no room
was ever searched more carefully than the Van Wyck study was that
day. We divided it into sections, and each of us searched every
section. Mrs. Stelton and Beth Fordyce joined us later, and every
possible hiding-place was ransacked. Nor was it an easy task. There
were many cupboards and desks and odd pieces of furniture with
secret drawers. And besides, there were many possible hiding-places
in the massive and intricate ornamentations. The enormous carved
fireplace seemed to mock at us with its possibilities. The carved
wainscot and stuccoed wall-panels all showed interstices which,
though in some cases thick with the dust of time, were large enough
to hold a pearl necklace.</p>

<p>Anne was perhaps the most energetic of all the searchers. She
ran up the spiral staircase to the musicians&rsquo; gallery and
called for some one to come and help her. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;this carved railing is simply full of places where
anything could be hidden!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I looked up and saw Anne leaning forward with both hands on
the balcony rail, I thought I had never seen a more beautiful
picture. Whether it was the mere exertion of the search, or the
result of some secret knowledge of her own, her cheeks were flushed
and her eyes were bright with an unnatural excitement.</p>

<p>I ran up the iron staircase, myself, in response to her
invitation, and as no one followed us, I drew her back into the
shadow of the curtain draperies, and, clasping both her hands in
mine, I said earnestly, &ldquo;Anne, you don&rsquo;t know where the
pearls are, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hands turned cold in mine, and the color died from her
cheeks. &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What do
you mean? What are you implying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; And, unable to control myself, I clasped
her in my arms. But only for a moment, and then, my senses
returning, I released her, and said calmly, &ldquo;I mean nothing,
Anne. Forgive me, I lost my head for a moment. But you must know
what I shall some day tell you, that I love you, and I shall yet
win you. Hush, don&rsquo;t answer me now! But just remember that I
have utter faith in you, and because of that faith I shall probe
this whole mystery to its furthest depths. I shall learn the truth,
the whole truth, and then, Anne, when it is the proper time, I
shall claim you, and you will give yourself to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have wondered since how I had the courage to make these
statements, for Anne gave me no encouragement. She merely stared at
me, her dark eyes seeming to burn like coals of fire in her white
face. But as I finished she gave a little despairing sob, and said
pitifully, &ldquo;Oh, Raymond, you don&rsquo;t know, you
<em>don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>And then Beth Fordyce came up to the gallery, and both Anne and
I controlled ourselves sufficiently to speak casually, as we all
continued our search. The gallery was six feet wide and extended
across the whole end of the room, except for a space of about four
feet from either side-wall. It rested on six enormously heavy
brackets, and its railing, about three feet high, was also heavy
and elaborate. Miss Fordyce looked over the railing in despair.
&ldquo;We never can look into every cranny of those
brackets,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can do it by ladders from below,&rdquo; I returned;
&ldquo;but I will say that I never saw any room so marvellously
well provided with hiding-places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne stood at the end of the gallery, but not the staircase end,
and looked at the great cartouche that formed the corner of the
cornice, but which was so massive that its lower end was on a level
with the gallery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reach it,&rdquo; she said, stretching out
her hand toward its plaster scroll-work; &ldquo;but the pearls
<em>could</em> be in any of those gilded crevices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there are four of those great ornaments in the
room,&rdquo; said I, looking hopelessly around at the cornice.
&ldquo;But if Mr. Van Wyck secreted his jewels in one of them, he
must have had a long ladder; and where is the ladder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have had a rope-ladder,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Stelton, looking self-conscious, as if she had voiced a brilliant
idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, even so, it must be somewhere, and we have found
nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Well, the search lasted all the morning, without the least
result. And, to my surprise, after luncheon Mr. Markham proposed
that we should search the other rooms of the house. &ldquo;I have
my own reasons for this,&rdquo; he declared, and as this was the
first time I had known him to assume the mysterious air which is
part of the stock in trade of every self-respecting detective, I
began to hope his reasons might be sound ones.</p>

<p>No one was enthusiastic about a further search, but all agreed
to it, except Anne. She declared that the privacy of her own rooms
should not be invaded, and she refused to allow search to be made
in them.</p>

<p>At this, I saw Archer look at her intently; I saw Anne flush
with anger and dismay; and I saw Mr. Markham alertly observing
both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a mere matter of form, Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but I must insist upon it. And of course you must see
that to close your rooms to our search would look&mdash;&rdquo; He
hesitated; even he could not voice the implication he was about to
make, in the face of Anne&rsquo;s scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; she said coldly, and at once led the
way to her own apartments.</p>

<p>Her bedroom, dressing-room, and bathroom were subjected to a
search, but, on the part of most of us, it was perfunctory and
superficial. Except the detective, not one of us was willing to
open the cupboards, boxes, or bureau-drawers. But Mr. Markham
darted here and there, opening drawers, boxes, and baskets, one
after another. I chanced to be sitting by a table on which was a
gilded Florentine chest, which was locked. Markham demanded the
key, and Anne gave it to him. But the chest was entirely empty,
save for several old photographs carelessly flung in.</p>

<p>Disappointed, the detective stared thoughtfully about the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must understand, Mrs. Van Wyck,&rdquo; he said
smoothly, &ldquo;that we have no suspicion, but at the same time we
must make this search a thorough one. And I think we have examined
everything except the book-shelves. I must ask now that the books
be taken down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book-shelves, which were built against the wall, covered
nearly all one side of the room. At Mr. Markham&rsquo;s orders, the
books were taken down, three or four at a time, and returned to
their places; but, although there was plenty of space behind them,
no pearls were discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we open each book?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Archer
sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the detective shortly. &ldquo;Pearls
could not be placed <em>in</em> a book, but they could easily be
hidden behind them, and I must do my duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others had helped with the book-shelf performance, but I had
stayed near Anne. She was trembling like a leaf. If she
<em>had</em> hidden the pearls behind the books, and feared their
discovery, she could not have been more nervously agitated. I
noticed, too, that Archer was watching her closely, even while he
was busily engaged in taking down and putting back the volumes.</p>

<p>In an effort to distract Anne&rsquo;s attention, and perhaps to
calm her unrest, I said, &ldquo;How did you like the vase I brought
you?&rdquo; and I glanced at it where it stood on a small side
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful!&rdquo; she said, and she thanked me with
her eyes. &ldquo;I have never seen a more exquisite piece of
Venetian glass. But so very fragile! I would not let any one but
myself touch it to unpack it; and even then I was afraid it would
break while I was disengaging it from its wrappings. I was
frightened, Raymond, lest Mr. Van Wyck should see it. He was so
absurdly jealous that it would have made him very angry. But now it
doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Her lip quivered, and a strange look
came into her eyes, but I was positive it was not regret that she
no longer had to endure her husband&rsquo;s jealousy.</p>

<p>At last Markham declared himself satisfied that the pearls were
not in Anne&rsquo;s apartments, and, followed by his assistants, he
went to search David Van Wyck&rsquo;s rooms. And from there the
search continued all over the rest of the rooms; and it was well on
toward sundown before he was ready to declare himself satisfied
that the pearls were not hidden in any part of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham, with an air of finality,
&ldquo;we may be sure that Mr. Van Wyck did not hide the pearls,
nor are they in the possession of any member of this household.
This, I think, proves that the robbery was committed by an
intruder, who also killed Mr. Van Wyck. The mystery of how the
burglar entered, and what weapon he used, will, I fear, never be
solved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the missing deed?&rdquo; asked Archer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is another mystery that seems inexplicable. Of
course the fortune now remains in possession of the family, and
will be disposed of according to the terms of Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The will, as everybody knew, left David Van Wyck&rsquo;s three
heirs each in possession of one-third of his fortune. The pearls
were not mentioned in the will, although Anne claimed he had
verbally given them to her. Both Barbara and Morland disputed her
ownership of them, but as the pearls were gone, it made little
difference whose they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking, Mr. Markham,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;that we have all reached the end of our ingenuity. But I
also think that the problem ought not to be given up, and that it
is now time to call in a more expert investigator. I propose,
therefore, that we send for Fleming Stone, and put the matter in
his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that wonderful Mr. Stone!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Stelton, clapping her hands in her foolish way. &ldquo;Send for
him, do! He can tell us everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, for one, do not wish him sent for,&rdquo; said Anne,
in a most positive manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Barbara, for once agreeing with her
step-mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need him,&rdquo; said Morland
thoughtfully. &ldquo;What could he find out more than we
have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found out anything,&rdquo; I retorted.
&ldquo;And he would explain everything in a short time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he, then, omniscient?&rdquo; said Mr. Markham, with a
decided sneer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very nearly so in matters of detective work,&rdquo;
I returned gravely. &ldquo;If Mrs. Van Wyck does not wish to employ
him, I will do so myself; as I am quite willing to admit that I
have a strong desire to solve the mysteries of David Van
Wyck&rsquo;s death and of the stolen jewels and missing
deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We discussed at some length the question of sending for Fleming
Stone, but so strong was the opposition of the Van Wycks, of the
detective, and of Condron Archer, that I forbore to insist, and the
matter was left unsettled.</p>

<p>But later I discussed it alone with Archer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
do it,&rdquo; he said to me earnestly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
that to get Stone here might implicate Anne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, in surprise, &ldquo;my motive in
getting him would be to prove Anne&rsquo;s innocence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if you want to prove Anne Van Wyck innocent, or
even to continue to think her so, don&rsquo;t send for
Stone;&rdquo; and with these words, Archer turned on his heel and
left me.</p>

<p>I went to the study, hoping to find Morland there, and to
persuade him to agree to my views. But there was no one in the
study except the secretary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lasseter,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as man to man,
won&rsquo;t you explain to me why you and Morland persist in those
conflicting stories?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My story is the true one,&rdquo; said Lasseter, looking
me squarely in the eye. &ldquo;When I left the room that night,
Morland sat here&rdquo;&mdash;indicating a large carved seat near
the fireplace&mdash;&ldquo;and Mr. Van Wyck was at his desk. It all
occurred as I related at the inquest. And, Mr. Sturgis, I will tell
you what I have not told any one else. After going out of the door,
I went around the study and half way down the front path to the
road. Then, on an impulse which I cannot explain, I turned back and
went and looked in at the study window&mdash;not the door, but the
window at the farther end. And I distinctly saw Morland bending
over his father&rsquo;s desk. Of course at that time I had no
thought of tragedy, and I hoped that father and son would make up
their quarrel then and there. I merely glanced in, and, turning
away again, went straight home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell of this at the
inquest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, though it would, in a way, prove my story, in
the face of the tragedy I feared it might make things look black
for Morland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect him of&mdash;of any
wrongdoing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. But it is all mysterious, and I agree
with you in wishing that we could have the great Fleming Stone look
into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you didn&rsquo;t want him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally I do; but since Miss Van Wyck is so opposed to
the idea, I should rather defer to her wishes than insist upon my
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; I didn&rsquo;t understand before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lasseter frankly; &ldquo;although
we&rsquo;re not formally engaged, I hope to make Barbara Van Wyck
my wife; and so, you see, I cannot endorse a course of action to
which she is so definitely opposed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true enough, and I told him so. I couldn&rsquo;t help
liking Lasseter, and some things about him which I had thought
strange were explained by what he had just told me.</p>

<p>From him I went straight to Morland. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I
said to him, in a confidential way, &ldquo;why did you and Lasseter
contradict each other at the inquest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wondered you didn&rsquo;t ask me that long ago,&rdquo;
he said, seeming not at all offended. &ldquo;You see, it is this
way. I was sitting on that old bench by the fireplace. But it is in
a dark corner, and I was in a shadow; for after the committee left
we had turned off some of the lights, and the shaded desk-light and
the firelight made pretty much all the illumination there was. I
was tired and discouraged with the whole matter, and I left the
room quietly, just before twelve, without even saying good-night.
Father and Lasseter were talking, and I don&rsquo;t believe they
heard me go. So when Lasseter said good-night to me, as he says he
did, he really thought I was there; and if Father spoke to me, why,
he must have thought so, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was all plausible enough, and the young man&rsquo;s frank
manner convinced me of its truth. But there was another point to be
cleared up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Morland,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That does
explain things. You left the room just before midnight, and a
moment or two later Lasseter went home, and said good-night to you,
thinking you were there. But, a little later still, you
returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Morland, and he turned fairly livid
with rage. &ldquo;What do you mean, Sturgis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do <em>you</em> mean by getting so excited over it?
You <em>did</em> return, and you were seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morland looked straight at me. There was fear in his eyes, but
there was also a strong ring of truth in his voice as he said,
&ldquo;Sturgis, if I returned to the study, and if I was seen
there, then the one who saw me is the murderer! Send for your
Fleming Stone and discover who it may be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word, Morland strode away, leaving me completely
bewildered by his words.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>Chapter

Fleming Stone Arrives</strong>
</h3>

<p>When I went to my room to dress for dinner, I thought the matter
over very definitely, before deciding to send for Stone. It was a
somewhat radical move on my part, and I was not sure that I was
entirely justified; but I felt that I must clear Anne of any
possible breath of suspicion. And as I was unable to do this by
myself, I wanted the best possible assistance I could find. And yet
everybody was opposed to the coming of the great detective. I felt
sure that Barbara didn&rsquo;t want him to come, because she
suspected the guilt of either her brother or the secretary. I could
see this from the way in which she looked at both men, and from
some slight hints she had inadvertently dropped in conversation.
And since it seemed to be fairly well proven that Morland Van Wyck
and Barclay Lasseter were the last two people known to be with
David Van Wyck, then one was, in a way, justified in suspecting one
or both of these men. And Barbara, fearful that Fleming
Stone&rsquo;s coming would mean disaster to her brother or her
lover, naturally protested against it</p>

<p>Condron Archer had said frankly that he didn&rsquo;t want Stone
to come, lest he might implicate Anne; and when I remembered
Anne&rsquo;s various inexplicable actions, and especially her
agitation during the search in her room, I too trembled to think
what Fleming Stone&rsquo;s investigations might disclose.</p>

<p>Markham, the detective, I knew, didn&rsquo;t want Stone, but
that I ascribed to a petty professional jealousy. Of course the two
detectives were not to be mentioned on the same day of the week,
but Markham, in his ignorance, considered himself quite the peer of
Stone.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, Lasseter, I knew, really wanted Stone,
and only refrained from saying so out of consideration for Barbara.
This to me was a fair proof of Lasseter&rsquo;s own innocence. And,
indeed, no breath of real suspicion had fallen on the secretary,
except the general fact that he had had opportunity to steal the
pearls, had he been inclined to do so.</p>

<p>But what had brought my inclinations to a positive decision was
the fact that Morland had said to send for Fleming Stone. He said
it in the heat of passion and under the influence of anger; but he
had said it, and I decided to consider that as authority. So I
concluded to write at once, before Morland could retract his
permission.</p>

<p>I made a rapid toilet, and found I had time enough left before
dinner to write my letter.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter, for I was not one of the principals
in the case, and I didn&rsquo;t wish to tell Stone of my hopes
regarding Anne. But I wrote a straightforward account of
everything, and I begged him to come at once. I told him frankly
that most of the household were opposed to his coming, but that
Morland had sanctioned it, and that if there were ever any question
of authority, I would assume all the responsibility of having asked
him, and would also be responsible for the financial settlement. As
I wrote, my mind became more firmly made up that I was doing right.
I could never marry Anne while she was under this cloud, and, even
should she refuse to marry me, I must free her from any taint of
suspicion regarding her husband&rsquo;s death. Of Archer&rsquo;s
hint that Stone&rsquo;s coming might convict Anne of the crime, I
resolutely took no notice. If I could believe such a thing of the
woman I loved, I would be utterly unworthy of her.</p>

<p>But I wrote nothing of all this to Stone. I told him the simple
facts of the case as I knew them; I told him the indications and
evidences as I knew them; and I must admit that it did seem a
tangle. I felt that we had been either stupid or inefficient in our
endeavors to unravel the mystery; for they certainly had led
nowhere. All suspicion of any person fell to the ground before the
undeniable fact of that sealed room. And all suspicion of suicide
fell to the ground in the absence of any weapon. Truly it was a
case worthy of Fleming Stone&rsquo;s attention, and I hoped with
all my heart he would take it up.</p>

<p>With the thought of helping him to understand it all, I wrote
him everything we had done. I told of Jeannette&rsquo;s
disappearance, of the hidden stiletto, and of her subsequent
explanation. I told him of our exhaustive search for the pearls,
and I told him, too, though I hated to, how nervous and agitated
Anne was when we searched her book-shelves. And then I told him,
though I fully realized that all these things pointed in one
direction, of the last words David Van Wyck said to his wife as he
left the drawing-room. How he had told her he was going to give
away the pearls she looked upon as her own, and how he had said,
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you wish I were dead?&rdquo; I admitted to
him that Anne was very strongly opposed to the munificent gift her
husband had intended making, but stated also that the disappearance
of the deed was quite as favorable to the wishes of the two
stepchildren as to those of the wife.</p>

<p>I told Fleming Stone all this, and I told him, too, that I
believed Anne Van Wyck innocent; but for this belief I could give
no reason.</p>

<p>That letter went off Wednesday night. I sent it to the permanent
address in New York which Stone had given me, though of course I
had no means of knowing whether he was there or not.</p>

<p>But by good fortune he was in New York, and he replied to my
letter at once, so that late Thursday afternoon I received his
reply.</p>

<p>To my satisfaction, he declared himself willing to undertake the
case, and incidentally complimented me on the clearness of my
account and the definiteness of my written details. He said he
would arrive Friday morning, and he begged me to keep the room from
being disturbed any further. &ldquo;Though, I dare say,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;that by this time all possible clues are removed or
destroyed through ignorance or carelessness. However, lock up the
room at once, and let no one enter it until I get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This instruction was scarcely necessary, for the study had had
few occupants since the tragedy. Everybody avoided the place, and
the servants could scarcely be induced to enter it. I knew it had
not been swept or dusted since the fatal night, and I hoped that
Stone&rsquo;s marvellous powers could find clues where we had seen
none. To be sure, we had searched it thoroughly for the pearls, and
no one of us had then found anything in the way of evidence. But we
were not trained observers, and I had great hopes of Stone&rsquo;s
wizardry.</p>

<p>After dinner, I walked on the terrace with Anne. I had announced
at the dinner-table that I had written for Fleming Stone, and that
I had done this with Morland&rsquo;s consent.</p>

<p>I glanced at Morland as I said this, but he made no response
beyond a slight affirmative nod. There was a silence after my
announcement, and then Mrs. Stelton began to babble, and Beth
Fordyce began a rapturous eulogy of Fleming Stone and his work. But
the others said nothing, either for or against the coming of the
detective.</p>

<p>As we walked on the terrace, I tried to draw Anne out on the
subject. But she only said wearily, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.
It would have to come out some time, I suppose. Shall you mind,
Raymond, when your friend Stone proves me a criminal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will do that, Anne,&rdquo; I said
very gently, for I couldn&rsquo;t think it; and yet her despairing
tone alarmed me more than if she had been angry or deeply
disturbed.</p>

<p>And then the others joined us, and the conversation became
general. But, seemingly by tacit consent, the subject of the crime
or the coming of the new detective was not touched upon. Even Mrs.
Stelton seemed to feel the restraint that was upon us all, and for
once refrained from making her usual flippant and ill-timed
observations. The party broke up early, and we all went to our
rooms. The men did not congregate in the smoking-room as usual, but
parted on the landing with brief good-nights.</p>

<p>I, for one, felt heavy of heart. Anne&rsquo;s definite speech
had frightened me, and I wondered if in sending for Stone I had
precipitated the very calamity I wished to avert. But it was too
late now for regret. I had put the matter in other hands, and I
must abide by the consequences. And yet though I could still hope
for Anne&rsquo;s innocence, though my heart still whispered,
&ldquo;Anybody but Anne!&rdquo; I was far from having the same
confidence that I had felt earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The next morning Fleming Stone came. The moment I saw him, I was
glad I had summoned him. He looked so strong, so capable, and so
resourceful, that I knew instinctively he would reach the truth.
And, after all, it was the truth we wanted&mdash;or ought to
want.</p>

<p>We congregated in the drawing-room to meet him, and his
reception was more like that of an honored guest than an official
detective. He greeted each one individually and with the utmost
cordiality and kindness. But after a few polite commonplaces of
conversation, he rose alertly and declared himself ready to begin
the business in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assume I have the freedom of the house,&rdquo; he said,
turning to Anne, who responded merely by a bow.</p>

<p>She was frightened, I could see that, and yet there was nothing
in Fleming Stone&rsquo;s manner to inspire alarm. Indeed, he looked
at her with an intent admiration, as he had done on his former
visit, and I realized that he would give her every possible benefit
of doubt</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go to the study first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I should like to be accompanied only by Mr. Sturgis and Mr.
Markham. After my investigations there, I may want to ask some
questions of the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wanted to feel that Stone was taking me with him because I
might be of some assistance, but this vain hope was quickly
shattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you with me, Mr. Sturgis,&rdquo; he said, as we
entered the study and he closed the door, &ldquo;first, because you
are my employer; and also because you are the only one of this
household who cannot possibly be implicated in this
crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose I looked my amazement, for he went on, &ldquo;That
does not mean that all the rest are implicated, but you are the
only one who I know is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, from the letter you wrote me, which leaves you
free of suspicion, while it leaves every one else open to the
possibility of it. Second, because you had no motive for the
deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t finish; I know you are deeply attracted
to Mrs. Van Wyck, but you would not murder her husband in order to
win her, and then send for me to come out here to discover the
criminal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied, almost smiling at
the way he put it. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Stone, if I can help you in
any way, I shall be only too glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I shall not require help, thank you; I ask only
freedom from interruption, and, possibly, answers to occasional
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the words were a trifle curt, the tone was not at all so, and
I willingly sat down, content to watch the great man at his
work.</p>

<p>Mr. Markham, also, watched Stone intently, and even offered
suggestions now and then. But these, Stone dismissed with a mere
word or two,&mdash;often with only a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>As I had surmised he would do, he scrutinized every part of the
room; at first with sweeping glances, and then focussing his
attention on various details. I had told him in my letter of the
security with which the room was locked and bolted on the inside,
and he examined all the fastenings of doors and windows with utmost
care and interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can safely say,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that
I have never seen a room apparently so absolutely impossible of
ingress. And yet some one entered and left while it was thus bolted
and barred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not a suicide, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. It was a case of wilful murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Committed by an intruder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; by an intruder of exceeding cleverness, of
marvellously cool nerve, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of great physical strength?&rdquo; I prompted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; said Stone, looking sharply at
me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deduce especial strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt ashamed, for I realized in a sudden flash that I had said
that hoping to learn that his thoughts were not directed toward
Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what did this intruder do with the weapon he
used?&rdquo; I stammered, partly to hide my confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left it behind him, in plain view of every one. I
fear, Mr. Sturgis, you are unobservant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I cried, stung by his evident scorn
of what we had done, or, rather, what we had failed to do.
&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that the weapon is even now in this
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is; and in plain sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me where; let me find it for
myself,&rdquo; I cried, gazing wildly around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find it if you can, but as you have overlooked it all
these days, how can you expect to see it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely mystified,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We
searched this room so carefully for the pearls, that I would have
sworn we must have found a weapon, had there been any to find. Show
it to me, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is;&rdquo; and Fleming Stone pointed quietly to
a bill-file which stood on the desk. It was of the ordinary type,
with a heavy bronze standard and a long, sharp, upright spike. The
bills and papers on it reached nearly to the top, but as soon as my
attention was drawn to it, I realized that with the bills removed
it would indeed be a deadly weapon, and would correspond in every
way to the weapon which the doctor declared must have been
used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it escaped
our attention because of its very obviousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;but it was
inconspicuous, being nearly covered with the bills; and, moreover,
you looked only for a definite weapon, and not for an ordinary
implement used as one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to notice it so quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you had told me no weapon could be found, with
the exception of the possible stiletto. And that did not greatly
impress me, for no one would leave evidence of a crime in so simple
a hiding-place. Even now I believe that bill-file to be the
criminal&rsquo;s weapon, only because I can discover no other. But
let us look at it. If we find a particle of blood-stain on the
papers, I think we may have no further doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fleming Stone carefully lifted the bills from the metal rod that
pierced them. Drawing a lens from his pocket, he examined the
bill-file and several of the papers. &ldquo;It was used to kill Mr.
Van Wyck,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It was carefully wiped off and
the bills returned to it The particles of blood remaining on it are
scarcely perceptible to the naked eye, but may clearly be seen
through the magnifying-glass. You may perceive, also, some faint
stains around the holes in the papers where they slid down the
spike. As this is vital evidence, I will put it safely away.&rdquo;
Fleming Stone put the file with its papers in a small cupboard of
the desk, which he locked and then took out the key.</p>

<p>After that, for a long time, Markham and I sat silently watching
him as he proceeded with his scrutiny of the room. Occasionally he
examined something through his glass, occasionally he picked up a
scrap of something from the floor and put it in his notebook or
pocket. At last I could contain myself no longer, and I burst out
with, &ldquo;Mr. Stone, do you know how the murderer got in and
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the
faintest idea. But since a human being did do so, another human
being may discover how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt that he was avoiding the masculine pronoun on purpose,
and again my heart sank, as I feared for Anne.</p>

<p>After an hour or so, though it seemed ages, Fleming Stone
declared his investigation of the room completed, and announced his
desire to see next some of the servants. I took him across the
house to the kitchen quarters, and in the butler&rsquo;s pantry we
found a footman and two maids.</p>

<p>After a quick glance at the faces of the trio, Mr. Stone
interrogated the more intelligent-looking of the maids. &ldquo;When
express packages arrive,&rdquo; he said to her, in his pleasant
way, &ldquo;who attends to them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A footman, sir,&rdquo; said the girl, with an air of
proud importance at being questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What footman? This one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. That&rsquo;s Jackson, sir. He &lsquo;most
always takes the express parcels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you can speak for yourself, Jackson. On the day
of your master&rsquo;s death, did any express parcels
arrive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Jackson. &ldquo;I remember there
were three came that morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was in them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supplies for the pantry, sir. Mostly bottles and jars,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what were they packed in&mdash;excelsior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; excelsior and straw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was there no other parcel, containing china or
glass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was another, sir, but not by express. Mr. Sturgis
brought it. That was glass, and it was taken to Mrs. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fleming Stone turned to me. &ldquo;What was the packing, Mr.
Sturgis?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied, greatly mystified
at this turn of affairs. &ldquo;I brought a glass vase as a gift to
Mrs. Van Wyck, but she opened the box when I was not
present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I emptied the box, sir,&rdquo; volunteered Jackson,
&ldquo;and it was full of tissue paper cut into little
scraps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;That is what
a fine piece of glass would naturally be packed in. That is all.
Thank you, Jackson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly and thoughtfully, Stone walked back through the house. He
detained me a moment as we passed through the dining-room.
&ldquo;You want me to go on with the case, Mr. Sturgis,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;wherever the results may lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shuddered at this question, coming right on top of his
discovery of Anne&rsquo;s glass vase. I could see no possible
connection between my innocent gift and the Van Wyck tragedy, but
there must have been one in Stone&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>However, I replied &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; knowing that I must know
the truth, whatever it might be.</p>

<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
The Two Carstairs</b>
</h3>

<p>We all three went back to the study. Stone looked thoughtful,
even puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the most mysterious case I have ever known,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you say once,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;that the
deeper the apparent mystery, the easier the solution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is true, in a way, Mr. Sturgis. A simple
commonplace case with little mystery and much seemingly direct
evidence, is often more difficult than a case which presents
startling and strange features.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; put in Mr. Markham, &ldquo;if another
mystery will help you in the matter, here it is,&rdquo; and he
handed Fleming Stone the typewritten letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter always means a great deal,&rdquo; said Stone, as
he scrutinized the address.</p>

<p>Markham and I watched him almost breathlessly as he drew out the
letter and read it.</p>

<p>He studied both the sheet and the envelope for a few moments,
and then looked up and said quietly, &ldquo;the letter is a
decoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham, eager to
seem astute; &ldquo;and it was mailed the day of Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s death, and the letter was written on the typewriter in
this very room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mailed in the morning and received in the
afternoon,&rdquo; agreed Stone, glancing at the postmarks.
&ldquo;It was written on two different typewriters, and to my mind
this clearly tells the whole story. I am willing to aver that
whoever sent this missive abstracted from Mrs. Van Wyck&rsquo;s
room, perhaps from her waste basket, a complete letter probably an
unimportant one,&mdash;which she had received duly in her Friday
afternoon mail. That letter bore writing only on its first
page;&mdash;it might have been a printed advertisement Whoever was
managing the affair, tore off that first page and utilized this
second half of the sheet for this letter, bringing it in here to
write. Then it was an easy matter to put it back in the envelope,
thus making it seem like a letter which had come duly through the
mail. It was brought to you, a bit of faked evidence, &mdash;and I
doubt if Mrs. Van Wyck ever saw the letter at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was found in a book she was reading the very night
the crime occurred,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you have been <em>told</em> that it was. Have
you asked Mrs. Van Wyck, herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would she admit it, if she were guilty?&rdquo; said</p>

<p>Markham with a triumphant air of having said something
clever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in so many words, perhaps; but surely one could judge
from her manner. Now then, to discover who did write this letter;
which ought not to be at all difficult. It does not bear on its
face evidence of being the work of either of David Van Wyck&rsquo;s
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Markham, eagerly, &ldquo;they would
scarcely connive with their step-mother in such a deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that! There was no conniving. Nobody
really wrote to Mrs. Van Wyck that she should do this thing, and he
would protect her! The thing is a fraud, I tell you, and was
written merely to throw suspicion on Mrs. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could have hugged Stone for this. Wherever his deductions
might lead it would certainly be toward anybody but Anne!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;this in no sense
exonerates Mrs. Van Wyck; nor does it prove anything except that
some one chose this means of throwing suspicion on her. It was
cleverly done, and yet it is, after all, a clumsy piece of work,
for it bears on its face the stamp of fraud. Anyone ought to know
to-day, that the fact of using different typewriters would give
away the game Therefore, it was written by some one who&mdash;by
the way, are there any French people in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stone asked this question, after a further perusal of the
letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Markham, quickly, &ldquo;there are
two of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a strong conviction that one of them wrote this
letter,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carstairs! I told you so!&rdquo; and Mr. Markham looked
elated; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s Mr. Van Wyck&rsquo;s valet, and I knew
all along he was in connivance with Mrs. Van Wyck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fleming Stone looked at him, &ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;this letter does not mean connivance. Would this
valet, for any reason, want to throw suspicion on Mrs. Van
Wyck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Mr. Markham looked
positively sullen because Fleming Stone&rsquo;s deductions did not
seem to agree with his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the other French person?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Carstairs&rsquo; mother,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;She is housekeeper here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carstairs is not a French name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone; but she is a Frenchwoman. I believe her
husband was an Englishman, and her son seems to have the traits of
both. Mr. Van Wyck considered him an exceptionally good
valet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please send for them both,&rdquo; was Fleming
Stone&rsquo;s order, and Markham rang the bell.</p>

<p>The two Carstairs came in together, and to my mind the mother
looked like a lioness defending her young. Surely whatever traits
this strange woman possessed, her maternal instinct was among the
strongest. She looked defiant as she entered, and putting Carstairs
in the background, she herself took a chair near Stone, and seemed
ready to answer questions.</p>

<p>Of course, we had told Fleming Stone everything we knew
concerning the whole matter. He knew of Carstairs&rsquo; joy ride,
and of his fright lest it be discovered. His gaze went past the
mother and fastened on the white-faced young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carstairs,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet pleasant tone,
&ldquo;you really needn&rsquo;t feel so frightened. You
didn&rsquo;t kill your master,&mdash;you had no hand in it. Now,
secure in the knowledge of your innocence, why are you so filled
with alarm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m n-not, sir,&rdquo; and though the valet looked
greatly relieved at Stone&rsquo;s words, he was still nervously
agitated.</p>

<p>But the look of relief on Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo; face was
unmistakable. A light spread over her whole countenance, and she
looked like one who had narrowly escaped disaster.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone looked at her intently. She returned his gaze
without fear, even with a trace of her usual seductive manner; but
he seemed to look straight through any mannerism to her very
soul.</p>

<p>After a moment, he said, and his words shot out suddenly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carstairs, had you any reason for wishing to fasten
this crime on Mrs. Van Wyck, except to direct suspicion from your
own son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The housekeeper&rsquo;s eyes blazed. &ldquo;I hate her!&rdquo;
and the exclamation seemed wrung from her by Stone&rsquo;s
compelling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The inquiry was in the most casual tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; young Carstairs interrupted her;
&ldquo;what are you saying? Collect yourself! You make a
mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carstairs gave one frightened, bewildered glance at her
son, and then like a flash she changed the whole expression of her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said, gently; &ldquo;I
spoke without thinking. I really have no animosity toward Mrs. Van
Wyck. I did feel a slight jealousy when she married a man who had
promised to marry me. But that is past now, and I bear her no ill
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are telling deliberate untruths,&rdquo; said Stone,
straightforwardly; &ldquo;but it does not matter; I have learned
what I have wanted to know. Now Mrs. Carstairs you have no notion
who sent this letter to Mrs. Van Wyck, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; she returned, disdainfully eying
the letter Stone held up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You found it in a book, as you described to Mr.
Markham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you came and asked Mr. Sturgis for it, saying that he
might keep a copy of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have concluded, Mrs. Carstairs, to grant that request,
if you will make the copy yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot use a typewriter, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;m not
familiar with the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The valet gave an involuntary glance of surprise at his mother,
but immediately dropped his eyes again.</p>

<p>She <em>can</em> use a typewriter! I thought to myself, and
won&rsquo;t admit it!</p>

<p>But Stone said, lightly, &ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.
Just write with a lead pencil. Here is one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer not to do it,&rdquo; and Mrs. Carstairs looked
at the great detective with the air of a frightened animal, who
does not understand into what snare it is being led.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to have no reason for refusing. It is a small
matter. Kindly make a copy at my dictation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He offered a pencil and a paper pad to Mrs. Carstairs, and
though she hesitated, she finally took them, as there seemed to be
nothing else to do.</p>

<p>In a low, clear tone, Fleming Stone read the sentences from the
letter, waiting after each until Mrs. Carstairs had written it</p>

<p>The woman looked utterly miserable. It was evident that she
could not see why she had to do this, but she feared some
underlying reason that boded ill for her.</p>

<p>Inexorably, Stone continued. One after another, the short,
direful sentences fell from his lips. Mrs. Carstairs grew whiter
and her fingers almost refused to hold the pencil, but with
indomitable courage she persevered to the end.</p>

<p>After the last word, Stone held out his hand for the paper, and
she mutely handed it to him. The rest of us sat spellbound. There
was nothing theatrical in the episode, it was the quietest possible
procedure, and yet the incident seemed fraught with intense mystery
and importance.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone gave the merest glance at the paper, tore it into
tiny bits and threw it into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carstairs,&rdquo; he said, and his tone was almost
careless; &ldquo;you wrote that letter yourself on the typewriter
in this room. It was cleverly done. You used the blank half of a
letter Mrs. Van Wyck had already received and the envelope it came
in. You pretended that she had received and read this letter. Now
will you tell us just why you did this, or would you prefer to
explain it to the coroner later? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless to say you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted
Stone. &ldquo;The proof is positive. Now I&rsquo;ll repeat my
question of some time ago. Did you wish to incriminate Mrs. Van
Wyck merely to divert suspicion from your son, or for any other
reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again anger and rage gleamed from Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo; eyes.
She was about to burst into a torrent of language, when she
controlled herself, glanced at her son, and said in a low, even
thrilling tone: &ldquo;<em>Only</em> to save my son from possible
suspicion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, you&rsquo;re telling an untruth, madam,&rdquo;
said Stone, as if it were a matter of no moment. &ldquo;You are
rather expert at it. However, if you&rsquo;ll take my advice, you
will do wisely to adhere to that statement! Let me suggest that you
keep your other reason to yourself. You may go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time in my experience, I saw Mrs. Carstairs&rsquo;
face wear a beaten look. She rose from her chair, a vanquished
woman. But she had nerve enough to make a slight mocking bow as,
accompanied by her son, she left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole matter of that letter means nothing,&rdquo;
said Fleming Stone; &ldquo;the case is still the deepest mystery to
me. I saw at once after I learned Mrs. Carstairs had written that
letter, that her prime motive was to save that idolized son of hers
from accusation or suspicion. But another reason, was her hatred of
Mrs. Van Wyck. I advised her to keep that to herself, and as I
imagine she will do so, I doubt if she can do any more
harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you sure she wrote the note?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Markham, and I, too, waited with eagerness for the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a random shot,&rdquo; said Stone, smiling a
little; &ldquo;although it was quite evident how the thing was
done. But you remember, I asked you if there were any French people
about. As you see, in this letter, the word committee is spelled
with one &ldquo;M.&rdquo; While that <em>might</em> be a mere
verbal error, it gave me the impression that the note was written
by a French native. For their word is &lsquo;comite,&rsquo; and
while the writer of the note is familiar with the English tongue,
that is a tricky word for a Frenchman to spell, because of the
double letters. However, that proof needed confirmation, so I
simply asked the lady to write the note from my dictation; and, if
you please, she misspelled &lsquo;committee&rsquo; in exactly the
same way! Even then, it might have been that the son wrote
it,&mdash;or any one else, for that matter, but when I declared
with conviction that she <em>had</em> written it, she was unable to
deny it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all sounds so simple, now that you explain it,&rdquo;
I said, with a feeling of chagrin that I had not noticed the
misspelled word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That particular bit of a mystery <em>was</em> simple of
solution,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;but it helps us not a bit with
the main issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Stone&rsquo;s request, we went in search of Anne.</p>

<p>We found her in the music-room with Archer. They were in close
conversation, and I had no doubt he was urging her again to give
him the right to protect her. I knew Archer felt, as I did, that
all usual conventions were to be ignored in such circumstances as
these we were experiencing.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone spoke directly to Anne, and his calm, pleasant
manner seemed to imbue her with an equal quietness of demeanor. She
even almost smiled when Stone said, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think
me over-intrusive, Mrs. Van Wyck, but will you tell me what gown
you wore at dinner last Friday evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Anne, rising. &ldquo;If you will
come to my room, I will show it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although uninvited, Archer and I followed. On reaching
Anne&rsquo;s dressing-room, she took from a wardrobe the beautiful
yellow satin gown, which I well remembered, and which now seemed to
mock at the sombre black robe she wore.</p>

<p>Stone looked at the gown admiringly, and seemed to show a
special interest in the frills and jabots of the bodice. Truly,
this man&rsquo;s ways were past understanding! What clue could he
expect to find in this way?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you came to your room that night; did you keep
on this gown until you prepared to retire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne, looking at him wonderingly; but
even as she looked, her eyes fell before his and she continued in a
hesitating way, &ldquo;No, I changed into a negligee
gown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see that?&rdquo; asked Stone pleasantly.</p>

<p>This time, it seemed to me, with reluctance, Anne took from the
wardrobe a charming boudoir robe of chiffon and lace. It was
decorated with innumerable frills and rosettes, and again Stone
seemed eagerly interested in the trimmings. He even picked daintily
at some of the bows and ruches, saying lightly, &ldquo;I am not a
connoisseur in ladies&rsquo; apparel, but this seems to me an
exquisite confection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Anne. &ldquo;It is Parisian.&rdquo;
But she spoke with a preoccupied air, and I knew she was deeply
anxious as to the meaning of all this. She hung the gown back in
its place, and then Stone seated himself, after having courteously
placed a chair for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warned you I should ask a few questions, Mrs. Van
Wyck,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;so please tell me, first, how you
occupied the time before you retired that evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s embarrassment had vanished, and she looked straight
at her questioner as she replied in even tones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I did nothing worth-while. I wrote one or two notes to
friends, glanced through a book about Gardening, tried on a new
hat, and then unpacked a glass vase which Mr. Sturgis brought me,
because I preferred not to trust that task to a servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your maid was here when you finally
retired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I had dismissed Jeannette earlier, and told her she
need not return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you leave your rooms late that night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Anne was fast losing control of herself. Her voice trembled,
and her large eyes were fixed on Stone&rsquo;s face. His expression
was one of infinite pity, and he said gently, &ldquo;Please think
carefully, and be sure of what you are saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; murmured Anne, and then Archer leaned
over and whispered to her. What he said I do not know, but it must
have been an accusation of some sort, for Anne turned scarlet and
stared at Archer with angry eyes. She glanced at her bookshelves,
and then back at Archer and then at Stone, and finally, with a look
of pathetic appeal, directly at me.</p>

<p>I knew she was asking my help, but what could I do? In a sudden
desperate attempt to relieve her, for at least a moment, I turned
the subject, and, touching the beautiful Florentine chest on the
table beside me, I drew Stone&rsquo;s attention to it as a work of
art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;it is a fine piece. Worthy
of holding the family heirlooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of which,&rdquo; I said lightly, &ldquo;Mrs. Van
Wyck uses it merely as a receptacle for old photographs.&rdquo;
Anne&rsquo;s agitation seemed to be increasing, and, determined to
keep Stone from addressing her for a few moments longer, I opened
the chest to prove my words. Stone glanced carelessly at the old
pictures, faded except round their edges, and then, suddenly
rising, he picked up two or three and looked at them intently. A
sudden light flashed into his eyes, and, turning to Anne, he said
in tones of genuine admiration, &ldquo;Wonderful, Mrs. Van Wyck!
Positively splendid! I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at him in amazement. There was no portrait of Anne
among the old photographs he held, and what he meant I could not
imagine.</p>

<p>But Anne knew. Sinking back in her chair, she covered her face
with her hands and gave a low moan.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
The Mystery Solved</strong>
</h3>

<p>Just then Barbara and Morland came into the room.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Anne?&rdquo; Morland asked
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s bothering you? I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; He
went to her and put his arm round her, and, seemingly encouraged by
his strength and sympathy, Anne looked up and with an effort
regained her poise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine!&rdquo; she exclaimed, addressing
herself to Stone, while her dark eyes flashed defiance at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; he replied, and then he
looked at her in a perplexed way. For a moment these two exchanged
glances, and it seemed as if they had superhuman powers of reading
each other&rsquo;s thoughts. Then Stone gave a little nod,
straightened himself up, and said, &ldquo;We must go on, whatever
the outcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, speaking to us all, generally, he said, &ldquo;I have
found the missing pearls&mdash;I can lay my hand upon them at any
moment. Before I do so, does the one who took them from the study
wish to say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archer looked at Anne, but I looked at Morland. I had a feeling
that Morland had taken those pearls; but, if so, he showed no
evidence of guilt at this moment.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone looked at no one in particular, and after a
moment&rsquo;s pause he said, &ldquo;Then I will simply hand them
to their owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the book-shelves, and without hesitation took down a
thick volume. It was an old-fashioned photograph album, fastened
with two ornate gilt clasps. Slowly snapping these open, he opened
the book. The photographs from several of the leaves had been
removed, and in the cavity thus made, wrapped in blue cotton, was
the Van Wyck pearl necklace!</p>

<p>Amid the exclamations of surprise, I was silent, for I realized
instantly that those photographs in the gilt chest were the ones
taken from the album to make room for the pearls; and that
I&mdash;I had deliberately shown those photographs to Stone, and
thereby offered his quick intellect a clue to the hiding-place!</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are mine!&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;It was no theft!
My husband gave them to me, and I had a perfect right to take them
when I chose, and hide them where I chose. But because I took them
from the safe in the study, you need not think that I killed my
husband! I took them&mdash;the day before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; exclaimed Archer in a warning voice,
&ldquo;tell the truth, dear&mdash;it will be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did go into the study late that night, Mrs. Van
Wyck,&rdquo; said Stone quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; flashed Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For one thing, your maid saw you coming from the study
shortly after midnight. But also, I found in there, on the fur rug
in front of the safe, two small scraps of the shredded tissue-paper
from the box which you unpacked. I found also two bits in the
rosettes of the negligee gown that you wore, and I&rsquo;m sure
that the bits on the rug fell from your gown as you took the pearls
from the safe. I do not deny your right to take them; nor your
right to hide them in the exceedingly clever place you selected.
But I must ask you to admit if this is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Anne, as if at the end of her
endurance, and then she fainted.</p>

<p>We went away from the room, leaving her with Barbara and the
maid; and as none of us felt inclined to talk, we drifted
apart.</p>

<p>Fleming Stone seemed more than ever thoughtful and preoccupied.
I would have talked with him, but he asked to be left to himself,
and went directly to the study.</p>

<p>Soon after this, luncheon was announced, and we gathered round
the table in a desperate effort to throw off the gloomy fear that
overhung us.</p>

<p>At first the conversation was on general subjects, Stone leading
the way with his kindly and courteous remarks.</p>

<p>But all at once Anne lifted her great eyes, and, looking
straight at Stone, said, &ldquo;I know you think I killed my
husband, Mr. Stone, but I did not. And why should I do so, to get
those pearls, since they were my own, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought perhaps Fleming Stone would answer this question
directly, but instead he said, &ldquo;Were you not anxious to
prevent his gift to the library?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Morland spoke in a terse, hard voice: &ldquo;You mean by
that, Mr. Stone, that Anne took the Deed of Gift from my
father&rsquo;s desk. That is not true, for I took it
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; said Stone, looking at him sharply.
&ldquo;Yes, I did. I told the truth when I said I left the study
before Lasseter did. But I don&rsquo;t think Lasseter knew this,
and he thought I was there when he went away. But a little later I
returned. My father was not there; the outside door was open, and I
think he had stepped out on the terrace. However, I took the deed,
and I have it in my possession still; but as it is unsigned, it is
of no value to anybody. But I did not kill my father, and I&rsquo;m
telling about the deed to exonerate Anne from any suspicion of
having taken it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne cast a grateful look at Morland, and then continued to look
at him, but with a changed expression. I could follow her thoughts,
or at least I thought I could, and I thought she was wondering if,
after all, Morland had killed his father. Perhaps they had
quarrelled over the deed, and Morland was misrepresenting the
scene.</p>

<p>At any rate, the net of suspicion was drawing close round the
two, Morland and Anne. My heart sickened as I realized that it must
have been one or the other of these, and that Fleming Stone&rsquo;s
unerring skill would yet discover which.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unnecessary to assert innocence until guilt is
suspected,&rdquo; said Stone, in a calm voice; &ldquo;and until we
learn how a murderer could get in and out of that locked room, we
can accuse no one; nor can we assert that it was not a case of
suicide.&rdquo; And then he determinedly changed the subject; nor
would he allow it to be brought up again during the meal.</p>

<p>But as we left the table, Stone spoke low to me. &ldquo;Lead the
whole crowd out on the terrace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and keep
them there for an hour or so. On no account let them come into the
house, or at least not into the study. I must be uninterrupted for
an hour, at least, and then the mystery will be solved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not set me a difficult task. For some reason, the members
of the little group seemed quite willing to stay out of doors. We
strolled down to a large arbor on the lawn, and sat there talking,
sometimes all together, and sometimes in twos and threes. After a
while Markham joined us, and inquired how far Mr. Stone had
progressed in his investigations. Anne told him frankly enough that
she herself had taken the pearls from the safe, and Morland
repeated his admission of having taken the deed. Mr. Markham was
excited over these revelations, but the strange apathy that had
settled down on our people was not greatly stirred by his comments.
Presently Archer and Beth Fordyce went off for a walk around the
garden. Mrs. Stelton asked me to go, too, but I declined, as I had
my work of keeping the people out of the house.</p>

<p>It was just about an hour before Stone rejoined us. He greeted
Mr. Markham pleasantly enough, and then turned to me. &ldquo;As my
employer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall I make my final report to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To all of us,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I asked you to
come here, but Mrs. Van Wyck and David Van Wyck&rsquo;s children
are quite as much entitled to hear your report as I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us all go to the study, then,&rdquo; said Stone.
&ldquo;Where is Mr. Archer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went down through the lower gardens with Miss
Fordyce,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Markham,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;suppose you go
after them.&rdquo; He added a few words to Markham which I did not
hear, and then we all went to the study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you all in a few words,&rdquo; said Mr. Stone.
&ldquo;We know that Mrs. Van Wyck took the pearls from the safe,
and that Mr. Morland Van Wyck took the paper from his
father&rsquo;s desk. But neither of these had any hand in Mr. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s death. Mr. Van Wyck was murdered later that same
night. He was stabbed with this bill-file;&rdquo; and Stone
produced the file in evidence. &ldquo;After killing Mr. Van Wyck,
the murderer himself carefully fastened all the doors and windows,
and left the room by a secret exit. This is the explanation of the
sealed room, and I will now show you where the secret passage is. I
did not know myself until during the last hour. I came in here
positive that there was some such way of egress, and after a
careful search I found it. As you see, the study is joined to the
main house only by one corner, which laps the corner of the house
for a space of about ten feet. This ten feet on the ground floor
gives space for the connecting doorway which is usually used. The
study is the height of two full stories of the house, but the study
has only one story, and therefore an unusually high ceiling. The
deep cornice has an immense cartouche ornamenting each corner. It
seemed to me that behind this cartouche in the corner that touches
the house was the only possibility of a secret exit from this
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All eyes turned at once to the great shield-shaped affair of
which he spoke. It was quite large enough to conceal a secret door,
but at a height of twenty-five feet or more from the floor, it was
entirely inaccessible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems inaccessible,&rdquo; said Stone, following our
thoughts, &ldquo;and there is no ladder or possibility of one
anywhere about. But I was so sure that my theory was the true one
that I examined the floor in that corner and found several tiny
flakes of plaster that had fallen. Then I was certain that the
secret exit had been used recently. I went in the house, and
upstairs to the room in which the secret passage &mdash;if there
was one&mdash;must necessarily open. I found in the back part of a
deep cupboard a panel, and by dint of search I found a spring which
caused the panel to open. I then discovered that I was directly
back of the great cartouche. In a word, the passage is an exit from
this room. I will now show you the means of using it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We watched with breathless attention while Fleming Stone mounted
the spiral staircase and walked the length of the little gallery.
At the end he stood with his hand on the end rail, quite four feet
from the cartouche.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Note the beautiful simplicity of it,&rdquo; he said.
Merely loosening a bolt on the under side of the end railing caused
the whole end of the balcony to fall outward. As it did so, the
great end bracket beneath swung the other way, acting as a
counterweight, and what had been the end railing of the gallery was
now a horizontal bridge straight across to the cartouche. Moreover,
mechanism in the wall had at the same time raised the outer shell
of the cartouche, which was hinged at the top, and disclosed a
small doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Mr. Stone, speaking to us from
the gallery. &ldquo;As I said, it is beautifully simple. Once
unbolted, a person&rsquo;s weight serves to throw down the railing
as a bridge, and open the cartouche. Now you will see that, as I
step off and through this doorway, the removal of my weight causes
the railing to swing back to place, and the cartouche to
close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stepping off the railing upon a ledge and through the door,
Stone disappeared, and the mechanism worked exactly as he had said.
A moment later he reappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that is the way David
Van Wyck&rsquo;s murderer left this room, after securely locking it
with the intent to involve the affair in deepest mystery. You all
know, I suppose, who occupies the room into which the secret
passage opens on the second floor of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;It is Condron
Archer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Archer has gone away,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone
significantly. &ldquo;I have sent Mr. Markham after him, but, as I
understand it, I was employed here to solve a mystery, and not to
arrest a criminal. In fact, I have not proved that Mr. Archer is
the criminal. But I think no one doubts it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this point that Beth Fordyce returned to us.
&ldquo;Oh, Anne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Archer said that he
had to go away very suddenly. He had had a telegram, or something,
and he asked me to tell you good-by for him, and to give you this
letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is his confession,&rdquo; said Anne, in a low voice,
as she took the letter from Beth. &ldquo;I felt sure of it all the
time. Raymond, will you read it aloud?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was touched at the confidence she showed in me, and, taking
the letter, I opened it. It bore no address, and began abruptly
thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not a confession, but an explanation of why I
killed David Van Wyck. I know now that Fleming Stone&rsquo;s
penetration will discover the secret passage, which Mr. Van Wyck
himself explained to me a few days before his death. And so I am
going away&mdash;not fleeing from justice, but because I do not
look upon myself as a criminal. I killed Mr. Van Wyck, not in
self-defense, but in defense of one far dearer to me than myself.
Last Friday night, after having gone to my room at eleven
o&rsquo;clock, I came downstairs again about midnight, with no
intent other than a stroll on the terrace. I had been there but a
few moments when Mr. Van Wyck joined me. I do not wish to repeat
his conversation, but I realized what a vicious, cruel, and even
diabolical husband he was to the woman I adored. I speak frankly of
this adoration, for it is no secret. David Van Wyck talked of his
wife in a way that made my blood boil, and I was about to tell him
so when, his attention attracted by a sound in the study, he
beckoned to me, and we looked in at the window. Mrs. Van Wyck was
taking the pearls from the safe. As we watched, she carried them
from the room, closing the door behind her. David Van Wyck drew me
into the study with him, and exclaimed in fiendish glee, &lsquo;Now
I have her where I want her! I shall denounce her as a thief, and
see if she will then be so high and mighty toward me!&rsquo; I
begged him not to do this, whereupon he accused me of being in love
with his wife, and made other wicked assertions that I could not
stand. He repeated his intention to give away all his money, to get
back the pearls, and to denounce Anne as a thief; and he became, I
really think, momentarily insane in his rage. Possibly I too lost
my mind, but I snatched up the bill-file, tore off the papers, and
stabbed him in a moment of white-hot anger. I carefully locked up
the study, hoping the deed might thus be an insoluble mystery. I
left the room by the secret exit, which leads directly to the
cupboard in the bathroom adjoining my bedroom. It was through this
panel I had disappeared the night Sturgis looked for me. I went
back to the study to see if I had left behind me any incriminating
evidence. I found none, but after Mr. Stone deduced Mrs. Van
Wyck&rsquo;s presence in the study, by scraps of tissue paper, I
have no doubt he will in some way trace mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to my act,&mdash;I will not call it a crime,&mdash;I
do not regret it. I have saved Mrs. Van Wyck from the cruelties of
a monster, and I am glad of it. But I refuse to pay the penalty for
this, and so I shall disappear forever from the country. I could
not do this if I thought I could ever win my heart&rsquo;s desire.
But I know, Anne, that in the after years you will find joy and
peace with a man who is worthy of your regard, though it pierces my
heart to admit it. But even if through crime, Anne, I have saved
you from the further despotism and insults of a brute; and the
knowledge of that is my reward.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Condron Archer&rdquo;</em>
</p>

<p>I finished reading, and there was a death-like silence. I think
not one in the room wished to prosecute Archer; I think each heart
was praying that Markham might not find him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Mr. Markham to detain Mr. Archer if he found
him,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone slowly. &ldquo;I fear that I regret
doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t find him,&rdquo; said Anne, and as if in
proof of her words, Mr. Markham came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Archer has disappeared,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
thought he might go by train, and I waited at the station, but he
didn&rsquo;t. Do you want him very much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want him at
all. Don&rsquo;t look for him any more, Mr. Markham.&rdquo; And
then, as the tears flooded her eyes, she turned to me, and, putting
her trembling hand through my arm, she let me lead her out into the
sunlight.</p>

<p>There was no more mystery. The secret of the cartouche explained
all.</p>

<p>The two Carstairs were dismissed from the Van Wyck service
without punishment. For Anne never knew of the villainous note that
had been written to bring trouble to her.</p>

<p>We never saw Archer again; and between Anne and myself his name
has never been spoken.</p>

<p>Buttonwood Terrace was sold, and the family separated. Morland
went to the city to live, and Barbara went for a trip abroad, with
Mrs. Stelton. But they may wander where they will,&mdash;it matters
not to me; for after a time, Anne is going to crown my life with
happiness, and I well know I shall never want anybody but Anne.</p>
