  <br>

  <p class="first">AS soon as the news was bruited up and down Roland Avenue,
  that typically Western thoroughfare, trade at the mayor&rsquo;s shop showed a
  perceptible increase. Mayor Pink was a nice little man and a born grocer. He
  was conspicuous for the domestic virtues, and his speech was innocent alike
  of initial h&rsquo;s and terminating g&rsquo;s. He went direct from the
  counter to the council-chamber, and exchanged his grocer&rsquo;s apron for
  the gold chain of office, so to speak; because there was no gold chain in
  Blackfoot as yet.</p>

  <p>Conversations of this trend might have been heard over the counter almost
  any time during those few days:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those prunes you sent me last week were all dried up, Your
  Worship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very sorry, Mrs. &rsquo;All. I&rsquo;ll see that it don&rsquo;t
  occur again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send me a pot of marmalade and a tin of wafers. I hear that a
  member of the royal family is coming to town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. &rsquo;All; &rsquo;Is Royal &rsquo;Ighness Prince
  &rsquo;Arold is passin&rsquo; through Blackfoot next week. What else, Mrs.
  &rsquo;All?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;two pounds of butter; and see that it is perfectly
  fresh, Your Worship&mdash;and&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to entertain him,
  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to give &rsquo;im a reception.
  We&rsquo;re &rsquo;avin&rsquo; a little meetin&rsquo; on Thursday night to
  discuss the arrangements. Can I send you a package of that Golden Sky coffee,
  Mrs. &rsquo;All?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed! It&rsquo;s more than half chickory, Your Worship. I
  suppose you&rsquo;ll shake hands with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;re mistaken, Mrs. &rsquo;All. Senator Cochrane
  won&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no other brand in &rsquo;is &rsquo;ouse. Yes; as the
  representative of the citizens of Blackfoot, I shall &rsquo;ave to receive
  &rsquo;Is &rsquo;Ighness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only fancy! Well, send me two pounds, Your Worship; but if
  it&rsquo;s no better than the last&mdash;be sure to get a place where I can
  get a good look at him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I will, Mrs. &rsquo;All.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><br>
  THE meeting of the reception committee was held up-stairs in the fire hall on
  Thursday night, as the citizens&rsquo; band happened to be using the council
  chamber for their weekly practice. In addition to the mayor and the city
  clerk, there were present Aldermen Sam Puffer, Hank Wills, and Telfair; also
  Major Coombs of the militia; and last, but not least, the redoubtable Cappy
  Gunn of the fire department, the time-honored master of ceremonies on such
  occasions. It was Cappy Gunn who, when the Prince of Wales passed through
  Blackfoot two years ago, got up that highly successful luncheon at
  Corey&rsquo;s short-order restaurant, opposite the station. Corey put out an
  extra supply of fly-paper in honor of the royal guest; and the
  &ldquo;Eye-Opener&rdquo; printed a story to the effect that H. R. H. thought
  it was a kind of currant cake. But no one takes the &ldquo;Eye-Opener&rdquo;
  seriously.</p>

  <p>Besides, Blackfoot had outgrown all that sort of thing. We have now
  Alderman Telfair, who was a great society man in the East, a leading citizen
  of Tuscarora, Michigan, to show us what to do. The alderman was not slow in
  perceiving the need of just such a man as himself on this occasion; and he
  rose to it manfully, taking the program into his own hands, and so impressing
  the other members of the committee with the propriety of his suggestions that
  not a voice was raised in protest, not even the voice of Sam Puffer, who
  represented the unregenerate old-timer&rsquo;s element. Cappy Gunn was
  conciliated by being given <i>carte blanche</i> in the matter of
  decorations&mdash;up to two hundred dollars.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a proper program that they drew up. As Blackfoot&rsquo;s
  only city hall is also the police court, it was quickly decided that holding
  the exercises there would be to call up unpleasant associations for some of
  the invited guests, and the band-stand in the railway gardens was chosen for
  the scene of the fete. It was decided to have all the little girls in white
  pinafores and red sashes, and as many of the little boys as could be made
  presentable, massed below the stand to sing patriotic airs accompanied by the
  Salvation Army band, which was more reliable than the citizens&rsquo;. Then,
  after the addresses had been read, it was arranged to take the Prince for a
  little drive about town, visiting the abattoir and the new brewery by the
  way, and ending with a review of the Blackfoot fire department, out of
  consideration for Cappy Gunn.</p>

  <p>Oh, the knotty questions that were discussed at that meeting! For
  instance, the red carpet: the longest strip in town would not nearly reach
  from the station platform to the band-stand; and the committee was in grave
  doubt as to the propriety of allowing His Royal Highness to risk wetting his
  feet in the grass. Then there was the warmest kind of a discussion over what
  the children should sing; it was a tie between &ldquo;Canada, My
  Canada,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rule, Britannia!&rdquo; It was not known for sure
  that the Salvation Army could play these secular tunes. First one member of
  the committee then another lifted up his voice in a more or less wabbly
  rendition of his favorite song, to show the others how it would go. The
  firemen down-stairs, thinking that some one must be &ldquo;setting &rsquo;em
  up&rdquo; to the committee, poked their heads through the hole in the floor
  to make sure they were not missing any refreshment. Finally, there was that
  most delicate question&mdash;What should the members of the reception
  committee wear? When this was brought up, Alderman Telfair glanced anxiously
  at Sam Puffer: the old cow-puncher&rsquo;s expression was both eloquent and
  ominous. The mayor averted an immediate explosion by hastily saying that of
  course &rsquo;igh &rsquo;ats were the thing, and he was going to wear one;
  but he would leave it to each member to suit himself in the matter.</p>

  <p>Alderman Sam Puffer had taken no part in the discussion hitherto except to
  register his disapproval of the entire proceedings by spitting disgustedly to
  the right and left. His silence was the more remarkable in that there was a
  standing feud between him and Alderman Telfair, who was running this affair.
  Telfair represented the new order of things that was making Blackfoot a
  commercial center of the West; Sam Puffer was a relic of the roaring past
  when Blackfoot had been the wildest town in the lee of the Rockies. Telfair
  was all that was respectable and pious, Sam Puffer all that was disreputable
  and profane. It is true that Cappy Gunn and Hank Wills were old-timers, too;
  but they found it profitable to accept the material benefits of the new
  regime. Old Sam stood alone for the old hard-swearing, hard-riding,
  hard-drinking days of the past, when everything was owned in common; he hated
  the stout, &ldquo;baby-faced tenderfoot,&rdquo; as he called him, who was
  always for doing the respectable, and yet could skin you out of the gold in
  your teeth. Yet he was a good deal in awe of him, too.</p>

  <p>The little mayor breathed a sigh of relief when the meeting broke up
  without any unpleasantness. As for Sam Puffer, he made straight for the bar
  of the Royal Hotel, and there, with his elbow on his own particular corner of
  the mahogany, he rapidly engulphed several somethings to take the sickly
  taste out of his mouth, and then proceeded to lay out a program for the
  Prince as he would carry it out. It would surely have proved a liberal
  education to the royal youngster.</p>

  <p>The great day dawned splendidly, and all Blackfoot turned out except the
  bedridden. Evidences of Cappy Gunn&rsquo;s taste and ingenuity were to be
  seen on every hand, particularly in the striking banners stretched across the
  street, with mottoes of his own composition painted in fancy letters on
  cotton: &ldquo;Welcome to Blackfoot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come Again,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo;&mdash;the same kind of banners that are
  tacked on the side of picnic busses. In the railway gardens, which lie
  between Front Street and the C. P. R. tracks, was a complicated scheme of
  flags which had been hastily borrowed from a town His Highness had previously
  visited; and was in turn to be forwarded down the line immediately after the
  ceremonies. Cappy Gunn, who had had long experience in these matters,
  believed in an accidental, &ldquo;bunchy&rdquo; effect; and he had certainly
  obtained it with the flags. The centerpiece of his composition was the
  bandstand, of course: there that somewhat chopfallen mountain lion which
  couches in the Blackfoot bar on ordinary days occupied the place of honor on
  a table, with potted flowers ranged around, and those handsome chairs from
  the hotel office in a circle, presumably so the guests could sit and look at
  the beast.</p>

  <p>In the foreground the gardens were thronged with fluttering white
  &ldquo;pinnies&rdquo;; the select of Blackfoot, including the mayor&rsquo;s
  best customers, took up places on the other side-of the band-stand; and the
  general public was roped off in the rear. The bishop&rsquo;s ample calves,
  distinctly aware of their importance in holding up the representative of the
  national church on this momentous occasion, occupied a position apart on the
  lawn; and Cappy Gunn, wearing a greasy uniform and an air of anxious
  importance, and turning over a quid large enough to last him through the
  ceremonies, was everywhere at once. Over the fence, in the street, waited a
  squad of mounted police, businesslike and soldierly in their red tunics, each
  man sitting stiffly on his splendid horse with his carbine on his knee.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the gardens lay the railway platform, and here, a
  full half-hour before the train was due, gathered the members of the
  reception committee, variously and wonderfully attired. The mayor&rsquo;s
  hint had been sufficient to cause silk hats of rare species to bloom on every
  head except one: Alderman Hank Wills wore a new frock-coat of his own design,
  reaching to his calves and of an extraordinary satiny sheen, and the top of
  his stalk bore a low-crowned bowler. He was delighted with the sensation he
  caused, and blew his nose loudly and frequently into an immense bandana
  handkerchief. Among other little novelties of costume might be mentioned
  Alderman Canning&rsquo;s dress waistcoat, worn over a brilliant, spotted
  shirt bosom, and Alderman Porter&rsquo;s famous lemon-colored shoes. It was a
  handsome aggregation, and the mayor was proud. Sam Puffer was not in
  evidence.</p>

  <p>During the long wait, the committee stood around, perspiring freely and
  very much at a loss whether to take its gloves off or put them on&mdash;or
  take them off again. Alderman Telfair, the oracle of etiquette, constituted
  himself guard of honor to the red carpet, the wonderful brilliancy of which
  fascinated all the stray dogs in town. But at last the whistle of the royal
  train was heard from up the valley, a spasm of expectation shook the crowd,
  and those of the reception committee who had their gloves on nervously began
  to pull them off, while those who had their gloves off attempted frantically
  to get them on. The little mayor felt that his great hour had arrived; a
  bright red spot appeared on each cheek, and his lips moved tremblingly over
  the little phrases of welcome he had committed to memory.</p>

  <p>What was his dismay at this moment to behold old Sam Puffer loaf down the
  platform, an only too familiar figure in his old brown suit, with his
  battered cow-puncher hat on the back of his head, his thumbs stuck in his
  waistband, and the inevitable ragged cigar between his teeth. This was a
  sorry sight for royal eyes. The mayor shuddered. The little man, for all his
  nervous manner, was not lacking in courage; he and the burly Sam Puffer had
  had more than one passage at arms in the council-chamber, in which the mayor
  had not always come off second best; but there was no time to do anything
  then, for at that moment the royal train swept into view.</p>

  <p>It was a gorgeous train of seven, shiny cherry-colored cars, the pride of
  the great railway which built it. It flashed past the waiting
  committee&mdash;sleeping, dining, stateroom cars, wide-windowed, and
  luxurious, culminating in the wonderful royal car &ldquo;Ulster,&rdquo; with
  the King&rsquo;s arms splendidly emblazoned on its sides and two little royal
  standards fluttering over the observation platform.</p>

  <p>The train came to a stop with the rear platform resting mathematically
  opposite the sacred red carpet. The reception committee stood on one foot and
  then the other. Two nice-looking young men jumped off, cast a quick glance
  around, then pulled themselves aboard. There was a wait of half a minute
  while the reception committee coughed nervously. Alderman Hank Wills relieved
  his pent-up feelings by a sonorous blast into the red handkerchief. Then a
  third lad, younger and less sure of himself than the first two, descended
  from the car somewhat awkwardly and stood by the steps, blushing furiously.
  He was of less than medium height and boyishly slim; he wore a plain dark
  suit and a little derby, which may have been the latest thing in London, but
  was considered very much out of date in Blackfoot.</p>

  <p>There was a disconcerting pause. No one knew exactly what to do next. The
  young man seemed to be of two minds, whether to advance or retreat, like a
  child on the threshold of a roomful of strangers. Finally the mayor, feeling
  that the situation hung on him, stepped forward and politely asked:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Is &rsquo;Iglmess comin&rsquo; off?"</p>

  <p>The young man turned pinker still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I &mdash; I,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

  <p>The little mayor, realizing his mistake, turned very pale. But how was he
  to have known better? The photographs of the young man in the newspapers had
  pictured him both broad and tall in his resplendent uniform. Every word of
  the mayor&rsquo;s little speech forsook him, of course: only the
  tradesman&rsquo;s instinct remained. He whipped off his hat and, moving
  toward the gate to the gardens, murmured:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step this way, please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The procession moved down through the lane of townspeople, the members of
  the Prince&rsquo;s suite, who seemed to have difficulty in concealing their
  amusement at something (could it have been the costumes of the committee?)
  falling in behind with the aldermen. Alderman Telfair, the well-fed apostle
  of progress in Blackfoot, took care to secure a place close to the royal
  back, on which he fixed his eyes with an expression of wistful awe, which, in
  one so stout, was almost pathetic. Last of all, in his old, brown suit,
  chewing his cigar with a derisive leer, came old Sam Puffer.</p>

  <p>When the people began to cheer, the young Prince took heart of grace
  again. This was something he knew. The fixed smile and the gracious, unseeing
  little bows to the right and left were part of his education. The people,
  delighted with these evidences of affability, redoubled their huzzas; and the
  Prince, encouraged in turn, patted everything on the head, so to speak, from
  the littlest girl in a white pinny, who shrank awestruck from the royal hand,
  to the chop-fallen mountain lion in the band-stand. He walked very slowly, as
  he had been taught; and chatted animatedly with the little mayor, whose cup
  of happiness was running over. The occasion was now an assured success; he
  forgot Sam Puffer lurking in the rear.</p>

  <p>When the procession reached the bandstand, the Salvation Army struck up
  &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; and all the white pinnies lustily lifted up
  their voices. The east half was a full bar ahead of the west half, while the
  band was somewhere in between; but their loyalty was indubitable. The young
  Prince stood at the edge of the stand and beamed down on them, turning to the
  mayor continually to express his gratification. He knew his part. When the
  children finished their song, the mayor read his famous address, which had
  been shown around town during several previous days. It was a wonderfully
  engrossed affair, with mysterious little water colors down one side, and
  topping the whole, an emaciated Britannia in a sort of red wrapper sitting on
  sheaves of grain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To &rsquo;Is Royal &rsquo;Ighness Prince &rsquo;Arold. On
  be&rsquo;alf of the citizens of Blackfoot, I desire to express to Your Royal
  &rsquo;Ighness,&rdquo; etc. The h&rsquo;s clattered on the bandstand floor
  like peas. But the address was exactly right; it breathed stertorous,
  beef-and-beer, prayer-book loyalty in every line. There was neither a word
  more nor less than was expected.</p>

  <p>When the mayor concluded, the Prince&rsquo;s equerry handed the young
  gentleman his answer; and he read the set phrases in a charming, boyish
  voice, that drew the hearts of all who could hear, and somehow made them
  sorry for the lad who was obliged to endure such silly ceremonies day after
  day. His reply answered the address so squarely, paragraph by paragraph, that
  it seemed quite magical to his hearers, unless it happened to occur to them
  that a copy of the mayor&rsquo;s address might have been sent up the
  line.</p>

  <p>There was a rousing cheer when the Prince finished reading and the
  Salvation Army enthusiastically struck up something: it was hard to say just
  what, but they were not accustomed to secular airs. The mayor introduced
  Prince Harold to the various local celebrities in the bandstand. He, the
  mayor, was now miserably aware of the bulk of Sam Puffer, half-hidden by a
  flag, and effectually blocking egress from the band-stand. A dozen futile
  plans to steer the royal guest safely past the profane old cattle-puncher who
  feared neither God nor prince suggested themselves; but in vain: the mayor
  felt in his bones that something would happen and something did.</p>

  <p>He delayed the evil moment as long as possible. He showed the Prince the
  glorious peaks off to the west, he pointed out this object and that in the
  street below. He steered the Prince all round the stand, hoping to draw Sam
  Puffer out of his corner and then slip past. But old Sam bided his time.
  Finally the Prince&rsquo;s gentlemen began to grow uneasy, thinking the mayor
  had lost his head through stage fright; the equerry softly inquired if they
  should not proceed. Then there was no help for it; and the mayor moved
  perforce to the head of the steps, taking care to keep between old Sam and
  the sacred person of royalty. He was silently praying to his respectable gods
  to come to his aid; but this time they heard him not.</p>

  <p>Old Sam stepped out and bared his great head respectfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>The boyish Prince smiled his fixed smile and took a polite listening
  attitude. The little mayor was in an agony. The mild introduction disarmed
  him and confirmed his worst fears. The next words were enough&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rounded up your steers and corralled &rsquo;em in good
  shape,&rdquo; continued Sam; &ldquo;now come and have a bit of a blow. A
  young feller like you ought to be havin&rsquo; a whale of a time seein&rsquo;
  God&rsquo;s own country. I don&rsquo;t believe yeh are, and I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to give it to yeh, if yeh&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sam paused to spit over the rail, and a horrible silence fell on the group
  in the band-stand. The Prince looked extremely red and flustered: his
  education evidently had not provided for this combination of circumstances,
  The little mayor made as if to brush past with his charge; but old Sam put
  forth a great ham of a hand and held him where he was. Sam had been holding
  himself on the snaffle up to this, as his purple face clearly showed. When he
  broke out again it was as if the reins were loosed a trifle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kep&rsquo; my mouth shet all this time because I&rsquo;m
  in a minority, and I didn&rsquo;t want to do nothin&rsquo; to queer the show.
  But I don&rsquo;t want yeh to think we&rsquo;re <i>all</i> a crowd of
  blank-blank old women what don&rsquo;t know no better than to trot out a
  bunch of squawkin&rsquo; little dish-washers to amuse a young feller like
  you.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come with me, Prince, and I&rsquo;ll show yeh a man&rsquo;s fun. I
  got a little mare down the street with a disposition like Mary Magdalen after
  she got religion. She kin take us out to my ranch in twenty minutes. Out
  there I got a bunch of blank-blank cow-punchers as &rsquo;ll throw a crazy
  steer in more ways than you have names, and in less time than Your Royal
  Highness takes to spit. And I brought a lot of Sarcees over from the
  reservation to ride races fer yeh. The blank-blank redskins will break their
  blank necks for half a dollar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Sam concluded his invitation, the silence on the band-stand was as
  thick as cheese. The young Prince was in an agony of embarrassment. One could
  see by his eyes that he longed to accept, and was restrained only by the fear
  of political complications, that bugbear of young princes. He did not know
  whether Sam Puffer was a supporter of the present government; and of course
  Sam was not. An old campaigner in the Prince&rsquo;s suite, a famous general,
  who, in his mufti, looked like a farmer, attempted to relieve this
  intolerable situation. He threw back his head with a shout of derisive
  laughter, exclaiming, &ldquo;Capital! Capital!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other members of the Prince&rsquo;s suite took their cue from the old
  soldier, and promptly joined in the burst of ridicule at old Sam&rsquo;s
  expense. The ridicule of this high-toned crowd was the one thing that could
  daunt the old cow-puncher. He fell back a step discomfited. But in so
  cleverly choosing the means to squelch Sam, the wily general neglected to
  calculate the effect on his young charge. The Prince was a kind-hearted lad,
  and the distress occasioned by the sight of Sam&rsquo;s discomfiture supplied
  just the needed fillip to his initiative. The unnecessarily loud laughter
  nettled him. He turned to his party and said spiritedly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This gentleman has been good enough to extend an invitation. I
  should like to accept it."</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Your Highness,&rdquo; expostulated the equerry, &ldquo;we have
  only two hours longer here. A drive through the streets, with a visit to the
  brewery and the abattoir, has been arranged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very much obliged, I am sure,&rdquo; returned the Prince, calmly:
  &ldquo;but I should prefer to omit the abattoir and the brewery.&rdquo; He
  turned to Sam. &ldquo;Will you lead the way, Alderman? I should like to see
  your mare.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Prince Harold was speeding Sam&rsquo;s mare over the
  Weasel Head Trail en route to the Puffer ranch, while his host leaned back
  with an arm extended on the back of the seat, luxuriously puffing a royal
  cigar. Away behind on the prairie trailed a miscellaneous lot of lords, a
  mayor, aldermen, newspaper reporters, and officers of His Majesty&rsquo;s
  army in hired rigs.</p>
