  The Hair-Cut</b></h3>
<p>The surface of the wide, empty  river rang with it like a sounding-board, and the undisturbed hills gave it  back, the gay song of a deep-chested man. The musical execution was not  remarkable, but the sound was as well suited to the big spaces of the sunny  river as the call of a moose to the October woods, or the ululation of a wolf  to a breathless winter&rsquo;s night. The zest of youth and of singing was in it; to  that the breasts of any singer&rsquo;s hearers cannot help but answer.</p>
<p class="verse">&ldquo;Oh! pretty Polly Oliver, the  pri-ide of her sex;<br>
  The love of a grenadier he-er poor heart did vex.<br>
  He courted her so faithfu-ul in the good town of Bow,<br>
But marched off to foreign lands a-fi-ighting the foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The singer was luxuriously  reclining on a tiny raft made of a single dry trunk cut into four lengths laced  together with rope. His back was supported by two canvas bags containing his  grub and all his worldly goods, and a banjo lay against his raised thighs. From  afar on the bosom of the great stream he looked like a doll afloat on a  shingle. The current carried him down, and the eddies waltzed him slowly around  and back, providing him agreeable views up and down river and athwart the noble  hills that hemmed it in.</p>
<p class="verse">&ldquo;I cannot live si-ingle, and  fa-alse I&rsquo;ll not prove,<br>
  So I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;list for a drummer-boy and follow my love.<br>
  Peaked ca-ap, looped jacke-et, whi-ite gaiters and drum,<br>
And marching so manfully to my tru-ue love I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between each verse the banjo  supplied a rollicking obbligato.</p>
<p>His head was bare, and the waves  of his thick, sunburnt hair showed half a dozen shades ranging between sienna  and ochre. As to his face, it was proper enough to twenty-five years old; an  abounding vitality was its distinguishing character. He was not too  good-looking; he had something rarer than mere good looks, an individuality of  line and colouring. It was his own face, suggesting none of the recognized  types of faces. He had bright blue eyes under beautifully modelled brows,  darker than his hair. One eyebrow was cocked a little higher than the other,  giving him a mocking air. In repose his lips came together in a thin, resolute  line that suggested a hard streak under his gay youthfulness.</p>
<p>He was wearing a blue flannel  shirt open at the throat, with a blue and white handkerchief knotted loosely  away from it, and he had on faded blue overalls tucked into the tops of his mocassins.  These mocassins provided the only touch of coxcombry to his costume; they were  of the finest white doeskin elaborately worked with silk flowers. Such footwear  is not for sale in the North, but may be surely construed as a badge of the  worker&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p>Such was Jack Chanty, sprawling on  his little raft, and abandoning himself to the delicious sunshine and the  delights of song. It was July on the Spirit River; he was twenty-five years  old, and the blood was coursing through his veins; inside his shirt he felt the  weight of a little canvas bag of yellow gold, and he knew where there was  plenty more to be had. Is it any wonder he was filled with a sense of wellbeing  so keen it was almost a pain? Expanding his chest, he threw back his head and  relieved himself of a roaring fortissimo that made the hills ring again:</p>
<p class="verse">&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the battle of Ble-enheim,  in a ho-ot fusillade,<br>
  A poor little drummer-boy was a prisoner made.<br>
  But a bra-ave grenadier fou-ought hi-is way through the foe<br>
  And fifteen fierce Frenchmen toge-ether laid low.</p>
<p class="verse">&ldquo;He took the boy tenderly in his  a-arms as he swooned,<br>
  He opened his ja-acket for to search for a wound.<br>
  Oh! pretty Polly Olive-er, my-y bravest, my bride!<br>
  Your true love shall nevermore be to-orn from your side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by the raft was carried  around a wide bend, and the whitewashed buildings of Fort Cheever stole into  view down the river. Jack&rsquo;s eyes gleamed, and he put away the banjo. It was  many a day since he had hobnobbed with his own kind, and what is the use of  gold if there is no chance to squander it?</p>
<p>Sitting up, he applied himself to  his paddle. Edging the raft toward the left-hand bank, he left the main current  at the head of an island, and, shooting over a bar, paddled through the  sluggish backwater on the shore of which the little settlement lay. As he came  close the buildings were hidden from him by the high bank; only the top of the  &ldquo;company&rsquo;s&rdquo; flagpole showed. The first human sound that struck on his ears was  the vociferous, angry crying of a boy-child.</p>
<p>Rounding a little point of the  bank, the cause of the commotion was revealed. Jack grinned, and held his  paddle. The sluggish current carried him toward the actors in the scene, and  they were too intent to observe him. A half-submerged, flat-bottomed barge was  moored to the shore. On the decked end of it a young girl in a blue print dress  was seated on a box, vigorously soaping an infant of four. Two other  ivory-skinned cupids, one older, one younger, were playing in the warm water  that partly filled the barge. Their clothes lay in a heap behind the girl.</p>
<p>She was a very pretty girl; the  mere sight of her caused Jack&rsquo;s breast to lift and his heart to set up a  slightly increased beating. It was so long since he had seen one! Her soft lips  were determinedly pressed together; in one hand she gripped the thin arm of her  captive, while with the other she applied the soap until his writhing little  body flashed in the sun as if burnished. Struggles and yells were in vain. The  other two children played in the water, callously indifferent to the sufferings  of their brother. It was clear they had been through their ordeal.</p>
<p>The girl, warned of an approaching  presence, raised a pair of startled eyes. Her captive, feeling the vise relax,  plunged into the water of the barge with incredible swiftness, and, rapturously  splashing off the hated soap, joined his brothers at the other end, safely out  of her reach. The girl blushed for their nakedness. They themselves stared  open-mouthed at the stranger without any embarrassment at all. The fat baby was  sitting in the water, turned into stone with astonishment, like a statue of  Buddha in a flood.</p>
<p>Something in the young man&rsquo;s frank  laugh reassured the girl, and she laughed a little too, though blushing still.  She glowed with youth and health, deep-bosomed as Ceres, and all ivory and old  rose. Her delicious, soft, roundness was a tantalizing sight to a hungry youth.  But there was something more than mere provoking loveliness &mdash; her large brown  eyes conveyed it, a disquieting wistfulness even while she laughed.</p>
<p>He brought his raft alongside the  barge, and, rising, extended his hand according to the custom of the country.  Hastily wiping her own soapy hand on her apron, she laid it in his. Both  thrilled to the touch, and their eyes quailed from each other. Jack quickly  recovered himself. Lovely as she might be, she was none the less a &ldquo;native,&rdquo;  and therefore to a white man fair game. Naturally he took the world as he found  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Mary Cranston,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I should have known if there was another like you in the country,&rdquo; his bold  eyes added.</p>
<p>The girl lowered her eyes. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
<p>Her voice astonished him, and  filled him with the desire to make her speak again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know who I am,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>She glanced at the banjo case.  &ldquo;Jack Chanty,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it  is to be famous!&rdquo; Their eyes met, and they laughed as at a rich joke. Her laugh  was as sweet as the sound of falling water in the ears of thirst, and the name  he went by as spoken by her rang in his ears with rare tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; he asked  curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows about everybody  up here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are so few! You came from across the mountains, and  have been prospecting under Mount Tetrahedron since the winter. The Indians who  came in to trade told us about the banjo, and about the many songs you sang,  which were strange to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ardour of his gaze confused  her. She broke off, and, to hide her confusion, turned abruptly to the staring  ivory cupids. &ldquo;Andy, come here!&rdquo; she commanded in the voice of sisterly  authority. &ldquo;Colin! Gibbie! Come and get dressed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy and Colin grinned sheepishly,  and stayed where they were. The smile of Andy, the elder, was toothless and  exasperating. As for the infant Buddha, he continued to sit unmoved, to suck  his thumb, and to stare.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Andy! Come  here this minute! Colin! Gibbie!&rdquo; she repeated in a voice of helpless vexation.</p>
<p>They did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look sharp, young &rsquo;uns!&rdquo; Jack  suddenly roared.</p>
<p>Of one accord, as if galvanized  into life, they scrambled toward their sister, making a detour around the far  side of the barge to avoid Jack.</p>
<p>Mary rewarded him with a smile,  and dealt out the clothes with a practised hand. Andy, clasping his garments to  his breast, set off over the plank to the shore, and was hauled back just in  time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has to have his hair cut,  because the steamboat is coming,&rdquo; his sister explained; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see how I  can hold on to him while I am dressing the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass him over here,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Andy, struck with terror, was  deposited on the raft, whence escape was impossible without passing the big  man, and commanded to dress himself without more ado.</p>
<p>Mary regarded the other two  anxiously. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beginning to shiver,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t dress both at  once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack sat on the edge of the barge  with his feet on the raft. &ldquo;Give me the baby,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t dress a baby,&rdquo; she  said, with a provoking dimple in either cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can, if he wears pants,&rdquo;  said Jack serenely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mystery about pants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, he&rsquo;d yell,&rdquo; she  objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Try  him and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in sooth he did not yell, but  sat on Jack&rsquo;s knee while his little shirt was pulled over his head and  buttoned, sucking his thumb, and staring at Jack with a piercing, unflinching  stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a way with babies,&rdquo; the  girl said in the sweet, hushed voice that continually astonished him.</p>
<p>He looked at her with his mocking  smile. &ldquo;And with girls?&rdquo; his eyes asked boldly.</p>
<p>She blushed, and attended strictly  to Colin&rsquo;s buttons.</p>
<p>Colin, fully attired in shirt,  troussers, and moccasins, was presently dismissed over the plank. He lingered  on the shore, shouting opprobrious epithets to his elder, still in captivity.  At the same time the baby was dressed in the smallest pair of long pants ever  made. He was as bow-legged as a bulldog. Jack leaned back, roaring with  laughter at the figure of gravity he made. Gibbie didn&rsquo;t mind. He could walk,  but he preferred to sit. He continued to sit cross-legged on the end of the  barge, and to stare.</p>
<p>Next, Andy was seated on the box,  while Mary, kneeling behind him, produced her scissors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t sit still you&rsquo;ll get  the top of your ears cut off!&rdquo; she said severely.</p>
<p>But sitting still was difficult  under the taunts from ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jutht you wait till I git aholt  of you,&rdquo; lisped the toothless one, proving that the language of unregenerate  youth is much the same on the far-off Spirit River as it is on the Bowery.</p>
<p>Jack returned to the raft and  unstrapped the banjo case. &ldquo;Be a good boy and I&rsquo;ll sing you a song,&rdquo; he said,  presumably to Andy, but looking at Mary meanwhile.</p>
<p>At the sound of the tuning-up the  infant Buddha in long pants gravely arose stern foremost, and reseated himself  at the edge of the barge, where he could get a better view of the player.</p>
<p>Jack chose another rollicking air,  but a new tone had crept into his deep voice. He sang softly, for he had no  desire to bring others down the bank to interrupt his further talk with Mary.</p>
<p class="verse">&ldquo;Oh, the pretty, pretty creature!<br>
  When I next do meet her<br>
  No more like a clown will I face her frown,<br>
  But gallantly will I treat her,<br>
  But gallantly will I treat her,<br>
  Oh, the pretty, pretty creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The infant Buddha condescended to  smile, and to bounce once or twice on his fundament by way of applause. Andy  sat as still as a surprised chipmunk.</p>
<p>Colin was sorry now that he had  cut himself off from the barge. As for the boy&rsquo;s big sister, she kept her eyes  veiled, and plied the scissors with slightly languorous motions of the hands.  Even a merry song may work a deal of sentimental damage under certain  conditions. And the sun shone, and the bright river moved down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, when he had  come to the end. &ldquo;We never have music here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack wondered where she had  learned her pretty manners.</p>
<p>The hair-cutting was concluded. Andy  sprang up looking like a little zebra with alternate dark and light stripes  running around his head, and a narrow bang like a forelock in the middle of his  forehead. Jack put away the banjo, and Andy, seeing that there was to be no  more music, set off in chase of Colin. The two of them disappeared over the  bank. Mary gathered up towels, soap, comb, and scissors preparatory to  following them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; said Jack eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she said, but lingering.  &ldquo;There is much to be done before the steamboat comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only expected,&rdquo; said Jack  of the knowledge born of experience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a week before she comes.&rdquo; Mary  displayed no great eagerness to be gone.</p>
<p>A bold idea had been making a  covert shine in Jack&rsquo;s eyes during the last minute or two. It suddenly found  expression. &ldquo;Cut my hair,&rdquo; he blurted out.</p>
<p>She started and blushed. &ldquo;Oh, I &mdash;  I couldn&rsquo;t cut a man&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; demanded  Jack with a great parade of innocence. &ldquo;Hair is just hair, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she repeated  naively. &ldquo;It would confuse me so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of her confusion was  delicious to him. He was standing below her on the raft. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said,  lowering his head. &ldquo;It needs it. I&rsquo;m a sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since in this position he could  not see her face, she allowed her eyes to dwell for a moment on the tawny  silken sheaves that he exhibited. Such bright hair was wonderful to her. It  seemed to her as if the sun itself was netted in its folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she repeated,  but weakly.</p>
<p>He swung about and sat on the edge  of the barge. &ldquo;Make out I am your other little brother,&rdquo; he said insinuatingly.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you, so it&rsquo;s all right. Ju&rsquo;st one little snip to see how it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temptation was too great to be  resisted. She bent over, and the blades of the scissors met. In her agitation  she cut a wider swath than she intended and a whole handful of hair fell to the  deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried remorsefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll have to do the whole  thing,&rdquo; said Jack quickly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave me looking like a half-clipped  poodle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a guilty look over her  shoulder she drew up the box and sat down behind him. Gibbie, the youngest of  the Cranstons, was a solemn and interested spectator. Jack thrilled a little  and smiled at the touch of her trembling fingers in his hair. At the same time  he was not unaware of the decorative value of his luxuriant thatch, and it  occurred to him he was running a considerable risk of disfigurement at her  hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so short as Andy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he  suggested anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be careful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The scissors snipped busily, and  the rich yellow-brown hair fell all around the deck. Mary eyed it covetously.  One shining twist of it dropped in her lap. He could not see her. In a  twinkling it was stuffed inside her belt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack continued to smile  with softened eyes. &ldquo;Hair-cutting was never like this,&rdquo; he murmured. He was  tantalized by the recollection of her voice, and he cast about in his mind for  something to lead her to talk more freely. &ldquo;You were not here when I came  through two years ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was away at school,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mission at Caribou Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you like it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the shrug in her  finger-tips. &ldquo;It is the best there is,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; said Jack. There  was a good deal unspoken here. &ldquo;A shame you should be obliged to associate with  those savages,&rdquo; he implied, and she understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been outside?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with somebody I liked,&rdquo; she  said in her simple way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me?&rdquo; he asked in the off-hand  tone that may be taken any way the hearer pleases.</p>
<p>Her simplicity was not dullness.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You would tell me funny lies about everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would laugh, and you  would like it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She had nothing to say to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside they have regular shops  for shaving and cutting hair,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Barber-shops they are called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said offended. &ldquo;I  read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you didn&rsquo;t know there  was a lady barber in Prince George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice kind of lady!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The obvious retort slipped  thoughtlessly off his tongue. &ldquo;I like that! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears, and  the scissors faltered. &ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for &mdash; I &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t do it all  the time,&rdquo; she murmured deeply hurt.</p>
<p>He twisted his head at the imminent  risk of impaling an eye on the scissors. The tears astonished him.</p>
<p>Everything about her astonished  him. In no respect did she coincide with his experience of &ldquo;native&rdquo; girls. He  was vain enough for a good-looking young man of twenty-five, but he did not suspect  that to a lonely and imaginative girl his coming down the river might have had  all the effect of the advent of the yellow haired prince in a fairy-tale. Jack  was not imaginative.</p>
<p>He reached for her free hand.  &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said clumsily. &ldquo;It was only a joke! It&rsquo;s mighty decent of  you to do it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snatched her hand away, but  smiled at him briefly and dazzlingly. She was glad to be hurt if he would let  that tone come into his mocking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just silly,&rdquo; she said  shortly.</p>
<p>The hair-cutting went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you read?&rdquo; asked Jack  curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get newspapers and magazines  three times a year by the steamboat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I have a few books. I like  &lsquo;Lalla Rookh&rsquo; and &lsquo;Marmion&rsquo; best.&rdquo; Jack, who was not acquainted with either,  preserved a discreet silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has sent out for a set of  Shakespeare for me,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I am looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better on the stage,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;What fun to take you to the theatre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no comment on this.  Presently the scissors gave a concluding snip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean over and look at yourself in  the water,&rdquo; she commanded. </p>
<p>Obeying, he found to his secret  relief that his looks had not suffered appreciably. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of sight!&rdquo; he  said heartily, turning to her. &ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An awkward silence fell between  them. Jack&rsquo;s growing intention was clearly evident in his eye, but she did not  look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I must pay you,&rdquo; he said at  last, a little breathlessly.</p>
<p>She understood that very well, and  sprang up, the scissors ringing on the hollow deck. They were both pale. She  turned to run, but the box was in her way. Leaping from the raft to the barge,  he caught her in his arms, and as she strained away he kissed her round firm  cheek and her fragrant neck beneath the ear. He roughly pressed her averted  head around, and crushed her soft lips under his own.</p>
<p>Then she got an arm free, and he  received a short-arm box on the ear that made his head ring. She tore herself  out of his arms, and faced him from the other side of the barge, panting and  livid with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you! How dare you!&rdquo; she  cried.</p>
<p>Jack leaned toward her, breathing  no less quickly than she. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lovely! You&rsquo;re lovely,&rdquo; he murmured swiftly.  &ldquo;I never saw anybody like you before. I&rsquo;ll camp quarter of a mile down river,  out of the way. Come down to-night, and I&rsquo;ll sing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never  speak to you again! I hate you!&rdquo; She indicated the unmoved infant Buddha with a  tragic gesture. &ldquo;And before the baby, too!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed a little sheepishly.  &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s too young to tell,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will he think of me?&rdquo;  she cried despairingly. Stooping, she swept the little god into her arms, and,  running over the plank, disappeared up the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you,&rdquo; Jack  softly called after her. She gave no sign of hearing.</p>
<p>Jack sat down on the edge of the  barge again. He brushed the cut hair into the water, and watched it float away  with an abstracted air. As he stared ahead of him a slight line appeared  between his eyebrows which may have been due to compunction. Whatever the  uncomfortable thought was, he presently whistled it away after the manner of  youth, and, drawing his raft up on the stones, set to work to take stock of his  grub. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>II<br>
  The Company From &ldquo;Outside.&rdquo;</b></h3>
<p>The Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s buildings  at Fort Cheever were built, as is customary, in the form of a hollow square,  with one side open to the river. The store occupied one side of the square, the  warehouse was opposite, and at the top stood the trader&rsquo;s house in the midst of  its vegetable garden fenced with palings. The old palisade about the place had  long ago disappeared, and nothing military remained except the flagpole and an  ancient little brass cannon at its foot, blackened with years of verdigris and  dirt. The humbler store of the &ldquo;French outfit&rdquo; and the two or three native  shacks that completed the settlement lay at a little distance behind the  company buildings, and the whole was dropped down on a wide, flat esplanade of  grass between the steep bare hills and the river.</p>
<p>To-day at the fort every one was  going about his business with an eye cocked downstream. Every five minutes  David Cranston came to the door of the store for a look, and old Michel  Whitebear, hoeing the trader&rsquo;s garden, rested between every hill of potatoes,  to squint his aged eyes in the same direction. Usually this state of suspense  endured for days, sometimes weeks, but upon this trip the river-gods were  propitious, and at five o&rsquo;clock the eagerly listened for whistle was actually  heard.</p>
<p>Every soul in the place gathered  at the edge of the bank to witness the arrival. At one side, slightly apart,  stood the trader and his family. David Cranston was a lean, up-standing  Scotchman, an imposing physical specimen with hair and beard beginning to  grizzle, and a level, grim, sad gaze. His wife was a handsome, sullen,  dark-browed, half-breed woman, who, unlike the majority of her sisters, carried  her age well. In his grim sadness and her sullenness was written a domestic  tragedy of long-standing. After all these years she was still a stranger in her  own house, and an alien to her husband and children. Their children were with  them, Mary and six boys ranging from Davy, who was sixteen, down to the infant  Buddha.</p>
<p>A small crowd of natives in ragged  store clothes, standing and squatting on the bank, and spilling over on the  beach below, filled the centre of the picture, and beyond them sat Jack Chanty  by himself, on a box that he had carried to the edge of the bank. Between him  and Mary the bank made in, so that they were fully visible to each other, and  both tinglingly self-conscious. In Jack this took the form of an elaborately  negligent air. He whittled a paddle with nice care, glancing at Mary from under  his lashes. She could not bring herself to look at him.</p>
<p>While the steamboat was still  quarter of a mile downstream, the people began to sense that there was  something more than usual in the wind, and a great excitement mounted. We of  the outside world, with our telegrams and newspapers and hourly posts, have  forgotten what it is to be dramatically surprised. Where can we get a thrill  like to that which animated these people as the magic word was passed around:  &ldquo;Passengers!&rdquo; Presently it could be made out that these were no ordinary passengers,  but a group of well-dressed gentlemen, and finally, wonder of wonders! what had  never been seen at Fort Cheever before, a white lady &mdash; no, two of them!</p>
<p>Mary saw them first, two ladies,  corseted, tailored, and marvellously hatted like the very pictures in the  magazines that she had secretly disbelieved in. In another minute she made out  that one of them, leaning on the upper rail, smiling and chatting vivaciously  with her companions, was as young as Mary herself, and as slender and pretty as  a mundane fairy.</p>
<p>Mary glanced swiftly at Jack. He,  too, was looking at the deck of the steamboat and he had stopped whittling his  paddle. A dreadful pang transfixed Mary&rsquo;s breast. Her hands and feet suddenly  became enormous to her, and her body seemed like a coarse and shapeless lump.  She looked down at her clean, faded print dress; she could have torn it into  ribbons. She looked at her dark-browed mother with eyes full of a strange,  angry despair. The elder woman had by this time seen what was coming, and her lip  curled scornfully. Mary&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. She slipped out of the group  unseen, and, running back to the house, cast herself on her bed and wept as she  had never wept.</p>
<p>The steamboat was moored alongside  the half-submerged barge. She came to a stop with the group on the upper deck  immediately in front of Jack and a little below him. True to the character of  indifference he was fond of assuming, he went on whittling his paddle. At the  same time he was taking it all in. The sight of people such as his own people,  that he thought he had put behind him forever, raised a queer confusion of  feelings in him. As he covertly watched the dashing, expensive, imperious  little beauty and three men hanging obsequiously on her words, a certain hard  brightness showed briefly in his eyes, and his lips thinned.</p>
<p>It was as if he said: &ldquo;Aha! my  young lady, I know your kind! None of you will ever play that game again with  me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consequently when her casual  glance presently fell on the handsome, young, rough character (as she would no  doubt have called him) it was met by a glance even more casual. The young man  was clearly more interested in the paddle he was making than in her. Her colour  heightened a little and she turned with an added vivacity to her companions.  After a long time she looked again. The young man was still intent upon his  paddle. </p>
<p>The first to come off the boat was  the young purser, who hurried with the mail and the manifests to David  Cranston. He was pale under the weight of the announcement he bore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have his honour the  lieutenant-governor and party on board,&rdquo; he said breathlessly.</p>
<p>Cranston, because he saw that he  was expected to be overcome, remained grimly unconcerned. &ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said coolly.</p>
<p>The youngster stared. &ldquo;The  lieutenant-governor,&rdquo; he repeated uncertainly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s landing here to make some  explorations in the mountains. He joined us without warning at the Crossing.  There was no way to let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can for his  lordship,&rdquo; said Cranston with an ironic curl to his grim lips. &ldquo;I will speak to  my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her he said under his breath,  grimly but not unkindly, &ldquo;Get to the house, my girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flared up with true savage  suddenness. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m not good enough to be seen with you,&rdquo; she snarled, taking  no pains to lower her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your lawful wife. These are my children. Are  you ashamed of my colour? You chose me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston drew the long breath that  calls on patience. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not your colour that puts me to shame, but your  manners,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;And if they&rsquo;re bad,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not for the  lack of teaching. Get to the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went.</p>
<p>The captain of the steamboat now  appeared on the gangplank, ushering an immaculate little gentleman whose  sailent features were a Panama hat above price, a pointed white beard, neat,  agile limbs, and a trim little paunch under a miraculously fitting white  waistcoat. Two other men followed, one elderly, one young. Cranston waited for  them at the top of the path.</p>
<p>The captain was a little flustered  too. &ldquo;Mr. Cranston, gentlemen, the company&rsquo;s trader here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His Honour  Sir Bryson Trangmar, the lieutenant-governor of Athabasca,&rdquo; he went on.  &ldquo;Captain Vassall&rdquo; &mdash; the younger man bowed; &ldquo;Mr. Baldwin Ferrie&rdquo; &mdash; the other  nodded.</p>
<p>There was the suspicion of a  twinkle in Cranston&rsquo;s eye. Taking off his hat he extended an enormous hand.  &ldquo;How do you do, sir,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;Welcome to Fort Cheever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charmed! Charmed!&rdquo; bubbled the  neat little gentleman. &ldquo;Charming situation you have here. Charming river!  Charming hills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that I cannot offer you  suitable hospitality,&rdquo; Cranston continued in his great, quiet voice. &ldquo;My house  is small, as you see, and very ill-furnished. There are nine of us. But the  warehouse shall be emptied before dark and made ready for you. It is the best  building here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson with offhand condescension &mdash; perhaps he sensed the twinkle, perhaps it  was the mere size of the trader that annoyed him; &ldquo;but we have brought  everything needful. We will camp here on the grass between the buildings and the  river. Captain Vassall, my aide-de-camp, will see to it. I will talk to you  later Mr. &mdash; er?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cranston,&rdquo; murmured the  aide-de-camp.</p>
<p>Cranston understood by this that  he was dismissed. He sauntered back to the store with a peculiar smile on his  grim lips. In the free North country they have never become habituated to the  insolence of office, and the display of it strikes them as a very humorous  thing, particularly in a little man.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson and the others  reconnoitred the grassy esplanade, and chose a spot for the camp. It was  decided that the party should remain on the steamboat all night, and go into  residence under canvas next day. They then returned on board for supper, and  nothing more was seen of the strangers for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>At the end of that time Miss  Trangmar and her companion, Mrs. Worsley, arm in arm and hatless, came  strolling over the gangplank to enjoy a walk in the lingering evening. At this  season it does not become dark at Fort Cheever until eleven.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s raft was drawn up on the  beach at the steamboat&rsquo;s bow, and as the ladies came ashore he was disposing  his late purchases at the store upon it, preparatory to dropping downstream to  the spot where he meant to camp. In order to climb the bank the two had to pass  close behind him.</p>
<p>At sight of him the girl&rsquo;s eyes  brightened, and, with a mischievous look she said something to her companion.  &ldquo;Linda!&rdquo; the older woman remonstrated. &ldquo;Everybody speaks to everybody up here,&rdquo;  said the girl. &ldquo;It was understood that the conventions were to be left at  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Jack was presently startled  to hear a clear high voice behind him say: &ldquo;Are you going to travel on the  river with that little thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily straightening his back and  turning, he raised his hat. Her look took him unawares. There was nothing of  the insolent queenliness in it now. She was smiling at him like a fearless,  well-bred little girl. Nevertheless, he reflected, the sex is not confined to  the use of a single weapon, and he stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came down the river on it this  morning,&rdquo; he said politely and non-committal. &ldquo;To-night I&rsquo;m going just a little  way to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was very like a little girl,  he thought, being so small and slender, and having such large blue eyes, and  such a charming, childlike smile. Her bright brown hair was rolled back over  her ears. Her lips were very red, and her teeth perfect. She was wearing a silk  waist cunningly contrived with lace, and fitting in severe, straight lines,  ever so faintly suggesting the curves beneath. In spite of himself everything  about her struck subtle chords in Jack&rsquo;s memory. It was years since he had been  so close to a lady.</p>
<p>She was displeased with the manner  of his answer. He had shown no trace either of the self-consciousness or the  eager complaisance she had expected from a local character. Indeed, his gaze  returned to the raft as if he were only restrained by politeness from going on  with his preparations. He reminded her of a popular actor in a Western play  that she had been to see more times than her father knew of. But the rich  colour in Jack&rsquo;s cheek and neck had the advantage of being under the skin  instead of plastered on top. Her own cheeks were a thought pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you go back upstream?&rdquo; she  asked with an absent air that was intended to punish him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You travel as you can,&rdquo; said Jack  calmly. &ldquo;On horseback or afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointedly did not wait for the  answer, but strayed on up the path as if he had already passed from her mind.  Yet as she turned at the top her eyes came back to him as if by accident. She  had a view of a broad back, and a bent head intent upon the lashings of the  raft. She bit her lip. It was a disconcerting young man.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Frank Garrod,  the governor&rsquo;s secretary, who until now had been at work in his cabin upon the  correspondence the steamboat was to take back next day, came over the gangplank  in pursuit of the ladies. He was a slim and well-favoured young man, of about  Jack&rsquo;s age, but with something odd and uncontrolled about him, a young man of  whom it was customary to say he was &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; without any one&rsquo;s knowing exactly  what constituted his queerness. He had black hair and eyes that made a striking  contrast with his extreme pallor. The eyes were very bright and restless; all  his movements were a little jerky and uneven.</p>
<p>Hearing more steps behind him, Jack  looked around abstractedly without really seeing what he looked at. Garrod,  however, obtained a fair look into Jack&rsquo;s face, and the sight of it operated on  him with a terrible, dramatic suddenness. A doctor would have recognized the  symptoms of what he calls shock. Garrod&rsquo;s arms dropped limply, his breath  failed him, his eyes were distended with a wild and inhuman fear. For an  instant he seemed about to collapse on the stones, but he gathered some rags of  self-control about him, and, turning without a sound, went back over the  gangplank, swaying a little, and walking with wide-open, sightless eyes like a  man in his sleep.</p>
<p>Presently Vassall, the amiable  young A. D. C., descending the after stairway, came upon him leaning against  the rail on the river-side of the boat, apparently deathly sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Garrod! What&rsquo;s the  matter?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The other man made a pitiable  attempt to carry it off lightly. &ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;A sudden  turn. I have them sometimes. If you have any whiskey &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall sprang up the stairway,  and presently returned with a flask. Upon gulping down part of the contents, a  little colour returned to Garrod&rsquo;s face, and he was able to stand straighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right now,&rdquo; he said in a  stronger voice. &ldquo;You run along and join the others. Please don&rsquo;t say anything  about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave you like this,&rdquo;  said Vassall. &ldquo;You ought to be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said  Garrod in his jerky, irritable way. &ldquo;Run along. There isn&rsquo;t anything you can  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall went his way with a  wondering air; real tragedy is such a strange thing to be intruding upon our  everyday lives. Garrod, left alone, stared at the sluggishly flowing water  under the ship&rsquo;s counter with the kind of sick, desirous eyes that so often  look over the parapets of bridges in the cities at night. But there were too  many people about on the boat; the splash would instantly have betrayed him.</p>
<p>He gathered himself together as  with an immense effort, and, climbing the stairway, went to his stateroom.  There he unlocked his valise, and drawing out his revolver, a modern hammerless  affair, made sure that it was loaded, and slipped it in his pocket. He caught  sight of his face in the mirror and shuddered. &ldquo;As soon as it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; he  muttered.</p>
<p>He sat down on his bunk to wait.  By and by he became conscious of a torturing thirst, and he went out into the  main cabin for water. Jack, meanwhile, having loaded his craft, had boarded the  steamboat to see if he could beg or steal a newspaper less than two months old,  and the two men came face to face in the saloon.</p>
<p>Garrod made a move to turn back,  but it was too late; Jack had recognized him now. Seeing the look of amazement  in the other&rsquo;s face, Garrod&rsquo;s hand stole to his hip-pocket, but it was arrested  by the sound of Jack&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank!&rdquo; he cried, and there was  nothing but gladness in the sound. &ldquo;Frank Garrod, by all that&rsquo;s holy!&rdquo; He  sprang forward with outstretched hands. &ldquo;Old Frank! To think of finding you  here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod stared in stupid amazement  at the smile and the hearty tone. For a moment he was quite unnerved; his hands  and his lips trembled. &ldquo;Is it &mdash; is it Malcolm Piers?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; cried Jack, wringing  his hand. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? You look completely knocked up at the  sight of me. I&rsquo;m no ghost, man! What are you doing up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sir Bryson&rsquo;s secretary,&rdquo;  murmured Garrod, feeling for his words with difficulty.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s delight was as transparent  as it was unrestrained. The saloon continued to ring with his exclamations. In  the face of it a little steadiness returned to Garrod, but he could not rid his  eyes of their amazement and incredulity at every fresh display of Jack&rsquo;s  gladness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking pretty seedy,&rdquo;  Jack broke off to say. &ldquo;Going the pace, I expect. Now that we&rsquo;ve got you up  here, you&rsquo;ll have to lead a more godly and regular life, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing up here,  Malcolm?&rdquo; asked Garrod dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy with that name around here,  old fel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jack carelessly. &ldquo;I left it off long ago. I&rsquo;m just Jack Chanty  now. It&rsquo;s the name the fellows gave me themselves because I sing by the  campfires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Garrod, with  a jerk of eagerness. &ldquo;Good plan to drop your own name, knocking around up  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no reason to be ashamed of  it,&rdquo; said Jack quickly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too well known a name in the East. I didn&rsquo;t  want to be explaining myself all the time. It was nobody&rsquo;s business, anyway,  why I came out here. So I let them call me what they liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock around,&rdquo; cried Jack.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do! A little river work, a little prospecting, a little  hunting and trapping, and one hell of a good time! It beats me how young  fellows of blood and muscle can stew their lives away in cities when this is  open to them! New country to explore, and game to bring down, and gold to look  for. The fun of it, whether you find any or not! This is freedom, Frank,  working with your own hands for all you get, and beholden to no man! By Gad!  I&rsquo;m glad I found you,&rdquo; he went on enthusiastically. &ldquo;What talks we&rsquo;ll have  about people and the places back home! I never could live there now, but I&rsquo;m  often sick to hear about it all. You shall tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tremor passed over Garrod&rsquo;s  face. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said nervously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop just this minute, because  they&rsquo;re waiting for me up on the bank. But I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; said Jack  easily; but his eyes followed the disappearing Garrod with a surprised and  chilled look. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>Garrod as he hurried ashore, his  hands trembling, and his face working in an ecstasy of relief, murmured over  and over to himself. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know! He doesn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>III<br>
  Talk By The Fire</b></h3>
<p>Jack was sitting by his own fire  idly strumming on the banjo. Behind him was his canvas &ldquo;lean-to,&rdquo; open to the  fire in front, and with a mosquito bar hanging within. All around his little  clearing pressed a thick growth of young poplar, except in front, where the  view was open to the river, moving smoothly down, and presenting a burnished  silver reflection to the evening sky. The choice of a situation, the proper  fire, and the tidy arrangements all bespoke the experienced campaigner. Jack  took this sort of thing for granted, as men outside ride back and forth on  trolley cars, and snatch hasty meals at lunch counters.</p>
<p>The supper dishes being washed, it  was the easeful hour of life in camp, but Jack was not at ease. He played a few  bars, and put the banjo down. He tinkered with the fire, and swore when he only  succeeded in deadening it. He lit his pipe, and immediately allowed it to go  out again. A little demon had his limbs twitching on wires. He continually  looked and listened in the direction of the fort, and whenever he fancied he  heard a sound his heart rose and beat thickly in his throat. At one moment he  thought: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; and confidently smiled; the next, for no reason: &ldquo;She  will not come,&rdquo; and frowned, and bit his lip.</p>
<p>Finally he did hear a rustle among  the trees. He sprang up with surprised and delighted eyes, and immediately sat  down again, picking up the banjo with an off-hand air. Under the circumstances  one&rsquo;s pet affectation of unconcern is difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>It was indeed Mary. She broke into  the clearing, pale and breathless, and looked at Jack as if she was all ready  to turn and fly back again. Jack smiled and nodded as if this were the most  ordinary of visits. The smile stiffened in his face, for another followed her  into the clearing &mdash; Davy, the oldest of her brothers. For an instant Jack was  nonplussed, but he had laid it down as a rule that in his dealings with the sex,  whatever betide, a man must smile and keep his temper. So, swallowing his  disappointment as best he could, he greeted Davy as if he had expected him too.</p>
<p>What Mary had been through during  the last few hours may be imagined: how many times she had sworn she would not  go, only to have her desires open the question all over again. Perhaps she  would not have come if the maddeningly attractive young lady had not appeared  on the scene; perhaps she would have found an excuse to come anyway. Be that as  it may, she had brought Davy. In this she had not Mrs. Grundy&rsquo;s elaborate code  to guide her; it was an idea out of her own head &mdash; or an instinct of her heart,  rather. Watching Jack eagerly and covertly to see how he took it, she decided  that she had done right. &ldquo;He will think more of me,&rdquo; she thought with a breath  of relief.</p>
<p>She had done wisely of course.  Jack, after his first disappointment, was compelled to doff his cap to her. He  had never met a girl of the country like this. He bestirred himself to put his  visitors at their ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make tea,&rdquo; he said,  reaching for the copper pot according to the ritual of politeness in the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just had tea,&rdquo; Mary said.  &ldquo;Davy will smoke with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was now wearing a shawl over  the print dress, but instead of clutching it around her in the clumsy native  way, she had crossed it on her bosom like a fichu, wound it about her waist,  and tucked the ends in. Jack glanced at her approvingly.</p>
<p>Davy was young for his sixteen  years, and as slender as a sapling. He had thin, finely drawn features, and  eyes that expressed something of the same quality of wistfulness as his  sister&rsquo;s. At present he was very ill at ease, but his face showed a certain  resoluteness that engaged Jack&rsquo;s liking. The boy shyly produced a pipe that was  evidently a recent acquisition, and filled it inexpertly.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s instinct led him to ignore  Mary for the present while he made friends with the boy. He knew how. They were  presently engaged in a discussion about prairie chicken, in an off-hand, manly  tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw &rsquo;em so plenty,&rdquo; said  Davy. &ldquo;You only have to climb the hill to bring back as many as you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gun do you use?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. &ldquo;My father  has a Lefever gun,&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;He lets me use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Jack, suitably  impressed. &ldquo;There are not many in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very good gun,&rdquo; said Davy  patronizingly. &ldquo;I like to take her apart and clean her,&rdquo; he added boyishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go up on the prairie  with you while I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But I have no shotgun. I&rsquo;ll have to try  and put their eyes out with my twenty-two.&rdquo; This sort of talk was potent to  draw them together. They puffed away, ringing all the changes on it. Mary  listened apart as became a mere woman, and the hint of a dimple showed in  either cheek. When she raised her eyes they fairly beamed on Jack.</p>
<p>Jack knew that the way to win the  hearts of the children of the North is to tell them tales of the wonderful  world outside that they all dream about. He led the talk in this direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve finished  school,&rdquo; he said to Davy, as man to man. &ldquo;Do you ever think of taking a trip  outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated before replying.  &ldquo;I think of it all the time,&rdquo; he said in a low, moved voice. &ldquo;I feel bad every  time the steamboat goes back without me. There is nothing for me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make it some day soon,&rdquo;  said Jack heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Prince George  well?&rdquo; the boy said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but why stop at  Prince George? That&rsquo;s not much of a town. You should see Montreal. That&rsquo;s where  I was raised. There&rsquo;s a city for you! All built of stone. Magnificent banks and  stores and office buildings ten, twelve, fourteen stories high, and more.  You&rsquo;ve seen a two-story house at the lake; imagine seven of them piled up one  on top of another, with people working on every floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fooling us,&rdquo; said the boy.  His and his sister&rsquo;s eyes were shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have seen pictures of them  in the magazines,&rdquo; put in Mary quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Notre Dame Street,&rdquo; said  Jack dreamily, &ldquo;and Great St. James, and St. Catherine&rsquo;s, and St. Lawrence  Main; I can see them now! Imagine miles of big show-windows lighted at night as  bright as sunshine. Imagine thousands of moons hung right down in the street  for the people to see by, and you have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; murmured Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an electric light at  Fort Ochre,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but I have not seen it working. They say when the  trader claps his hands it shines, and when he claps them again it goes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary blushed for her brother&rsquo;s  ignorance. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only to fool the Indians,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Of course  there&rsquo;s some one behind the counter to turn it off and on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack told them of railway trains  and trolley cars; of mills that wove thousands of yards of cloth in a day, and  machines that spit out pairs of boots all ready to put on. The old-fashioned  fairy-tales are puerile beside such wonders as these &mdash; think of eating your  dinner in a carriage that is being carried over the ground faster than the wild  duck flies! &mdash; moreover, he assured them on his honour that it was all true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about theatres,&rdquo; said  Mary. &ldquo;The magazines have many stories about theatres, but they do not explain  what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a theatre&rsquo;s a son-of-a-gun  of a big house with a high ceiling and the floor all full of chairs,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;Around the back there are galleries with more chairs. In the front there  is a platform called the stage, and in front of the stage hangs a big curtain  that is let down while the people are coming in, so you can&rsquo;t see what is  behind it. It is all brightly lighted, and there&rsquo;s an orchestra, many fiddles  and other kinds of music playing together in front of the stage. When the  proper time comes the curtain is pulled up,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and you see the  stage all arranged like a picture with beautifully painted scenery. Then the  actors and actresses come out on the stage and tell a story to each other. They  dance and sing, and make love, and have a deuce of a time generally. That&rsquo;s  called a play.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it nothing but making love?&rdquo;  asked Davy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they have anything about hunting, or having sport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;War and  soldiers and shooting, and everything you can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the actresses all as pretty  as they say?&rdquo; asked Mary diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too close,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But  you see the lights, and the paint and powder, and the fine clothes show them up  pretty fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives them a great advantage,&rdquo;  she commented. Mary had other questions to ask about actresses. Davy was not  especially interested in this subject, and soon as he got an opening therefor  he said, looking sidewise at the leather case by the fire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard the banjo played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack instantly produced the  instrument, and, tuning it, gave them song after song. Brother and sister  listened entranced. Never in their lives had they met anybody like Jack Chanty.  He was master of an insinuating tone not usually associated with the blatant  banjo. Without looking at her, he sang love-songs to Mary that shook her  breast. In her wonder and pleasure she unconsciously let fall the guard over her  eyes, and Jack&rsquo;s heart beat fast at what he read there.</p>
<p>Warned at last by the darkness,  Mary sprang up. &ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.</p>
<p>Davy, who had come unwillingly,  was more unwilling to go. But the hint of &ldquo;father&rsquo;s&rdquo; anger was sufficient to  start him.</p>
<p>Jack detained Mary for an instant  at the edge of the clearing. He dropped the air of the genial host. &ldquo;I shall  not be able to sleep to-night,&rdquo; he said swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Th &mdash;  thinking of the theatre,&rdquo; she added lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When everybody is asleep,&rdquo; he  pleaded, &ldquo;come outside your house. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you. I want to talk to  you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no answer, but raised her  eyes for a moment to his, two deep, deep pools of wistfulness. &ldquo;Ah, be good to  me! Be good to me,&rdquo; they seemed to plead with him. Then she darted after her  brother.</p>
<p>The look sobered Jack, but not for  very long. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he thought exultingly.</p>
<p>Left alone, he worked like a  beaver, chopping and carrying wood for his fire. Under stress of emotion he  turned instinctively to violent physical exertion for an outlet. He was more  moved than he knew. In an hour, being then as dark as it would get, he  exchanged the axe for the banjo, and, slinging it over his back, set forth.</p>
<p>The growth of young poplar  stretched between his camp and the esplanade of grass surrounding the buildings  of the fort. When he came to the edge of the trees the warehouse was the  building nearest to him. Running across the intervening space, he took up his  station in the shadow of the corner of it, where he could watch the trader&rsquo;s  house. A path bordered by young cabbages and turnips led from the front door  down to the gate in the palings. The three visible windows of the house were  dark. At a little distance behind the house the sledge dogs of the company were  tethered in a long row of kennels, but there was little danger of their giving  an alarm, for they often broke into a frantic barking and howling for no reason  except the intolerable ennui of their lives in the summer.</p>
<p>There is no moment of the day in  lower latitudes that exactly corresponds to the fairylike night-long summer  twilight of the North. The sunset glow does not fade entirely, but hour by hour  moves around the Northern horizon to the east, where presently it heralds the  sun&rsquo;s return. It is not dark, and it is not light. The world is a ghostly  place. It is most like nights at home when the full moon is shining behind  light clouds, but with this difference, that here it is the dimness of a great  light that embraces the world, instead of the partial obscurity of a lesser.</p>
<p>Jack waited with his eyes glued to  the door of the trader&rsquo;s house. There was not a breath stirring. There were no  crickets, no katydids, no tree-toads to make the night companionable; only the  hoot of an owl, and the far-off wail of a coyote to put an edge on the silence.  It was cold, and for the time being the mosquitoes were discouraged. The stars  twinkled sedulously like busy things.</p>
<p>Jack waited as a young man waits  for a woman at night, with his ears strained to catch the whisper of her dress,  a tremor in his muscles, and his heart beating thickly in his throat. The  minutes passed heavily. Once the dogs raised an infernal clamour, and subsided  again. A score of times he thought he saw her, but it was only a trick of his  desirous eyes. He became cold to the bones, and his heart sunk. As a last  resort he played the refrain of the last song he had sung her, played it so  softly none but one who listened would be likely to hear. The windows of the  house were open.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he sensed a figure  appearing from behind the house, and his heart leapt. He lost it in the shadow  of the house. He waited breathlessly, then played a note or two. The figure  reappeared, running toward him, still in the shadow. It loomed big in the  darkness. It started across the open space. Too late Jack saw his mistake. He  had only time to fling the banjo behind him, before the man was upon him with a  whispered oath.</p>
<p>Jack thought of a rival, and his  breast burned. He defended himself as best as he could, but his blows went wide  in the darkness. The other man was bigger than he, and nerved by a terrible,  quiet passion. To save himself from the other&rsquo;s blows Jack clinched. The man  flung him off. Jack heard the sharp impact of a blow he did not feel. The earth  leapt up, and he drifted away on the swirling current of unconsciousness. </p>
<p>What happened after that was like  the awakening from a vague, bad dream. He had first the impression of  descending a long and tempestuous series of rapids on his flimsily hung raft, to  which he clung desperately. Then the scene changed and he seemed to be floating  in a ghastly void. He thought he was blind. He put out his hand to feel, and  his palm came in contact with the cool, moist earth, overlaid with bits of twig  and dead leaves, and sprouts of elastic grass. The earth at least was real, and  he felt of it gratefully, while the rest of him still teetered in emptiness.</p>
<p>Then he became conscious of a  comfortable emanation, as from a fire; sight returned, and he saw that there  was a fire. It had a familiar look; it was the fire he himself had built some  hours before. He felt himself, and found that he was covered by his own  blanket. &ldquo;I have had a nightmare,&rdquo; he thought mistily. Then a voice broke  rudely on his vague fancies, bringing the shock of complete recollection in its  train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re coming &rsquo;round all  right,&rdquo; it said grimly.</p>
<p>At his feet, Jack saw David  Cranston sitting on a log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put the pot on,&rdquo; he  continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a sup of tea for you in a minute. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hit  you so hard, my lad, but I was mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack turned his head, and hid it  in his arm. Dizzy, nauseated, and shamed, he was as near blubbering at that  moment as a self-respecting young man could let himself get in the presence of  another man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean hit, point of the jaw,&rdquo;  Cranston went on. &ldquo;Nothing broke. You&rsquo;ll be as right as ever with the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made it, and forced Jack to  drink of the scalding infusion. In spite of himself, it revived the young man,  but it did not comfort his spirit any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; he muttered,  meaning: &ldquo;You can go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smoke a pipe wi&rsquo; you,&rdquo; said  Cranston imperturbably. &ldquo;I want a bit of a crack wi&rsquo; you.&rdquo; Seeing Jack&rsquo;s scowl,  he added quickly: &ldquo;Lord! I&rsquo;m not going to preach over you, lying there. You  tried to do me an injury, a devilish injury, but the mad went out wi&rsquo; the blow  that stretched ye. I wish to do you justice. I mind as how I was once a young  sprig myself, and hung around outside the tepees at night, and tried to whistle  the girls out. But I never held by such a tingle-pingle contraption as that,&rdquo;  he said scornfully, pushing the banjo with his foot. &ldquo;To my mind it&rsquo;s for  niggers and Eye-talians. &rsquo;Tis unmanly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack raised his head. &ldquo;Did you  break it?&rdquo; he demanded scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Cranston coolly. &ldquo;I  brought it along wi&rsquo; you. It&rsquo;s property, and I spoil nothing that is not my  own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence. Cranston with  the greatest deliberation, took out his pipe and stuck it in his mouth;  produced his plug of tobacco, shaved it nicely, and put it away again; rolled the  tobacco thoroughly between his palms, and pressed it into the bowl with a  careful forefinger. A glowing ember from the fire completed the operation. For  five minutes he smoked in silence, occasionally glancing at Jack from under  heavy brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ye anything to say?&rdquo; he  asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered Jack.</p>
<p>There was another silence.  Cranston sat as if he meant to spend the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get too many chances to  talk to a white man,&rdquo; he finally said with a kind of gruff diffidence. &ldquo;Yon  pretty fellows sleeping on the steamboat, they are not men, but clothespins.  Sir Bryson Trangmar, Lord love ye! he will be calling me &lsquo;my good man&rsquo;  to-morrow. And him a grocer once, they say &mdash; like myself.&rdquo; There was a  cavernous chuckle here.</p>
<p>Jack sensed that the grim old  trader was actually making friendly advances, but the young man was too sore,  too hopelessly in the wrong, to respond right away.</p>
<p>Cranston continued to smoke and to  gaze at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have something to say,&rdquo;  he blurted out at last, in a changed voice. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s none too easy!&rdquo; There was  something inexpressibly moving in the tremor that shook his grim voice as he  blundered on. &ldquo;You made a mistake, young fellow. She&rsquo;s too good for this  &lsquo;whistle and I&rsquo;ll come to ye, my lad,&rsquo; business. If you had any sense you would  have seen it for yourself&mdash; my little girl with her wise ways! But no offence.  You are young. I wouldn&rsquo;t bother wi&rsquo; ye at all, but I feel that I am  responsible. It was I who gave them a dark-skinned mother. I handicapped my  girl and my boys, and now I have to be their father and their mother too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good deal less than this would  have reached Jack&rsquo;s sense of generosity. He hid his face again, and hated  himself, but pride still maintained the ascendency. He could not let the other  man see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that that makes you hold  her so lightly,&rdquo; Cranston went on. &ldquo;If she had a white mother, my girl, aye,  wi&rsquo; half her beauty and her goodness, would have put the fear of God into ye.  Well, the consequences of my mistake shall not be visited on her head if I can  prevent it. What does an idle lad like you know of the worth of women? You  measure them by their beauty, which is nothing. She has a mind like an opening  flower. She is my companion. All these years I have been silenced and dumb, and  now I have one to talk to that understands what a white man feels!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a white woman. Some of the  best blood of Scotland runs in her veins. She&rsquo;s a Cranston. Match her wi&rsquo; his  lordship&rsquo;s daughter there, the daughter of the grocer. Match her wi&rsquo; the  whitest lilies of them all, and my girl will outshine them in beauty, aye, and  outwear them in courage and steadfastness! And she&rsquo;s worthy to bear sons and  daughters in turn that any man might be proud to father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to a full stop. Jack sat  up, scowling fiercely, and looking five years younger by reason of his  sheepishness. What he had to say came out in jerks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s damn hard to get it  out,&rdquo; he stuttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself. What else can I say? I  swear to you I&rsquo;ll never lay a finger of disrespect on her. For heaven&rsquo;s sake  go, and let me be by myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston promptly rose. &ldquo;Spoken  like a man, my lad,&rdquo; he said laconically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say no more. Goodnight to ye.&rdquo;  He strode away. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>IV<br>
  The Conjuror</b></h3>
<p>Morning breaks, one awakes  refreshed and quiescent, and, wondering a little at the heats and disturbances  of the day before, makes a fresh start. Mary was not to be seen about the fort,  and Jack presently learned that she and Davy had departed on horseback at  daybreak for the Indian camp at Swan Lake. He was relieved, for, after what had  happened, the thought of having to meet Mary and adjust himself to a new  footing made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s self-love had received a  serious blow, and he secretly longed for something to rehabilitate himself in  his own eyes. At the same time he was not moved by any animosity toward  Cranston, the instrument of his downfall; on the contrary, though he could not  have explained it, he felt decidedly drawn toward the grim trader, and after a  while he sheepishly entered the store in search of him. He found Cranston quite  as diffident as himself, quite as anxious to let bygones be bygones. There was  genuine warmth in his handclasp.</p>
<p>They made common cause in deriding  the gubernatorial party. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love ye!&rdquo; said Cranston.  &ldquo;Never was an outfit like to that! Card-tables, mind ye, and folding chairs,  and hanging lamps, and a son-of-a-gun of a big oil-stove that burns blue  blazes! Fancy accommodating that to a horse&rsquo;s back! I&rsquo;ve sent out to round up  all the company horses. They&rsquo;ll need half a regiment to carry that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the governor&rsquo;s game up  here?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me,&rdquo; said Cranston.  &ldquo;Coal lands in the canyon, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty thin,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t need a blooming governor and his train to look at a bit of coal.  There&rsquo;s plenty of coal nearer home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece about it in one  of the papers the steamboat brought,&rdquo; said Cranston.</p>
<p>He found the place, and exhibited  it to Jack, who read a fulsome account of how his honour Sir Bryson Trangmar  had decided to spend the summer vacation of the legislature in touring the  North of the province, with a view of looking into its natural resources; that  the journey had been hastily determined upon, and was to be of a strictly  non-official character, hence there were to be no ceremonies en route beyond  the civilities extended to any private traveller; that this was only one more  example of the democratic tendencies of our popular governor, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natural resources,&rdquo; quoted Jack.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ring in the cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the coal they&rsquo;re after  has a yellow shine?&rdquo; suggested Cranston.</p>
<p>Jack nodded. &ldquo;Even a governor may  catch that fever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By Gad!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, &ldquo;do you remember those  two claim-salters &mdash; Beckford and Rowe their names were &mdash; who went out after the  ice last May?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They stopped here,&rdquo; said  Cranston. &ldquo;I remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if those two&mdash;&rdquo; suggested  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; cried Cranston, &ldquo;the  governor himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  the richest thing that ever happened! A hundred years from now they&rsquo;ll still be  telling the story around the fires and splitting their sides over it. It&rsquo;s like  Beckford, too; he was a humourist in his way. This is too good to miss. I  believe I&rsquo;ll go back with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From discussing Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  object they passed to Jack&rsquo;s own work in the Spirit River Pass. No better  evidence of the progress these two had made in friendship could be had than  Jack&rsquo;s willingness to tell Cranston of his &ldquo;strike,&rdquo; the secret that a man  guards closer than his crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I  have three good claims staked out,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;In case I should be stopped  from filing them, I&rsquo;ll leave you a full description before I go. I&rsquo;ll leave you  my little bag of dust too, to keep for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious about going back  with them, then?&rdquo; said Cranston.</p>
<p>Jack nodded. &ldquo;I ought to go,  anyway, to make sure they don&rsquo;t blanket anything of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due course Jack produced his  little canvas bag, which the trader sealed, weighed, and receipted for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing I wanted to  talk to you about,&rdquo; said Jack diffidently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hold these three claims  myself. I want you to take one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed Cranston in great  astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; stammered Jack, still more  embarrassed. &ldquo;For &mdash; for her, you know &mdash; Mary. I feel that I owe it to her. I  want her to have it, anyway. She needn&rsquo;t know it came from me. It&rsquo;s a good  claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston would not hear of it, and  they argued hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing in your own  daughter&rsquo;s light,&rdquo; said Jack at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giving you anything. It&rsquo;s for  her. You haven&rsquo;t any right to deprive her of a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston was silenced by this  line; they finally shook hands on it, and turned with mutual relief to less  embarrassing subjects. Jack had the comfortable sensation that in a measure he  had squared himself with himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s running the governor&rsquo;s  camp?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They brought up Jean Paul Ascota  from the Crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Jack, considerably  interested. &ldquo;The conjuror and medicine man, eh? I hear great tales of him from  all the tribes. What is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston exhibited no love for the  man under discussion. &ldquo;His father and mother were half-breed Crees,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;He has a little place at the Crossing where he lives alone &mdash; he never married  &mdash; but most of the time he is tripping; long hikes from Abittibi to the Skeena,  and from the edge of the farming country clear to Herschel Island in the  Arctic, generally alone. Too much business, and too mysterious for an Indian, I  say. He&rsquo;s a strong man in his way, he has a certain power, you wouldn&rsquo;t  overlook him in a crowd; but I doubt if he&rsquo;s up to any good. He&rsquo;s one of those  natives that plays double, you know them, a white man wi&rsquo; white men, and a red  wi&rsquo; the reds. Much too smooth and plausible for my taste. Lately he has got  religion, and he goes around wi&rsquo; a Bible in his pocket, which is plumb  ridiculous, knowing what you and I know about his conjuring practices among the  tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s a good tripper,&rdquo;  said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, none better,&rdquo; said Cranston.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say that for him; there&rsquo;s no man knows the whole country like he does, or  a better hand in a canoe, or with horses, or around the camp. But, look you,  after all he&rsquo;s only an Indian. Here he&rsquo;s been with these people a week, and  already his head is turned. They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing, so they defer  to him in everything, and consequently the Indian&rsquo;s head is that swelled wi&rsquo;  giving orders to white men his feet can hardly keep the ground. Their camp is  at a standstill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a childish  outfit, isn&rsquo;t it? It would be a kind of charity to take them in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Jack ran into the  redoubtable Jean Paul Ascota himself, whom he immediately recognized from  Cranston&rsquo;s description. As the trader had intimated, there was something  strongly individual and peculiar in the aspect of the half-breed. He was a  handsome man of forty-odd years, not above the average in height, but very  broad and strong, and with regular, aquiline features. Though Cranston had said  he was half-bred, there was no sign of the admixture of any white blood in his  coppery skin, his straight black hair, and his savage, inscrutable eyes. He was  dressed in a neatly fitting suit of black, and he wore &ldquo;outside&rdquo; shoes instead  of the invariable moccasins. This ministerial habit was relieved by a fine blue  shirt with a rolling collar and a red tie, and the whole was completed by the  usual expensive felt hat with flaring, stiff brim. A Testament peeped out of  one side-pocket.</p>
<p>But it was the strange look of his  eyes that set the man apart, a still, rapt look, a shine as from close-hidden  fires. They were savage, ecstatic, contemptuous eyes. When he looked at you,  you had the feeling that there was a veil dropped between you, invisible to  you, but engrossed with cabalistic symbols that he was studying while he  appeared to be looking at you. In all this there was a certain amount of  affectation. You could not deny the man&rsquo;s force, but there was something  childish too in the egregious vanity which was perfectly evident.</p>
<p>He was sitting on a box in the  midst of the camp disarray, smoking calmly, the only idle figure in sight.  Tents, poles, and miscellaneous camp impedimenta were strewn on one side of the  trail; on the other the deck-hands were piling the stores of the party. Sidney  Vassall, with his inventory, assisted by Baldwin Ferrie, both in a state  approaching distraction, were pawing over the boxes and bundles, searching for  innumerable lost articles, that were lost again as soon as they were found.</p>
<p>Vassall was not a particularly  sympathetic figure to Jack, but the sight of the white men stewing while the  Indian loafed was too much for his Anglo-Saxon sense of the fitness of things.  His choler promptly rose, and, drawing Vassall aside, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, why do you let that  beggar impose on you like this? You&rsquo;ll never be able to manage him if you  knuckle down now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall was a typical A. D. C.  from the provinces, much better fitted to a waxed floor than the field. The  hero of a hundred drawing-rooms made rather a pathetic figure in his shapeless,  many-pocketed &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; suit. His much-admired manner of indiscriminate,  enthusiastic amiability seemed to have lost its potency up here. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he said  helplessly. &ldquo;He says he can&rsquo;t work himself, or he won&rsquo;t be able to boss the  Indians that are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Everybody  has to work on the trail. I&rsquo;ll put him to work for you. Show me how the tents  go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall gratefully explained the  arrangement. There was a square tent in the centre, with three smaller A-tents  opening off. Jack measured the ground and drove the stakes. Then spreading the  canvas on the ground, preparatory to raising it, he called cheerfully: &ldquo;Lend a  hand here, Jean Paul. You hold up the poles while I pull the ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed looked at him with  cool, slow insolence, and dropping his eyes to his pipe, pressed the tobacco in  the bowl with a delicate finger. He caught his hands around his knee, and  leaned back with the expression of one enjoying a recondite joke.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face reddened. Promptly  dropping the canvas, he strode toward the half-breed, his hands clenching as he  went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you damned redskin!&rdquo;  he said, not too loud. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t hear a civil request, I&rsquo;ve a fist to back  it up, understand? You get to work, quick, or I&rsquo;ll knock your head off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The native deck hands stopped dead  to see what would happen. Out of the blue sky the thunderbolt of a crisis had  fallen. Jean Paul, the object of their unbounded fear and respect, they  invested with supernatural powers, and they looked to see the white man  annihilated.</p>
<p>The breed slowly raised his eyes  again, but this time they could not quite meet the blazing blue ones. There was  a pregnant pause. Finally Jean Paul got up with a shrug of bravado, and  followed Jack back to the tents. He was beaten without a blow on either side. A  breath of astonishment escaped the other natives. Jean Paul heard it, and the  iron entered his soul. The glance he bent on Jack&rsquo;s back glittered with the  cold malignancy of a poisonous snake. It was all over in a few seconds and the  course of the events for weeks to come was decided, a course involving, at the  last, madness, murder, and suicide.</p>
<p>On the face of it the work  proceeded smartly, and by lunch time the tents were raised, the furniture and  the baggage stowed within, and Vassall&rsquo;s vexatious inventory checked complete.  His effusive gratitude made Jack uncomfortable. Jack cut him short, and  nonchalantly returned to his own camp, where he cooked his dinner and ate it  alone.</p>
<p>Afterward, cleaning his gun by the  fire, he reviewed the crowded events of the past twenty-four hours in the  ever-delightful, off-hand, cocksure fashion of youth that the oldsters envy,  while they smile at it. His glancing thoughts ran something like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be put to sleep like that!  Damn! But I couldn&rsquo;t see what I was doing. If it hadn&rsquo;t been dark! ... At any  rate, nobody knows. It&rsquo;s good he didn&rsquo;t black my eye. Cranston&rsquo;ll never tell.  He&rsquo;s a square old head all right. I suppose it was coming to me. Damn! ... I  like Cranston, though. He&rsquo;s making up to me now. He&rsquo;d like me to marry the  girl. She&rsquo;d take me quick enough. Nice little thing, too. Fine eyes! But  marriage! Not on your cartridge-belt! Not for Jack Chanty! The world is too  full of sport. I haven&rsquo;t nearly had my fill! . . . The governor&rsquo;s daughter!  Rather a little strawberry, too. Professional angler. I know &rsquo;em. Got a whole  bookful of fancy flies for men. Casts them prettily one after another till you  rise, then plop! into her basket with the other dead fish. You&rsquo;ll never get me  on your hook, little sister. . . I can play a little myself. If you let on you  don&rsquo;t care, with that kind, it drives &rsquo;em wild. . . . Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she  had old Frank going. . . . Rum start, meeting him up here. What a scared look  he gave me. I wonder! . . . He&rsquo;s changed. . . . Very likely it&rsquo;s politics, and  graft, and getting on in the world. Doesn&rsquo;t want to associate too closely with  a tough like me, now. . . . Oh, very well! These big-bugs can&rsquo;t put me out of  face. I can show them a thing or two. ... I put that Indian down in good shape.  I have the trick of it. He&rsquo;s a queer one. They&rsquo;ll have trouble with him later.  Women with them, too. Hell of an outfit to come up here, anyway.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s meditations were  interrupted by Frank Garrod, who came threading his way through the poplar  saplings. Jack sprang up with a gladness only a little less hearty than upon  their first meeting the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, old fel&rsquo;!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Glad  you looked me up! We can talk off here by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it appeared that Frank had  come only for the purpose of carrying Jack back with him. Sir Bryson had  expressed a wish to thank him for his assistance that morning. Jack frowned,  and promptly declined the honour, but upon second thought he changed his mind.  There was a plan growing in his head which necessitated a talk with Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>They made their way back together,  Frank making an unhappy attempt to appear at his ease. He had something on his  mind. He started to speak, faltered, and fell silent. But it troubled him  still. Finally it came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said in his jerky way,  &ldquo;as long as you want to keep your real name quiet, we had better not let on  that we are old friends, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at him quickly, all  his enthusiasm of friendliness dying down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can seem to become good  friends by degrees,&rdquo; Garrod went on lamely. &ldquo;It need only be a matter of a few  days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; said Jack  coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m thinking of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  care what people call me. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid that I&rsquo;ll trouble you with my  society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Garrod  murmured miserably.</p>
<p>However, in merely bringing the  matter up he had accomplished his purpose, for Jack never acted quite the same  to him afterward.</p>
<p>A little to one side of the tents  they came upon a group of finished worldliness such as had never before been  seen about Fort Cheever. From afar, the younger Cranston boys stared at it  awestruck. Miss Trangmar and her companion sat in two of the folding chairs,  basking in the sun, while Vassall and Baldwin Ferrie reclined on the grass at  their feet, the former, his day&rsquo;s work behind him, now clad in impeccable  flannels. The centre of the picture was naturally the little beauty, looking in  her purple summer dress as desirable, as fragile, and as expensive as an  orchid. At the sight of her Jack&rsquo;s nostrils expanded a little in spite of  himself. Lovely ladies who metamorphosed themselves every day, not to speak of  several times a day, were novel to him.</p>
<p>As the two men made to enter the  main tent she called in her sweet, high voice: &ldquo;Present our benefactor, Mr. Garrod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod brought Jack to her. Garrod  was very much confused. &ldquo;I &mdash; I&rdquo; &mdash; he stammered, looking imploringly at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me Jack Chanty,&rdquo; Jack  said quietly, with his air of &ldquo;take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Trangmar, Mrs. Worsley,&rdquo;  Garrod murmured looking relieved.</p>
<p>Jack bowed stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are tremendously obliged,&rdquo; the  little lady said, making her eyes big with gratitude. &ldquo;Captain Vassall says he  would never have got through without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of assent went round the  circle. Jack would not out of sheer obstinacy make the polite and obvious  reply. He looked at the elder lady. He liked her looks. She reminded him of an  outspoken cousin of his boyhood. She was plain of feature and humorous-looking,  very well dressed, and with an air of high tolerance for human failings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In pleasing Miss Trangmar you put  us all under heavy obligations,&rdquo; said Baldwin Ferrie with a simper. He was a  well-meaning little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! yes,&rdquo; added Vassall;  &ldquo;when she&rsquo;s overcast we&rsquo;re all in shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed agreeably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda Trangmar,  &ldquo;one would think I had a fearful temper, and kept you all in fear of your  lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of disclaimers.  Jack felt slightly nauseated. He looked away. The girl stole a wistful glance  at his scornful profile, the plume of fair hair, the cold blue eyes, the  resolute mouth. All of a sudden she had become conscious of the fulsome  atmosphere, too. She wondered what secrets the proud youthful mask concealed.  She wondered if there was a woman for whom the mask was dropped, and if she  were prettier than herself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack felt as if he were  acting like a booby, standing there. He was impelled to say something,  anything, to show them he was not overcome by their assured worldliness. He  addressed himself to Vassall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had no trouble with the  Indian, since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; Vassall said.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone off now with some of the people here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod took advantage of the next  lull to say: &ldquo;Sir Bryson is waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack bowed again, and made a good  retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you he was a gentleman,&rdquo;  said Linda to Mrs. Worsley.</p>
<p>That lady had been impressed with  the same fact, but she said cautiously, as became a chaperon: &ldquo;His manner is  rather brusque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has manner,&rdquo; remarked  Linda slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know nothing about him, my  dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Linda.  &ldquo;Fancy meeting a real mystery in these matter-of-fact days. I shall find out  his right name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s not polite to ask  questions about a man&rsquo;s past in this country,&rdquo; suggested Vassall with a playful  air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor safe,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Worsley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares for safety?&rdquo; cried  Linda. &ldquo;I came North for adventures, and I mean to have them! Isn&rsquo;t he  handsome?&rdquo; she added wickedly.</p>
<p>The two men assented without  enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Within the main tent Sir Bryson  was seated at a table, looking the very pink of official propriety. There were  several piles of legal documents and miscellaneous papers before him, with  which he appeared to be busily occupied. It was noticeable that his chief  concern was to have the piles arranged with mathematical precision. He never  finished shaking and patting them straight. At first he ignored Jack. Handing  some papers to Garrod, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are now ready to be sent,  Mr. Garrod. Please bear in mind my various instructions concerning them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod retired to another table.  He proceeded to fold and enclose the various documents, but from the tense  poise of his head it was clear that he followed all that was said.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson now affected to become  aware of Jack&rsquo;s presence with a little start. He looked him up and down as one  might regard, a fine horse he was called on to admire. &ldquo;So this is the young  man who was of so much assistance to us this morning?&rdquo; he said with a smile of  heavy benignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack suppressed an inclination to  laugh in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very much obliged to you,  young sir &mdash; very,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson grandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing, sir,&rdquo; said Jack,  smiling suddenly. He knew if he caught Garrod&rsquo;s eye he would burst out  laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now desire to ask you some  questions relative to the big canyon,&rdquo; continued Sir Bryson. &ldquo;I am told you  know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come from there,&rdquo;  said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a good trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came by water. But I know the  trail. It is well-travelled. There are no muskegs, and the crossings are easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the canyon well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been working above it for  three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson favoured Jack with a  beady glance. &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; he said. And then suddenly: &ldquo;Are you free for the next  month or so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod raised his eyes with a  terrified look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you prepared to consider an  offer to guide our party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod bit his lips to keep back  the protest that sprang to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is sufficiently  attractive,&rdquo; said Jack coolly.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson opened his eyes. &ldquo;Three  dollars a day, and everything found,&rdquo; he said sharply.</p>
<p>Jack smiled, and shook his head.  &ldquo;That is the ordinary pay of a white man in this country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a  responsible job. I&rsquo;d expect five at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson made a face of horror.  &ldquo;Out of the question!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all anxious for it at  any price,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;It will be difficult. You are very badly provided&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have everything!&rdquo; cried Sir  Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except necessities,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;Moreover, men should have been engaged in advance, good packers, boatmen,  axemen. We can&rsquo;t get good material on the spur of the moment, and I have no  wish to be blamed for what goes wrong by others&rsquo; doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson puffed out his cheeks.  &ldquo;You take a good deal on yourself, young man,&rdquo; he said heatedly. &ldquo;Let me ask  you a few questions now if you please. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am known throughout the country  as Jack Chanty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care to give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long breath escaped slowly from  between Garrod&rsquo;s clenched teeth, and he wiped his face.</p>
<p>The little governor swelled like a  pouter pigeon. &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is preposterous. Do you think I would  entrust myself and my party to a nameless nobody from nowhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, pleased with the sound  of this phrase, glanced over at Garrod for approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not after the job, Sir Bryson,&rdquo;  said Jack coolly. &ldquo;You opened the matter. I am known throughout the country.  Ask Cranston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod, seeing his chief about to  weaken, could no longer hold his peace. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be as well to let the  matter go over?&rdquo; he suggested casually.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson turned on him very much  annoyed. &ldquo;Mr. Garrod, by your leave,&rdquo; he said crushingly. &ldquo;I was about to make  the suggestion myself. That will be all just now,&rdquo; he added to Jack.</p>
<p>Jack sauntered away to talk the  matter over with Cranston.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson spoke his mind warmly  to his secretary concerning the latter&rsquo;s interference. Garrod, however,  relieved of Jack&rsquo;s presence, recovered a measure of sang-froid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said smoothly,  &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t stand by and listen to the young ruffian browbeat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Browbeat nothing,&rdquo; said the irate  little governor. &ldquo;Bargaining is bargaining! He stands out for as much as he  can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod turned pale. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely  not thinking of engaging him!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else,&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s more insolent than the  Indian,&rdquo; said Garrod nervously. &ldquo;And who is he? what is he? Some nameless  fugitive from justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overlook the fact that he  doesn&rsquo;t care whether I engage him or not,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson. &ldquo;Our assurance lies  in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shallow pretence,&rdquo; cried Garrod.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson turned squarely in his  chair. &ldquo;You seem to be strangely set against hiring this fellow,&rdquo; he said  curiously.</p>
<p>Garrod was effectually silenced.  With a gesture, he went on with his work.</p>
<p>Later he sought out Jack again.  They sat on a bench at the edge of the bank, and Garrod suffered himself to  answer some painful questions first, in order that he might not appear to be  too eager to broach the subject that agitated his mind.</p>
<p>At last he said with an assumed  heartiness in which there was something very painful to see: &ldquo;I tell you it did  me good to hear you giving the old man what for this afternoon. He leads me a  dog&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was only in the way of a  dicker,&rdquo; said Jack carelessly. &ldquo;He expected it. Any one could see he loves a  bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself in for this  one,&rdquo; said Garrod earnestly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll repent it if you do. He&rsquo;ll interfere all  the time, and insist on his own way, then blame you when things go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with you is you&rsquo;re in  awe of him because he&rsquo;s the Big Chief outside,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t go up  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to come?&rdquo; faltered  Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he accepts my terms,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to let myself go too cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s head drooped. &ldquo;Well &mdash;  don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you,&rdquo; he said in an odd, flat tone. </p>

  Jack Hears About Himself</b></h3>
<p>Jack was subsequently engaged as  chief guide to Sir Bryson&rsquo;s party. Days of strenuous preparation succeeded. For  one thing the stores of the expedition had to undergo a rigid weeding-out  process; the oil-stove, the bedsteads, the white flannels, and the parasols,  etc., were left behind. There was a shortage of flour and bacon, which the  store at Fort Cheever was in poor shape to supply. Last winter&rsquo;s grub was  almost exhausted, and this winter&rsquo;s supply had not arrived. The Indians, who  are the store&rsquo;s only customers, live off the land during the summer. Cranston  stripped himself of what he had, and sent a messenger down the river with an  urgent order for more to be sent up by the next boat.</p>
<p>Jack was hampered by a lack of  support from his own party. Vassall and Baldwin Ferrie were willing enough but  incapable. Garrod blew hot and cold, and altogether acted in a manner  inexplicable to Jack. Only the man&rsquo;s obvious suffering prevented the two from  coming to an open quarrel. Jack dismissed him with a contemptuous shrug. The  little governor issued and countermanded his orders bewilderingly and any  malcontent was always sure of a hearing from him. But Jean Paul Ascota, from  whom Jack had most reason to expect mischief-making, gave him no trouble at  all. This in itself might have warned him of danger, but he had too many other  things to think about.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that Jack bore  all his hindrances with exemplary patience. However, he had an effective weapon  in his unconcern. When matters came to a deadlock he laughed, and, retiring to  his own little camp, occupied himself with his banjo until some one came after  him with an olive branch. They were absolutely dependent on him.</p>
<p>On the eighth day they finally got  away. Mounting his horse, Jack took up a position on a little mound by the  trail, and watched his company file past. For himself he had neglected none of  the stage-trappings dear to the artistic sense of a young man. His horse was  the best in the company and the best accoutred.</p>
<p>He had secured a pair of shaggy  bearskin chaps and from his belt hung a gigantic .44 in a holster. He wore a  dashing broad-brimmed &ldquo;Stetson,&rdquo; and a gay silk handkerchief knotted loosely  around his throat. The sight of him sitting there, hand on hip, with his scornful  air, affected little Linda Trangmar like a slight stab. She bit her lip, called  herself a fool, and spurred ahead.</p>
<p>Jean Paul Ascota rode at the head  of the procession. Jack had seen the wisdom of propitiating him with this empty  honour. The Indian had likewise seen to it that he obtained a good horse, and  he rode like a careless Centaur. Passing Jack, his face was as blank as paper,  but out of Jack&rsquo;s range of vision the black eyes narrowed balefully, the wide  nostrils dilated, and the lips were tightly compressed.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson&rsquo;s party followed: the  spruce little governor, an incongruous figure on his sorry cayuse; the two  ladies, Garrod, Vassall, and Baldwin Ferrie. At the very start Sir Bryson  objected to riding at the tail of Jean Paul&rsquo;s horse, and Jack was obliged to  explain to him that there are certain rules of the trail which even a  lieutenant-governor may not override. The place at the head belongs to him who  can best follow or make a trail.</p>
<p>The two ladies wore khaki divided  skirts that they had been obliged to contrive for themselves, since  side-saddles are unknown in the country. In regard to Miss Trangmar and Mrs.  Worsley, Jack had strongly urged that they be left at Fort Cheever, and in this  matter Garrod had almost desperately supported him, volunteering to stay behind  to look after them. His activity booted him nothing with his little mistress.  When she heard of the suggestion she merely smiled and waited until she got her  father alone. As a result here they were.</p>
<p>There was one more white member of  the expedition of whom some explanation must be given: this was Thomas Jull,  lately cook on the steamboat, and now transferred to the position of camp cook.  The whole design of the journey had been threatened with extinction at Fort  Cheever by the discovery that a cook had been forgotten. There was of course  nothing of that kind to be obtained at the fort. Jull&rsquo;s cooking had all been  done on stoves, but Jack, promising to initiate him into the mysteries of  campfires, had tempted him to forsake his snug berth.</p>
<p>He was a fat, pale, and puffy  creature of indeterminate age, who looked as if his growth had been forced in a  cellar, but he was of a simple, willing nature, and he had conceived an  enormous admiration for Jack, who was so different from himself. He had already  acquired a nickname in the country from his habit of carrying his big head as  if in momentary expectation of a blow. Humpy Jull he was to be henceforth.</p>
<p>Four Indian lads completed the  party. This was barely sufficient to pack the horses and make camp, but as Jack  had explained to Sir Bryson the best he could get were a poor lot, totally  unaccustomed to any discipline, and a larger number of them would only have  invited trouble. They must be worked hard, and kept under close subjection to the  whites, he said. There were twenty laden horses, and five spare animals.</p>
<p>They climbed the steep high hill  behind Fort Cheever and Jack, watching the train wind up before him, thrilled a  little with satisfaction under his mask of careless hardihood. Notwithstanding  all his preliminary difficulties, it was a businesslike-looking outfit.  Besides, it is not given to many young men in their twenties to command a  lieutenant-governor.</p>
<p>This was not really a hill, but  the river-bank proper. From the top of it the prairie stretched back as far as  the eye could reach, green as an emerald sea at this season, and starred with  flowers. Here and there in the broad expanse grew coverts of poplar saplings  and wolf-willow, making a parklike effect. The well-beaten trail mounted the  smooth billows, and dipped into the troughs of the grassy sea like an endless  brown ribbon spreading before them.</p>
<p>The progress of such a party is  very slow. The laden pack-horses cannot be induced to travel above a slow, slow  walk. Twice a day they must be unladen and turned out to forage; then caught  and carefully packed again. On the first day a good deal of confusion attended  these operations. Little by little Jack brought order out of chaos.</p>
<p>As the pack-train got under way  after the first &ldquo;spell&rdquo; on the prairie, Jack, not generally so observant of  such things, was struck by the look of weariness and pain in Garrod&rsquo;s white  face. It was the face of a man whose nerves have reached the point of snapping.  Jack did not see as far as that, but: &ldquo;The old boy&rsquo;s in a bad way,&rdquo; he thought,  with a return of his old kindness. After all, as youths, these two had been  inseparable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, wait behind and ride with  me,&rdquo; he said to Garrod. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve scarcely had a chance to say anything to each  other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s start and the wild roll  of his black eyes suggested nothing but terror at the idea, but there was no  reasonable excuse he could offer. They rode side by side in the grass at some  distance behind the last Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  never heard a word from home since the night I cleared out five years ago. Tell  me everything that&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a large &mdash; a large order,&rdquo;  stammered Garrod. &ldquo;So many little things. I forget them. Nothing important. I  left Montreal myself soon after you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you never answer my  letter?&rdquo; asked Jack. &ldquo;You know I had no one to write to but you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never got a letter,&rdquo; said  Garrod quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;Letters don&rsquo;t often go astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo; demanded  Garrod sharply.</p>
<p>Jack stared. &ldquo;Why, sure!&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s biting you? You&rsquo;re in a rotten state of nerves,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Better  chuck the life you&rsquo;re leading, and stay up here for a year or two. What&rsquo;s the  matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod passed the back of his hand  across his weary eyes. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of a man up here that  couldn&rsquo;t do his eight hours a night,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still hitting the old  pace?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>Garrod shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad! what a pair of young fools  we were! Trying to cut a dash on bank-clerks&rsquo; salaries! That girl did me a  mighty good turn without meaning it when she chucked me for the millionaire.  What&rsquo;s become of her, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She married him,&rdquo; Garrod said;  &ldquo;ruined him, divorced him, and married another millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed carelessly. &ldquo;Logical,  eh? And that was what I broke my young heart over! Remember the night I said  good-bye to you in the Bonaventure station, and blubbered like a kid? I said my  life was over, &rsquo;member? &mdash; and I wasn&rsquo;t twenty-one yet. You were damn decent to  me, Frank. You didn&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod kept his head averted. His  lips were very white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went through quite a lot for a  pair of kids,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;We always stood by each other, though we were  such idiots in other respects. What we needed was a good birching. It takes a  year or two of working up here to put an only son straight with himself. Life  is simple and natural up here; you&rsquo;re bound to see the right of things. Better  stay, and get your health back, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod merely shook his head  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle is dead,&rdquo; Jack went on.  &ldquo;I saw it in a paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And left his pile to a blooming  hospital! That&rsquo;s what I lost for clearing out, I suppose. Well, I don&rsquo;t regret  it &mdash; much. That is, not the money. But I&rsquo;m sorry the old boy passed out with a  grouch against me. I thought he would understand. He had a square head. I&rsquo;ve  often thought there must have been something else. You were quite a favourite  of his, Frank. Was there anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Garrod had not  looked at Jack. At the last question a wild and impatient look flashed in his  sick eyes as if some power of endurance had snapped within him. He jerked his  head toward the other man with desperate speech on his lips. It was never  uttered, for at the same moment an exclamation broke from Jack, and clapping  heels to his horse, he sprang ahead. One of the packs had slipped, and the  animal that bore it was sitting in the trail like a dog.</p>
<p>After the pack had been  readjusted, other things intervened, Garrod regained his own place in the  procession, and Jack for the time being forgot that his question had not been  answered.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s dignity as the commander of  the party often sat heavily upon him, and he was fond of dropping far behind in  the trail, where he could loll in the saddle, and sing and whistle to his  heart&rsquo;s ease. His spirits always rose when he was on the move, and the sun was  shining.</p>
<p>Jack had a great store of old  English ballads. On one such occasion he was informing high heaven of the merits  of &ldquo;Fair Hebe,&rdquo; when upon coming around a poplar bluff he was astonished to see  Linda Trangmar standing beside her horse, listening with a smile of pretty  malice. She had a bunch of pink flowers that she had gathered. Jack sharply  called in the song, and blushed to his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What did  Reason tell you about Fair Hebe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made believe not to hear. Our  hero hated to be made fun of. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to be left behind by the outfit,&rdquo;  he said stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you were coming,&rdquo; she said  coolly. &ldquo;Besides, I got off to pick these flowers, and I couldn&rsquo;t get on again  without being helped.&rdquo; She thrust the flowers in her belt. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they lovely?  Like crushed strawberries. What are they called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Painter&rsquo;s brush,&rdquo; said Jack  laconically.</p>
<p>He lifted her on her horse. She  was very light. It was difficult to believe that this pale and pretty little  thing was a woman grown. She had a directness of speech that was only saved  from downright impudence by her pretty childishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can talk,&rdquo; she said as  they started their horses. &ldquo;The truth is, I stayed behind on purpose to talk to  you. I wish to make friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack, not knowing exactly what to  say, said nothing.</p>
<p>She darted an appraising look at  him. &ldquo;Mr. Vassall says it&rsquo;s dangerous to ask a man questions about himself up  here,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But I want to ask you some questions. May I? Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was accompanied by a dazzling  smile. Jack slowly grew red again. He hated himself for being put out of  countenance by her impudence, nevertheless it cast him up high and dry.</p>
<p>She took his assent for granted.  &ldquo;In the first place, about your name,&rdquo; she chattered; &ldquo;what am I to call you?  Mr. Chanty would be ridiculous, and without the Mister it&rsquo;s too familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bother about a handle  to my name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Call me Jack, just as you speak to Jean Paul or  Charlbogin, or any of the men about camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I  do not call Mr. Garrod, Frank, nor Captain Vassall, Sidney. You can make  believe what you choose, but I know you are my kind of person. If you are a  Canadian, I&rsquo;m sure we know heaps and heaps of the same people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack began to find himself. &ldquo;If  you insist on a respectable name call me Mr. &rsquo;Awkins,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Is that the best you can  invent?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was a long time since Jack had  played conversational battledore and shuttlecock. He found he liked it rather.  &ldquo;&rsquo;Awkins is an honorable name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Sir &rsquo;Awkeye &rsquo;Awkins of  &rsquo;Awkwood &rsquo;All, not to speak of &rsquo;Enery &rsquo;Awkins and Liza that everybody knows  about. And over on this side there&rsquo;s Happy Hawkins. All relatives of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl approved him because he  played the foolish game without grinning foolishly, like most men. Indeed his  lip still curled. &ldquo;You do not resemble the &rsquo;Awkinses I have known,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It appeared from this that the  little lady could flatter men as well as queen it over them. Jack was sensible  that he was being flattered, and being human, he found it not unpleasant. At  the same time he was determined not to satisfy her curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For your sake I  wish I would lay claim to Montmorenci or Featherstonehaugh. But &rsquo;Awkins is my  name and &rsquo;umble is my station. I don&rsquo;t know any of the Vere de Veres, the  Cholmondeleys or the Silligers here in Canada, only the toughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not laugh. Abandoning the  direct line, she asked: &ldquo;What do you do up here regularly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing regularly,&rdquo; he said with  a smile. &ldquo;A little of everything irregularly. I have horses across the  mountains, and I make my living by packing freight to the trading posts, or for  surveyors or private parties, wherever horses are needed. When I get a little  ahead of the game like everybody else, I do a bit of prospecting. I have an eye  on one or two things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold?&rdquo; she said with shining  eyes. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be telling,&rdquo; said  Jack, flicking his pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anybody in Toronto?&rdquo;  she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>He smiled at her abrupt return to  the main issue, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Montreal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face changed a little. After a  moment he said slyly: &ldquo;I met a fellow across the mountains who was from  Montreal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malcolm Piers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with round eyes.  &ldquo;How exciting!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exciting?&rdquo; said Jack, very much  taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t  be more than one by that name. It must have been Malcolm Piers the absconder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her last word had much the effect  of a bomb explosion under Jack&rsquo;s horse. The animal reared violently, almost  falling back on his rider. Linda was not sufficiently experienced on horseback  to see that Jack&rsquo;s hand had spasmodically given the cruel Western bit a  tremendous tug. The horse plunged and violently shook his head to free himself  of the pain. When he finally came back to earth, the actions of the horse  seemed sufficient to account for the sudden grimness of Jack&rsquo;s expression. His  upper lip had disappeared, leaving only a thin, hard line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said Linda nervously.  &ldquo;These horses are unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you call him?&rdquo; asked  Jack quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absconder,&rdquo; she said innocently. &ldquo;Malcolm Piers was the boy who  stole five thousand dollars from the Bank of Canada, and was never heard of  afterward. He was only twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her stupidly. &ldquo;Five  thousand dollars!&rdquo; he repeated more than once. &ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said eagerly.  &ldquo;Everybody knows the story. He disappeared, and so did the money. I heard all  the particulars at the time, because my room-mate at Havergal was the sister of  the girl they said he did it for. She wasn&rsquo;t to blame, poor thing. She proved  that she had sent him about his business before it happened. She married a  millionaire afterward. She&rsquo;s had heaps of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s horse fretted and danced,  and no answer was required of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy your meeting him,&rdquo; she said  excitingly. &ldquo;Do tell me about him. They said he was terribly good-looking. Was  he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Jack gruffly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no judge of a man&rsquo;s looks.&rdquo; He scarcely knew what he was saying. The  terrible word rang in his head with a clangour as of blows on naked iron  &ldquo;Absconder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell me about him,&rdquo; she  repeated. &ldquo;Criminals are so deadly interesting! When they&rsquo;re gentlemen. I mean.  And he was so young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said everybody knows what he  did,&rdquo; said Jack dully. &ldquo;I never heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant everybody in our world,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;It never got in the newspapers of course. Malcolm Piers&rsquo;s uncle was  a director in the bank, and he made the shortage good. He died a year or so  afterward, leaving everything to a hospital. If Malcolm Piers had only waited a  little while he wouldn&rsquo;t have had to steal the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he would have been a  millionaire, too,&rdquo; said Jack, with a start of harsh laughter.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t understand the  allusion. She favoured him with a sharp glance. &ldquo;Funny he should have told you  his real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Jack abstractedly.  &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t consider that he had done any wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How ardently Jack wished her away  so that he could think it out by himself. Little by little it was becoming  clear to him, as if revealed by the baleful light of a flame. So that was why  his uncle had cut him off? And Garrod had not answered his question. Garrod  knew all about it. Garrod was the only person in the world who knew in advance  that he had been going to clear out, never to return. Garrod was deep in debt  at the time. Garrod had access to the bank&rsquo;s vault. This explained his strange,  wild agitation at the time of their first meeting, and his actions ever since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of him now?&rdquo; Linda  desired to know. She had to ask twice.</p>
<p>Jack heard her as from a great  distance. He shrugged. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep track of men up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you his story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;It was different from  yours,&rdquo; he said grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that he was infatuated  with a certain girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Amy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind her name! It was  difficult for him to keep up the pace she and her friends set, but she led him  on. Finally she made up her mind that an old man with money was a better gamble  than a young one with prospects only, and she coolly threw him over. It broke  him all up. He was fool enough to love her. Everything he had known up to that  time became hateful to him. So he lit out. But he took nothing with him.  Indeed, he stripped himself of every cent, sold even his clothes to pay his  debts around town before he went. He came West on an emigrant car. Out here he  rode for his grub, he sold goods behind a counter, he even polished glasses  behind a bar, until he got his head above water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a long speech for Jack,  and in delivering it he was betrayed into a dangerous heat. The girl watched  him with a sparkle of mischievous excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely story,&rdquo; she said,  tossing her head. &ldquo;I know that old Mr. McInnes had to put up the money, and  that he altered his will.&rdquo; She smiled provokingly. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s much more interesting  to think that Malcolm Piers took the money. Don&rsquo;t rob me of my favourite  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at her with his  handsome brows drawn close together. Her flippancy sounded incredible to him.  He hated her at that moment.</p>
<p>A horseman dropped out of his  place in the train ahead and came trotting back toward them? It was Garrod.  Seeing him, a deep, ugly red suffused Jack&rsquo;s neck and face, and a vein on his  forehead stood out. But he screwed down the clamps of his self-control. Pride  would not allow him to betray the secrets of his heart to the light-headed  little girl who was angling for them. They were riding around another little  poplar wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said in as near his  natural voice as he could contrive. &ldquo;In the shade the painter&rsquo;s brush grows  yellow. Shall I get you some of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said  inattentively. &ldquo;I like the others best. Tell me about Malcolm Piers &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod was now upon them. His  harassed eye showed a new pain. He looked at Linda Trangmar with a dog&rsquo;s  anxiety, and from her to Jack. Jack looked abroad over the prairie with his  lips pursed up. His face was very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Garrod, what do you  think!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;This man met Malcolm Piers across the mountains. The  boy who absconded from the Bank of Canada, you know. You used to know him,  didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, dreadful to the  two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the little fool! The little  fool!&rdquo; thought Jack. Out of sheer mercifulness he kept his head averted from  Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he heard her  say sharply. &ldquo;Help him!&rdquo; she said to Jack.</p>
<p>This was too much. Making sure  only that Garrod was able to keep his saddle, Jack muttered something about  having to speak to Jean Paul, and rode away. His anger was swallowed up a  pitying disgust. His passing glance into Garrod&rsquo;s face had revealed a depth of  despair that it seemed unfair, shameful, he &mdash; the man&rsquo;s enemy &mdash; should be  allowed to see. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>VI<br>
  The Price of Sleep</b></h3>
<p>They camped for the night on a  grassy terrace at the edge of a deep coulee in the prairie, through which a  wasted stream made its way over a bed of round stones toward the big river. The  only full-sized trees they had seen all day grew in the bottom of the coulee,  which was so deep that nothing of the branches showed over the edge.</p>
<p>The horses were herded together,  and unpacked in a wide circle. Each pack and saddle under its own cover was  left in its place in the circle, against loading in the morning. As fast as  unpacked the horses were turned out to fill themselves with the rich buffalo  grass. The old mares who had mothered most of the bunch were hobbled and belled  to keep the band together.</p>
<p>Jack, Jean Paul, and the Indian  lads saw to the horses. Jack also directed Vassall&rsquo;s and Baldwin Ferrie&rsquo;s  inexpert efforts with the tents, and between times he showed Humpy Jull how to  make a fire.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, Linda, and Mrs.  Worsley, in three of the folding chairs which were the object of so much comment  in the country, looked on at all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so useless,&rdquo; said Linda,  following Jack&rsquo;s diverse activities, without appearing to. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose  there is something we could do, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all seems like such heavy  work, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Worsley.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, folding his hands upon  his comfortable centre, beamed indulgently on the busy scene. &ldquo;Nonsense,  Linda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are all paid for their exertions. You do not concern  yourself with household matters at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is different,&rdquo; said Linda, a  little sulkily. She was sorry she had spoken, but Sir Bryson would not let the  matter drop so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! up here things seem to fall  away from you,&rdquo; said Linda vaguely. &ldquo;You get down to rock bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your metaphors are mixed, my  dear,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson pleasantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said  indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, for my part, I think this  the most agreeable sight in the world,&rdquo; Sir Bryson went on. &ldquo;All these people  working to make us comfortable, and dinner coming on presently. It rests me.  Fancy seeing one&rsquo;s dinner cooked before one&rsquo;s eyes. I hope Jull has washed his  hands. I didn&rsquo;t see him do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson had no intention of  making a joke, but Mrs. Worsley laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of dinner,&rdquo; continued  Sir Bryson, &ldquo;I hope there won&rsquo;t be any awkwardness about our guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Chanty?&rdquo; said Linda quickly.  &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t be  so free with his vulgar name! Do you suppose he will expect to sit down with  us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Linda warmly.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the custom of the country. The whites eat together, and the Indians.  Can&rsquo;t you see that things are different up here? There are no social  distinctions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is high time we  introduced them,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson with the indulgent smile of one who closes  the matter. &ldquo;I shall ask Mr. Garrod to drop him a hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only make yourself  ridiculous if you do,&rdquo; said Linda.</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley spoke but seldom, and  then to some purpose. She said now: &ldquo;Do you know, I think the matter will probably  adjust itself if we leave it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she was right. Nothing was  further from Jack&rsquo;s desires than to sit down with the party in the big tent.  Apart from other considerations he knew which side his bread was buttered on,  and he chummed with the cook. Jack and Humpy slung their little tents side by  side behind the fire, and Jack waited to eat with Humpy after the others were  through.</p>
<p>It was Humpy Jull&rsquo;s debut as a  waiter, and Sir Bryson was thereby likewise provided with a new experience.  Humpy was very willing and good-natured. He was naturally a little flustered on  this occasion, and with him it took the form of an increased flow of speech. To  his simplicity, waiting on the table obligated him to play the host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk in, people,&rdquo; he said  genially. &ldquo;Sit down anywheres. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me if I don&rsquo;t do things  proper. I ain&rsquo;t had no experience at the table with ladies. I never did have no  face, anyway. A child could put me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson became turkey red, and  looked at his aide-de-camp. Vassall made believe not to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just set everything on the  table,&rdquo; Humpy went on innocently, &ldquo;and you dip right in for yourselves. The  bannock ain&rsquo;t quite what it ought to be. I didn&rsquo;t have the time. When we get a  settled camp I&rsquo;ll show you something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far have we made to-day?&rdquo; Sir  Bryson asked pointedly of Vassall to create a diversion.</p>
<p>Humpy took the answer upon  himself. &ldquo;Eighteen miles, Governor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We would have stopped at  Mooseberry Spring two miles back, but Jack said there was no firewood  thereabout. So we&rsquo;re late tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have everything, thank you,&rdquo;  said Sir Bryson icily. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, Governor,&rdquo; said  Humpy heartily. &ldquo;Jack and me ain&rsquo;t going to eat till you are through. I want to  make sure you folks gets your fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the bannock is very good,  Mr. Jull,&rdquo; said Linda wickedly. &ldquo;The raisins are so nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had &rsquo;em and I thought I might  as well put &rsquo;emin,&rdquo; said Humpy, highly pleased. &ldquo;Some finds it hard to make  good baking-powder bannock, but it come natural to me. Jack, he baked it for  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson ceased eating. It was  Jack who prevented an explosion. Possibly suspecting what was going on within  the tent, he called Humpy. Linda pricked up her ears at the sound.</p>
<p>Humpy ducked for the door. &ldquo;If  there&rsquo;s anything you want don&rsquo;t be afraid to sing out, Governor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson slowly resumed his  normal colour. He made no reference to what had happened except to say  severely: &ldquo;Belinda, I&rsquo;m surprised at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t be stuffy, father,&rdquo;  returned his daughter, inelegantly.</p>
<p>The members of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s suite  were accustomed to these little passages.</p>
<p>When they issued from the tent  Jack Chanty and Humpy were to be seen supping cheek by jowl beside the fire,  and Linda said with a flash of intuition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound, they&rsquo;re having a  better supper than we had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was only guessing, but as a  matter of fact, in the case of a party as large as this, there are bound to be  tidbits, such as a prairie-chicken, a fish or a rabbit, not sufficient to  furnish the general table, and these naturally fall to the share of the cook  and his chum.</p>
<p>Afterward, while the Indians  washed the dishes Jack smoked and Humpy talked. Humpy was the kind of innocent  braggart that tells tall tales about nothing at all. He was grateful to Jack  for even the appearance of listening, and Jack in turn was glad of the prattle  that enabled him to keep his face while he thought his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last winter when the steamboat  was laid up,&rdquo; said Humpy Jull, &ldquo;I was teaming for the company down to Fort  Ochre. Say, it&rsquo;s wild country around there. The fellers advised me not to leave  my gun behind when I druv into the bush for poles. One day I was eatin&rsquo; my  lunch on a log in the bush when I hear a grizzily bear growl, right behind me.  Yes, sir, a ding-gasted grizzily. I didn&rsquo;t see him. I didn&rsquo;t wait. I knew it  was a grizzily bear because the fellers say them&rsquo;s the on&rsquo;y kind that  growls-like. Say, my skin crawled on me like insec&rsquo;s walkin&rsquo; on my bare bones.  I never stop runnin&rsquo; till I get back to the fort. The hosses come in by  themselves. Oh, I let &rsquo;em laugh. I tell you I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no chances with a  grizzily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack, for the first time  in his life, was obliged to face a moral crisis. Other threatening crises  hitherto he had managed to evade with youth&rsquo;s characteristic ingenuity in  side-stepping the disagreeable. The first time that a young brain is held up in  its happy-go-lucky career, and forced to think, is bound to be a painful  experience.</p>
<p>Up to now Jack had taken his good  name for granted. </p>
<p>He had run away when he felt like  it, meaning to go back when he was ready. Now, when he found it smirched he  realized what an important thing a good name was. He raged in his mind, and  justly at the man who had destroyed it; nevertheless a small voice whispered to  him that it was partly his own fault. For the first time, too, he realized that  his name was not his exclusive property; his father and mother had a share in  it, though they were no longer of the world. He thought too of the streets of  the city that was so dear to him, now filled with people who believed that  Malcolm Piers was a thief.</p>
<p>The simplest thing was not to  think about it at all, but go direct to Frank Garrod, and &ldquo;have it out&rdquo; with  him. But Jack was obliged to recognize that this was no solution. Every time he  had drawn near to Frank since the afternoon, Frank had cringed and shown his  fangs like a sick animal, disgusting Jack, and making it impossible for him to  speak to Frank in any connection. A look in Frank&rsquo;s desperate eyes was enough  to show the futility of an appeal to his better feelings. &ldquo;Besides, I couldn&rsquo;t  beg him to set me right,&rdquo; Jack thought, his hands clenching, and the vein on  his forehead swelling.</p>
<p>Force then suggested itself as the  only recourse, and the natural one to Jack&rsquo;s direct nature. This was no good  either. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sick man,&rdquo; Jack thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand up to me. If I  struck him&mdash;&rdquo; A cold fear touched his heart at the thought that he had no way in  the world of proving himself honest, except by means of a free and voluntary  statement from a man who was obviously breaking, and even now scarcely sane.</p>
<p>The problem was too difficult for  Jack to solve. He found himself wishing for an older head to put it to. More  than once his thoughts turned to the wiser and older lady in Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  party, to whom he had not yet spoken. &ldquo;I wish I could make friends with her,&rdquo;  he thought.</p>
<p>The second day on the trail was  largely a repetition of the first. The routine of making and breaking camp  proceeded more smoothly, that was all. On this day as they rose over and  descended the endless shallow hills of the prairie, the snow-capped peaks of  the Rockies rose into view off to the west.</p>
<p>Jack and Frank Garrod held no  communication throughout the day. Garrod showed an increased disorder in his  dress, and a more furtive manner. On the trail there were no secretarial duties  to perform, and he kept out of the way of the other white members of the party.  He had always been considered queer, and his increased queerness passed  unnoticed except by Jack, who held the clue, and by Jean Paul Ascota. The  half-breed watched Jack, watched Garrod, and drew his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Jean Paul on the face of things  was turning out an admirable servant, capable, industrious, and respectful. The  white men, including Jack, would have been greatly-astonished could they have  heard the substance of his low-voiced talk to the Indian lads around their own  fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I held my hand,&rdquo; he said in Cree,  &ldquo;because the time is not come to strike. One must suffer much and be patient  for the cause. But I have not forgotten. Before I am through with him, Jack  shall be kicked out of camp, and then he shall die. My medicine works slowly,  but it is very sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is only one white man,&rdquo; he  went on. With an ignorant, easily swayed, savage audience Jean Paul was superb  in his effect of quiet intensity. &ldquo;I will not let him spoil my plans against  the race. The time is almost ripe now. I have visited the great tribe of the  Blackfeet in the south. They are as many as the round stones in the bars when  the big river is low. I have talked with the head men. They are ready. I have  visited the Sarcees, the Stonies, the Bloods, and the Piegans; all are ready  when I give the word. And are we not ready in the North, too? the Crees, the  Beavers, the Sapis, the Kakisas, and all the peoples across the mountain. When  Ascota sends out his messengers a fire shall sweep across the country that will  consume every white man to soft ashes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it went night after night.  The four lads listened scowling, a hot sense of the wrongs of the red race  burning in each breast. But it was like a fire in the grass, blazing up only to  expire. They fell asleep and forgot all about it until Jean Paul talked again.  Perhaps they sensed somehow that Jean Paul talked to them largely for the  satisfaction he got out of his own eloquence.</p>
<p>To-night Jean Paul was watching  Garrod. By and by Garrod wandered away from the campfires, and Jean Paul  followed. Garrod mooned aimlessly around the tents with his head sunk on his  breast, zigzagging to and fro in the grass, flinging himself down, only to get  up and walk again. For a long time Jean Paul watched and followed him,  crouching in the grass in the semi-darkness. Finally Garrod sat down at the  edge of the coulee, and Jean Paul approached him openly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine night,&rdquo; he said with an  off-hand air.</p>
<p>Garrod murmured an  indistinguishable reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, I lak&rsquo; to walk in the night  the same as you,&rdquo; Jean Paul went on in a voice indescribably smooth and  insinuating. He sat beside the other man. &ldquo;I lak&rsquo; sit by one black hole lak&rsquo;  this and look. It is so deep! You feel bad?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head,&rdquo; murmured Garrod. &ldquo;It  gives me no rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Jean Paul. &ldquo;I cure you.  With my people I what you call doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctors can&rsquo;t do me any good,&rdquo;  Garrod muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, I not the same lak&rsquo; other  doctors,&rdquo; said Jean Paul calmly. &ldquo;First, I tell you  what&rsquo;s the matter. Your body not sick; it&rsquo;s your, what you call, your soul.&rdquo;  Garrod looked at him with a start.</p>
<p>Jean Paul lowered his voice. &ldquo;You  hate!&rdquo; he hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What damn nonsense is this?&rdquo; said  Garrod tremblingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use to make believe?&rdquo;  said Jean Paul with a shrug. &ldquo;I doctor &mdash; conjuror they call me. I know. You  know what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod weakened. &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know because same way I hate,&rdquo;  said Jean Paul softly.</p>
<p>Garrod breathed fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we put our hates together?&rdquo;  murmured Jean Paul.</p>
<p>But there was still life in  Garrod&rsquo;s pride of race. &ldquo;This is foolishness,&rdquo; he said contemptuously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  talking wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul shrugged. &ldquo;Ver&rsquo; good,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;You know to-morrow or some day. There is plentee time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of my way,&rdquo; said Garrod.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The darkness swallowed Jean Paul&rsquo;s  smile. He murmured velvetly: &ldquo;Me, I t&rsquo;ink you lak&rsquo; ver&rsquo; moch sleep to-night.  Sleep all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod partly broke down. &ldquo;Oh, my  God!&rdquo; he murmured, dropping his head on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got your pipe?&rdquo; asked Jean  Paul. &ldquo;Give me, and I fill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What with?&rdquo; demanded Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little weed I pick,&rdquo; said Jean  Paul. &ldquo;No hurt anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Garrod handing over  his pipe with a jerk of bitter laughter; &ldquo;if it does for me, so much the  better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul drew a little buckskin  bag from an inner pocket, and filled the pipe with herb leaves that crackled as  he pressed them into the bowl. Handing it back, he struck a match. Garrod  puffed with an air of bravado, and a subtle, pungent odour spread around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a rotten taste,&rdquo; said  Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not smoke that for taste,&rdquo;  said Jean Paul.</p>
<p>For several minutes nothing was  said. Garrod nursed the pipe, taking the smoke with deeper, slower inhalations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he murmured at  length. There was unspeakable relief, relaxation, ease, in his voice.</p>
<p>Jean Paul watched him narrowly.  Garrod&rsquo;s figure slowly drooped, and the hand that carried the pipe to his mouth  became uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got enough,&rdquo; said Jean Paul  suddenly. &ldquo;Come along. You can&rsquo;t sleep here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod protested sleepily, but the  half-breed jerked him to his feet, and supporting him under one arm, directed  his wavering, spastic footsteps back to the tents. Garrod shared a small tent  with Vassall and Baldwin Ferrie. One end opened to the general tent, the other  was accessible from outdoors. Jean Paul looked in; it was empty, and the flap  on the inner side was down. In the big tent they were playing cards.</p>
<p>Garrod collapsed in a heap. Jean  Paul deftly undressed him, and, rolling him in his blanket, left him dead to  the world. Before leaving the tent he carefully knocked the ashes out of the  pipe, and dropped it in the pocket of Garrod&rsquo;s coat. Immediately afterward Jean  Paul in his neat black habit showed himself in the light of the fire. Sitting,  he was seen to gravely adjust a pair of rimmed spectacles (his eyes were like a  lynx&rsquo;s!) and apply himself to his daily chapter of the Testament before turning  in.</p>
<p>In the morning Garrod awoke with a  splitting head and a bad taste in his mouth. However, that seemed a small price  to pay for nine hours of blessed forgetfulness.</p>
<p>There followed another day of  prairie travel. Sir Bryson, when he wished to communicate with Jack, made  Garrod his emissary, so that the two were obliged to meet and talk. On the  approach of Garrod, Jack merely sucked in his lip, and stuck closely to the  business of the day. These meetings were dreadful to Garrod. Only an indication  of what he went through can be given. In the condition he was in he had to  avoid the sharp-eyed Linda, and he was obliged to stand aside and see her ride  off with Jack out of sight of the rest of the train. By nightfall his nerves were  in strings again.</p>
<p>On this night after supper Jean  Paul took pains to avoid him. Garrod was finally obliged to go to the Indians&rsquo;  fire after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jean Paul, I want to  speak to you,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
<p>Jean Paul, closing the book and  taking off the spectacles with great deliberation, followed Garrod out of  earshot of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say give me another pipeful of  that dope, Jean Paul,&rdquo; Garrod said in a conciliatory tone.</p>
<p>The half-breed had dropped his  smooth air. &ldquo;Ha! You come after it to-night,&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it! I&rsquo;ll pay you for it,&rdquo;  snarled Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My medicine not for sale,&rdquo;  replied Jean Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine?&rdquo; sneered Garrod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give you five dollars for the little bagful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten! Twenty, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul merely smiled.</p>
<p>A white man could not possibly  humble himself any further to a redskin. Garrod, with a miserable attempt at  bravado, shrugged and turned away. Jean Paul stood looking after him, smiling.  Garrod had not taken five paces before a fresh realization of the horrors of  the night to come turned his pride to water. He came swiftly back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were a doctor,&rdquo; he  said in a breaking voice. &ldquo;Good God! can&rsquo;t you see what it means to me! I&rsquo;ve  got to have it! I&rsquo;ve got to have it! I can&rsquo;t live through another night without  sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Las&rsquo; night you tol&rsquo; me to kip  away from you,&rdquo; drawled Jean Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Jean Paul,&rdquo; begged  Garrod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you all the money I have for it. A pipeful for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul continued to smile, and,  turning, went back to the fire, and took out his Testament.</p>
<p>Garrod did live through the night,  and the day that followed, but at the approach of another night, white man as  he was, he delivered himself over to Jean Paul Ascota, the half-breed, body and  soul. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>VII<br>
  An Emotional Crisis</b></h3>
<p>Toward the end of the fourth day  the pack-train wound down a hill to Fort Geikie, and they saw the great river  again, that they had been following all the way, but at some distance from the  bank. Fort Geikie was no more than a couple of log shacks maintained during the  winters as an outpost for trading with the Indians. At present the shacks were  boarded up, and the Indians ranging away to the north and the west.</p>
<p>The prairie came to an abrupt end  here, and immediately before them rose the steep foothills, with the mountains  proper looking over their heads behind. Around a point off to the left the  river issued foaming from between grim, hewn walls of rock. Up and down river  it was called significantly, &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Back door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Opening,&rdquo; it followed, was  at the other end of the canyon. For upward of twenty miles between the river  roared down in unchecked fury, grinding the drift-logs to shreds.</p>
<p>The log shacks stood in the middle  of another grassy esplanade, but here elevated high above the river. The party  camped on the edge of the steep bank, with a lovely prospect visible from the  tent openings. The river was swifter and much narrower here; far below them lay  a thin island, and beyond, the river stretched away like a broad silver ribbon  among its hills, the whole mellowed and glowing in the late sunshine.</p>
<p>As soon as the horses were turned  out Jack made his way to Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>The governor led him into the  tent. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, seating himself, and carefully matching his finger-tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My instructions were to take you  to the big canyon,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Here we are at the lower end of it. Do you want  to make a permanent camp here, or to push farther on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson.  Producing a paper from his pocket, he spread it on the table. Jack saw that it  was a handmade map. &ldquo;The lower end of the canyon,&rdquo; he repeated to himself.  &ldquo;That will be here,&rdquo; and he put his finger on a spot.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s natural impulse was to walk  around the table, and look at the map over Sir Bryson&rsquo;s shoulder. As he did so,  Sir Bryson snatched it up, and held it against his breast like a child whose  toy is threatened by another child.</p>
<p>Jack, with a reddening face,  retired around the table again. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said stiffly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t  know it was private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson reddened too, and  murmured something indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Suddenly it came to Jack that he  had seen the map before, and a smile twitched the corners of his lips. Since  Sir Bryson wished to make a great secret of it, all right &mdash; he, Jack, was not  obliged to tell all he knew.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson did not see the smile.  He was studying the map again. &ldquo;How far is it to the top of the canyon?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve miles,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;The  trail, as you see, cuts across a bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a good place to camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than here. First-rate  water, grass, and wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we cross the river if we wish  to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are any number of boats  cached along the shore. Everybody bound downstream has to leave his boat  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move on to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack joined Humpy Jull he  said briefly: &ldquo;I was right. The old boy is travelling by Beckford and Rowe&rsquo;s  map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him what they were?&rdquo;  asked Humpy, all agog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack coolly. &ldquo;He  wouldn&rsquo;t have thanked me. He&rsquo;ll find it out himself in a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nerve of it,&rdquo; said Humpy,  tremendously impressed, &ldquo;to play the governor himself for a sucker! There&rsquo;ll be  the deuce to pay when it all comes out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible for Jack&rsquo;s  spirits to remain permanently depressed. To-night, after a long silence, the  banjo and the insinuating baritone were heard for a while by the fire. At the  sound, Linda, in the big tent, changed colour. The ladies still dressed for  dinner as far as they could, and Linda, with her elaborate hair arrangement,  the pearls in her ears, and the rings on her fingers, made an odd urban figure  to be here on the lonely plains.</p>
<p>Her attention wandered, and  finally she committed the capital crime of bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve revoked!&rdquo; cried Sir Bryson  aghast, &ldquo;when the game and the rubber were ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not much cast down by her  parent&rsquo;s reproaches. &ldquo;Kate, take my hand,&rdquo; she said cajolingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no head  for the game to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They changed places, and Linda  carried her chair outside the door of the tent. The cook-fire was only some  twenty paces distant, and she saw Jack in his favourite attitude, the small of  his back supported against a log, and the banjo across his thighs. The admiring  Humpy Jull sat on the other end of the log, whittling a stick.</p>
<p>Jack saw her come out, and he felt  the call that she sent him. He drew in his upper lip a little, and stayed where  he was. He would have been glad enough to go of his own volition, but the hint  of coercion made him stubborn. Linda was finally obliged to retire beaten.</p>
<p>Next morning the pack-train  climbed the steep hill that barred the way, traversed the ancient portage  around the canyon, and finally camped beside the river again in a little  clearing that has been a camping-place since before the white men found  America. Looking across to the left, a smooth wall of rock seemed to bar the  river&rsquo;s progress; an ominous hoarse roar issued from its foot. All around them  rose moderate mountain heights green to their summits; farther upstream were  the first-class peaks.</p>
<p>After lunch a riding-party to High  Rock, down the canyon, was talked about. Long afterward Jack remembered that it  had first been suggested by Jean Paul, who volunteered to put the camp in order  while they were away. All the whites set out except Humpy Jull. Garrod  accompanied the others.</p>
<p>A change had come over Garrod, a  comfortable daze taking the place of the wild, harassed look in his eyes. He  rode apparently without seeing or caring where. He and Jean Paul had ridden  together all morning, and it was observable that the white&rsquo;s man eyes followed  all the movements of the Indian in a mechanical way. The two were rapidly  becoming inseparable. No thought of danger to himself from this connection  occurred to Jack. By this time he had forgotten the scene at Fort Cheever.</p>
<p>They first visited &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s  Opening&rdquo; on foot, having to climb over a tangle of great trunks cast high on  the rocks by the freshets. One of the great sights of earth rewarded them. The  mighty river, a thousand feet wide above, plunged through a cleft in the rock  that a child could have tossed a stone across, and, pent within its close, dark  walls, swept down with a deep, throaty roar.</p>
<p>The beholders remarked upon it  according to their several natures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Sidney Vassall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tertiary rocks of the Cambrian  period,&rdquo; said Baldwin Ferrie, or whatever they were.</p>
<p>Garrod looked with lack-lustre  eyes, and said nothing.</p>
<p>Linda looked at Jack. Seeing that  he was genuinely moved by the sight, familiar as it was to him, she began to  enthuse. It sounded overdone to Jack, and he turned on his heel.</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley looked at it with  shining eyes, and said nothing.</p>
<p>As they rode on it commenced to  rain softly, and Sir Bryson was for returning. His daughter opposed him, and  all the others rallied to her support. Garrod in particular, though he seemed  to have no interest by the way, was dead set against giving up the expedition.  They rode through a magnificent, untouched forest. The cool gloom, the slow  drip of the leaves, and the delicious fragrance of the wet greenery created an  effect the impressionable ones in the party were not soon to forget. Sir Bryson  grumbled.</p>
<p>In one of the various  rearrangements of the party Jack found that Mrs. Worsley was riding next behind  him. Swinging around, he talked to her, hanging sideways over his saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has passed this way this  year,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you know the path  at all,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I can see nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack explained the blazes on the  trees. &ldquo;Beyond the next creek I blazed a trail myself last year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The  old trail was too steep for white men&rsquo;s horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the country well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if this bit was my  own,&rdquo; he said, with a look around.</p>
<p>Crossing a little stream he  pointed out the remains of a sluice and cradle, and explained their uses to  her. &ldquo;Joe Casey had his camp on that little hill two years ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck did he have?&rdquo; she  asked.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;But we all  know the stuff&rsquo;s somewhere about,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Kate Worsley was able in turn to  tell Jack something about the showy plants they passed, and a bird or two.  Jack&rsquo;s knowledge of the flora and fauna was limited strictly to what would  serve a man for fuel or food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this life would suit  you, too,&rdquo; he said, approving her strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it would,&rdquo; she said  with a smile, &ldquo;if there was any place for such as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would soon make a place,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>Linda, following Mrs. Worsley in  the trail, wondered jealously why Jack never unbent with her like that.</p>
<p>Though they were never out of  hearing of its thunderous voice, they had no sight of the canyon again until  they suddenly issued out on the High Rock, five miles from camp. A superb view  arrested them. The trail came out on a flat, overhanging table rock two hundred  feet above the water. The spot was in the middle of a wide bend in the walls of  the canyon, and they could therefore see both up and down, over the ragged  white torrent in the bottom.</p>
<p>This was their destination. To  dismount they had to cross the rock to a stretch of grass beyond. They  instinctively lingered first for a look. Jack, Mrs. Worsley, Linda, Vassall,  Sir Bryson, and Baldwin Ferrie lined up in that order, taking care to hold  their horses in a safe eight or ten feet back from the naked edge. Looking down  river afforded the finest prospect; here the steep, brown walls fell back a  little, and in the middle of the torrent rose a tall rock island, like a tower,  crowned with noble spruce trees.</p>
<p>Garrod, who had dropped behind the  others, now came out from among the trees on to the flat rock. His horse  appeared to be fretting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better dismount and lead him  across,&rdquo; Jack flung over his shoulder.</p>
<p>If Jack had looked squarely at  Garrod the look in the man&rsquo;s eyes would surely have caused him to draw back  himself and dismount. But he was intent at the moment in pointing out a seam of  coal in the face of the rock opposite.</p>
<p>None of them could ever tell  exactly what happened after that. Garrod did not dismount, but attempted to  ride across behind the others through the narrow space between their horses and  the thickly growing trees. Jack was sitting loose in his saddle with an arm  extended. Suddenly his horse shrank and quivered beneath him. With a snort of  pain and terror the animal sprang forward, reared on the edge of the rock,  attempted desperately to turn on his hind legs &mdash; and, with his rider,  disappeared.</p>
<p>They heard breaking branches  below, and a moment later a dull crash on the rocks far beneath. No sound  escaped from any member of the party. The awful silhouette of the rearing horse  on the edge of nothing had frozen them into grotesque attitudes of horror, and  they looked at the empty place as if they saw it still. Finally Vassall swore  in a strange, soft voice, and Sir Bryson began to babble. Their horses,  infected by the terror of their riders, suddenly turned of one accord, and  shouldered each other off the rock to the grassy terrace at one side. Garrod  slipped out of his saddle and lay inert. The horses that followed jumped over  his body.</p>
<p>One by one the others half-rolled,  half-slipped out of their saddles. Linda Trangmar was the first to reach the  ground, and it was she who crawled back over the rock like a lithe little  animal, and looked over the hideous edge. She saw that several spruce trees  grew out obliquely from a ledge beneath the rock, and that horse and rider had  fallen through the tops of these. Far below she saw the lump of dead horseflesh  on the rocks. It had struck, and rolled down a steep incline to the water&rsquo;s  edge.</p>
<p>The three men watched her,  trembling and helpless. Sir Bryson&rsquo;s legs failed him, and he sat abruptly in  the grass. Kate Worsley crawled toward Linda on her hands and knees, and  attempted to draw her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away, come away,&rdquo; she  whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be!&rdquo; said Linda sharply.  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found him yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a piercing scream broke  from Linda. Kate, by main force, snatched her back from the edge of the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; cried Linda. She  clung to Kate, weeping and laughing together.</p>
<p>They thought it was merely  hysteria. Vassall, extending his body on the rock, looked over. He got up  again, and shook his head.</p>
<p>High Rock was the highest point of  the cliff on the side where they stood. The stretch of grass where the horses  were now quietly feeding inclined gently down from the flat table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; screamed Linda,  pointing.</p>
<p>Following the direction of her  finger, they saw Jack&rsquo;s head and shoulders rise above the edge of the grass.  Pulling himself up, he came toward them. He sat in the grass and wiped his  face. He was terribly shaken, but he would never confess it. His pallor he  could not control. All this had occurred in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The men gathered around him, their  questions tumbling out on each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not hurt,&rdquo; said Jack,  steadying his speech word by word. &ldquo;I slipped out of the saddle as we went  over, and I caught a spruce tree. I had only to climb down the trunk and walk  along the ledge to the grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their questions disconcerted him.  He got up, and coolly throwing himself down at the edge of the rock, looked  over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back! Come back!&rdquo; moaned  Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor brute!&rdquo; Jack said, turning  away.</p>
<p>As he came back, Linda, straining  away from Kate&rsquo;s encircling arms, bent imploring eyes on him. Jack looked at  her and stopped. Instead of the worldly little coquette he had thought her up  to now, he saw a woman offering him her soul through her eyes. The sight  disturbed and thrilled him. It came at a moment of high emotional tension. He  gave her his eyes back again, and for moments their glances embraced, careless  of the others around. Had it not been for Kate&rsquo;s tight clasp, Linda would have  cast herself into his arms on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have startled your  horse?&rdquo; Sir Bryson asked for the dozenth time, breaking the spell.</p>
<p>Jack shrugged. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Garrod?&rdquo;  he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Garrod had completely passed out  of their minds. They found him lying in the grass a little to one side. He had  fainted. It provided a distraction to their shaken nerves, and gradually a  measure of calmness returned to them all. Kate Worsley and Vassall worked over  Garrod. Jack, who felt a strong repugnance to touching him, rode back for water  to the last stream they had crossed.</p>
<p>When Garrod returned to  consciousness the shock to his confused faculties of seeing Jack standing in  front of him, and his mingled remorse and relief, were all very painful to see.  He babbled explanations, apologies, self-accusations; none of them could make  out what it all amounted to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jack turning away.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you. I should have made everybody dismount at once. It was my  own fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time he honestly believed  it.</p>
<p>It was a very much sobered  procession that wound back to camp. As they climbed the side of one of the  steep gullies, leading their horses, Jack and Linda found themselves together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, it gives you a queer  start to fall through space,&rdquo; said Jack with a grim smile. &ldquo;I never lived so  fast in my life. Down below I saw every separate stone that was waiting to  smash me. And in that one second before I grabbed the tree I remembered  everything that had happened to me since I was a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; she  murmured, turning away her head. At the same time a little spring of gladness  welled in her breast, for it was the first time that he had ever dropped his  guard with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care?&rdquo; he said, off-hand.  &ldquo;I thought you were the kind that didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flashed a look at him. &ldquo;Would  you have me the same to everybody?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He lifted her on her horse in the  way that had suggested itself to him as most natural. It was not according to  the fashionable conventions of riding, but Linda liked it. Her hand fell on his  round, hard shoulder under the flannel shirt, and she bore upon it heavier than  she need. They rode on with beating hearts, avoiding each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>It signified only that their  combined ages made something less than fifty, and that each was highly pleasing  in the eyes of the other sex. His scornful air had piqued her from the first,  and he had seen her hard eyes soften for him at a high-pitched moment. Young  people would be saved a deal of trouble if the romantic idea were not so  assiduously inculcated that these feelings are irrevocable.</p>
<p>In camp after supper they found  each other again. &ldquo;Too bad about the mosquitoes,&rdquo; said Jack a little  sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, making the big  eyes of innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place we can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit under your mosquito  bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack gasped a little, and looked  at her with sidelong eyes. True, his tent had no front to it and the firelight  illumined every corner, still it was a man&rsquo;s abode. Linda herself conceived a  lively picture of the consternation of Sir Bryson and his suite if they knew,  but they were good for an hour or more at the card-table, and, anyway, this was  the kind of young lady that opposition, even in prospect, drives headlong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humpy Jull will chaperon us,&rdquo; she  said demurely. &ldquo;You can sing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Linda sat in the middle of the  tent, with a man on either hand, and the fire glowing before them. Jack  reclined on the end of his spine as usual, with the banjo in his lap. The  spirit of at least one of his hearers was lifted up on the simple airs he sung.  An instinct prompted him to avoid the obviously sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exact to appointment I went to  the grove<br>
  To meet my fair Phillis and tell tales of love;<br>
  But judge of my anguish, my rage and despair,<br>
  When I found on arrival no Phillis was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between songs Linda, in the  immemorial way of women, made conversation with the man of the two present in  which she was not interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like to look for  pictures in the fire, Mr. Jull?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I like to look at  pitchers,&rdquo; returned Humpy innocently. &ldquo;But there ain&rsquo;t never no pitchers in  camp. I like the move-&rsquo;em pitchers best. When I was out to the Landing last  year I used to go ev&rsquo;y night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was partly hidden from Humpy  by Linda. Tempted by the hand that lay on the ground beside him, he caught it  up and pressed it to his lips. When he sang again, the same hand, while its  owner looked innocently ahead of her, groped for and found his curly head. At  the touch of it Jack&rsquo;s voice trembled richly in his throat.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt=""  src="1600881h-images/page114.png" width="500" height="750"><a name="114"></a></p>
<p>When she thought the rubber of  rubbers would be nearing its end Linda made Jack take her back. Walking across  the narrow space their shoulders pressed warmly together. They walked very  slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have told you my  name,&rdquo; murmured Jack uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Malcolm, dear,&rdquo; she  breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; he demanded,  greatly astonished.</p>
<p>She twined her fingers inside his.  &ldquo;I guessed, silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t take the money,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you did,&rdquo; she  murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, unconvinced  and uncaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t begin that,&rdquo; she said  swiftly. &ldquo;This is to-night, and we&rsquo;re together. Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the tents. Of one  accord they turned aside, and in the shadow of the canvas she came naturally  into his arms, and he kissed her, thrilling deliciously. The delicate fragrance  of her enraptured his senses. It was light love, lightly sealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me again,&rdquo; she murmured on  her deepest note. &ldquo;Kiss me often, and don&rsquo;t bother about the future!&rdquo; </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>VIII<br>
  The Feminine Equation</b></h3>
<p>Jack turned in filled with a  nagging sense of discomfort. He felt dimly that he ought to have been happy,  but it was very clear that he was not. It was all very well for her to say:  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about the future,&rdquo; but his stubborn mind was not to be so easily  satisfied. It was true he had not committed himself in so many words, but with  girls of Linda&rsquo;s kind he supposed a kiss was final. So the future had to be  considered. It was now more than ever imperative that his name be cleared. She  didn&rsquo;t seem to care much whether he were honest or not. There was the rub. He  scowled, and rolled over to woo sleep on the other side.</p>
<p>In the end he fell asleep, and  dreamed a fantastic dream. He was King David, wearing a long gray beard and a  white gown. He was at sea in a motor-sailboat of extraordinary construction,  having a high, ornate cabin, over which the boom had to be lifted whenever they  came about. There was a beturbaned lascar at the tiller, whom he, King David,  treated with great contumely. Linda was along, too, also clad in biblical  costume with a silver band around her brow. She was strangely meek, and she  plucked continually at his sleeve.</p>
<p>A great storm came up; the waves  tossed, the boat was knocked about, and he couldn&rsquo;t get a spark in his engine.  He suspected that the lascar knew much better than he what to do, but out of  sheer, kingly wilfulness he went contrary to everything the brown man suggested.  Nor would he heed the insistent plucking at his sleeve.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a mermaid uprose  bedside the boat, and the sea was miraculously stilled. Her long, black, silky  hair hung before her face, and streamed over her deep bosom and her lovely  arms. All would be well if he could but distinguish her face, he felt. He  leaned farther and farther over the rail, while the fretful plucking at his  sleeve continued. He implored the mermaid to push back her hair.</p>
<p>Then he awoke. Some one <i>was</i> pulling at his sleeve, and a voice  was whispering: &ldquo;Jack, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to a sitting position,  throwing out his arms. They closed around a bony little frame encased in a  rough coat. He recoiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; said the small  voice.</p>
<p>The fire had burned down to dull  embers, and Jack at first could see nothing. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Davy Cranston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davy Cranston?&rdquo; repeated Jack. It  was a moment or two before his dream-muddled brain conceived the identity that  went under this name. &ldquo;What does this mean? What do you want? How did you get  here?&rdquo; he demanded in great surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mary said we had to come,&rdquo;  the boy replied abashed.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s name had the effect of  ringing a bell in Jack&rsquo;s understanding. &ldquo;Mary? Where is she?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re camped up on the bench,&rdquo;  the boy replied. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s waiting for us. Come to our camp, and we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was ready in a moment, and  they set off. The afterglow was under the north star, and by that Jack knew it  was midnight. The camp was wrapped in perfect stillness. When they got clear,  and began to climb the trail, a little fiery eye beckoned them ahead.</p>
<p>In answer to Jack&rsquo;s further  questions the boy could only reply that &ldquo;Mary had a warning,&rdquo; which only  heightened the questioner&rsquo;s wonder and curiosity.</p>
<p>The camp was pitched on the edge  of the low bench above the river-flat, and they saw her, from a little  distance, crouching by the fire that made a little crimson glory under the  branches. She was listening with bent head to hear if there was one pair of  footsteps approaching or two. Behind her the two little A-tents were pitched  side by side, their open doors like mouths yawning in the firelight.</p>
<p>As they came within radius of the  light she lifted her face, and Jack without knowing why he should be, was  staggered by the look in her deep eyes, an indescribable look, suggesting pain  proudly borne, and present gladness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo; she murmured,  searching for what she might read in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely!&rdquo; said Jack wonderingly.  Further speech failed him. The sight of her threw him into a great uneasiness  that he was at a loss to account for. She was nothing to him, he told himself a  little angrily. But he could not keep his eyes off her. She had changed. She  looked as if her spirit had travelled a long way these few days and learned  many difficult lessons on the road. She had an effect on him as of something he  had never seen before, yet something he had been waiting for without knowing  it. And this was only Mary Cranston that he thought he knew!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a danger,&rdquo; she said quietly.  &ldquo;I did not know if we would be in time to save &mdash; to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger? Save me?&rdquo; Jack repeated,  looking at her stupidly. &ldquo;Good God! How did you know that?&rdquo; he presently added.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s agitation broke through her  self-contained air. To hide it she hastily busied herself picking up the  dishes, and packing them in the grub-box. Fastening the box with its leather  hasp, she carried it into her tent. She did not immediately reappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; Jack  demanded of Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swan Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been there ever since  you left the fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded. &ldquo;Tom Moosehorn&rsquo;s  three children got the measles,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They are pitching at Swan Lake.  Tom came to the fort to ask my father for medicine, and when Mary heard that  his children were sick, she said she would go and nurse them, because Tom&rsquo;s  wife is a foolish squaw, and don&rsquo;t know what to do for sickness. And I went to  take care of Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Swan Lake?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northwest of the fort, two days&rsquo;  journey,&rdquo; said Davy. &ldquo;We were there a week, and then the kids got well. On the  way back home Mary had a warning. She said she felt a danger threatening you.&rdquo;  Shyness overcame the boy here. &ldquo;You &mdash; you were friendly to us,&rdquo; he stammered.  &ldquo;So we wanted to come to you. We didn&rsquo;t know where you were, but Mary said the  warning came from the south, so we left the trail, and hit straight across the  prairie till we came to the river trail. There we found your tracks, and  followed them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warning!&rdquo; said Jack, amazed.  &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the boy said  simply. &ldquo;Mary has them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary returned to the fire with a  composed face. All three of the youngsters were embarrassed for speech. How  could they find words to fit the strange feelings that agitated them.</p>
<p>Jack, gazing at Mary&rsquo;s graceful  pose, on her knees by the fire, suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, it was you, all the  time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a mermaid?&rdquo; Davy wanted to  know.</p>
<p>Mary answered before Jack could.  &ldquo;An imaginary creature, half woman, half fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you know?&rdquo; asked  Jack unthinkingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I know nothing?&rdquo; she  said, with the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>He had the grace to redden.</p>
<p>They made Jack tell them his  dream. They laughed, and the tension was relieved. They were all grateful for  something else to talk about. There was one thing in the dream that Jack left  out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the woman who kept  pulling at your sleeve?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>
<p>Jack lied. &ldquo;Nobody I know,&rdquo; he  said lightly. &ldquo;One of King David&rsquo;s five hundred wives, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy laughed, but Mary looked  affronted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re confusing David with Solomon,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
<p>Jack looked at her uneasily. This  was she whom he had dismissed merely as one of the girls of the country!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he sat up and hugged me as if  I was a girl,&rdquo; Davy put in with relish.</p>
<p>Jack and Mary looked away from  each other and blushed, but for different reasons.</p>
<p>They could not long keep away from  the subject that filled their minds. &ldquo;Blest if I can understand it,&rdquo; murmured  Jack.</p>
<p>They knew to what he referred.  &ldquo;Nobody can,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had this warning  several days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing happened to me three days  ago. Nothing until to-day &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was an accident,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;My horse shied on High Rock, and jumped over the ledge. I caught on a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes brooded over him, and  her hands went to still her breast. &ldquo;Was there any one behind you?&rsquo;&rsquo; she asked  quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Garrod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was no accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared at the fire. &ldquo;Perhaps  not,&rdquo; he said slowly. After a while he added. &ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the people have such  warnings,&rdquo; Mary said quietly.</p>
<p>Jack frowned. &ldquo;You are not a  savage,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are one fourth Indian,&rdquo; Mary  said with a kind of relentless pride. &ldquo;It is silly to make-believe that we&rsquo;re  not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack went on to tell them in  detail what had happened during the day, suppressing, however, all that related  to Linda. One thing led to another; he could hardly have explained how it came  about, but Mary&rsquo;s eyes drew out what he had believed was locked deep in his  heart, the story of his early days, and of Garrod&rsquo;s treachery that he had just  found out. Sister and brother had little to say to the story, but their shining  eyes conveyed unquestioning loyal assurance to him. It needed no words to tell  him they knew he was no thief. Jack experienced a sense of relief such as he  had not felt since the moment of his making the ugly discovery. When he  considered the net of circumstance that bound him round sometimes he was almost  ready himself to doubt his honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something  behind,&rdquo; Mary murmured. &ldquo;It was the day you found him out that I had my  warning. I&rsquo;m glad we came. Maybe we can help you&rdquo; &mdash;she looked at him  questioningly &mdash; &ldquo;if you will let us stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you like,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my idea we&rsquo;ll all be turning back in a couple of days. In the meantime Davy can  help with the horses. We&rsquo;re short-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we camp here by  ourselves?&rdquo; asked Mary quickly.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;It would  look queer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had better ride into our camp in the morning as if  you&rsquo;d just come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary presently sent him home. The  fire had paled, and the trees began to rise out of the graves of darkness at  the touch of the ghostly wand of dawn. The youngsters&rsquo; pale and slightly  haggard faces had a strange look to each other like things that had been left  over from yesterday by mistake, and were hopelessly out of place this morning.</p>
<p>Jack lingered awkwardly. &ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thanked you for coming. I don&rsquo;t know how. But  you know what I feel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sister and brother looked  exquisitely uncomfortable, and absurdly alike. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be thanked  for,&rdquo; murmured Mary. &ldquo;Of course we came! That&rsquo;s what I had the warning for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands. Mary&rsquo;s hand lay  for an instant in Jack&rsquo;s passive and cold. But later she pillowed her cheek on  that hand because he had touched it.</p>
<p>The permanent camp, that Sir  Bryson had graciously permitted to be called Camp Trangmar, had been laid out  with considerably more care than their nightly stopping-places. The main tent,  with its three little wings, was erected at the top of the clearing, facing the  river. A canvas had been stretched in front to make a veranda. On the  right-hand side of the open square was Humpy&rsquo;s cooking outfit under another awning,  with Humpy&rsquo;s tent and Jack&rsquo;s lean-to beyond. Across the square was Jean Paul&rsquo;s  little tent and the ragged brown canvas that sheltered the Indians. The camp  was ditched and drained according to the best usage, and around the whole was  stretched a rope on poplar posts, to keep the straying horses from nosing  around the tents in their perpetual search for salt.</p>
<p>After breakfast next morning Sir  Bryson issued a command for Jack to wait upon him. As Jack approached, Linda  and Mrs. Worsley were sitting under the awning, each busy with a bit of  embroidery. Jack, who had been for a swim in the river, looked as fresh as a  daisy. As he passed inside Linda smiled at him with a frankness that  disconcerted him greatly. If she was going to give the whole thing away to everybody  like this! However, Mrs. Worsley gave no sign of having seen anything out of  the ordinary.</p>
<p>It transpired that Sir Bryson  wished to make a little exploration up the river. He inquired about a boat, and  Jack offered him his own dugout that he had cached at this point on his way  down the river. Sir Bryson was very much concerned about the speed of the  current, but Jack assured him the Indians were accustomed to making way against  it.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson cast a good deal of  mystery about his little trip, and made it clear that he had no intention of  taking Jack with him. Jack, who had a shrewd idea of his object, had no desire  to be mixed up in it. He swallowed a grin and maintained a respectful air. He  had discovered that there was more fun to be had in playing up to the little  governor&rsquo;s grand airs than in flouting him. Afterward he would enact the scene  by the fire, sure of an appreciative audience in Humpy Jull.</p>
<p>It was arranged that Sir Bryson  should start in an hour, and that his party should take a lunch against an  all-day trip.</p>
<p>As Jack came out Linda rose to  meet him. &ldquo;We will have the whole day to ourselves,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>Jack was nonplussed. Somehow, such  a frank avowal dampened his own ardour. He glanced at Mrs. Worsley to see if  she had heard, and his face stiffened. At this moment a diversion was created  by the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs on the trail.</p>
<p>They looked around the tent to see  Mary and Davy trotting down the little rise that ended at the camp, followed by  two pack-ponies. Linda had not seen Mary before. Her eyes widened at the sight  of another girl, and a very pretty one, riding into camp, and quickly sought  Jack&rsquo;s face. A subtle and unbeautiful change passed over her at what she  fancied she read there.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, attracted by the  sound, came out of the tent. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; he asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son and the daughter of the  trader at Fort Cheever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty girl,&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson condescendingly. &ldquo;Pray bring them to me that I may make them welcome,&rdquo;  he said as he went back.</p>
<p>Jack vaulted over the fence, and  the three youngsters shook hands again with beaming smiles. Jack forgot that in  order to keep up their little fiction he should have appeared more surprised to  see them. Linda looked on with darkening eyes. Jack led the horses around the square  to the place next his own tent, where they were unpacked, unsaddled, and turned  out. He then brought Mary and Davy back. Linda was not in evidence.</p>
<p>Within the tent Sir Bryson  welcomed them as graciously as a king. &ldquo;Very glad to see you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Which  way are you travelling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy&rsquo;s adolescence was painfully  embarrassed in the presence of the great man, but as the man of his party he  blushed and faced him out. &ldquo;We are going home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My sister has been  nursing some sick Indians at Swan Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson did not know of course  that Camp Trangmar was not on the direct road between Swan Lake and Fort  Cheever. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;most worthy of her, I&rsquo;m sure. I trust you will remain  with us a few days before you go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can help around,&rdquo; said Davy.  &ldquo;Jack Chanty said you were short-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent! Excellent!&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson.</p>
<p>Jack made a move toward the door,  and Davy and Mary promptly followed. Sir Bryson fussed among his papers with an  annoyed expression. As much as anything pertaining to his official position he  enjoyed dismissing people. Consequently when they left before they were sent he  felt a little aggrieved.</p>
<p>Outside, Sidney Vassall and  Baldwin Ferrie were now with the two ladies. Linda was reclining languorously  in the folding chair, with her little feet crossed in front of her. She was  pale and full of fine lady airs. Any one but Jack would have known that there  was trouble brewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Introduce your friends,&rdquo; she said  to Jack in a clear, high voice.</p>
<p>Jack was only conscious of an  extreme discomfort. He was oppressed by a sense of guilt that he resented. The  air seemed full of electricity ready to discharge on some one&rsquo;s head. He looked  very stiff and boyish as he spoke the names all round: &ldquo;Miss Cranston, Davy  Cranston; Miss Trangmar, Mrs. Worsley, Captain Vassall, Mr. Ferrie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all smiled on the embarrassed  newcomers, and made them welcome. In particular Linda&rsquo;s smile was  overpoweringly sweet. Without changing her position she extended a languid  little hand to Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So nice of you to come and see  us,&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;I hope you will remain with us until we go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Jack this sounded all right. He  felt relieved. Even yet he did not see what was coming. Mary&rsquo;s perceptions were  keener. With a slightly heightened colour she stepped forward, took the hand  with dignity, and let it fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said quietly.  &ldquo;Not more than a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we need you,&rdquo; Linda insisted,  &ldquo;both of you. &ldquo;Your brother can help the men who are nearly worked to death,  and if you would only help Mrs. Worsley and me with our things, you know, and  other ways&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley looked quickly at  Linda, astonished and indignant, but Linda affected not to see. As Jack  realized the sense of what she was saying, a slow, dark red crept under his  skin, and his face became as hard as stone.</p>
<p>Mary took it smilingly. Her chin  went up a little, and she drew a slow breath before she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;  she said quietly, &ldquo;but I have no experience with ladies&rsquo; things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a faint ring of irony in  the last two words, and excepting Jack, who was too angry to see anything, it  was evident to the others that Mary had returned just a little better than she  got. Linda evidently felt so, for naked malice peeped out of her next speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would be so glad to teach you,  wouldn&rsquo;t we, Kate? And it would be so useful for you to know!&rdquo; Mrs. Worsley  bent over her work, blushing for her young friend.</p>
<p>Mary continued to look at Linda  steadily, and it was finally Linda&rsquo;s eyes that were obliged to stray away.  &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;but we will be expected at home in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; said Linda casually.  She nodded at Mary, and smiled the inattentive smile that women mean to stab  with. &ldquo;Kate, do show me this next stitch,&rdquo; she said, affecting a sudden  absorption in her work.</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley ignored the question.  Her face was now almost as red as Jack&rsquo;s. What passed between these two ladies  when they presently found themselves alone may be guessed.</p>
<p>Jack, Mary, and Davy crossed the  little square. There was a commotion going on inside Jack that he could not in  the least analyze. He was furiously angry, but his sidelong glances at Mary  dashed his anger, and made him fall to wondering if he had rightly understood  what had happened. For Mary, instead of being humiliated and indignant as one  might suppose, was actually smiling. She carried her head high, and the shine  of triumph was in her eye. What was a man to make of this? Jack could only long  in vain for a head to knock about.</p>
<p>The explanation was simple. &ldquo;How  silly I was to be so afraid of her,&rdquo; Mary was thinking. &ldquo;To give herself away  like that! She&rsquo;s a poor thing! I&rsquo;m a better woman than she, and she knows it  now. She can be jealous of <i>me</i> after  this.&rdquo; Behind these thoughts another peeped like an elf through a leafy screen,  but since the maiden herself refused to see it in its hiding-place it is not  fair to discover it to the world.</p>
<p>Mary refused to refer in any way  to what had happened, and Jack was therefore tongue-tied. All he could do was  to show his sympathy in the ardour of his muscular efforts on her behalf. He  put up their two tents, and stowed their baggage; he cut a wholly unnecessary  amount of balsam for Mary&rsquo;s bed, and chopped and carried wood for their fire,  until she stopped him. All this was observable to Linda watching from afar  under her lashes, and in the meantime Kate was not sparing her.</p>
<p>Jack forgot all about Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  order until a peremptory message recalled it. After he had embarked the  governor, Baldwin Ferrie, and three Indians in the dugout, he swung an axe over  his shoulder, and set off up the trail to chop down a tree or two, and &ldquo;think  things out,&rdquo; as he would have said. The operations of the human consciousness  that go under the name of thinking differ widely in the individual. Meanwhile  it should be mentioned that Jean Paul and Garrod had started on horseback with  the object of finding a camp of Sapi Indians that was said to be not far away.  They were gone all day. Jack hardly thought of them.</p>
<p>In a grove of pines beside the  trail Jack swung his axe, and the blows rang. His design was to make a  flagstaff for the centre of the camp. There was an immense satisfaction in  stretching his muscles and planting the blade true. The blood coursed through  his veins, and he tingled to his finger-tips. He felt so much better that he  thought he had solved his problems. This was what Jack called &ldquo;thinking things  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was engaged in chopping the  limbs from a trunk with the stern air of concentration that was characteristic  of him, when something caused him to look up, and he saw Linda standing near  with an appealing aspect. He frowned and went on chopping. Linda sat down on a  stump and looked away with an unsuccessful attempt at unconcern. How astonished  Vassall or Baldwin Ferrie would have been could they have seen their imperious  little mistress then.</p>
<p>There was a long silence except  for the light strokes of Jack&rsquo;s axe as he worked his way up the stem. Jack  enjoyed a great advantage because he was busy. It was Linda who was finally  obliged to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything to say?&rdquo; she  murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack promptly. The  light branches did not offer him a sufficient outlet for his pent-up feelings,  and he wantonly attacked the bole of the biggest tree in sight. Linda watched  the swing of his lithe body with a sort of stricken look. There was another  silence between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said at  last in a small voice.</p>
<p>Jack was not so easily to be  appeased. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t come away from camp alone with me like this,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Followed me,&rdquo; was what he had in mind, but he spared her pride that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what anybody  thinks,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of being compromised?&rdquo; she  asked with a little sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a silly thing to say,&rdquo; he  answered coolly. &ldquo;You know what I mean. I don&rsquo;t intend to give your father and  the other men a chance to throw &lsquo;thief&rsquo; in my teeth. When I&rsquo;ve cleared myself  I&rsquo;ll walk with you openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry,&rdquo; she said like a  child. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rest until I had told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was silent and uncomfortable.  Whenever she sounded the pathetic and childlike note, the male in him must  needs feel the pull of compassion and he resented it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for me any more?&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
<p>Jack frowned, and aimed a tremendous blow at the tree.</p>
<p>Real terror crept into her voice.  &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take anything back,&rdquo; he  said stubbornly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when I feel like telling you, but I won&rsquo;t have  it dragged out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to his tree, and she  prodded the pine needles with the toe of her boot. After a while she returned  to the charge.</p>
<p>More like a child than ever, she  said: &ldquo;Jack, I acted like a little beast. But I said I was sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Jack,  &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t expect to make me so mad I can&rsquo;t see straight, and then have it  all right again just for the asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ungenerous,&rdquo; she said,  pouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; he  said obstinately. &ldquo;I have to be what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another silence. They  were just where they had started. Indeed no progress was possible without an  explosion and a general flare-up. It was Jack who brought it on by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to me you should be  saying you&rsquo;re sorry.&rdquo; Linda sprang up pale and trembling, and the flood gates  of invective were opened. It is no advantage to a jealous woman to be a  governor&rsquo;s daughter. Linda in a passion lacked dignity. Her small face worked  like a child&rsquo;s preparing to bawl, and her gestures were febrile. What is said  at such moments is seldom worth repeating. Jack did not hear the words; it was  her tone that stung him beyond endurance. But at last a sentence reached his  understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you bring her here, and  install her under my eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her here? What do you  mean?&rdquo; he demanded in a voice that forced her to attend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know very well what I  mean!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You knew she was coming this morning. I saw it in your face.  You didn&rsquo;t even pretend that you were surprised. And you took her part against  me all the way through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was enough truth in this to  make Jack furiously angry in turn. His voice silenced hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did take her part!&rdquo; he cried.  &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d do it again. What have you got to complain of? Just like a girl to fly  into a rage and blame everybody all around, just to cover her own tracks! What  did you mean by offering to engage her as your maid? You don&rsquo;t want a maid. You  only did it to insult her! I was ashamed of you. Everybody was ashamed of you.  If you&rsquo;re suffering for it now, it&rsquo;s no more than you ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under all this and more she sat  with an odd, still look from which one would almost have said she enjoyed  having him abuse her.</p>
<p>And so they both emptied  themselves of angry speech, and the inevitable moment of reaction followed.  Both Linda and Jack began to feel that they had said too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said humbly.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, I was only jealous of her, because you seemed so glad to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any good to you to hear  it,&rdquo; said Jack sheepishly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s nothing to me &mdash; that way.&rdquo; Even as he said it  his heart accused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Linda  irrelevantly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s mad about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; said Jack.  Nevertheless he quickly turned to pick up his axe in order to hide the telltale  red that crept into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  said Linda coaxingly. &ldquo;Come and kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obediently went, and, stooping,  kissed her upturned lips. But for both of them the delicious sweetness had  flown. Jack could not forget how ugly her face had looked in a passion, and  Linda remembered how he had worked for Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do it like that last  night,&rdquo; she said, pouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt differently last night,&rdquo;  said Jack doggedly. &ldquo;How can I get up any enthusiasm when you make me do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her breast began to heave again.  &ldquo;You said you had forgiven me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s begin that  again,&rdquo; said Jack with a dismayed look. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to forgive you. If  you want to make things really all right, you can do it in a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up again. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t! I  won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried passionately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her coming that has made the difference  since last night! How dare you suggest that I apologize to her! I&rsquo;d die rather!  I hate you! Don&rsquo;t ever speak to me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden she was gone like a  little tempest among the trees. Jack sat down on the trunk he had cut, and  rested his chin in his palms, terribly troubled in his mind. This sort of thing  was new to him, and it seemed of much greater moment than it was.</p>
<p>Pretty soon she came flying back  again, and casting herself in his arms, clung to him like a baby, weeping and  whimpering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of me, Jack! I don&rsquo;t  know what I&rsquo;m doing or saying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arms closed about her, and he  patted her shoulder with an absurd, sheepish, paternal air of concern. What  else could he do? &ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he said clumsily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress  yourself. It&rsquo;ll be all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t make me apologize  to her?&rdquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said with a shrug. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t suppose it would do any good if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda lay perfectly still. A sense  of sweet satisfaction stole into her breast. It had been a hard fight, but she <i>had</i> made him do what she wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanged if I know what&rsquo;s going to  become of us,&rdquo; thought Jack gloomily. </p>

  Yellow Metal</b></h3>
<p>The fiction that coal was the  objective of Sir Bryson Trangmar&rsquo;s expedition was scarcely maintained; indeed,  once they got away from Fort Cheever the word was never heard again. On the  other hand, a little word that resembled it circulated continually with a  thrilling intonation. Stories of gold and gold-hunters were told over the fires  in English and Cree. Baldwin Ferrie, the geologist, kept the subject agitated  by cracking every likely looking stone he came to with his little hammer, and  by studying the composition of the mountain tops all day with his powerful  glasses.</p>
<p>We are told that the essence of  comedy lies in the exposure of pretentiousness. That being so, the comic spirit  is highly developed up North. In town pretentiousness is largely a matter of  give and take; we are all pretending to something, and we are obliged to seem  to allow the pretences of our neighbours in order to get them to allow ours.  But up North they are beholden to no man, and, sardonic jesters that they are,  they lie in wait for pretentiousness. Woe to the man who goes up North and  &ldquo;puts on side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One like Sir Bryson was therefore  bound to be considered fair game. His official position was no protection to  him. There is a story current about a governor-general, and another about an  actual prince of the blood, who did not escape. All of which is to say that  Jack, notwithstanding his perplexities in other directions, was looking forward  with keen relish to the return of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s &ldquo;exploring-party.&rdquo; He only  regretted that there was none at hand but Humpy Jull with whom to share the  joke.</p>
<p>They landed toward the end of the  day, Sir Bryson and Baldwin Ferrie looking very glum. Jack was sent for. He  found Sir Bryson alone at his table, looking more than usually important and  puffy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know two men called  Beckford and Rowe?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Jack adopted an  innocent-respectful line. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were working in the pass  here at the same time I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, or have you ever been,  associated with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my  own,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a reputation do  these men bear?&rdquo; asked Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson frowned, and squeezed  his pointed beard. &ldquo;How, bad?&rdquo; he wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confidence men. They were square  enough up here. They had to be. They saved their game to work outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo;  demanded Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;Beckford bragged about what he&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did no one take any steps to  stop them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was none of our business,&rdquo;  said Jack. &ldquo;And if it had been we couldn&rsquo;t very well follow them all over, and  warn people off, could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson snorted. &ldquo;Where have  they staked out claims?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all over,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;Anything good they keep dark, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Dexter&rsquo;s  Creek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack bit his lip. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he  said with an innocent stare. &ldquo;Those were what they called their sucker claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson swelled like a  turkey-cock, and turned an alarming colour, but he said nothing. What could he  say?</p>
<p>Your Northern humourist is  merciless. Jack was not nearly through with him. He went on full of solicitude:  &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t fall for anything on Dexter Creek, Sir Bryson. If you&rsquo;d only  mentioned it before, I could have warned you, and saved all this trip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do with  Dexter&rsquo;s Creek,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson quickly. &ldquo;I have other objects. I merely  promised the attorney-general of the province to do a little detective work for  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack could appreciate quick wits  in a victim. &ldquo;Well turned,&rdquo; he thought, and waited for Sir Bryson&rsquo;s next lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the little man  testily. &ldquo;Explain what you mean by &mdash; by this vulgar expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sucker claims?&rdquo; said Jack  wickedly. It really pained him that there was no one by to benefit by this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t repeat the word,&rdquo;  snapped Sir Bryson. &ldquo;It is offensive to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; said Jack: &ldquo;Most  of the prospectors in the country are staked by bankers and business men  outside. And when they at last make a strike, after years of failure, maybe,  their backers generally step in and grab the lion&rsquo;s share. Consequently the men  up here are sore on the city fellows; they have none of the hardships or the  work they say; they just sit back comfortably and wait for the profits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beckford said that he and his  partner had been done a couple of times in this way, and they were out to get  square with the bankers. When they found anything good they kept it dark, and  went outside and sold some fake claims to raise the coin to work the good ones.  Beckford said it was just as easy to sell fake claims as good ones, if you went  about it right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll  set the police after you. Beckford said: &lsquo;They can&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t make any  misrepresentations. We&rsquo;re too smart. We make a mystery of it, and the sucker  gets excited, and swallows it whole. We do the innocent game,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re  the simple, horny-handed tons of soil from the North that ain&rsquo;t on to city  ways. We make &rsquo;em think they&rsquo;re putting it all over us, and we sell out cheap.  Two of us can work it fine!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo; &lsquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how you can get anybody to shell out real money unless you offer to  come back and show them the place.&rsquo; &lsquo;We always do offer to come back,&rsquo; Beckford  said, &lsquo;and we get all ready to come. But at the last moment one of us is took  real sick, and the other refuses to leave his dyin&rsquo; pardner. By that time the  come-on is so worked up he comes across anyway!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this recital Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  face was a study. A kind of shamed chagrin restrained him from a violent  explosion. Jack &ldquo;had&rdquo; him, as Jack would have said. The little beard was in  danger of being plucked out bodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go now,&rdquo; he said in an  apoplectic voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one thing more,&rdquo; Jack  said at the door. &ldquo;Beckford said that if you picked your man right there was no  danger of a prosecution. &lsquo;Choose one of these guys that sets an awful store on  his respectability,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and he&rsquo;ll never blow on himself.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>A deeper tinge of purple crept  into Sir Bryson&rsquo;s puffing cheeks.</p>
<p>Jack lingered for a parting shot.  &ldquo;Any man who did get let in for such a game,&rdquo; he said with a great air of  innocence, &ldquo;hardly deserves any sympathy, does he, Sir Bryson?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sir Bryson was now beyond speech.  He got to his feet; he pulled at his collar for more air, and he pointed mutely  to the door.</p>
<p>Jack embraced Humpy Jull by the  fire, and moaned incoherently. No amount of laughter could ease his breast of  the weight of mirth that oppressed it. Never was such a joke known in the North.</p>
<p>During the rest of the evening  Jack was in momentary expectation of an order to break camp and turn back, but  none came. On the contrary, Humpy reported, from the scraps of conversation he  had overheard at the dinner-table, that Sir Bryson, being convinced there was  gold somewhere in the pass, was determined, with Baldwin Ferrie&rsquo;s assistance to  do a little hunting on his own account. Jack smiled indulgently at the news. It  was not long, however, before he had to change his superior attitude.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning he  was fishing in the backwater below camp, while Baldwin Ferrie sat on a  projecting point of the bank above, patiently searching the mountainsides with  his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Ferrie suddenly called  out, &ldquo;how far is that peak over there, the pointed one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About nine miles in a line from  here,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Fifteen, up the river and in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tetrahedron,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;A  surveyor named it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know it at all?&rdquo; asked  Ferrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; said Jack,  off-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slope on this side,&rdquo; asked  the geologist, &ldquo;I suppose there is a stream that drains it? Could you take us  to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at him hard, and  reeled in his line before he answered. &ldquo;There is a little stream,&rdquo; he said,  approaching Ferrie. &ldquo;It has no name. It empties into Seven-Mile Creek above  here. Anybody could find it. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferrie was an amiable soul, and  not at all secretive, like his master. He went into a detailed explanation of  the geological formation of Tetrahedron peak. &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s different from the  others,&rdquo; he said, offering Jack the glasses. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good chance of finding  free gold in the bed of the creek that drains the slope on this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack whistled in his mind, as one  might say, and looked with a new respect at Baldwin Ferrie and his field  glasses. For it was on that very little stream he had washed his gold, and  there his claims were situated. It had taken him months of strenuous labour to  find what the geologist had stumbled on in half an hour sitting still.</p>
<p>Baldwin Ferrie toddled off to  report to his master, and Jack sat down to do some quick thinking. This  discovery came of the nature of a thunderclap. The possibility of their finding  his claims had occurred to him, but he had counted at least on having time to  prepare against it, and here it was only the third day. Jack had made sure of  the choicest claim on Tetrahedron Creek for himself, and that, of course, they  could not touch. But the two adjoining claims, practically as rich, were still  vacant, and Jack meant to have at least the bestowal of those himself.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson presently ordered Jean  Paul to get the dugout ready for another all-day trip. In excluding Jack from  any share in the preparations he saved that young man from an embarrassing  position, for had he been officially informed of the destination of the river  party, Jack would have had to make explanations on the spot.</p>
<p>As it was, even before Sir Bryson  was ready, he became busy on his own account. Finding Davy, he said: &ldquo;Catch two  horses, and saddle them for you and Mary. You&rsquo;ve got to do something for me,  and for her to-day. There&rsquo;s not a minute to lose. While you&rsquo;re saddling up,  I&rsquo;ll explain everything to Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy, who would have gone through  Hell&rsquo;s Opening itself at Jack&rsquo;s command, raced away to find the horses.</p>
<p>Mary was at the door of her tent  sewing. At the sound of Jack&rsquo;s step she lifted her quiet eyes. There was  something in the uplift of Mary&rsquo;s eyes that stirred Jack queerly, seeing that  he was as good as engaged to another girl, but he put that aside for the  present.</p>
<p>Before he could speak she asked  quickly: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat beside her on the ground.  &ldquo;Something doing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;something big! Listen hard, and don&rsquo;t give it away  in your face. Go on sewing as if I was just passing the time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I told you I&rsquo;d been  prospecting,&rdquo; Jack began. &ldquo;Well, I made a rich strike on the little creek that  comes down from Tetrahedron peak. I staked my claim there, and two claims  adjoining mine for whoever I might want to go in with me on it. The names and  dates aren&rsquo;t entered on the two stakes yet, and of course if these people find  them they have a right to enter their own names. Baldwin Ferrie has doped it  out that there&rsquo;s gold on that creek, and that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re off to now. You  and Davy must get there first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we?&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take them three hours to  make the mouth of Seven-Mile Creek against the current,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can ride  it in one. Davy is getting the horses. If you can get yourselves across the  river before they come up, the claims are saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary went on with her quick, even  stitches without a break. &ldquo;Tell me exactly how to go,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six miles west by the Fort  Erskine trail, and then down to the river. You leave the trail where it turns  to the north, under three big pines that stand by the themselves on the bench.  Look sharp and you will find a trail that I blazed down to the river. At the  end of it I left a little raft for crossing back and forth. If it has been  washed down you&rsquo;ll have to knock another one together. Cross the river, and  land at the lower side of Seven-Mile Creek. You&rsquo;ll find my landing-place there,  and a good trail back to the little creek, and my old camp. The first square  post is a hundred feet upstream from the campfire. You can&rsquo;t miss it. Keep on  going until you come to the second post, and the third one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must we do when we find the  posts?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the notice on the first one,  and that will show you. It reads: &lsquo;I, Malcolm Piers, hereby give notice of my  intention to file a claim,&rsquo; and so forth. And signed and dated at the bottom.  The inscriptions are all written on the other two. All you have to do is to  fill in your name on the second one, &lsquo;I, Mary Cranston,&rsquo; and so on, and on the  third post Davy writes, &lsquo;David Cranston, Junior.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary stopped sewing. &ldquo;My name,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and Davy&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second claim is yours in your  own right,&rdquo; said Jack. Seeing her expression, he hastily added: &ldquo;It was a deal  that I made with your father before we started. As to the other, Davy can sign  that back to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I sign mine,&rdquo; said Mary  quickly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can argue that out when you  come back,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a minute to lose. Davy&rsquo;s got the horses.  Make sure you have a lead pencil to write on the posts. After you&rsquo;ve signed  them get back without running into the governor&rsquo;s party if you can. I don&rsquo;t  want the storm to break until I am there to receive it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes after Sir Bryson with  Baldwin Ferrie and three Indians, had pushed off from the bank, Mary and Davy  Cranston sauntered inconspicuously away from camp, and, mounting their horses  outside, set off at a dead run west on the Fort Erskine trail. </p>

  A Crumbling Brain</b></h3>
<p>Jack set about to fill his anxious  day as full as possible with small tasks. Along the shore toward the mouth of  the canyon he found another dugout sticking out from among the bushes, and he  pulled it out to put it in repair in case a second boat should be required. It  needed new cross-pieces to hold the sides from spreading.</p>
<p>While he was seated on a boulder  whittling his little braces out of snowy poplar, Garrod came shambling over the  stones toward him. Jack, seeing the high-powered rifle he carried, turned a  little grim, and while apparently going on with his work, watched the other man  narrowly. His ideas covering Garrod had taken a new direction since he had  talked with Mary.</p>
<p>Garrod came slowly, pausing,  starting jerkily, fluctuating from side to side. When he thought Jack&rsquo;s eyes  were upon him he turned his back like a child, and made believe to look off up  the river. His eyes were blank and lustreless, but close-hid under the  thickened lids glimmered a mean furtive sentence. There was no striking change  in him; the canvas suit was still in fair condition; he shaved every morning  from force of habit; and when he was spoken to he could still answer with  sufficient intelligence. But any one experienced in diseased mental states  would have recognized at once that this man was in no condition to be trusted  at large with a gun.</p>
<p>Among the members of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  party there existed an entire absence of formality together with an entire  absence of intimacy. They were not curious about each other, consequently  Garrod&rsquo;s state excited no remark. True, Mrs. Worsley wondered a little, but she  had always felt an antipathy to Garrod; as for the others, they merely said,  &ldquo;Queerer than ever,&rdquo; and dismissed him with a shrug.</p>
<p>Jack, watching the wavering figure  approaching him now, thought of the reckless, hawk-eyed youth of five years  before, and was made thoughtful by the change. &ldquo;Gad! Life has had him on the  toaster,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>When Garrod came close enough to  be heard he stammered, avoiding Jack&rsquo;s eyes: &ldquo;I &mdash; I want to talk to you,  Malcolm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down the gun,&rdquo; said Jack  coolly. &ldquo;Out of reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod immediately laid it on the  stones. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that I&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything,&rdquo; said  Jack, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m taking no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s eyes strayed everywhere,  and his voice maundered. &ldquo;I suppose you think I&rsquo;m an utter cur. I know it looks  bad. But not that &mdash; Maybe you think that I &mdash; your horse &mdash; on the cliff&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing you,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Garrod sat down near him. &ldquo;I &mdash;  want to talk to you,&rdquo; he said, forgetting that he had said it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that you and I have to say to  each other can be put in one question and answer,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Are you going to  square me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; stammered  Garrod.</p>
<p>Jack looked up surprised. There  was more in the answer than he had expected. &ldquo;You will?&rdquo; he cried, bright-eyed.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to tell me that! By Gad! that would be a plucky thing to do after  all these years. I didn&rsquo;t think you had it in you!&rdquo; .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; murmured  Garrod, as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy enough if you want to,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;You only have to speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do you any good,&rdquo;  said Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you think,&rdquo; said  Garrod. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank was robbed,&rdquo; said  Garrod. &ldquo;The morning after you went away. Three men broke in during the night,  and hid until morning. When Rokeby and I opened the safe, they overpowered us  and got away with the money. We had no business to open up until the others  came, and we were afraid to tell. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t do you any harm as long  as you were away. If you had come back I would have told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a glib tone in all this  that caused Jack&rsquo;s lip to curl. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to prevent your telling now?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; said  Garrod. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d think I was just trying to shield you, my old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s Rokeby to back you  up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; muttered Garrod.</p>
<p>A harsh note of laughter broke  from Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo;  said Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;It fits in a  bit too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s voice rose shaky and  shrill: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! I swear it! Three men; French, they were. I can see them  now! One was young; he had a scar across his forehead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut out the fine touches,&rdquo;  said Jack contemptuously. &ldquo;Any fool could see you were lying.&rdquo; He went on whittling  his brace.</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s voice sunk to a whimper.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack began to perceive that it was  scarcely a reasonable being he had to deal with. He took a different line. &ldquo;I  guess you&rsquo;ve led a dog&rsquo;s life these last few years,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Garrod looked at him queerly. &ldquo;Oh,  my God.&rdquo; he said in a flat voice. &ldquo;Nobody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know what&rsquo;s the  matter with you,&rdquo; said Jack. There was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the story-books call  remorse,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to work and ruin your best friend without  having bad dreams afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never took the money,&rdquo; Garrod  murmured.</p>
<p>Jack ignored it. &ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; he  repeated with a direct look. &ldquo;Do you remember, as we stood waiting for my train  to pull out, you put your arm around my shoulders, and said: &lsquo;Buck up, old  fel&rsquo;! We&rsquo;ve got in many a hole together, and we always saw each other out!  Count on me &mdash; until death!&rsquo; Do you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next morning you took the  money to pay your debts, to get you out of your hole, knowing they would put it  off on me. You pushed me into a hole as deep as hell, and left me to rot  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod put up a trembling hand as  if to fend off a blow. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; he murmured still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look me in the eyes, and swear  it,&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>He could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a bad way. You can&rsquo;t stand much more. There&rsquo;s going to be a grand  show-down to-night. Do you think you can go through with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; asked Garrod, dully and  anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, and try to  understand,&rdquo; said Jack impatiently. &ldquo;Sir Bryson has gone to look at my claims.  He will read the name Malcolm Piers written on the post, and when he comes back  he will know who I am, and there&rsquo;ll be the deuce to pay. Do you think you&rsquo;re in  any state to face me down? Why, man, the very look of you is enough to give you  away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod merely looked at him with  dull, frightened eyes. &ldquo;Suppose you could face me down,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo;what  then? You can&rsquo;t face yourself down. You were born a decent fellow at heart,  Frank, and you can&rsquo;t get away with this sort of thing. It&rsquo;s <i>got</i> you. And every new lie you tell just  adds to the nightmare that&rsquo;s breaking you now. You&rsquo;ve reached the limit.  Anything more, and you&rsquo;ll go clean off your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell Sir Bryson everything,&rdquo;  muttered Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am accused I defend  myself,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go through with it. I  couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Garrod said like a frightened, stupefied schoolboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; urged Jack,  pursuing his advantage. &ldquo;Make a clean breast of it before Sir Bryson comes  home, and you won&rsquo;t have to face him at all. By Gad! think what a load off your  mind! You&rsquo;d be cured then; you&rsquo;d sleep; you&rsquo;d be a man again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Garrod murmured again: &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t take the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack fought hard for his good  name. His need lent him an eloquence more than his own. In all this he never  stooped by so much as a word to plead for himself. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you tell the  truth?&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;What good is this life you&rsquo;re leading to you? It&rsquo;ll kill  you in a month. Chuck it all, and stay in this country, and win back your  health, and your brains, and your self-respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod wavered. He half turned to  Jack with a more human look. &ldquo;Would &mdash; would you be friends with me again?&rdquo; he  murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stand by you,&rdquo; said Jack  quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my start up here, and I could give you a good one. As long  as I stood by you no one could rake up old scores. But it couldn&rsquo;t be just the  same as it used to be,&rdquo; his honesty forced him to add.</p>
<p>Jack waited with his eyes fixed  compellingly on the other man. Garrod&rsquo;s eyes struggled to escape them, and  could not. Suddenly he broke down, and buried his head in his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do  it!&rdquo; he sobbed.</p>
<p>Jack sprang up. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried  with blazing eyes. &ldquo;The whole truth? You took the money, and spent it, and let  them fasten the theft on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the money, and spent it,  and let them fasten the theft on you,&rdquo; repeated Garrod.</p>
<p>Jack drew a long breath, and,  sitting again, wiped his face. Not until he felt the sense of relief that  surged through him did he realize how much this had meant to him. He could look  almost kindly on the stricken figure in front of him now, and the sobs inspired  him with none of the disgust he would have felt at any other time. He waited  patiently for Garrod to recover himself. When the man at last became quiet he  said, not unkindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; asked Garrod, lifting  a terrified face. &ldquo;Let us go back to camp. Vassall is there. You can tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod desperately shook his head.  &ldquo;Linda &mdash; Miss Trangmar is there. I couldn&rsquo;t &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t have her hear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we could take Vassall away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  understand? Vassall is after her. He&rsquo;ll be glad of this. I couldn&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if he knew about Linda and  me,&rdquo; thought Jack with a sidelong look. &ldquo;Gad! but life&rsquo;s a rum go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather face Sir Bryson,&rdquo;  stuttered Garrod. &ldquo;Wait till Sir Bryson comes back. I swear I&rsquo;ll tell him the  whole truth, and you shall be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo;  said Jack grimly. He considered, frowning. It might be better to confront Sir  Bryson with Garrod direct, but Sir Bryson would not be back for five or six  hours, and who could tell what contradictions of mood would pass over this  half-insane man in the interval.</p>
<p>As if reading his mind, Garrod  said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take anything back. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid &mdash; if you let me stay  with you. You&rsquo;re my only hope. Let me stay with you. Give me something to do  all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rubbed his chin in  perplexity. &ldquo;Will you write out a confession?&rdquo; he finally asked.</p>
<p>Garrod eagerly nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, then,&rdquo; commanded Jack.</p>
<p>Jack ran to his tent, where he got  a pen and his note-book, and returned to the dugout. He was gone but two  minutes, nevertheless as he sprang down the bank he saw that Garrod was no  longer alone. Jean Paul had joined him.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Jack that the  half-breed had any concern in this affair, but he was annoyed by his intrusion  just at this minute. He looked at him sharply. Jean Paul stood idly chewing a  grass-stalk, and looking out over the river with a face as expressionless as  brown paper. Garrod was sitting as Jack had left him, looking at Jean Paul. A  change had passed over his eyes.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s temper got a little the  better of him. &ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Jean Paul turned with an air of mild  surprise. &ldquo;Not&rsquo;ing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;W&rsquo;at&rsquo;s the matter? I saw you and Garrod here,  and I came. I got not&rsquo;ing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go find something,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;Clear out! Make yourself scarce! Vamoose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul, with a deprecatory  shrug, walked slowly on up the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have pen and paper,&rdquo; Jack said  eagerly to Garrod.</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s dazed eyes were following  Jean Paul&rsquo;s retreating figure. He paid no attention. It was only too evident  that his mood had changed.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face grew red. &ldquo;Have you  gone back on it already?&rdquo; he said with an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; muttered Garrod,  struggling to rise.</p>
<p>Jack thrust him back. &ldquo;You stay  where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as soon as Jack took his hands  off him Garrod endeavoured to get up and follow Jean Paul, who by this time had  climbed the bank. Garrod&rsquo;s wasted strength was no match for Jack&rsquo;s but Jack  could hardly see himself sitting there holding the other man down until Sir  Bryson returned. He looked around for inspiration. There was a length of rope  fastened to the bow of the dugout. Cutting off a piece of it, he tied Garrod&rsquo;s  wrists and ankles, and let him lie.</p>
<p>Jack sat down and filled his pipe,  watching Garrod grimly meanwhile, and trying to puzzle out a solution. The man  spoke no articulate word except to mutter once or twice that he must go. Occasionally  he struggled feebly in his bonds like a fish at the last gasp. Still it did not  occur to Jack to connect this new phase of his sickness with the appearance of  the half-breed. Jack&rsquo;s heart was sore. &ldquo;Of what use was the confession of a man  in such a state?&rdquo; he thought. In Jack&rsquo;s simple system of treatment there was  but one remedy for all swoons or seizures, viz., cold water. Upon thinking of  this he got up and, filling his hat in the river, dashed the contents in  Garrod&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>It had the desired effect. Garrod  gasped and shivered, and looked at Jack as if he saw him for the first. He  ceased to struggle, and Jack untied the ropes. </p>
<p>Garrod sat up, a ghastly figure,  with the water trickling from his dank hair over his livid face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all wet,&rdquo; he said, putting up  the back of his hand. Without expressing any curiosity as to what had happened,  he dried his face and neck with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what we were  talking about?&rdquo; asked Jack, concealing his anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted me to write something,&rdquo;  Garrod said dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod nodded, and held out his  hand for the pen and the little book.</p>
<p>Jack breathed freely again. The  blade of a paddle served Garrod for a writing table. The man was entirely  submissive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know what you&rsquo;re  doing?&rdquo; demanded Jack frowning.</p>
<p>Garrod nodded again. &ldquo;You want me  to write out a confession,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What shall I write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack dictated: &ldquo;I, Francis Garrod,  desire to state of my own free will that on the morning of October ninth,  nineteen hundred and six, I took the sum of five thousand dollars from the  vault of the Bank of Canada, Montreal. I knew that Malcolm Piers had gone away,  and I allowed the theft to be fixed on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He signed the page, and dated it.  Taking the book, Jack slipped it in the breast pocket of his flannel shirt.</p>
<p>Jack was genuinely moved. It was  borne in on him dimly that though he was technically the injured party, it was  the other man who showed the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better now,&rdquo; he said  gruffly.</p>
<p>Garrod lay back on the stones, and  covered his face with his arm. &ldquo;I suppose you loathe me, Malcolm,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone a long way to make it  up,&rdquo; Jack said, in the keenest discomfort. &ldquo;Just give me a little time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s thoughts strayed in  another direction. &ldquo;What will she say?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Considering everything, this was a  poser for Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no business to be thinking about girls in your  state,&rdquo; he said frowning. &ldquo;Put her out of your mind, man, and go to work to win  back what you&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod reverted to the night five  years before. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to take the money,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep  after you went, that night, and all night I played with the idea as if it was a  story. Supposing I did take the money, you know, how I would cover my tracks,  and so on. But I never meant to. And next morning when I went to the bank I was  alone in the vault for a moment, and I slipped the package in my pocket just to  carry out the idea, and Rokeby came in before I could put it back. Then the  money was counted, and the shortage discovered. I had plenty of other chances  to put it back, for the money was counted twenty times, but I was always afraid  of being seen, and I kept putting it off, and at last the alarm was given and  it was too late. They were old bills and they couldn&rsquo;t be traced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I lived through  the time that followed. I was afraid to put it back then, because the fellows  talked about my changed looks, and I knew if the money turned up they would  suspect me. As it was, they thought I was grieving on your account. I was, too,  but not the way they thought. I set a store by you, Malcolm. I didn&rsquo;t mean to  injure you. I just drifted into it, and I was caught before I knew. The thought  of meeting you brought the sweat pouring out of me. I thought you would come  back. I bought a revolver, and carried it always. If I had come face to face  with you it would have nerved me to turn it on myself, which I couldn&rsquo;t do  alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come. The thing was  quickly hushed up. I left the bank, and my life went on like anybody&rsquo;s. I  didn&rsquo;t think about the money any more. But something had changed in me. I was  nervous and cranky without knowing why. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep nights. I was full of  silly terrors, always looking around corners, and over my shoulder. And it kept  getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s voice never varied from  the toneless half-whisper that was like a man talking in his sleep. &ldquo;Then I  came up here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and ran into you without any warning. It was like a  blow on the temple. It all came back to me. Then I knew what was the matter. I  didn&rsquo;t kill myself on the spot, because I found you didn&rsquo;t know. I wish I had.  I&rsquo;ve died a thousand deaths since. It was like little knives in my brain  thrusting and hacking. I could have screamed with it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s increasing discomfort  became more than he could bear. &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tell all this,&rdquo; he  burst out. &ldquo;At least not to me. I&rsquo;m the one you injured. Pull yourself  together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a relief to get it out,&rdquo;  Garrod murmured with a sigh. &ldquo;I can sleep now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack got up. &ldquo;Sleep, that&rsquo;s what  you need,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come back to your tent, and lie low for the rest of the  day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want to be alone,&rdquo;  stammered Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stretch out here in the  grass,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go away without waking  me?&rdquo; Garrod said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Above the stones of the beach  extended a narrow strip of grass, shaded from the sun by thickly springing  willows. Behind and above the willows the trail skirted the escarpment of the  bank. Garrod crawled into the shade and stretched himself out. Once or twice he  started up to look rather wildly if Jack were still there; finally he slept.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack, returning to the  dugout, took up his poplar braces again, with the instant concentration on the  job in hand of which he was capable. Jack&rsquo;s highly practical temperament was at  once the source of his strength and his weakness. On the one hand, he conserved  his nervous energy by refusing to worry about things not immediately present;  on the other hand, his refusal to track these same things down in his mind  often left him unprepared for further eventualities. At this moment, while his  attentive, blue eyes directed his sure hands, he had not altogether ceased to  think of the strange things that had happened, but it was only a subconscious  current. There was evidence of it in the way his hand occasionally strayed to  the pocket of his shirt to make sure the little book was still there.</p>
<p>Jack had pushed the dugout partly  into the water. The stern floated in a backwater on the lower side of a little  point of stones that jutted out. On this point impinged the descending current,  which was deflected out, straight for the opening in the wall of rock, a  thousand feet or so downstream. Little could be seen of this opening from above;  the first fall hid the white welter below, and the bend in the walls of rock  closed up the prospect. It was as if the river came to an end here in a round  bay with a stony beach, and rich, green-clad shores. Only the deep, throaty  roar from under the wall of rock gave warning that this was really &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s  Opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack thought of no reason for  watching Garrod now, and his back was turned to him as he worked. He therefore  did not notice that the leaves of the willows above Garrod&rsquo;s head were  occasionally twitched on their stems in a different way from the fluttering  produced by a current of air. Only a sharp and attentive eye could have spotted  it, for the movement was very slight, and there were long pauses between. After  a while the leaves low down were parted, and for an instant a dark face showed,  bright and eager with evil. It was Jean Paul. Marking Jack&rsquo;s position and  Garrod&rsquo;s, he drew back. Garrod was immediately below him.</p>
<p>More minutes passed. The patience  of a redskin is infinite.</p>
<p>Finally Garrod began to twitch and  mutter in his sleep, and presently he rolled over on his back, wide awake. Jack  threw him a careless glance, and went on working. As Garrod lay staring at the  leaves over his head, a change passed subtly over his face; the lines of his flesh  relaxed a little, a slight glaze seemed to be drawn over his eyes. In the end  he slowly raised himself on one elbow, and looked at Jack with an exact  reproduction of the cunning, hateful expression Jean Paul had shown. He quickly  dropped back, and lay, waiting.</p>
<p>Presently, Jack having finished  the shaping of his braces, picked up hammer and nails, and with another  off-hand glance at the apparently sleeping Garrod, climbed into the dugout. He  put in the stern thwart first, sitting on his heels in the bottom of the  dugout, with his back toward the shore.</p>
<p>Garrod raised his head again, and  seeing Jack&rsquo;s attitude, drew himself slowly up, and came crawling with infinite  caution down over the stones. Back among the leaves a fiery pair of eyes was  directing him. This was where Jack&rsquo;s faculty of concentration proved his  undoing. Driving the nails as if his soul&rsquo;s fate rested on the accuracy of his  strokes, he never looked around. Garrod covered the last five yards at a  crouching run. Seizing the bow of the dugout, and exerting all his strength, he  heaved the craft out into the stream.</p>
<p>The force and the suddenness of  the shove threw Jack flat on his back. By the time he recovered himself, the  dugout fairly caught in the current and, gradually gaining way, was headed straight  for Hell&rsquo;s Opening.</p>
<p>If Jack allowed the moment to take  him unwares, it must be said he wasted no time when it came. His faculties  leaped in the presence of danger. His bright, wary, calculating eyes first  sought for the paddle, but it lay back on the stones where Garrod had used it.  He looked at Garrod. The man had picked up his gun, and was running toward him.  He kept pace with the moving dugout along the edge of the stones. Not more than  fifty feet separated the two men. Jack measured the distance to the backwater.  Ten swimming strokes would have carried him to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you jump overboard I&rsquo;ll  shoot,&rdquo; Garrod murmured huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you easy in the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack saw that it was madness he  had to deal with, and he wasted no words with him. Garrod, crouching, stumbling  over the stones, with his strained, inhuman eyes fixed on Jack, was an ugly  sight. He muttered as he went:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to kill you. I can&rsquo;t  help it. I&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stood up in the canoe. The blue eyes were steady,  and the thin line of his lips was firm, but the rich colour slowly faded out of  his sunburned face, leaving it like old ivory. All this had happened in a  moment; the dugout was not yet fully under way, though it seemed to Jack as if  it were flying down. The harbouring backwater still stretched between him and  the shore. He had a minute or longer to make his choice. The roaring canyon  that ground its great tree-trunks into shreds was vividly present before his  eyes; on the other hand, he could jump overboard and make his bobbing head a  mark like a bottle for a madman to shoot at. A minute to decide in, and there  he was tinglingly alive, and life was very sweet.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s frightened voice rang  out: &ldquo;Jack! what are you doing out there? Come ashore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked and saw Linda standing  in the trail by the bank&rsquo;s edge. Garrod was hidden from her by the intervening  bushes. She came flying down, regardless. Garrod heard the voice, and, turning  toward it, stopped dead. His muscles relaxed, and the butt of the gun dropped  on the stones.</p>
<p>Jack laughed, and jumped  overboard. Half a dozen strokes carried him into the backwater; twenty landed  him hands and knees on the stones. Rising face to face with Garrod, he snatched  the gun from his nerveless hands and sent it spinning into the bushes. Without  looking at the girl he ran and caught up the paddle, ran back along the stones,  plunged in and, heading off the dugout, wriggled himself aboard. It became a  question then of his strength against the sucking current. The dugout hung in  the stream as if undecided. Finally it swung around inch by inch, swept  inshore, and grounded with perhaps five yards to spare.</p>
<p>As he landed the second time Linda  cast herself weeping and trembling on his dripping bosom. &ldquo;What did you  frighten me like that for?&rdquo; she cried, beating him with her small fists.</p>
<p>Jack laughed, and held her off.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good boat,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;besides, the hammer was in it, the only one we  have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get adrift?&rdquo; she  demanded.</p>
<p>Jack looked at Garrod with a  hardening eye. Garrod still stood where he had stopped. His eyes were blank of  sense or feeling. Linda flew toward him, her slight frame instinct and  quivering with menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coward!&rdquo; she hissed.</p>
<p>Jack held her off. &ldquo;Let him  alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His wits are clean gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to lead Garrod,  unresisting, back to camp. Suddenly he remembered the note-book, and his hand  flew to his pocket. It was gone. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>XI<br>
  The Showdown</b></h3>
<p>Sidney Vassall, wondering what had  become of Linda, wandered about camp covertly looking for her. The amiable  young aide-de-camp had his dull heartache too, these days. An instinct warned  him that the humble attitude he displayed toward her would never succeed in  focussing the little beauty&rsquo;s attention on himself, but he was unable to change  it. He was the victim of his own amiability.</p>
<p>Coming to the edge of the bank, he  met the odd little procession coming up; Garrod with his wild, blank stare;  Jack with his hand twisted in Garrod&rsquo;s collar, and Linda following at a little  distance, pale, angry, and frightened.</p>
<p>Vassall&rsquo;s jaw dropped. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the  matter?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>Jack let go his hold on Garrod,  and scowled at him, angry and perplexed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Clean  daft!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall fell back a step. &ldquo;Easy,  for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she knows,&rdquo; Jack said  carelessly. &ldquo;The question is, what are we to do with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first command in Vassall&rsquo;s  highly artificial code was: &ldquo;Keep it from the women!&rdquo; Turning to Linda with a  shaky imitation of his polite smile, he said: &ldquo;Mrs. Worsley has been wondering  where you were. You&rsquo;ll find her in the big tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Linda&rsquo;s impatient  rejoinder was: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no place for you,&rdquo;  Vassall went on earnestly; &ldquo;I beg that you will go to Mrs. Worsley, and let us  attend to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No place for me?&rdquo; Linda burst  out. &ldquo;What do you think I am, a doll? I can be as much help to Jack as you  can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vassall turned pale at the sound  of the familiar name on her lips.</p>
<p>Garrod stood motionless,  apparently neither seeing nor hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quiet enough now,&rdquo; said Jack  rubbing his chin; &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t tell when he may break out again. A tent is no  place to keep a madman. We&rsquo;ll have to tie him up, Vassall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; murmured  the other man. He all but wrung his hands. &ldquo;This is too dreadful! Miss Linda, I  beg of you! What will Sir Bryson say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s eyes passed contemptuously  over him. &ldquo;What is there I can do?&rdquo; she asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find Jean Paul,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As if evoked by the sound of his  name, the half-breed issued at that moment from among the trees on their left,  and approached them. If his designs had miscarried, he gave no sign of it. One  could hardly have guessed that he harboured designs. His face was as smooth as  velvet, his manner calm, respectful, inquiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;at&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. He  looked at Garrod and appeared to comprehend with a start. &ldquo;Ah, weh-ti-go!&rdquo; he  said, using the Cree word for madness. He shook his head in sober compassion.  &ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink so me, before; many days he is act fonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was perfection, and Jack was  completely taken in. It seemed good to him to find some one quiet and capable.  &ldquo;He will have to be tied up and watched,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He tried to launch me  into the canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wah! Wah!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean Paul,  holding up his hands at the thought. &ldquo;I put him in my tent,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You  and I all time watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Garrod was given in charge of  Jean Paul, as Jean Paul had designed. He led him away, looking rather amused.  White men were so easy to fool.</p>
<p>Jack went back for the gun, and to  search up and down in case he might have dropped the precious notebook on the  shore. Linda tagged after him, and Vassall followed Linda, because he could not  support his bewilderment and dismay alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; Linda  kept asking. &ldquo;Something I lost out of my pocket,&rdquo; Jack said; &ldquo;a note-book.&rdquo; He  could not bring himself to tell her more.</p>
<p>It was not there of course. The  canyon had it long before this. When they returned to camp Humpy Jull was  carrying lunch into the big tent. Linda commanded Jack to change his clothes  and come and eat with them. He shook his head.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot. &ldquo;You must  come! Kate has to be told. We need you to hold us together. Kate!&rdquo; she called  out. &ldquo;Make him come and have lunch with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley nodded and smiled  from the door of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;One  minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Linda perversely frowned and  bit her lip because Kate could bring him with a nod, where she was unable to  command.</p>
<p>It was not a cheerful meal that  followed. Jack told Mrs. Worsley briefly what had happened, Vassall supplying a  lamentable chorus. Mrs. Worsley took it with raised eyebrows and closed lips.  Afterward Jack relapsed into silence. He had difficult matters of his own to  think of. None of them knew of his intimate connection with Garrod, and it was  impossible for him to speak to them of what concerned him so closely. Meanwhile  the three talked as people always talk, of Garrod&rsquo;s strange behaviour during  the last few days, and how anybody could have seen what was going to happen, if  anybody had thought.</p>
<p>After they had come out of the  tent, Jack saw Mary stroll through the trees on the westerly side of camp.</p>
<p>His eye brightened. Since they were  back so soon they must have been successful. Mary quietly set to work to  prepare their dinner. In a little while Davy appeared dragging the saddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have they been up to?&rdquo; Linda  said curiously. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been gone all morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they have their own  matters to attend to,&rdquo; Mrs. Worsley said, relieving Jack of the necessity of  answering.</p>
<p>When a decent interval had elapsed  Jack strolled over to the Cranston&rsquo;s fire. &ldquo;Were you in time?&rdquo; he asked  casually.</p>
<p>Mary raised a face as controlled  as his own. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We did what you told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet the other party?&rdquo; he  asked anxiously.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;We found your  raft,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;so we had plenty of time. We landed above Seven-Mile Creek,  so they could not see the raft when they came up. After we had marked the posts  we crossed the little stream, and came back on that side, as they went up the  other. We heard them. The Indians would see our tracks of course, but Sir  Bryson pays no attention to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That has turned  out all right, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary searched his face, and a  flash of anxiety appeared in her quiet eyes. &ldquo;Something has happened here?&rdquo; she  said.</p>
<p>Jack nodded. His constricted  breast welled up. Here was somebody he <i>could</i> tell. He did not reflect on the ambiguity of the situation. He only knew  instinctively that he needed help, and that help was to be had in those deep  eyes. However, he stuck to the bare facts of his narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal beneath  that,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you  when I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let me help you,&rdquo; she  said earnestly. &ldquo;I understand the people so much better than you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people?&rdquo; he said surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think  that Jean Paul is at the bottom of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared at her. This was quite  a new thought to him. It required consideration.</p>
<p>Their further talk was prevented  by the customary shrill hail from up river, announcing the return of the boat  party. Travelling downstream, they were able to make ten miles an hour,  consequently they arrived close on the heels of the Cranstons, who had left  Seven-Mile Creek an hour before them.</p>
<p>Jack went back to the others at  the door of the big tent. Linda received him sulkily, but he made believe not  to be aware of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will tell Sir Bryson?&rdquo;  murmured Vassall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Jack firmly. &ldquo;I  have to talk to him anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; demanded Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mining claims,&rdquo; said Jack &ldquo;and  other things! There has to be a general showdown to-night.&rdquo; He spoke with  affected carelessness, nevertheless his heart was beating at the thought of  what he must go through with.</p>
<p>They looked at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well all know it,&rdquo;  said Jack. &ldquo;I am Malcolm Piers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Worsley and Vassall  had time to recover from their stupefaction at this announcement, Sir Bryson  and Baldwin Ferrie came striding from the river-bank. It appeared as if all Sir  Bryson&rsquo;s river expeditions were doomed to disappointment. Again he was in a  furious temper, and trying without success to conceal it. He passed inside the  tent without noticing anybody. Baldwin Ferrie followed him. Jack, without  waiting for a command, went in after them.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson flung himself into a  chair, and opened up on Jack without any preliminaries. &ldquo;You say you have  worked up and down this pass,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever hear the name Malcolm  Piers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson leaned forward in his  chair, and peered at Jack through squeezed-up eyes in a way that he intended to  be magisterial and intimidating. &ldquo;Where is this fellow now?&rdquo; he barked.</p>
<p>Jack smiled a little grimly. &ldquo;He  is before you,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I am Malcolm Piers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson fell back in his chair,  and puffed. He appeared to have suffered a sudden loss of motive power. &ldquo;Well,  well, I knew that,&rdquo; he said flatly. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t expect you to have the  assurance to admit it to my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no reason to conceal my  name,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson gradually worked  himself up again. &ldquo;No reason?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You young blackguard! It was an  honourable name until it descended to you! I ought to have guessed the truth  from your intimacy with the details of these swindling operations. No reason?  We&rsquo;ll see what the law has to say to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law?&rdquo; said Jack, quickly.  &ldquo;The money which I did not take has been paid into the bank. What has the law  to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson smiled disagreeably.  &ldquo;Apparently you do not know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are under indictment for grand  larceny, and that your uncle, Mr. McInnes, directed his executors to see that  you were prosecuted whenever you should be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a staggerer for Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! that touches you!&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson. &ldquo;That shakes your impudence, eh? Moreover, I do not think the province  of Athabasca, of which I have the honour to be chief executive, will raise any  obstacles to giving you up to the province of Quebec!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack felt a little sick with  helpless rage. He drew the mask of obstinacy over his face, and held his  tongue. What could he say? It would only draw down their ridicule for him to  confess that the only witness to his innocence was an insane man.</p>
<p>He submitted to receive a long  moral lecture in Sir Bryson&rsquo;s best vein. &ldquo;Do you realize,&rdquo; the governor said in  conclusion, &ldquo;that as the head of this province it is my duty to put you under  arrest, and hand you over to the authorities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack by this time had been goaded  pretty far. &ldquo;And so prevent me from filing my claim?&rdquo; he said with a dangerous  light in his eyes.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson swelled and puffed.  &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Naturally the government does not intend that its valuable  mining privileges shall fall into the hands of felons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not yet a felon,&rdquo; said Jack  quietly; &ldquo;and the three claims are not yet yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sir Bryson&rsquo;s turn to grow  red. There were no papers handy, and he fussed with his watch charm. &ldquo;As to the  other two claims,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;you have overreached yourself there. The  notices on the posts are dated to-day, and it will be easy to prove that your  friends could not have got there before we did to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack found a momentary pleasure in  describing to Sir Bryson how it had been done.</p>
<p>Naturally Sir Bryson was  infuriated. &ldquo;So it appears I have been harbouring a conspiracy!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Jack.  &ldquo;The three claims were staked out before you came into the country. Isn&rsquo;t the  rest of the creek enough for you? There&rsquo;s plenty of pay dirt. I have worked for  five years to find this place, and the best of it belongs to me by right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; cried Sir  Bryson tremblingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt to bandy words with me! You can go until I  decide what is to be done with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to Jack dimly that he  was scarcely acting the part of prudence in thus exasperating his judge to the  highest degree, and he cooled down. So they were not going to put him under  restraint immediately. It would have been rather difficult anyway. With all his  anger there was an uncandid look in the little governor&rsquo;s eye. Jack wondered  what he was getting at. Suddenly the idea went through his mind that Sir Bryson  hoped he might ride out of camp that night, and never show his face again. In  other words, the unspoken proposal was: his liberty in exchange for his claims.  Jack smiled a little at the thought, his fighting smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo;  demanded Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell you,&rdquo;  Jack said, mildly. &ldquo;Garrod&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very sick. He appears to  have gone out of his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense is this?&rdquo; puffed  Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad, insane, crazy; whatever word  you like,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>The little governor was startled  out of his pomposity.</p>
<p>He turned to Baldwin Ferrie,  plucking at his beard. For the moment he forgot his animosity against Jack, and  asked him innumerable questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set you adrift?&rdquo; he said, when  Jack had told his tale. &ldquo;What could have led him to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the moment Jack had been  dreading. He drew a long breath, and, looking Sir Bryson in the eye, told him  the whole story of himself and Frank Garrod. Sir Bryson, as Jack expected,  sneered and pooh-poohed it throughout. On the face of it, it was a fantastic  and improbable tale, but a disinterested person seeing Jack&rsquo;s set jaw and level  eyes, and hearing his painstakingly detailed account, could scarcely have  doubted he was telling the truth. Baldwin Ferrie was impressed, and he was not  altogether disinterested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost the note-book, eh?&rdquo; sneered  Sir Bryson. &ldquo;And you expect me to believe this on your unsupported word!  Garrod&rsquo;s life has been exemplary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Trangmar saw me when I was  cast adrift,&rdquo; said Jack patiently. &ldquo;As to the rest, I think Garrod will bear me  out, if he ever comes to his right senses. Why not have him in here now, and  look him over? He may be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson was very much excited.  He called Vassall into the tent, and the three men held a whispered  consultation. Presently Linda came in, pale and charged with emotion. She  headed directly for Jack. He fended her off with a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you give anything away, it  will queer me for good with this crowd,&rdquo; he swiftly whispered.</p>
<p>She could not but perceive the  force of this. A spasm passed over her face. Turning, she sat in a chair near  the door, doing her best to look unconcerned.</p>
<p>When Sir Bryson saw her, he said:  &ldquo;We have important matters to discuss, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a tent,&rdquo; said Linda.  &ldquo;You can hear every word outside anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; began Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay,&rdquo; said Linda  tempestuously, and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>The upshot of the consultation was  that Jack should be confronted with Garrod. Sir Bryson was opposed to it, but  the other two overruled him. Vassall went off to get Garrod, and they waited.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson&rsquo;s table was toward the  top of the tent, and as he sat he faced the door. He frowned, and tapped on the  table and pulled his beard. Occasionally, in spite of himself, his eyes bolted.  It was as if a horrible doubt kept recurring to him that the situation was  getting too much for him; that he had stirred up more than he was able to  settle. Jack stood to the right of the table, with his upper lip drawn in, his  face as hard as a wall. Poor Jack had no ingratiating ways when he was put on  the defensive. Mrs. Worsley stole into the tent, and, sitting beside Linda,  took her trembling hand. Baldwin Ferrie bent over them, and with a pale face  whispered soothing things that they made no pretence of listening to.</p>
<p>At last Vassall pulled the tent  flap back, and Garrod came in. He was well-brushed and tended. He walked  without assistance, and his face was composed. Manifestly another change had  taken place in him during the last few hours, a change for the better. Jack&rsquo;s  heart began to beat more hopefully. There was still something queer about  Garrod&rsquo;s eyes. Jean Paul Ascota and Vassall followed him in.</p>
<p>The half-breed constituted himself  the sick man&rsquo;s nurse. Seeing a chair, he placed it for him at Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  left, and Garrod sat down. Garrod had not greeted anybody on entering. Jean Paul  stood over him watchful and solicitous. Mary&rsquo;s warning occurred to Jack, but  what was he to do? The halfbreed&rsquo;s attitude was irreproachable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear that you have  been very sick, Mr. Garrod,&rdquo; Sir Bryson began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Garrod composedly.  &ldquo;My head has been troubling me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a curious, stiff quality  in Garrod&rsquo;s voice, but that might easily have been accounted for by what he had  been through. In spite of the man&rsquo;s apparent recovery, a dull anxiety that he  could not explain, began to shape itself in Jack&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite yourself again?&rdquo;  continued Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what happened  this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, up to a certain point.  I had a shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Sir Bryson. &ldquo;This man,&rdquo;  pointing to Jack, &ldquo;accuses you of setting him adrift in the current. Is it  true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight pause before  each of Garrod&rsquo;s answers. This time his hearers held their breaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some mistake,&rdquo; he said  composedly. &ldquo;He was working in the boat, and it must have drifted off. I was  asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pent-up breaths escaped. Jack  turned a little paler, and set his teeth. He was not surprised; something had  warned him of what was coming. Sir Bryson looked at his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda, I understand that you were  present,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you see Mr. Garrod push the boat off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it,&rdquo; she began excitedly.  &ldquo;I know he did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you if you saw him do  it?&rdquo; Sir Bryson said severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said sullenly. &ldquo;It was  already adrift when I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, with a satisfied air,  turned back to Garrod. &ldquo;Do you know this man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Garrod. &ldquo;It is  Malcolm Piers. We were friends years ago, before he ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at him with a kind of  grim surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He claims,&rdquo; continued Sir Bryson,  &ldquo;that you were the only person who knew of his intention to leave Montreal for  good, and that after he had gone you took the money and let the theft be  fastened on him. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the same tense pause  while they waited for the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; said Garrod. &ldquo;I  knew he was going away, but I knew nothing about the money until the shortage  was discovered.&rdquo; There was a pause, and then Garrod went on in his level,  toneless voice, &ldquo;I never accused him of taking it. I was the only one who stood  up for him. You can ask anybody who worked in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A note of bitter laughter escaped  from Jack.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson frowned. &ldquo;He says,&rdquo; he  went on, &ldquo;that you wrote a statement this morning confessing that you took the  money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a longer pause before Garrod  spoke. &ldquo;Before or after the accident of the boat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson looked at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before,&rdquo; said Jack indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; said Garrod. &ldquo;I  remember everything that happened up to that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson appealed to the company  at large. &ldquo;Surely we have heard enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have laid bare an  impudent attempt on the part of this young man to fasten his crime on one whom  he thought incapable of defending himself.&rdquo; He looked at Jack with the most  terrible air he could muster. &ldquo;Have you anything to say for yourself now?&rdquo; he  barked. </p>
<p>Jack screwed down the clamps of  his self-control. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Mr. Garrod back to your  tent, then, Jean Paul,&rdquo; Sir Bryson said graciously. &ldquo;Tend him well, and we will  all be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before any move was made the  company was electrified by a new voice: &ldquo;May I speak if you please, Sir  Bryson?&rdquo; They turned to see Mary Cranston standing within the door, resolute in  her confusion.</p>
<p>Linda half rose with an  exclamation. At the touch of Kate&rsquo;s hand she sank back, twisting her  handkerchief into a rag, her lips trembling, her pained eyes darting from  Mary&rsquo;s face to Jack&rsquo;s and back again.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson sneered.  &ldquo;Eavesdropping?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was listening,&rdquo; said Mary  firmly. &ldquo;It is good that I was. You are all blind!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Sir Bryson  jocularly, looking all around to share the joke. &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody laughed, however. Mary was  not put out by his sneers. She pointed at Garrod. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s  saying,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His lips are speaking at the command of another mind! It is  hypnotism! If you don&rsquo;t believe, look at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven faces turned toward  Garrod with a simultaneous start. Jean Paul&rsquo;s astonishment was admirably done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See by his eyes, his voice, the  whole look of him!&rdquo; Mary went on. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even hear what I am saying now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of those who looked could  help but be struck by Garrod&rsquo;s extraordinary apathy. He sat, as he had  continued to sit since he came in, looking before him with eyes devoid of all  expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garrod!&rdquo; said Sir Bryson sharply.</p>
<p>After the usual pause Garrod  replied like an automaton without moving his eyes: &ldquo;Yes, Sir Bryson?&rdquo; The  governor was very much shaken. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s hypnotism,  who&rsquo;s doing it?&rdquo; Mary looked squarely at the man she accused. &ldquo;Ask Jean Paul  Ascota, the wonder-worker, the conjurer, the medicine man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul started, and looked at  her with a deprecating smile. From her he looked at Sir Bryson with the hint of  a shrug, as much as to ask him to excuse her for what she was saying. It was  almost too well done. Mary&rsquo;s eyes clung to him steadily, and any one who looked  hard enough could have seen uneasiness behind the man&rsquo;s smiling mask. Sir  Bryson, however, wished to be deceived.</p>
<p>He puffed and blew.  &ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; he cried, casting his eyes around the little circle for  support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Jean Paul away out of sight  and hearing, and we will see if I am right,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do no such thing,&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson irritably. &ldquo;We all know what your interest is in this case, my young lady.  You are one of the beneficiaries of this young rascal&rsquo;s generosity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack suddenly came to life. He  turned red, and leaned threateningly over Sir Bryson&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Sir Bryson&mdash;&rdquo; he  began with glittering eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Mary in a voice that  silenced Jack&rsquo;s own. &ldquo;It is nothing to me what he thinks of me. I only want to  see the truth come out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Kate Worsley&rsquo;s restraining  arm kept Linda from jumping up. She was trembling all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is any justice here you  can&rsquo;t refuse to do what I ask,&rdquo; Mary continued, with her eyes fixed on Sir  Bryson. It appeared that the quiet eyes could flash at need.</p>
<p>The little governor desired  strongly to refuse. He pished, and pshawed, and fussed with his watch-chain,  avoiding the disconcerting eyes. But the others in the tent were dead against  him. They were of Anglo-Saxon stock, and an appeal to justice had been made.  Sir Bryson could not support the silent opposition of his whole party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I suppose we must go  through with the farce,&rdquo; he said pettishly. &ldquo;Jean Paul, will you oblige me by  stepping outside for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must go as far away as the  river bank,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And some one must go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Vassall.</p>
<p>The two men went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ask him questions,&rdquo; said  Mary.</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s eyes looked after Jean  Paul uneasily. He half rose as if to follow. There was something inhuman in his  aspect. Baldwin Ferrie laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. All their  hearts were beating fast as they watched and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garrod, can &mdash; can you remember  what happened this morning?&rdquo; stammered Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go,&rdquo; muttered Garrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; asked  Jack.</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank, didn&rsquo;t you tell me you  took the money?&rdquo; Jack persisted.</p>
<p>Garrod&rsquo;s fingers pulled at his  hanging lip, and the vacant eyes remained turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garrod, can&rsquo;t you hear me?&rdquo;  demanded Sir Bryson sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; muttered Garrod.</p>
<p>It was a painful exhibition. The  beholders were a little sickened, and none of them wished to prolong it.  Baldwin Ferrie went to the opening to call Vassall and Jean Paul back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; asked Mary of  Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied of nothing!&rdquo; he  snapped. &ldquo;The man is out of his wits. I knew that before. We are just where we  started!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s cheeks reddened with  generous indignation. &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You were going to believe  what he said before. I have shown you that he was irresponsible then as well as  now. Let me take care of him,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Perhaps I can nurse him back to  his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson with  a disagreeable smile, &ldquo;but I will see that Mr. Garrod has <i>disinterested</i> care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes widened with alarm.  &ldquo;Not Jean Paul! After what I have shown you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul had come in, and was  bending solicitously over Garrod.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson glanced at them. &ldquo;You  have shown me nothing to his discredit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see anything but what  you wish to see!&rdquo; cried Mary indignantly. &ldquo;Is this your justice, your  disinterestedness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson lost his temper. &ldquo;That  will do!&rdquo; he snapped rapping on the table. &ldquo;I am the master here and I will do  as I see fit. The truth is clear to all reasonable people,&rdquo; he went on, his  eyes travelling around the circle again. &ldquo;Of course I understand that to you  and your lover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. Linda sprang up  like a released bowstring. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; she cried, her small white face  working with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda! Linda!&rdquo; implored Mrs.  Worsley, following her aghast.</p>
<p>Linda thrust her away with a  strength more than her own. &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be quiet any  longer! I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; She ran across the grass, and clung to Jack&rsquo;s arm,  facing Mary. Gone were all the pretty affectations and refinements; this was  the primitive woman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not hers!&rdquo; she cried hysterically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mine! He&rsquo;s  mine! She&rsquo;s trying to take him from me by making believe to defend him. I can  defend him as well as she can. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s guilty either. I don&rsquo;t care  if he is or not. I love him, and he loves me!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt=""  src="1600881h-images/page186.jpg" width="750" height="500"><a name="186"></a></p>
<p>A dreadful silence in the tent  succeeded this outburst, broken only by Linda&rsquo;s tempestuous sobs. She hid her  face on Jack&rsquo;s shoulder. His arm was around her; a man could do no less.  Vassall and Ferrie turned away their heads, shamed and sick at heart to see the  lady of their dreams so abase herself. Mrs. Worsley sank back in her chair, and  covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>Mary Cranston, just now all alive,  and warm and eager, turned to ice where she stood. Jack was fiery red and  scowling like a pirate. For a second his eyes sought Mary&rsquo;s imploringly. Seeing  no hope there, he stiffened his back, and drew on the old scornful, stubborn  mask, letting them think what they chose. If he had had a moustache he would  have twirled it in their faces. Sir Bryson was staring at his daughter  clownishly.</p>
<p>Mary broke the silence. &ldquo;I am  sorry,&rdquo; she said, smoothly and clearly, &ldquo;that the young lady has misunderstood  my reasons for mixing myself in this. She need not distress herself any  further. Malcolm Piers is nothing to me, nor I to him. If she still thinks I  have any share in him, I cheerfully give it to her here and now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she was gone. David  Cranston would have been proud of her exit. Not until after she had gone did  any of those present realize the wonder of it, that as long as she had remained  in the tent this native girl of less than twenty years had dominated them all.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson&rsquo;s faculties were  completely scattered. His eyes were almost as blank as Garrod&rsquo;s; his hands  trembled; his breathing was stertorous. Whatever his absurdities and  weaknesses, at that moment the little man was an object worthy of compassion.  Gradually his voice returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda! How can you shame me so!&rdquo;  he murmured huskily. Then in a stronger voice: &ldquo;Leave that man!&rdquo; He turned to  Kate Worsley. &ldquo;Take her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storm of Linda&rsquo;s passion  passed with the departure of the other woman. She was now terrified by what she  had done. She allowed herself to be led away, weeping brokenly.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson turned to Jack. &ldquo;As for  you, you young blackguard,&rdquo; he said tremulously, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t expect to profit  by this. If she persists in her infatuation she is no daughter of mine. But  I&rsquo;ll save her if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s chin stuck out. He said  nothing.</p>
<p>Jean Paul had listened to all  this, outwardly shocked, but with the hint of a smirk playing around the  corners of his lips. Fate was unexpectedly playing into his hands! He now  looked at Sir Bryson for orders, and Sir Bryson, as if in answer, rose and  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Paul, I order you to arrest  this man. Secure him, and keep him under guard until we can reach the nearest  police post. Mr. Vassall and Mr. Ferrie will assist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two men who, up to the  moment of Linda&rsquo;s avowal, had been well enough disposed toward Jack, now turned  hard and inimical faces against him, and hastened to lend Jean Paul their aid.  All this while Garrod sat in his chair staring dully before him.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s hands clenched, and his  eyes shot out cold sparks. &ldquo;Keep your hands off me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul with an air of bravado  motioned Vassall and Ferrie back. To outward appearances he was fully Jack&rsquo;s  match. Lacking an inch or two of his height, he more than made it up in breadth  of trunk, and length of arm. He slowly approached the white man, alert and  smiling evilly. For a moment they measured each other warily, Jean Paul  crouching, Jack upright. Then the half-breed sprang forward. Jack drew off, and  his fist shot out. There was the crack of bone on bone, and Jean Paul measured  his length on the grass. He twisted a few times, and lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Vassall and  Ferrie, falling back. They were not muscular men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; said Jack  off-hand. &ldquo;A bucket of water will bring him to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack walked to the door with none  to hinder. Holding up the flap, he faced them. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m  going to run,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to do anything that would suit you so  well. I&rsquo;m going to fight for my good name, and my claims, and my girl, and the  whole government of Athabasca can&rsquo;t stop </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>XII<br>
  Jack Finds Out</b></h3>
<p>Dinner-time came and went at Camp  Trangmar without any one&rsquo;s feeling much interested except the four Indian lads  who ate largely, to the accompaniment of chatter and laughter by their own  fire. It was nothing to them what high words were passed, and what tears were  shed in the big tent. They were making the most of such a time of plenty as had  never come their way before, and was not likely to be repeated.</p>
<p>By the cook-fire Humpy Jull  exerted himself to tempt his hero&rsquo;s appetite &mdash; not wholly without success, it  must be said; for what had happened could not check the coursing of the blood  through Jack&rsquo;s veins. Twenty-five years old must be fed though the heavens  fall. Gabriel&rsquo;s trumpet had better not be sounded for the young until after  dinner. Jack ate silently and scowlingly. To one of his nature it was galling  when there was so much to be overcome, not to be up and doing, not to be able  to strike a blow.</p>
<p>Afterward the trees up the trail  suffered for his wrath. Having eased his breast a little, he sat down to find a  way out. Here, being a hewer instead of a thinker, he was at a disadvantage. He  was conscious of an anomaly somewhere. He was in perfect condition; to fill his  chest, and to stretch his muscles afforded him a keen sting of pleasure, but  wind and limb availed him nothing against the subtle moral complications that  beset him. It was one thing to defy the government of Athabasca in a bold  voice, and another thing to find a vulnerable spot to hit the creature.</p>
<p>He was sitting with his chin in  his palms, considering this, when Kate Worsley approached him from behind, and  spoke his name. He sprang up, scowling. Linda was waiting a little way off.  &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Another scene to go through with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Worsley was always simple in  manner, and direct of speech. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she said at once, &ldquo;Linda has told me  everything that has happened between you, and I do not blame you as much as I  did at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, looking away,  and speaking gruffly as he was obliged to do when he was moved. &ldquo;I value your  good opinion, Mrs. Worsley. I don&rsquo;t think of you like the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking you into my  confidence,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I am in a difficult position. Linda is terribly  distressed by what has happened. She begged so to be allowed to see you for a  moment, that I was afraid if I refused &mdash; well, I have brought her on my own  responsibility. You will not say anything to her to make me sorry I brought  her, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;Nor Sir Bryson. I can&rsquo;t say it properly, but I shall not have anything  to do with her until I can come out in the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you felt that way,&rdquo; she  said quietly. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s no use telling Sir Bryson in his present state of  mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hates me,&rdquo; said Jack frowning.  &ldquo;His kind always does. He won&rsquo;t give me a chance, and I say things that only  make matters worse.&rdquo; He rubbed his furrowed forehead with his knuckle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a  rotten, mixed-up mess, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said with an appealing look.</p>
<p>Her eyes softened. His strength  and his weakness appealed alike to the woman in her. Her hand went out  impulsively. &ldquo;You boy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack, wondering what was no  wonder, grabbed her hand, and pressed it until she winced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can help you, come to me,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, anyway,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But  nobody can, I suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now talk to Linda,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Be  gentle with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack frowned. &ldquo;I told her not to  say anything,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; she said  cajolingly. &ldquo;But you are strong; be merciful with her weakness. Make allowances  for women&rsquo;s nerves and emotions. It was a terrible scene on us all; most of all  on her. She was foolish; but there was a kind of bravery, too, in avowing you  before them all. Think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she only had your sense,&rdquo; said  Jack.</p>
<p>Kate smiled and turned away. &ldquo;What  do you expect?&rdquo; she said over her shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirty-eight years old, and I  was always plain! Linda!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Three minutes only, remember.&rdquo; She  walked away.</p>
<p>Linda came running, and cast  herself in Jack&rsquo;s arms, weeping, protesting, scarcely coherent. &ldquo;Oh, Jack! I  had to see you! I was terrified, thinking of your anger! That woman enrages me  so! I can&rsquo;t think! What did you give her a mining-claim for? If you&rsquo;d only love  me more, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so jealous of her. I didn&rsquo;t mean to injure you! You know  I&rsquo;d never do that! Don&rsquo;t be angry with me. I&rsquo;ve disgraced myself forever with  them, and if you go back on me too, what will I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was he to do with the  helpless, contrite little thing but comfort her? His arms closed around her.  &ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m going back on you?&rdquo; he muttered gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more than I deserve after  disobeying you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I was such a fool! I&rsquo;m so sorry! Say you forgive  me, Jack. I&rsquo;ll do better after this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive you right away,&rdquo;  he said with his awkward honesty. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going back on anything. Don&rsquo;t  distress yourself like this. Everything will come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But love me a little,&rdquo; she  begged, lifting her tear-stained face.</p>
<p>He put her away not ungently. &ldquo;We  mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, gripping his  arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Mrs. Worsley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; he said  uncomfortably. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that if there is any &mdash; well, love-making between  us, it makes me out a villain to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Not if I make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack began to sense that father  and daughter had an exasperating trait in common, the inability to see a thing  they did not wish to see. &ldquo;I should be blamed, anyway,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell everybody the  truth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed of you. They shall see that I have chosen  you of my own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done harm enough,&rdquo; said  Jack grimly. &ldquo;Better not say anything more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she whimpered.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face became hard. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> care,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Understand, we have  got to cut all this out. No one, not even a woman, can make me do what I don&rsquo;t  choose to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, don&rsquo;t speak to me like  that,&rdquo; she murmured terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought it on yourself,&rdquo; he  said miserably. &ldquo;You always seem to make me  stubborn and hateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do love me?&rdquo; she said  desperately.</p>
<p>He inwardly groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  going back on anything,&rdquo; he said lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough,&rdquo; she said,  beginning to tremble again. &ldquo;It would kill me if you didn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ll never have  anything to do with me again. I have no one but you. You must love me. You do  love me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I love you,&rdquo; he said  with a strange sinking of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do whatever you tell  me,&rdquo; she said submissively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more talks off by ourselves,&rdquo;  said Jack. &ldquo;And around camp you must treat me exactly the same as the other  men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you shouldn&rsquo;t succeed in  proving&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will&rdquo;</i> said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up, Linda,&rdquo; said Kate,  coming back.</p>
<p>Linda kissed him in spite of  himself, and hurried away. Jack breathed a sigh of relief, and took up his axe  again.</p>
<p>At the top of the bench a few  hundred yards from where Jack was working, the trail from over the portage  divided. One branch came down to Camp Trangmar and the river; the other turned  west along the edge of the bench, and became the Fort Erskine trail. A mile or  two up the valley the latter was joined by the trail that led directly west from  Camp Trangmar.</p>
<p>As Jack stood breathing himself  after a spell of chopping, he became aware of the sound of horses&rsquo; footfalls  coming along the Fort Erskine trail. There was no sound of a bell. Struck by  this fact, he bent his head to listen attentively. It is exceptional for the  horses to stray away from the one of their number who is belled. Moreover, to  Jack&rsquo;s experienced ears, these had the sound of laden horses. He could not  guess who it might be, but Indians or whites, they would hardly ride so near to  Camp Trangmar without coming in, unless they had a reason to avoid observation.  He therefore dropped his axe, and ran up the hill to intercept, whoever was  coming, and make them account for themselves.</p>
<p>At the forks of the trail to his  astonishment he came face to face with Mary and Davy mounted, and leading their  two pack-horses. The bell of the leading horse had been silenced with a wisp of  grass. At the sight of Jack they pulled up in obvious embarrassment. Jack&rsquo;s  heart went down like a stone in deep water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling out?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else was there for us to  do?&rdquo; said Mary coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without telling me?&rdquo; cried Jack  reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; put in Davy eagerly. &ldquo;Mary said we had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pride, indignation, and exquisite  discomfort struggled in Mary&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It seemed easier,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry  we met you. There&rsquo;s nothing to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mary &mdash; Mary!&rdquo; urged Jack,  scarcely knowing what he said, but filled with his need of her. &ldquo;Not like this!  Wait until to-morrow. Who knows what may happen to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can happen?&rdquo; said Mary.  &ldquo;More humiliating scenes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack caught her bridle rein. &ldquo;I  swear to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if Sir Bryson or any of the men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of them,&rdquo; Mary  interrupted. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop <i>her</i> tongue. You&rsquo;ve given her the right to speak that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack hung his head. Like a man  under the circumstances he muttered: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty hard on a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard?&rdquo; cried Mary sharply. &ldquo;What  do you think I &mdash;&rdquo; She checked herself with an odd smile.</p>
<p>Jack was determined to be  aggrieved. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfriendly,&rdquo; he burst out; &ldquo;stealing out of camp by a  roundabout way like this and even muffling your bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said!&rdquo; put in Davy.</p>
<p>Mary flashed a hurt look at Davy  that forgave him while she accused. That he should take sides against her at  such a moment &mdash; but of course he was only a child. She was silent. Swallowing  the lump in her throat, she looked away over the little valley and the river  for support. All three of them looked at the lovely scene below them, softened  and silvered in the creeping twilight, each wondering miserably what had  happened to the joy of life.</p>
<p>At last Mary said quietly: &ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t easy to decide what to do. I have to think of myself. I have to think of  father, what he would like. There is nothing else. I am sorry. You and I cannot  be friends. We might as well make up our minds to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we be?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have chosen a girl  that will not allow you to have another woman for a friend,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>This was unanswerable. Jack could  only hang his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be friends with you  secretly,&rdquo; Mary went on. &ldquo;Nor can I lay myself open to her abuse. So we must  not see each other any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need you!&rdquo; Jack blurted out.  His pride was hauled down. It was the first appeal for help that had passed his  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she faltered, but  without relenting. &ldquo;Watch Jean Paul well,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t keep the man  hypnotized always. Get Garrod away from him if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack scarcely heard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m under  arrest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving me without a friend in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have her,&rdquo; said Mary softly,  with an indescribable look; compassion, reproach or disdain &mdash; or all three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; he burst out.</p>
<p>She jerked her bridle rein out of  his hand, and clapped heels to her horse&rsquo;s ribs. &ldquo;This does no good,&rdquo; she  muttered. &ldquo;And it hurts! Come, Davy.&rdquo; She loped out of sight among the trees.</p>
<p>Davy lingered. Leaning out of the  saddle he put his arm around Jack&rsquo;s shoulders. The boy was near tears. &ldquo;Jack,  what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he begged to know. &ldquo;I want to stay. I feel so bad about it.  I don&rsquo;t understand. Why can&rsquo;t we be friends like we were before? Mary won&rsquo;t  tell me anything. We think such a heap of you, Jack. The other girl &mdash; she&rsquo;s  nothing to you, is she? Mary&rsquo;s worth a dozen of her. There&rsquo;s nobody like Mary. Why  can&rsquo;t you and Mary &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was like a knife turned in  Jack&rsquo;s breast. &ldquo;Get along with you!&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what  you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Disengaging himself from the boy&rsquo;s arm, he clapped the  horse&rsquo;s haunch, and the animal sprang ahead. The pack-horses lumped after.</p>
<p>When they were out of sight Jack  flung himself full length in the grass with his face in his arms. Now he knew.  This pain in his breast was the thing they called love. Blind fool that he had  been, he had dismissed her with the light term &ldquo;native girl,&rdquo; and had not seen  that it was a woman in a thousand, the woman his manhood had always been  unconsciously yearning for, generous, true and lovely. She rode away, dragging  his heart after her. He was tied fast. The pain of it was insupportable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! how did I ever get into  it!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;What a price to pay for a kiss in the dark!&rdquo; </p>

  The Retreat</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;Two days passed at Camp Trangmar. There was  little outward evidence of the several storms that agitated the breasts of the  company. The men left Jack severely alone, and Jack for his own part took care  to keep out of Linda&rsquo;s way. He made it his business to watch Garrod, visiting  him night and day in Jean Paul&rsquo;s tent, careless of the owner. There was no  change in Garrod&rsquo;s condition. Jean Paul sheered off at Jack&rsquo;s approach like the  wary animal he was. Meanwhile Sir Bryson, Baldwin Ferrie, and the Indians were  busy staking out additional claims along Tetrahedron creek.</p>
<p>On the third morning the camp was  plunged into a fresh agitation. Jack and Humpy Jull were breakfasting by the  cook-fire, Jack looking like a sulky young Olympian in the morning sunlight,  and Humpy naively trying to cheer him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I had your  looks and figger I wouldn&rsquo;t care about nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack, who disdained the false  modesty that disclaims such tributes with a simper, merely held out his plate  for porridge. </p>
<p>Suddenly Vassall came quickly  across the grass. His face was pale and streaked from the effects of nervous  emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Bryson wants you,&rdquo; he said to  Jack.</p>
<p>Jack continued to eat leisurely.  &ldquo;What about?&rdquo; he asked, coolly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no mind to stand up and be abused again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garrod is gone,&rdquo; said Vassall.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s indifference vanished like  sleight of hand. He sprang up. &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
<p>He headed straight for the big  tent, Vassall following, and Humpy Jull looking after them both with round  eyes.</p>
<p>The inside of the big tent  presented evidences of confusion. Breakfast was spread on the two little tables  pushed together, and Linda, Mrs. Worsley, and Baldwin Ferrie were seated,  playing with their food. Sir Bryson&rsquo;s chair was pushed back, and his napkin lay  on the grass. The little man was agitatedly walking up and down. Jean Paul  stood by with a deferential air.</p>
<p>This time Linda gave no sign at  Jack&rsquo;s entrance except for an access of self-consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about this?&rdquo; Sir  Bryson immediately demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I  have come to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garrod has escaped,&rdquo; said Sir  Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Jack bitterly. &ldquo;He  ought to have been secured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul spoke up. &ldquo;I get no  order to tie him,&rdquo; he said smoothly. &ldquo;He all time ver&rsquo; quiet. I mak&rsquo; him sleep  inside me, and I tie a buckskin lace from him to me. If he move a little I  wake. This morning when I wake, the lace cut and him gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you let him keep a knife,  too?&rdquo; asked Jack, sneering.</p>
<p>Jean Paul looked confused. &ldquo;He got  no knife w&rsquo;en I look on him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds fishy,&rdquo; said Jack  scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to imply &mdash;&rdquo; began Sir  Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Paul sleeps like a cat,&rdquo;  Jack went on. &ldquo;If so much as a stick turns in the fire he wakes and looks to  see. Follow it out for yourselves. He can&rsquo;t keep the man hypnotized forever.  And once Garrod comes to his senses, the truth comes out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are empty accusations,&rdquo;  puffed Sir Bryson. &ldquo;The poor fellow has wandered away in his distraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or been carried,&rdquo; Jack amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; said Sir Bryson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re  all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are Sapi Indians a few  miles west,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Jean Paul is a power in the tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, your excellency,&rdquo;  purred Jean Paul, &ldquo;if I do this, I not stay be&rsquo;ind myself me, to get your  punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy, Jean Paul,&rdquo;  said Sir Bryson graciously. &ldquo;This fellow attempts to twist everything that  happens, to his own advantage. I commend your ingenuity, young sir,&rdquo; he added  sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time!&rdquo; cried Jack  with an impatient gesture. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to be found! Whatever you choose to think  of me, you can safely leave that in my hands. It means more to me than to any  one else. It means everything to me to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Paul says the horses have  strayed &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses, too?&rdquo; cried Jack. The  half-breed&rsquo;s eyes quailed under the fiery question that Jack&rsquo;s eyes bent on  him. Without another word Jack turned and ran out of the tent.</p>
<p>In half an hour he was back &mdash; with  a grim face. The occupants of the big tent were much as he had left them, but  Jack sensed from the increased agitation of their faces, and from Jean Paul&rsquo;s  sleekness, that the half-breed had not failed to improve the interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jack shortly.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been driven off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had a terrifying sound to them.  They looked at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found their tracks on the Fort  Erskine trail,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;They were travelling at a dead run. The tracks  were six hours old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson stopped his pacing.  &ldquo;Driven off?&rdquo; he said agitatedly. &ldquo;Are you sure? Couldn&rsquo;t they have run off by  themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but they  didn&rsquo;t. Five of the horses were hobbled when we turned them out. The hobbles  had been removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; stammered Sir  Bryson, &ldquo;what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take ten days&rsquo; grub from  the store,&rdquo; said Jack &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake to bring Garrod back, and at least some  of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d follow on foot?&rdquo; Linda  burst out.</p>
<p>Jack answered to Sir Bryson. &ldquo;They  can&rsquo;t travel fast with their families and baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not Jack&rsquo;s safety that Sir  Bryson was concerned about. &ldquo;But &mdash; but, leave us here without horses?&rdquo; he  faltered.</p>
<p>Jack smiled a little. &ldquo;What good  am I to you? I&rsquo;m under arrest. Jean Paul has your ear. Why won&rsquo;t he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson gave no sign of hearing  this. &ldquo;We must return,&rdquo; he said nervously. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here &mdash; without  horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s heart sank. &ldquo;What have the  horses got to do with it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe here. You&rsquo;ve grub enough for  months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson looked at the  half-breed. &ldquo;Jean Paul says perhaps it is the Indians,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He thinks  they may have driven off the horses as a preliminary to attacking us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not say that, me,&rdquo; put in Jean  Paul quickly. &ldquo;I jus&rsquo; say best to be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s his game,&rdquo; cried Jack  scornfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fooling you! It&rsquo;s an old redskin trick to drive off the  horses to prevent pursuit. But as to standing up to white men &mdash; well, I&rsquo;m  willing to go and take my man and my horses away from the whole village of  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson violently shook his  head. Jack saw that the fate of Garrod had little weight with him. &ldquo;We are  quite defenceless!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And with the women to look after! It is my duty  to start back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s lip curled.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson&rsquo;s voice scaled up  shrilly. &ldquo;How will we ever get back?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Twelve  miles walk over the portage to Fort Geikie, then by raft down the river. We&rsquo;ll  make it in two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we start this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack flushed. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Abandon  our outfit! That would be disgraceful. It would be the joke of the country. I  won&rsquo;t be a party to it! We&rsquo;ll cache the stuff to-day, and you can start  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson  nervously. &ldquo;In the meantime we must keep a sharp lookout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Jack left him he made  another appeal to be allowed to go after Garrod. He might as well have saved  his breath. Sir Bryson and those with him, except perhaps Mrs. Worsley, were in  the grip of panic. It was futile to try to reassure those whose notions of  Indians had been gathered from the Wild West fiction of a preceding generation.</p>
<p>Jack came out of the tent sore all  the way through. Taking them down to the Fort would cost him five precious  days. True, he could get horses there, and perhaps assistance if he needed it,  but the waste of five days was maddening.</p>
<p>Jack thought for a moment of  defying Sir Bryson, and going anyway. But he put it from him. Any white man who  abandoned a party that he had bound himself to guide, no matter what the  circumstances might be, would be disgraced forever in the North. It is a  situation which simply does not admit of argument. This sense of  guide-responsibility is strong among white men, because the natives are without  it. They are prone to shuffle off disagreeable burdens on the slightest  provocation.</p>
<p>Jack set to work with a sullen  will. He took out his soreness in hard work and in making the Indian lads work.  Hard and long-continued exertion was a disagreeable novelty to them; before  many hours had passed they were sullen too.</p>
<p>An axe party was immediately  dispatched into the bush, and by noon enough stout poplar logs were cut and  trimmed and drawn into camp to make a small shack. By supper-time the walls  were raised, and the roof of poles laid and covered with thick sods. The  remaining hours of daylight were occupied in storing everything they possessed  inside. It was ten o&rsquo;clock before they knocked off work. Meanwhile Sir Bryson,  to Jack&rsquo;s scornful amusement, had insisted on posting Vassall and Ferrie as  outposts against a surprise.</p>
<p>Next morning the governor was  plunged into a fresh panic by the loss of the four Indian lads. No one saw them  go. They melted out of camp, one by one, and were seen no more. Jack was not  greatly surprised; he had seen premonitory symptoms the day before. It was  additional evidence to him that the other Indians were still in the  neighbourhood, and he was more than ever chagrined to be obliged to retreat  without even an attempt to recover Garrod.</p>
<p>Jack kept out of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s way.  In spite of themselves, however, the white men leaned on Jack more and more.  Their imaginary redskin peril strengthened the race feeling, and Jack&rsquo;s energy  and resourcefulness were indispensable to them. They came to him sheepishly for  aid, but they came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this  desertion?&rdquo; Vassall asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Jean Paul has a hand in it, because it&rsquo;s his game to get us out as  quickly as he can. They probably vamoosed of their own accord. When we lost the  horses, they saw the end of their good times. They&rsquo;ve been fed too high. It  makes &rsquo;em beany, like horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;ll we do without them?&rdquo;  Vassall asked.</p>
<p>Jack guessed that the question  came from Sir Bryson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the old gentleman to keep  his shirt on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re no great loss. It means  that we&rsquo;ll all have to carry a little more across the portage, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast the tents were  taken down and stored with the last of the camp impedimenta in the cache. When  everything had been put inside, the door was fastened with a hasp and staple  removed from one of the boxes, and Jack pocketed the key. The loads were then  apportioned and packed, a long job when six of the eight were totally  inexperienced. Sir Bryson was still looking over his shoulder apprehensively.  At eleven o&rsquo;clock they finally set out.</p>
<p>It was a quaintly assorted little  procession that wound in single file along the firmly beaten brown trail  through the willow scrub and among the white-stemmed poplars. There was a  lieutenant-governor carrying a pack, and striving ineffectually to maintain his  dignity under it; and there was his daughter likewise with a blanket strapped  on her shoulders, and an olive-wood jewel-case in her hand, with a gold clasp.  Jack smiled a little grimly at the idea of a jewel-case being toted through the  bush.</p>
<p>Everybody carried a pack  conformable to his strength. Since the two women and Sir Bryson could take so  little, the others were fairly well laden. Jean Paul at the head, and Jack  bringing up the rear, toted the lion&rsquo;s share. Besides blankets, the outfit  consisted of food sufficient for five days, cooking and eating utensils, guns,  ammunition, and axes. Jack had a coil of light rope to aid in building his  raft.</p>
<p>Jack put Vassall next behind Jean  Paul, with a word in his ear to watch the half-breed. Jack felt, somehow, that  no serious harm was likely to befall Garrod so long as he had Jean Paul safely  under his eye. After Vassall the others strung along the trail, with Humpy  Jull, the oddest figure of all, marching in front of Jack, looking like an  animated tinware shop with his pots and pans hanging all over him.</p>
<p>They started in good enough  spirits, for the sun was shining, and the packs felt of no weight at all. But  on the little hills their legs inexplicably caved in; their breath failed them,  and the burdens suddenly increased enormously in weight. It was a long time  since hard labour had caused Sir Bryson to perspire, and the novel sensation  afforded him both discomfort and indignation. Two miles an hour was the best  they could do, counting in frequent pauses for rest. The twelve miles stretched  out into an all-day affair.</p>
<p>Once, toward the end of the  afternoon, they came to the bank of a small stream, and throwing off their  burdens, cast themselves down in the grass beside it, all alike and equal in  their weariness. Sir Bryson was no longer a knight and a governor, but only the  smallest man of the party, rather pathetic in his fatigue. They were too tired  to talk; only Jack moved about restlessly. The slowness of the pace had tired  him more than the seventy-five pounds he carried.</p>
<p>As Jack passed near Kate and Linda  the latter said petulantly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, Jack. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s heart sank, but nothing of  it showed in his face. The little thing&rsquo;s look of appeal always reproached him.  To a man of his type there is something shameful and wrong in not being able to  give a woman more than she looks for. &ldquo;Lord! it&rsquo;s not her fault,&rdquo; he would tell  himself; and &ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m going through with it, I must make a good job of  it!&rdquo; So he plumped down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as far as you like,&rdquo; he said  with a kind of hangdog facetiousness. &ldquo;Everybody can see, and Mrs. Worsley is  standing guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I  want to put my head on your shoulder.&rdquo; She looked at the spot she had chosen.</p>
<p>Jack became restive. &ldquo;Easy there,&rdquo;  he said uncomfortably. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting the compact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s eyes slowly filled with  tears. &ldquo;Hang the compact,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry your blanket the rest  of the way,&rdquo; Jack said gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a perfectly enormous load already.&rdquo; .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! that featherweight won&rsquo;t  make any difference,&rdquo; he said, and tied it to his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet hurt me,&rdquo; wailed Linda.</p>
<p>Jack frowned at the elegant little  affairs Linda called her &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; shoes. &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Trying to hit  the trail on stilts. Put out your foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His axe lay near. Firmly grasping  her ankle, with a single stroke he guillotined the greater part of the  elevating heel. Linda and Kate both screamed a little at the suddenness of the  action, and Linda looked down horrified, as if she expected to see the blood  gush forth. Jack laughed, and performed a like operation on the other foot. For  the next hundred yards she swore she could not walk at all, but the benefit of  the amputation gradually became apparent.</p>
<p>Never was such a long twelve  miles. Finally, when most of them had given up hope of ever making an end to  this journey, they debouched on the grassy esplanade surrounding the shacks of  Fort Geikie. Humpy Jull set about getting dinner, while Jack and Jean Paul cut  poplar saplings and constructed a leafy shelter for Linda and Kate. The  business of camp had to be carried on; no one seeing these people travelling,  and eating together, and sleeping around the same fire, could have guessed how  their hearts were divided.</p>
<p>They were ready for sleep  immediately after eating. Linda and Kate disappeared, and the men rolled up in  their blankets, Sir Bryson grumbling. He felt that another little shelter  should have been made for him. He found it very trying to be obliged to snore  in public among his servants.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson insisted that a watch  be maintained throughout the night, and Jack, who would have laughed at any  other time, fell in with the idea, because he had a notion that Jean Paul might  try to slip away.</p>
<p>Jack arranged therefore that the  half-breed keep the first watch, and, at no little pain and difficulty, he  remained awake himself to watch Jean Paul. At eleven Jean Paul wakened Humpy  Jull; at one, Vassall took Humpy&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Jack had left instructions that he  was to be roused at three. It was already broad day at this hour. Upon  Vassall&rsquo;s touch he staggered to his feet under the burden of sleep and walked  blindly up and down until he had shaken it off. He went to the edge of the bank  to take a prospect, Vassall at his elbow. A better understanding was coming  about between these two. Vassall made no pretence that he had forgiven Jack for  burglarizing Linda&rsquo;s affections, as he thought, but granting that, he, Vassall,  was doing all he could do to bear his share of their common burden.</p>
<p>A lovely panorama of river,  islands, and hills lay before them in the cool, pure, morning light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cross to the  island,&rdquo; Jack said, pointing. &ldquo;In the drift-pile on the bar there, there&rsquo;s dry  wood enough for a dozen rafts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you get over there?&rdquo;  asked Vassall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared at the slender, pale  young city man. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said with a not very flattering intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, I&rsquo;m not going to let  you do everything,&rdquo; Vassall said, frowning. &ldquo;I can swim. It&rsquo;s one of the few  things I can do that is useful up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much of a swim,&rdquo; said  Jack. &ldquo;The current carries us. I&rsquo;ll tow the axe on a stick or two. But the  water&rsquo;s like ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stand if it you can,&rdquo;  Vassall said doggedly.</p>
<p>Jack looked at him with a gleam of  approval. &ldquo;Come on and feed then,&rdquo; he said off-hand.</p>
<p>They wakened Baldwin Ferrie to  stand the last watch, and sat down to the cold victuals Humpy had left for them.  In front of them the other men still slept, an odd sight, the three of them  rolled up like corpses in a row in the morning light: lieutenant-governor,  half-breed, and cook, as much alike as three trussed chickens.</p>
<p>While Jack ate, he issued his  instructions to Ferrie: &ldquo;Wake Humpy at five, and tell him to get a move on with  breakfast. As soon as Vassall and I knock the raft together, we&rsquo;ll cross back  to this side, but the current will carry us down about a third of a mile. When  the rest of you have finished eating, pack up and come down to the shore.  You&rsquo;ll have to walk along the stones to the first big point on this side. Bald  Point, they call it, because of the trees being burned off. Lose no time,  because we must be started by eight, if we mean to make Fort Cheever by dark.&rdquo;  Jack and Vassall, clad only in shirt, trousers, and moccasins, scrambled down  the steep bank to the water&rsquo;s edge. Vassall looked at the swirling green flood  with a shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie your moccasins around your  neck,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your other things on.  They&rsquo;ll soon dry as we work around. Head straight out into midstream, and  you&rsquo;ll find the current will ground you on the point of the bar below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water gripped them with icy  fingers that squeezed all the breath out of their lungs. Vassall set his teeth  hard, and struck out after Jack. They were both livid and numb when they  finally landed, and Jack forced Vassall to run up and down the bar with him,  until the blood began to stir in their veins again. Then they attacked the  tangled pile of drift logs.</p>
<p>Eight bleached trunks as heavy as  they could pry loose and roll down to the water&rsquo;s edge provided the  displacement of the raft. Jack chopped them to an equal length, and laced them  together with his rope. On these they laid several cross-pieces, and on the  cross-pieces, in turn, a floor of light poles, the whole stoutly lashed  together. The outfit was completed by two roughly hewn sweeps and a pair of  clumsy trestles in which to swing them. They were greatly handicapped by the  lack of an auger and of hammer and nails, and the result of their labour was  more able than shipshape. Four strenuous hours went to the making of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hold,&rdquo; said Jack at last,  &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t hit anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed off, and each wielding  a sweep, pulled her back toward the shore they had started from. They both  watched her narrowly, not a little proud of their handiwork. At least she  floated high and dry, and answered, though sluggishly, to the sweeps. Their  common feeling made Jack and Vassall quite friendly for the moment.</p>
<p>The little group was already  waiting for them on the stones, with the slender baggage. Apprehension is  quicker than the physical senses. Before he could see what was the matter, Jack  sensed that something had happened, and a sharp anxiety attacked him. As he and  Vassall drew near the shore he scanned the waiting group closely; he counted  them, and then it became clear! There were only five waiting instead of six!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jean Paul?&rdquo; he cried out.</p>
<p>The people on the shore looked at  each other uncomfortably. There was no answer until the raft grounded on the  stones. Then Sir Bryson drew himself up and puffed out his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked my permission to remain  to search for poor Garrod,&rdquo; he said in his most hoity-toity manner. &ldquo;And I  thought best to accede to his request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s jaw dropped. For an instant  he could not believe his ears. Then he slowly turned white and hard. So this  was what he got for spending his strength in their service! This was what he  had to deal with: folly and self-sufficiency that passed belief! He was angrier  than he had ever been in his life before. He was much too angry to speak. He  stepped ashore, and walked away from them, struggling with himself.</p>
<p>Sir Bryson strutted and puffed and  blew for the benefit of all observers. His secret dismay was none the less  apparent. None looked at him. They were gazing fearfully at Jack&rsquo;s ominous  back.</p>
<p>He came back with a set, white  face. &ldquo;Sir Bryson,&rdquo; he said in a voice vibrating with quiet, harsh scorn, &ldquo;I  say nothing about myself. Apart from that I&rsquo;ve shown you clearly, and these  people are witnesses to it, that this half-breed means Garrod no good. So be  it. If he does for him now, it will be on your head.&rdquo; In spite of his bluster,  Sir Bryson began to look like a frightened small boy.</p>
<p>Linda was weeping with anger and  fright. &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate, fearful of another outburst,  laid a restraining hand on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your raft,&rdquo; Jack went on  harshly. &ldquo;All you have to do is to sit on it and keep it in the middle of the  river and you&rsquo;ll be at Fort Cheever before dark. After letting the breed go,  the least you can do is to let me stay and watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all cried out against this,  even Kate and Vassall, whom Jack thought he could count on a little. They all  spoke at once in confused tones of remonstrance and alarm. &ldquo;What would we do  without you? We don&rsquo;t know the river. We can&rsquo;t handle a raft,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Above all the others Sir Bryson&rsquo;s  voice was heard trembling with alarm and anger: &ldquo;Would you desert us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word brought the blood surging  back into Jack&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Desert nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I asked your permission. I  do not desert. Get aboard everybody, and hand on the bundles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They scrambled at his tone, a good  deal like sheep. Jack launched the raft with a great heave of his back, running  out into the water, thigh deep. Clambering on board, he picked up a sweep, and  brought her around in the current. Sir Bryson and the others stole disconcerted  sides glances at his hard and bitter face. There is something very intimidating  in the spectacle of a righteous anger pent in a strong breast. The spectator is  inclined to duck his head, and wonder where the bolt will fall. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>XIV<br>
  Bear&rsquo;s Flesh And Berries</b></h3>
<p>Jack propelled the raft into the  middle of the current, and, taking the sweep aboard, sat down on the end of it  with his back to the others, and nursed his anger. They sat or lay on the poles  in various uneasy positions. Sir Bryson, who, until the day before, had  probably not been obliged to sit in man&rsquo;s originally intended sitting position  for upward of thirty years, felt the indignity keenly.</p>
<p>Every one&rsquo;s nerves were more or  less stretched out of tune. Linda, watching Jack&rsquo;s uncompromising back with  apprehensive eyes, was exasperated past bearing by her father&rsquo;s fretful  complaints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she burst out.  &ldquo;A padded chair? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson swelled and snorted.  &ldquo;That is no way to speak to your father, Belinda. Because you see me robbed of  my outward and visible dignity is no reason for your forgetting the respect you  owe me. I am surprised at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s muttered reply was  forcible and inelegant. None of the others paid any attention. Sir Bryson,  feeling perhaps that a magisterial air accorded ill with his tousled hair and his  cross-legged position, made a bid for sympathy instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet are going to sleep,&rdquo; he  said plaintively.</p>
<p>Jack, overhearing, was reminded  again of the resemblance between father and daughter. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to sit  still,&rdquo; he said, speaking over his shoulder. &ldquo;You can move about as long as you  don&rsquo;t all get on the same side at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson, who would not have  been robbed of his grievance for any consideration, continued to sit and suffer  dramatically.</p>
<p>Vassall&rsquo;s head was heavy.  Stretching himself out, and watching Linda wistfully, he finally fell asleep.  Humpy Jull, up at the bow &mdash; if a raft may be said to have a bow &mdash; constructed a  fishing line out of a bent pin and a moccasin lace, and baiting it with a  morsel of bacon, fished for hours with the trusting confidence of a child.  Discouraged at last, he fell asleep beside Vassall.</p>
<p>Thus the morning passed. Left to  its own devices, the raft swung around and back in the eddying current, and a  superb panorama was ceaselessly and slowly unrolled for any who cared to see.  The river moved down through its vast trough in the prairie, and an  ever-changing vista of high hills, or seeming hills, hemmed them in. On the  southerly side the hills were timbered for the most part. On the northerly  side, where the sun beat all day, the steep slopes were bare, and the rich  grass made vivid velvety effects darkened in the hollows and touched with gold  on the knolls. The whole made a green symphony, comprising every note in the  scale of green from the sombre spruce boughs up through the milky emerald of  the river water to the high verdancy of the sunny grass and the delicate poplar  foliage.</p>
<p>Of them all only Kate Worsley  watched it as if the sight was enough to repay one for the discomfort of  sitting on poles. Her quiet eyes were lifted to the hills with the look of one  storing away something to remember.</p>
<p>Now and then a momentary  excitement was created by the sight of a bear grubbing about the roots of the  poplar saplings, homely, comical beasts with their clumsy ways and their  expression of pretended cuteness. Something still wild in the breasts of  domesticated creatures like ourselves never fails to answer to the sight of a  real wild thing at home in his own place. Since they had no time to go ashore  in case of a hit, no shots were fired.</p>
<p>Once in the middle of the day they  landed long enough for Jack to build a hearth of flat stones on Humpy&rsquo;s end of  the raft, and cover it with clay. Then, gathering a little store of wood, they  pushed off again, and Humpy built his fire, and boiled his kettle while they  floated down.</p>
<p>After lunch Jack&rsquo;s anger was no  longer sufficient to keep his neck stiff. He had been up since three that  morning, and in spite of himself he began to nod. Vassall volunteered to keep  watch while he slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do as long as  she keeps the middle of the stream,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;If she drifts to one side or  the other wake me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched himself out, and in  spite of the cobbly nature of his bed, immediately fell asleep. Linda watched  him with the tears threatening to spring. He had not spoken to her since they  started, and indeed had scarcely seemed to be aware of her. She glanced at the  others with rebellious brows. If it were not for them, she thought, the tawny  head might be pillowed in her lap.</p>
<p>Another hour dragged out its slow  length. Kate Worsley out of pity for Sir Bryson&rsquo;s increasing peevishness  proposed a game of bridge. It was hailed with alacrity. A sweater was spread  for a cloth; Sir Bryson, Kate, Baldwin Ferrie, and Vassall squatted around it,  and the cards were dealt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; exclaimed Vassall,  looking around. &ldquo;Rather different from a game in the library at Government  House, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And different looking players,&rdquo;  suggested Kate with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel it very keenly, Mrs.  Worsley,&rdquo; said Sir Bryson tearfully. &ldquo;I have always attached great importance  to the little details of one&rsquo;s personal appearance. Perhaps it is a weakness.  But that is the way I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat &mdash; I  mean raft,&rdquo; said Mrs. Worsley cheerfully. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make it no trumps,&rdquo; said  Baldwin Ferrie.</p>
<p>Linda, seeing the others fully  occupied, moved nearer to Jack, and lay down where, making believe to be asleep  herself, she could watch his face, calm and glowing in sleep, the lashes lying  on his cheeks, the thin nostrils, the firm, red line of his lips. If he had  only slept with his mouth open, or had snored, it might have broken the spell  that held her, and a deal of trouble been saved. Unfortunately he slept  beautifully; and if that was not enough, once he smiled vaguely like a sleeping  baby, and changed his position a little with a sigh of content. The sight of  her strong man in his helplessness affected the girl powerfully; when he moved,  her heart set up a great beating, and the alarmed blood, tingled to her  finger-tips.</p>
<p>During this time but an  indifferent watch was kept. Humpy Jull had fallen asleep again. There seemed  little need to watch on such a voyage. True, they had passed little reefs and  stretches of broken water where the swift current met obstructions inshore, but  there had been no disturbance that extended out into midstream. The raft was  carried down squarely in the middle of the channel.</p>
<p>Once when it came to Vassall&rsquo;s  turn to be dummy, he stood up to stretch his legs and look about him. A short  distance ahead he saw that the invariably earthy slope of the hills was broken  by an outcropping of rock on either side. The band of rock evidently crossed  the river, for in the middle a ragged islet of rock stuck its head out of the  water.</p>
<p>Vassall debated on which side of  the rock they ought to pass with the raft. To a riverman the &ldquo;middle of the  stream&rdquo; means the main sweep of the current of course. Vassall was not a  riverman and he did not observe that the greater body of water made off to the  left and around that side of the island. The channel on the right-hand side  stretched straight ahead of them, wide and apparently smooth, and to Vassall  this looked like the &ldquo;middle of the stream.&rdquo; If he had left the raft alone the  current of its own accord would have carried it around to the left, but he ran  out a sweep and pulled her to the other side. He saw no occasion for waking  Jack.</p>
<p>A new hand was dealt and he  returned to the game. It was a critical hand, and the attention of all four of  the players was closely fixed on the cards until the last trick was taken. Not  until then did they become aware of the grumble of broken water ahead. They had  heard the sound before on the reefs they had passed. Vassall, looking up, saw  only a kind of smudge like a thumb-mark drawn across the smooth face of the  river ahead. The next time he looked he saw darkish spots here and there  between the island and the shore.</p>
<p>The noise became louder. Finally  he got up, and in the act of rising the ominous white leaped into his view. It  was a reef extending all the way across.</p>
<p>The dark spots were rocks covered  by an inch or two of water.</p>
<p>For an instant Vassall looked at  it stupidly. The others were arranging their cards in ignorance of any danger.  Before Vassall could wake Jack, the hoarse roar of the reef reached the  subconsciousness of the sleeping man, and he sprang up, all standing. A glance  told him everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we doing on this side?&rdquo;  he cried.</p>
<p>He ran out one sweep, and motioned  Vassall to the other. They pulled with a will. The others watched, not fully  understanding the nature of the danger yet, but alarmed by Jack&rsquo;s grimness. He  was heading the raft for the main channel. They had not reached the island yet,  but Jack soon saw that at the rate they were being carried down he could not  make the other side, nor could he land his clumsy craft on the shore above the  reef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your strength,&rdquo; he said to  Vassall. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to chance it. Everybody sit still and hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A breathless few minutes  succeeded. Jack steered for the widest space he could see between the rocks.  Those who were sitting down still could not see much of what was ahead, but the  roar of the water was now sufficiently terrifying. Moving of a piece with the  current as they were, it seemed as if they were not moving, but that the broken  rocks were striding to meet them, not very fast, but inexorably. It was hard to  sit and wait.</p>
<p>Then as they came close they saw  how the water slipped silkily over the reef with the dark shadows showing like  teeth beneath, and boiled up below. The women cried out sharply, and the men  turned pale. It suddenly became evident how fast the heavy raft was moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw yourselves flat and hang  on!&rdquo; Jack shouted.</p>
<p>They obeyed. There was a dreadful  moment of waiting, while the roar of the water filled their ears. Then she  struck. One side of the raft slid up on a submerged shelf, the floor tilted at  a steep angle, and the current surged over the lower side, sweeping everything  movable off. Jack stood up to his knees in the torrent, pushing desperately at  the heavy sweep. He budged her inch by inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;For your  lives! We&rsquo;ll make it yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But panic seized upon his  passengers. Somebody scrambled for the high side of the raft, and the rest  followed. The strain was too great for the lashings. A rope parted somewhere,  and the floor instantly heaved up beneath them. There was a brief, wild  confusion of thrashing, tangled logs and feeble human bodies. Then the whole  thing, logs, bodies, baggage, and playing cards was swept over into the deep,  rough water below.</p>
<p>When Jack came to the surface he  had a confused impression of bobbing heads and logs on every side. He seized  the nearest log, and unstrapping the cartridge belt and the gun that were  drowning him, buckled it on. Meanwhile, he was looking for the long hair of the  women. He reached one of them in six strokes. A pair of clutching arms reached  for him, but he dived, and seizing her by the collar, towed her to the nearest  log. It was Linda.</p>
<p>Leaving her supported, he trod  water looking for Kate. He saw more streaming hair not far away, and reached  the spot as she rose again. There was sterner stuff here; her face was white  and wild, but her arms were under control. She put her hands on Jack&rsquo;s  shoulders as he commanded, and he brought her likewise to a log. A little brown  box came bobbing by, Linda&rsquo;s jewel-case. Kate coolly put out her hand and  secured it.</p>
<p>All this had taken but a minute.  Jack looked about him. Everything was being carried down of a piece with the  current, and they were all close together. It seemed to Jack as if the whole  face of the river was littered with playing cards. He had a particular  impression of the deuce of clubs. Vassall was helping Baldwin Ferrie to a log,  and Humpy Jull had secured the log that bore Jack&rsquo;s cartridge belt. Only Sir  Bryson was missing. Farther out Jack saw a feeble commotion, and no log near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See to the women!&rdquo; he called to  Vassall. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a backwater inshore. Humpy, save that belt as you value your  life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The struggling figure sank before  he reached it.</p>
<p>Jack swam about the spot. It rose  again, but out of his reach. He dived for it. They came together, and a pair of  frantic arms closed about Jack&rsquo;s neck. They sank together, Jack struggling  vainly. They rose, Jack got a breath, and broke the hold. The struggling  ceased.</p>
<p>Swinging the inert figure over his  back, Jack struck out for the shore. It was a desperately hard pull. They had  been carried too far to obtain any advantage from the backwater. The logs he  passed were of no aid to him, because the current tended to carry them into  midstream. For a long time the shore seemed only to recede as he struggled  toward it. More than once fear touched him and he was on the point of going  down. He rested, breathing deep, and set to it again. Finally he ceased to  think or to feel, but he continued to struggle automatically, and he still  clung to his burden.</p>
<p>It was with a kind of surprise  that he finally felt the stones under his feet. He staggered ashore, and  putting down the limp figure he carried, flung himself on the shore utterly  exhausted. How long he lay there he hardly knew. As soon as a little strength  began to stir in him, with the man-of-the-wilds instinct he set to work  collecting sticks to make a fire.</p>
<p>He had been carried nearly a mile  below the reef. By and by, far up the shore he saw some wavering, uncertain  little figures. He was able to count five of them, so he knew all were safe. He  hailed them shrilly after the way of the country. After his little fire sprang  up, he could see that they were coming toward him slowly, the men helping the  women.</p>
<p>They came, a distressed little  company, drenching wet, silent and dazed. They moved like automatons, as if  their limbs were independent of them, and they looked at each other dully, as  if not with full recognition. Reaching Jack, they stood around in an uncertain  way; none of them spoke. It was as if they had lost the faculty of speech also.  Linda was roused by the sight of her father; with a cry, she cast herself on  his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not drowned,&rdquo; Jack said  quickly. &ldquo;Only stunned a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The helplessness of the others had  the effect of rousing Jack to an ardour of activity that transformed him. His  gnawing anger was forgotten; his black looks were flown. Their situation was  well-nigh desperate, but here the opposing forces were purely physical, such as  he thoroughly understood, and loved to attack. His exhaustion passed, and his  eyes became bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anybody dry matches?&rdquo; he sang  out.</p>
<p>The dazed ones looked a little  amazed at his spirits. It appeared that no one&rsquo;s match-safe was waterproof but  Jack&rsquo;s own. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spread &rsquo;em out to dry on a rock,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;They may work. I have seventeen good ones. That&rsquo;s enough at a pinch.  Everybody scatter for dry wood. Keep on the move, and get your circulation going.  Humpy, you build another fire behind the willows for the ladies. Light it from  this one. We can have all the fire we want, anyway. Vassall, help me here with  Sir Bryson. We must take his wet things off.&rdquo; He glanced up at the sun. &ldquo;Rest  for an hour,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;then on the march! Red Willow Creek to-night; Fort  Cheever to-morrow afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to support  life on the way?&rdquo; stammered Baldwin Ferrie.</p>
<p>Jack pointed to the belt Humpy  Jull had brought along. His gun and his hunting-knife hung from it. This, with  Linda&rsquo;s jewel-case, was the sum total of what they had saved from the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the cannon,&rdquo; Jack said  with a laugh. &ldquo;About forty cartridges, and the seventeen matches. We&rsquo;ll make  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later they started to  climb the steep, high hill to the prairie. They took it very slowly on account  of Sir Bryson, who was still white and shaky. But he complained no more. Jack&rsquo;s  example had had its effect on all, and a more cheerful feeling pervaded the  party. They were at least dry and warm again. The men still regarded Jack&rsquo;s  high spirits a little askance. It did not fit their settled convictions about  him; they resented it slightly while forced to admire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we heading for?&rdquo;  Vassall asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trail down this side of  the river as well as on the other,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been over it, but if  we strike straight back we must hit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we get back across the  river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;When  we arrive opposite the fort, if it&rsquo;s daylight, we&rsquo;ll wave a shirt; if it&rsquo;s  night, we&rsquo;ll build a fire, and they&rsquo;ll send a canoe over for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once having accomplished the  difficult hill it was easy enough going over the prairie. Taking his bearings  from the sun, Jack led them in a line at right angles back from the river.  Linda walked beside him. Vassall and Ferrie helped support Sir Bryson. Half an  hour&rsquo;s walking brought them to a trail, as Jack had promised, and their hearts  rose. It was a less well-beaten track than the main route on the north side of  the river, but easy enough to follow.</p>
<p>Jack called a halt. &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;The first good water that I know of is Red Willow Creek. I&rsquo;ve camped  on the river at the mouth of it. It will be about seven miles. Are you good for  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said they were. No one dreamed  of opposing Jack now. They hung on him like defenceless merchantmen on their  man-o&rsquo;-war convoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vassall, you lead the way from  here,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the creek in a big coulee. We&rsquo;ll camp for the  night in the bottom of it. If by any chance you should lose the trail before  you get there, just climb to the highest place you see, and sit down and wait  till I come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are you going?&rdquo; they  demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hunt for our supper,&rdquo; said  Jack.</p>
<p>He issued two of the precious  matches to Humpy to make a fire on arrival. &ldquo;There ought to be berries in the  coulee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Collect all you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda clung to him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go  with you?&rdquo; she begged.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;The hunter  must hunt alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be long. Be very careful.  If we lost you we&rsquo;d simply lie down and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; he said uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Linda glanced at the others. &ldquo;Why  should I hide it now?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you. They know now why I chose a  man like you, a real man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had the feeling that  additional turns of rope were being taken around his body. He blushed and  scowled together. &ldquo;Linda! for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he burst out. Under his breath,  &ldquo;Wait until I pull you out of this before you begin to talk.&rdquo; He turned and  fled.</p>
<p>A word of sympathy may be dropped  here for Vassall and Ferrie. It is hard to have to stand by while your rival  has the opportunity to save the lives of all and sundry, including your own,  just because he is in his own element and you are out of yours. And then to be  publicly scorned by the girl in the case &mdash; for that is what Linda&rsquo;s speech  amounted to. Linda had no mercy for men; that is why, if you look into it far  enough, she was bound to suffer on her own account. It was much to their credit  that the two men took it generously.</p>
<p>It was four hours before they saw  Jack again. They had reached the rendezvous some time before, and Humpy had  built a fire on the shore of the creek, around which they sat in silence,  trying not to look as hungry as they felt, and trying to conceal the common  anxiety that gnawed at each breast: &ldquo;What will we do if he doesn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last his hail came over the  hill, and Jack himself came running and sliding down the grassy slope, covered  with feathers it appeared. They sprang up with glad cries. Never did man  receive a more heartfelt welcome. They were like his hungry children waiting to  be fed and cheered. It is sweet to be so necessary to one&rsquo;s fellow-beings, but  indeed it was a startling transformation. At one bound Jack had risen in their  estimation from a disgraced felon to the saviour and preserver of them all.  Jack felt this, and it was his revenge.</p>
<p>He kissed Linda &mdash; he had to &mdash; and  flung his burdens down. &ldquo;Prairie chicken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting  so long, but I hated to come in until I had got one all round, and I couldn&rsquo;t  take any chances. They&rsquo;re too expensive, anyway; a shell apiece and two misses.  To-morrow I&rsquo;ll try to bring in something more substantial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they dined off roasted  prairie chicken and saskatoon berries, strictly after Nature&rsquo;s first intention  without artificial aids. And when one wanted a drink he had to scoop it out of  the creek in his hand. It was remarkable how easy all this came to them, even  to a lieutenant-governor when he was hungry and thirsty.</p>
<p>The night was harder. Jack built a  sort of lean-to, or wind-break, of poplar, with a long fire close across in  front. The heat was partly reflected down by the sloping roof, and in this  pleasant oven they lay in a row on heaped spruce boughs. The men arranged to  take turns in keeping up the fire throughout the night. But the ground was  cold, and there was not much sleep to be had. Jack sat up and told cheerful  yarns of worse nights that he had managed to live through.</p>
<p>At sun-up he was away again. An  hour&rsquo;s patient waiting at the edge of a berry thicket two miles up the coulee  brought him what he sought, a young black bear. He brought the hams into camp.  The women looked askance at his prizes, and elected to breakfast off berries  alone. But baked in its hide in a pit with hot stones the meat was not to be  despised, and after a few miles on the trail they were all glad to share it.</p>
<p>All that day Jack convoyed his  little company slowly, with many a rest beside the trail. They had about twenty  miles to cover. Alone, Jack would have made it in five hours, but he saw that  it would be a great feat for some of the others if they got through at all that  day. In spite of what he could do, in the middle of the afternoon Linda gave  out, and Sir Bryson was on his last legs. The indefatigable Jack then contrived  a litter out of two poplar poles thrust through three buttoned coats, and Linda  and her father took turns in riding the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Jack was considerably embarrassed  by Sir Bryson&rsquo;s attitude toward him during this day. The little gentleman, as  has been said, was much chastened. He was quiet; he issued no orders, nor  uttered complaints, and was unaffectedly grateful for whatever was done for  him. Here was a change indeed! Whenever Jack approached him his confusion  became visible and acute. At the same time he often sought Jack out, and began  conversations which petered out to nothing. Manifestly he had something on his  mind that his tongue balked at uttering.</p>
<p>It came out at last. During one of  the rests they were all sitting in the grass, Jack among the others, busily  intent upon cleaning the precious &ldquo;cannon&rdquo; with a sleeve of his shirt that he  had sacrificed to the purpose. Sir Bryson suddenly moved closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he began, and his  lofty tone could not hide the genuine feeling, &ldquo;they tell me you saved my life  yesterday. I don&rsquo;t remember much about it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked up, alarmed and  frowning. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;Everybody did what he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Linda and Mrs. Worsley too,&rdquo;  Sir Bryson went on. &ldquo;It was very gallantly done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vassall would have done it, only  I was nearer,&rdquo; Jack said gruffly. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say anything more. It makes me  feel like a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be spoken of,&rdquo; Sir Bryson  persisted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s difficult &mdash; I hardly know &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not perceive the exact  nature of the old gentleman&rsquo;s difficulty. He got up. &ldquo;It was all in the day&rsquo;s  work,&rdquo; he said awkwardly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to feel that it changes the situation  at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson rose too. All tousled,  creased and bedraggled as he was, the little governor was never more truly  dignified. &ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I &mdash; I am very grateful.  Moreover, I am sorry for things I said. I desire to acknowledge it here before  our friends who were present when I said them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked away in acute embarrassment.  &ldquo;Very handsomely said, Sir Bryson,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>This ended the incident for the  present. The air was much cleared by it. However, it gave rise to something it  was necessary for Jack to unburden himself of. He waited until he could get Sir  Bryson away from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Bryson,&rdquo; he said doggedly. &ldquo;I  wanted to tell you that I understand my being useful to you doesn&rsquo;t clear my  name, doesn&rsquo;t make me any more a desirable suitor for your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bryson made a deprecating  gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances,&rdquo; Jack  continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her any more than you want me. It is agreed between  Miss Linda and I that we are to have nothing to do with each other until I  succeed in clearing myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands on it. Later  Vassall and Baldwin Ferrie took opportunity to follow in the lead of their  master and ask to shake Jack&rsquo;s hand. For the rest of the day Jack moved in an  atmosphere warm with their gratitude and admiration. It was not unpleasant in  itself of course, but somehow he felt as if everything that happened tended to  tighten little by little the coils in which he found himself. Mile by mile as  they neared the end of the journey, and the obstacles retreated, his spirits  went down. He was elevated into Sir Bryson&rsquo;s good graces, but not into his own.  This was his ingenious difficulty: that the girl he didn&rsquo;t want was attached as  a rider to the good name he had to have.</p>
<p>At the day&rsquo;s close he led his  bedraggled and dead weary little company stumbling down the hill to the river  bank opposite Fort Cheever. There, a fire built on the shore, with its mounting  pillar of smoke, soon brought over Davy in a dugout to investigate. Great was  the boy&rsquo;s astonishment at the sight of them.</p>
<p>Jack burned with a question that  he desired to ask him, but he could not bring his tongue to form Mary&rsquo;s name.  His heart began to beat fast as they approached the other shore. He wondered if  he would see her. He hoped not, he told himself, and all the while desiring it  as a desert traveller longs for water. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>XV<br>
  An Expedition of Three</b></h3>
<p>Mary was not in evidence around  the fort.</p>
<p>Jack spent half the night talking  things over with David Cranston in the store. In the sturdy Scotch trader he  found a friend according to his need. He experienced an abounding relief in  unburdening himself to a man who merely smoked and nodded understandingly,  without making any fuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to explain to me  that you&rsquo;re no thief,&rdquo; Cranston said coolly.</p>
<p>That was all to be said on the  subject. As to the feminine element in his difficulties, Jack was necessarily  silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my sons were a year or two  older,&rdquo; Cranston said strongly. &ldquo;As it is I am tied here hand and foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack swore at him gratefully.  &ldquo;This is my fight,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let you give up your time to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll take some of the  men out of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s party back with you,&rdquo; said Cranston.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;Humpy Jull&rsquo;s  all right, but he can&rsquo;t ride, and I have to ride like sin. Vassall&rsquo;s a square  head too, in his way, but either one of them would only weaken me. They don&rsquo;t  know the people. They couldn&rsquo;t face them down. They couldn&rsquo;t walk into their  tepees and tell the beggars to go to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston smiled grimly. &ldquo;Is that  what you calculate to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean. It&rsquo;s a way  of putting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cranston considered a moment.  &ldquo;Take Davy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boy has pluck. He would be wild to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was more moved than he cared  to show. &ldquo;Damn decent of you, Cranston,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he added  aloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much of a responsibility. Jean Paul is clever enough to see  that he could always get at me through the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the alternative then?&rdquo;  asked Cranston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going it alone,&rdquo; said Jack  doggedly.</p>
<p>Cranston struck the counter with  his fist. &ldquo;No, by Gad!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the boss around here. You know as well  as I that it&rsquo;s foolhardy for a man to ride alone at any time &mdash; the police don&rsquo;t  do it &mdash; let alone into a village of redskins in an ugly mood. That&rsquo;s tempting  them to murder you. And if they did, how could we convict them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face hardened. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t  murder me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m not afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s too big a  chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think nothing of taking it  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind that. I&rsquo;m the boss  here, and I forbid it!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my boss,&rdquo; muttered  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I can prevent you,  my lad,&rdquo; said Cranston grimly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no outfit from me for such a  purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shrugged, and appeared to let  the matter go. Cranston might have taken warning from his tight lips, but the  trader thought, as he said, that he commanded the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk to Sir Bryson in the  morning,&rdquo; Cranston went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Sir Bryson!&rdquo; muttered  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him to send Vassall down  to the Crossing in a canoe with a letter to the police. I&rsquo;ll send my boy Angus  and an Indian along. The steamboat will be up in a few days, and they can bring  back the police on her. If she leaves the Crossing before they get there, the  captain will turn back for the policemen. With luck they&rsquo;ll all be back in a  week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week!&rdquo; thought Jack. &ldquo;What  would I be doing all that time? Biting my thumbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By morning Jack had made his plan.  He was only prevented from putting it into instant execution by his great  desire to see Mary, though he would not acknowledge to himself that that was  the reason he hung about the fort all morning. He waited until after the middle  of the day, thinking that Cranston would surely ask him home to dinner, but the  invitation was not forthcoming. Jack did not know it, but the trader for many  years past had been obliged to give up dispensing hospitality at his own board.  Mrs. Cranston seized on such occasions to assert her most savage and perverse  self.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jack showed himself  assiduously in front of the trader&rsquo;s windows. The ladies of Sir Bryson&rsquo;s party  did not appear all morning out of the warehouse where they were quartered, so  Jack was at least spared Linda&rsquo;s surveillance. His pertinacity was in vain;  Mary never once showed herself. By afternoon he had worked himself up to a  towering, aggrieved anger. &ldquo;She might at least have a word of welcome for a  white man,&rdquo; he thought bitterly, choosing to forget her side of the case, that  she had made plain to him. At last he gave up in a passion, and strode away  from the fort.</p>
<p>Taking care that he was not  observed by Cranston, Jack headed for the Indian village, which lay on the  river-flat, a half mile west of the fort. Reaching it, he sought out the head  man, and by degrees brought the talk around to the subject of horses. Presently  a deal was in progress, and in an hour Jack found himself the owner of two  fairish ponies, with a saddle for one and a pack-saddle for the other. Some of  the Indians had been trading with Cranston, and by going from tepee to tepee  and offering a premium on the company&rsquo;s prices, Jack was able to collect the  grub he required, together with blankets and a Winchester and ammunition. He  paid for all this with an order on Cranston, and with the order he sent back a  note:</p>
<p>DEAR CRANSTON: I hope you won&rsquo;t  lay this up against me. I feel as if you are the only friend I have, and I  don&rsquo;t want to make you sore, but I&rsquo;ve got to go. If I had to hang around the  fort doing nothing for a week I&rsquo;d go clean off my nut. You needn&rsquo;t bother your  head about me. I know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do, and I&rsquo;m not going to get  murdered either. I&rsquo;ll bring you back your horses in a few days, also Garrod and  Jean Paul, unless I have to bury them.</p>
<p>Tell Sir Bryson and his people.</p>
<p>Remember me to Mary.</p>
<p>JACK.</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock he had ridden  fifty miles, and he camped then only because his grass-fed beasts could go no  farther. He turned them out, and ate, and crawled between his blankets by the  fire; but not, in spite of his weariness, to sleep. He found that he had not  succeded in galloping away from the ache in his breast: &ldquo;Mary! Mary! Mary!&rdquo; it  throbbed with every beat.</p>
<p>Wakefulness was a novel sensation  to Jack. Cursing at himself, he resolutely closed his eyes and counted sheep,  but in vain. He got up and replenished his fire. He lit his pipe, and, walking  up and down in the grass of the prairie, gazed up at the quiet stars for peace.  If he could have inspired his horses with some of his own restlessness he would  have ridden on, but the poor beasts were standing close by with hanging heads,  too weary to eat.</p>
<p>He did fall asleep at last, of  course, only to be immediately wakened, it seemed to him, by a distant thudding  of hoofs on the earth. It is a significant sound in a solitude, and, sitting  up, he listened sharply. By the movement of the stars he saw that several hours  had passed since he fell asleep. It could not be his own horses, because they  were hobbled. In any case there were more than two approaching. They were  coming from the direction of the fort. Jack, frowning, wondered if Cranston  would go so far as to attempt to prevent him from carrying out his purpose.  With instinctive caution he drew back from his fire and crouched in the shadow  of a clump of willows.</p>
<p>Four horses came loping up. Jack&rsquo;s  two came hobbling toward them out of the darkness, whinnying a welcome. The  fire blazed between Jack and the newcomers, and he could not see them very  well. He sensed that there were two riders, and as they slipped out of the  saddles it appeared that one of them was skirted. For a moment they stood  outlined against the dim light of the eastern sky, and Jack&rsquo;s heart began to  thump against his ribs. Surely there could be but one such graceful head poised  on such beautiful shoulders, but he couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Then they approached  his fire, and he saw for sure: it was Mary and Davy.</p>
<p>She saw his tumbled blanket by the  fire, and looked across toward where he crouched, with the firelight throwing  up odd, strong shadows on her wistful face. &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she called softly. The  voice knocked on his naked heart.</p>
<p>His hardihood failed him then. He  came slowly toward them, trembling all over, ashamed of his trembling, and  horribly self-conscious. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going with you,&rdquo; murmured  Mary. Her voice, too, was suffocated as if her heart was filling her throat.</p>
<p>There was a little pause. Jack  looked at her like an unworthy sinner, who nevertheless sees Heaven opening  before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see us?&rdquo;  demanded Davy, coming up.</p>
<p>Glad! Jack was quite unable to  speak. Suddenly-flinging an arm around the boy&rsquo;s shoulders he squeezed him  until Davy cried out. It was meant for Mary. She saw. Dropping to the ground,  she made a great business of building up the fire.</p>
<p>They fell to babbling foolishly  without any one&rsquo;s caring how foolishly; they laughed for no reason, and asked  the same questions over again without heeding the answers. Jack sprang to  unpack and unsaddle their horses. When they were finally hobbled and turned  out, he came back to Mary. She was setting out the grub-box and making tea.  Davy went away to cut poles for their two little tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do wish to be friends?&rdquo; Jack  said pleadingly; &ldquo;after what you said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary had recovered her  self-possession. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let you go alone,&rdquo; she parried. &ldquo;That is such a  foolish thing to do. I couldn&rsquo;t have slept or sat still for thinking of it.  Other things are not changed at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you came!&rdquo; murmured Jack a  little triumphantly, and moving closer to her.</p>
<p>She drew away. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say  that,&rdquo; she murmured stiffly. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to come. And it may cost me  dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack wondered like a man why she  was offended. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to let you come. But I&rsquo;m  glad you wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made matters worse. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t  want to,&rdquo; she threw back at him sharply. &ldquo;I came because I was the only one who  could help you. I know the Indians; they like me; they&rsquo;re a little afraid of  me. And you can&rsquo;t make us go back. We have our own outfit. If you won&rsquo;t let us  ride with you, we&rsquo;ll follow after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared, perplexed and  wondering at her hurt tones. Certainly girls were beyond his comprehension.  Though so different in other respects, it seemed they were alike in this: their  perfect inconsistency. He tried another tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your father let you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said unwillingly. &ldquo;He  was very angry with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He offered to let Davy come,&rdquo;  Jack said idly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; she said,  wondering at men&rsquo;s stupidity.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s brain moved only about a  third as fast as hers. He frowned at the fire. &ldquo;If you lit out without telling  him,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll think that I &mdash; what will he think of me! After I  promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mary&rsquo;s turn to be  surprised. &ldquo;Promised what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack turned stubborn. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  tell you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But something that concerns me,&rdquo;  said Mary. &ldquo;I think I have a right to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack merely pulled in his upper  lip. &ldquo;You do lots of things without explaining them to me. I have the same  right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary dropped the inquiry. &ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t be anxious about what father is thinking,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I left a  letter for him, telling where we were going, and I told him you didn&rsquo;t know we  were coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent. Jack stared at  the fire, wondering unhappily what was the matter. After they had come, and he  had been so glad to see them, to be near a quarrel already! To heal this  inexplicable breach he put out his hand, and took Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She snatched it away with  astonishing suddenness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to touch me!&rdquo; she muttered, low and  quivering.</p>
<p>He was blankly surprised. &ldquo;Why,  Mary! What did you come for then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for that!&rdquo; she cried, with  eyes full of anger and pain. &ldquo;You asked me to be friends with you. All right.  Nothing else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends shake hands, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;  muttered Jack sulkily. &ldquo;One would think I had the leprosy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; said Mary  more quietly.</p>
<p>Jack scowled at the fire. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  see how a man and a woman &mdash; if they&rsquo;re young &mdash; like you and I, can be just  friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can,&rdquo; said Mary eagerly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at her, eager,  wistful, self-forgetful as she was, and a great irresponsible longing surged up  in him. Passion darkened his eyes; his breast began to heave. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he  said hoarsely, &ldquo;not with you, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She avoided him warily. &ldquo;Then I  must go back,&rdquo; she said sadly.</p>
<p>Jack forgot that he had intended  to send her. &ldquo;No! Not now,&rdquo; he said sharply.</p>
<p>She looked at him with the  extraordinary look she had for him, proud, pitying, and relentless all at once.  &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she commanded quietly. &ldquo;Somebody has got to speak plainly. I will do  it. I like you very much&rdquo; &mdash; her voice faltered here &mdash; &ldquo;I &mdash; I wish to be friends  with you &mdash; very much. But if you are so weak and dishonourable as to make love  to me when you are bound to another woman, I shall despise you, and I shall  have to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack recoiled as if she had struck  him, and sat staring at her, while the two hideous words burned their way into  his soul. In all his life he had never been hurt like this. She had dealt a  blow at the twin gods of his idolatry: Strength and Honour. It is true he did  not distinguish very clearly between physical strength and moral. Strength,  none the less, was the word that made his breast lift up, and Honour, scarcely  less. Honour to Jack meant telling the truth.</p>
<p>The worst of the hurt was that he  knew she was right. It was very true that some one had to speak plainly! This  was the disconcerting thought he had been thrusting out of sight so  determinedly. Now that it had been put into harsh speech it could never be  ignored again.</p>
<p>Mary was busying herself with  shaking hands among the supper things. Obviously she could scarcely see what  she was doing. Davy came back with his poles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go help him,&rdquo; she murmured  tremulously.</p>
<p>Jack obeyed.</p>
<p>They ate as dawn began to break  over the prairie, supper or breakfast, whichever it was. Davy&rsquo;s lighthearted  chatter kept the situation from becoming acute again. There was no further  suggestion of their going back. Afterward they turned in for a few hours to let  the horses rest out.</p>
<p>Jack took refuge from the  mosquitoes in Davy&rsquo;s tent. He could not talk, and he turned his back on the  boy, but Davy, creeping close, wound an arm over Jack&rsquo;s shoulder, and, like an  affectionate spaniel, thrust his head in Jack&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he  murmured sleepily. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all right again. I&rsquo;d rather be with you than  anybody, Jack. Say, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a friend of yours. You and I and Mary, we&rsquo;ll make  a great team, eh? What a good time we&rsquo;ll have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell asleep. Meanwhile Jack lay  staring through the mosquito netting at the prairie grass in the ghostly light,  and the low-hung, paling stars, thinking of how a woman had been obliged to  remind him of Strength and Honour.</p>
<p>Admitting the justice of it, he  took his punishment like a man. It was a much-chastened Jack that issued from  the tent into the early sunshine. And although he did not know it, he was  tenfold more in love with the hand that had chastised him. His glance sought  hers humbly enough now. And Mary? There was none of the disdain he feared; on  the contrary, her telltale eyes were lifted to his, imploring and contrite for  the hurt she had dealt him.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and the  skies cleared. Nothing was said; nothing needed to be said. It was enough for  Jack that Mary did not despise him, and it was enough for Mary that he did not  hate her. They were together, and the sun was shining on a sea of green grass.  Their spirits soared. Troubles and heartaches vanished like steam in the  sunshine. Breakfast became a feast of laughter, and Davy was enraptured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blest if I can understand you  two,&rdquo; the boy said with an unconscious imitation of his hero&rsquo;s casual manner  that made Mary laugh again. &ldquo;One minute you&rsquo;re as dumb as owls in the daytime,  and the next you&rsquo;re laughing like a pair of loons at nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They justified it by laughing  afresh. &ldquo;Oh, the loon&rsquo;s a much-abused bird, Mr. Davy,&rdquo; sang Jack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not  nearly as loony as his name. I think I&rsquo;ll adopt a loon for my crest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a crest?&rdquo; Davy wanted to  know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s what you have on your  note-paper,&rdquo; Jack said vaguely. &ldquo;And they carve it on rings for you to seal  your letters with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s private sign,&rdquo;  said Mary. &ldquo;His totem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Jack with a surprised  look. &ldquo;How clever you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary blushed to the eyes.</p>
<p>They packed and rode on, a  cheerful trio on the trail. Jack to all appearances was his old, off-hand self,  but he had stored away his lesson, and he never looked, or seemed never to  look, at Mary. From her glance at him when she was unobserved one would have  said she was sorry he obeyed her so well.</p>
<p>Mary and Davy rode with the  unconscious ease of those who are born to the saddle. Mary, who had never seen  a riding-habit, had contrived a divided skirt for herself, as she contrived  everything for herself, cunningly. With it she wore a blue flannel shirt out of  the store, that she had likewise adapted to her own figure. She had a man&rsquo;s  felt hat, but, except when it rained, it was hanging by its thong from her  saddle-horn. Her plentiful dark hair was braided and bound close round her  head. Tied to her saddle she carried a light rifle, which upon occasion she  used as handily as Jack himself.</p>
<p>Thus she was totally without  feminine aids and artifices. With that firm, straight young figure, that  well-set head and those eyes, she was finer without. For all he was making  believe not to look at her, she stirred Jack&rsquo;s deepest enthusiasm, like the  sight of distant hills at evening, or a lake embowered in greenery, or anything  wholly beautiful and unspoiled from the hand of Nature.</p>
<p>The slender Davy showed none of  his sister&rsquo;s trimness. Davy was a little nondescript. He possessed &ldquo;Sunday  clothes,&rdquo; but he detested them, and was only truly happy in his ragged  trousers, his buttonless shirt, and his blackened apologies for moccasins. Davy  was apparently insensible to cold, and it was all one to him whether he was wet  or dry.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock they rode past the  little boarded-up store at Fort Geikie. Two hours later they reined in at the  edge of the bench on the other side of the portage. This was the spot where  they had parted so unhappily. No one referred to that now. Casting his eyes  over the valley, Jack pointed to a number of dark objects in the river meadows  to the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horses,&rdquo; said Davy.</p>
<p>One of the little objects reared,  and moved forward in a way that was familar to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hobbled again,&rdquo; said Jack  with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course as soon as you went  away they would drive them back,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t want to be found  with company horses in their camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riding down the hill they made  their noon spell on the site of Camp Trangmar. Jack opened the cache for an  additional supply of grub, and what else he needed: his cherished leather  chaps, his canvas lean-to, and mosquito bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need that,&rdquo; Davy said.  &ldquo;Sleep with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Garrod,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t  let the mosquitoes eat the poor devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy caught sight of the banjo  inside. &ldquo;Bring that,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;No time for  tingle-pingling on this trip,&rdquo; he said, unconsciously using the trader&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Davy begged hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after  it myself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jack hesitated. His fingers itched  for the strings. &ldquo;Do you think we had better take it?&rdquo; he asked Mary.</p>
<p>Mary was only human. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>One could not always be dwelling  on one&rsquo;s troubles. The banjo was brought out, and while Mary, with veiled eyes,  busied herself mixing bannock, and Davy listened with his delighted mouth open,  Jack filled his chest and gave them &ldquo;Pretty Polly Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; said Davy with a  sigh of pleasure.</p>
<p>Mary said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Jack asked, very  off-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you dress up as a  drummer-boy and follow your lover to the wars, like Polly did?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded, taken  aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a poor thing,&rdquo; said Mary  scornfully. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t live single, she said. When she did get to the wars  she was only in the way, and put him to the trouble of rescuing her; but it  makes a pretty song of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very romantic,&rdquo;  grumbled Jack.</p>
<p>Mary smiled to herself, and  attended to the bannock. After a long time, when Jack had forgotten all about  Polly, she said: &ldquo;I think romances are for people who don&rsquo;t feel very much  themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After lunch, leaving Mary and Davy  to finish packing, Jack circled wide over the river-meadows to round up the  horses, and reconnoitre generally. Mary and Davy were to follow him. He found  that two of the horses were still missing; the others were in good condition.  Riding on up the trail, he dismounted at a little stream to read what was to be  seen in the tracks. He saw that the horses had been driven back two days  before, and that none of them was hobbled when they crossed the stream.</p>
<p>At this moment all Jack&rsquo;s senses  were suddenly roused to the <i>qui vive</i> by the sound of the hoof-beats of two horses approaching along the trail  from-up the valley. Here was a new factor entering the situation. Quickly mounting,  he held his horse quiet under the bushes beside the trail. The newcomers  trotted around a bend; all the horses whinnied, and Jack found himself face to  face with Jean Paul Ascota. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>XVI<br>
  The Tepees of the Sapis</b></h3>
<p>The breed betrayed no surprise,  and Jack reflected that he must have seen the smoke of their fire from up the  valley. He was riding one of the missing horses, and the other followed with a  light pack. He smiled blandly, and, bringing his horse close to Jack&rsquo;s, held  out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I glad you come back,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I need help, me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack ignored the hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not  friends, Jean Paul,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t make believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul shrugged like an injured  and forgiving person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to give an account of  yourself,&rdquo; Jack went on.</p>
<p>A spark shot sidewise out of Jean  Paul&rsquo;s black eyes. &ldquo;To you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said Jack coolly, and the  blue eyes faced the black ones down.</p>
<p>Jean Paul thought better of his  threatened defiance. &ldquo;You all time think bad of me,&rdquo; he said deprecatingly. &ldquo;I  work for you. I get the horses back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed in his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not dealing with Sir Bryson now. You know as well as I do that the Indians are  not stealing company horses. They might be persuaded to drive them away, but  they&rsquo;d be glad enough to drive them back when they thought it over. The horses  are nothing to me. Where&rsquo;s Garrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul shrugged again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I no can find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You  can find anything that you wish to find in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you tell me &rsquo;ow?&rdquo; Jean Paul  returned with an ill-concealed sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him, with or without  you,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>The horses whinnied again, and  presently Jack&rsquo;s little train was heard approaching along the trail.</p>
<p>Jean Paul started. Apparently he  had supposed that Jack was alone. &ldquo;Who you got?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>Jack ignored the question. Jean  Paul watched the bend in the trail, lynx-eyed. When Mary and Davy rode into  view his angry chagrin peeped out. He immediately put on the ordinary redskin  mask, but Jack had had a look beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy and girl!&rdquo; sneered Jean  Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;The boy and  the girl speak the native talk as well as you do. They will interpret for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mary and Davy joined them, Jean  Paul greeted them politely, shaking hands with each, according to custom.  Mary&rsquo;s face was as bland and polite as Jean Paul&rsquo;s own. Jack frowned to see her  put her hand into the breed&rsquo;s, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we do now?&rdquo; asked Jean Paul  of all and sundry. Thus he gracefully adopted himself into their party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Sapi camp?&rdquo; asked  Jack.</p>
<p>The breed pointed west. &ldquo;One day,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;thirty mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sleep there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul shrugged. &ldquo;My horses  tire&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul rode after the horses,  and Jack sent Davy back to the cache for the half-breed&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if we  didn&rsquo;t let him see we were suspicious.&rdquo; Mary suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll give us the slip again, if  I don&rsquo;t watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head decisively.  &ldquo;Not now. He&rsquo;ll never let us talk to the Sapis without his being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack frowned. &ldquo;My stomach rises  against him! I can&rsquo;t hide it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better,&rdquo; she said  gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always right,&rdquo; he  grumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul and Davy came back and  they proceeded. Their pack-animals were but lightly laden, and they rode hard  all afternoon with very little speech. Twelve miles from Camp Trangmar they  came on the site of the abandoned Indian camp. At this point the Fort Erskine  trail, leaving the Spirit River valley, turned northwestward to ascend beside a  small tributary, the Darwin River. This stream came down a flat and gently  ascending valley, heavily timbered for the most part, and hemmed in by  mountains wooded almost to their summits. It was a gloomy way, for they could  see but little through the trees. Now and then from a point of vantage they had  a glimpse of the magnificent bulk of Mount Darwin blocking the valley at the  top.</p>
<p>They spelled once to eat and to  rest the horses. Riding on, Mary kept asking Jean Paul how far it was. At  length he said: &ldquo;Two miles.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They rode a little farther, and  came to a brook. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s us camp here,&rdquo; said Mary suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared and frowned. Mary  tired! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less than a mile,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;We have plenty of time to ride in  and see this thing through before dark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stopped by a look from  Mary. He was learning to answer quickly to suggestions from that quarter. &ldquo;Oh,  well, if you&rsquo;re tired,&rdquo; he said hastily.</p>
<p>When he had a chance apart with  her he asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be seen talking  together,&rdquo; she said swiftly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing much, only I think maybe he will  steal away to the tepees to-night to tell them what to say to us. If he does  I&rsquo;ll follow and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked his admiration. &ldquo;Good  for you!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The invariable routine of camping  was gone through with, the horses unpacked and turned out, the little tents  pitched, the supper cooked and eaten. Jack pitched his own little lean-to, because  lying within it he could still see all that passed outside. After eating they  sat around the fire for a while, and Jack sang some songs, that Jean Paul might  not get the idea they were unduly on the alert. The half-breed complimented  Jack on his singing.</p>
<p>Afterward Jack lay within his  shelter, one arm over his face, while he watched from beneath it. When it  became dark he saw Jean Paul issue boldly out of his tent and move around as if  inviting a challenge. None being forthcoming, he went back. A moment later Jack  saw a shadow issue from <i>behind</i> the  little A-tent, and steal away into the bushes.</p>
<p>He waited a minute or two, and got  up. He met Mary outside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going too,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will double the risk,&rdquo; she  objected. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need. Nothing can happen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting time,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arousing Davy, and putting him on  watch, they set off on the trail. Crossing the stream, they plunged anew into  the fragrant forest of old pines. It was a close, still night; the sky was  heavily overcast, and it became very dark for that latitude. The trail  stretched ahead like a pale ribbon vanishing into the murk at half a dozen  paces. In the thicker places they had literally to feel for it with their feet.  They had not very far to go. After about fifteen minutes&rsquo; walking the stillness  was suddenly shattered by a chorus of barking from a few hundred yards ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be Jean Paul getting  into camp,&rdquo; Mary said.</p>
<p>The forest ended abruptly, and  they found themselves at the edge of a natural meadow reaching down to the  Darwin River. Below them was a quadrangle of tepees, faintly luminous from the  little fires within, as if rubbed with phosphorous. The dogs were still barking  fitfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; Mary  commanded.</p>
<p>He unconsciously put out his hand  toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lingered. &ldquo;Well &mdash; Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go instead. I can&rsquo;t stay  quiet here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must. You don&rsquo;t know their  talk as well as I do. Nothing can happen to me. If they do find me out, they  are my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the dogs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bark at nothing. No one  minds them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes beamed on him softly,  like stars through the night; her soft voice was of the night too; and so brave  and tender! She was adorable to him. He abruptly flung himself down in the  grass to keep from seizing her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said a little thickly.  &ldquo;Hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours passed, it seemed to him; it  was perhaps half of one hour. The dogs barked and howled, and finally fell  silent. A partridge drummed in the depths of the forest, and an owl flew out  from among the trees with a moan that rose to a shriek of agony. Down the  valley a fox uttered his sharp, challenging bark, and the dogs returned with a  renewed infernal clamour. A band of horses stampeded aimlessly up and down  between the tepees. It was a heavy, ominous night, and every creature was  uneasy.</p>
<p>At last quite suddenly he saw her  crouching and running up the grassy slope toward him. His heart bounded with  relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quick,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Jean  Paul has started back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set off at a run through the  black forest, with warding hands outstretched in front of them. Their flying  feet gave little sound on the thick carpet of needles. In a few minutes she  slowed down, and caught Jack&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  take his time. He suspects nothing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>Following him in the trail, she  put her hand on his shoulder to keep in touch with him in the dark. The light  contact warmed Jack through and through. &ldquo;Jean Paul came to Etzeeah, the head  man, to tell him what to say to us to-morrow. I listened outside with my ear at  the bottom of the tepee. They spoke softly. I couldn&rsquo;t hear everything. It  seems Jean Paul&rsquo;s talk is always for the people to stand together and drive the  white men out of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old story,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is clever and they are simple.  He tells them my father cheats them, and gets their furs for nothing. He says  all the redmen are ready to rise when he gives the word. He makes them think he  is not a man like themselves, but a kind of spirit. They are completely under  his influence. They are excited and ugly, like bad children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Garrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I  think they know, but I heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; said Jack;  &ldquo;if we wish to get anything out of them to-morrow, we&rsquo;ll have to leave Jean  Paul behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we prevent him from  coming with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to think about that,&rdquo;  Jack said grimly.</p>
<p>Next morning Jean Paul issued out  of his tent as demure and smooth-faced as a copper-coloured saint. Looking at  him they were almost ready to believe that he had never left it. He did his  full share of the work about camp, did it cheerfully and well. He even had the  delicacy &mdash; or whatever the feeling was &mdash; to retire with his breakfast to a  little distance from the others, that they might be relieved of the constraint  of his company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonder,&rdquo; Jack said to Mary  with a kind of admiration.</p>
<p>When they had finished eating,  Jack spoke a word to Davy, and the two of them got a tracking line out of the  baggage, a light, strong cord that Jack had included because of the thousand  uses to which it lends itself. He gave the coil to Davy to carry, and they  returned to Jean Paul. Jack covertly made sure that his six-shooter was loose  in its case. The half-breed, having finished eating, was sitting on the ground,  lighting his pipe. Jack stood grimly waiting until he got it going well. Jean  Paul flipped the match away with an air of bravado, and a sidelong sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hands behind you!&rdquo; Jack  suddenly commanded.</p>
<p>Jean Paul sprang up astonished.  Jack drew his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move again,&rdquo; he harshly  warned him. &ldquo;Put your hands behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul slowly obeyed, and Davy twisted  the cord around his wrists. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;at you do?&rdquo; Jean Paul  protested, with an eye on the gun and an admirable air of astonished innocence.  &ldquo;I your man, me. I all time work for you. You always moch bad to me. No believe  no&rsquo;ting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you leave camp at night  tell us where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; said Jack with a hard smile.</p>
<p>It did not feaze Jean Paul. &ldquo;Mus&rsquo;  I tell w&rsquo;en I go to see a girl?&rdquo; he demanded, highly injured.</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &ldquo;Very clever! But  the girl was Etzeeah, and I know all you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul fell suddenly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kneel down,&rdquo; commanded Jack. &ldquo;Tie  his ankles together, Davy, with his wrists between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack finished the job himself,  going over all the knots, and taking half a dozen turns around Jean Paul&rsquo;s  body, with a final knot on his chest, out of reach of both hands and teeth. He  and Davy then picked him up and laid him inside his own tent. His pipe dropped  out of his mouth in transit. Jack, with grim good-nature, picked it up and  thrust it between his teeth again. Jean Paul puffed at it defiantly. Jack  fastened the tent flaps back, affording a clear view of the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to leave him to you while  we&rsquo;re gone, Davy. Keep away from him. Don&rsquo;t listen to anything he says. Above  all, don&rsquo;t touch him. I don&rsquo;t see how he can work loose, but if he should&rdquo; &mdash;  Jack raised his voice so it would carry into the tent &mdash; &ldquo;shoot him like a  coyote. I order you to do it. I take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul lay without stirring.  His face was hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows what poisonous mess is  stewing inside his skull,&rdquo; Jack said to Mary, as they rode away.</p>
<p>When the two of them cantered into  the quadrangle of the tepees, with its uproar of screaming children, yelping  curs, and loose horses, it needed no second glance to confirm the report that  the redskins were in an ugly temper. An angry murmur went hissing down the line  like the sputtering of a fuse. Every one dropped what he was doing; heads stuck  out of all the tepee openings; the little children scuttled inside. Men scowled  and fingered their guns; women laughed derisively, and spat on the ground.</p>
<p>Jack and Mary pulled up their  horses at the top of the quadrangle, and coolly looked about them. Filth and  confusion were the keynotes of the scene. This was the home-camp of this little  tribe, and the offal of many seasons was disintegrating within sight. All their  winter gear, furs, snowshoes and sledges, was slung from vertical poles out of  harm&rsquo;s way. Between the tepees, on high racks out of reach of the dogs, meat  was slowly curing.</p>
<p>As for the people, they were  miserably degenerate. Their fathers, the old freebooters of the plains, would  have disowned such offspring. The mark of ugliness was upon them; pinched gray  cheeks and sunken chests were pitifully common; their ragged store clothes hung  loosely on their meagre limbs. A consciousness of their weakness lurked in  their angry eyes; in spite of themselves the quiet pose and the cold,  commanding eyes of the whites struck awe into their breasts. They saw that the  man and the girl had guns, but they hung in buckskin cases from the saddles,  and they made no move to reach for them. They saw the two speak to each other  quietly. Once they smiled.</p>
<p>It was upon Jack&rsquo;s calling Mary&rsquo;s  attention to the absurdity of it, this little company of tatterdemalions  seeking to defy the white race. There were eighteen tepees, small and large,  containing perhaps ninety souls. It was absurd and it was tragic. Remote and  cut-off even from the other tribes of their own people, they had never seen any  white men except the traders at Fort Cheever and Fort Erskine, and the rare  travellers who passed up and down their river in the summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for them,&rdquo; Mary  murmured. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>look</i> sorry for them,&rdquo; Jack warned. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old man issued from the largest  tepee, and approached them, not without dignity. He was of good stature, but  beginning to stoop. He wore a dingy capote, or overcoat made out of a blanket,  and to keep his long, uncombed gray hair out of his face, he had a dirty cotton  band around his forehead. Not an imposing figure, but there was a remnant of  fire and pride in his old eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etzeeah, the head man,&rdquo; Mary  whispered to Jack.</p>
<p>Etzeeah concealed his feelings.  Approaching Jack&rsquo;s horses he silently held up his hand.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s eyes impaled the old man.  He ignored the hand. Jack had enough of their talk for his purpose. &ldquo;I do not  shake hands with horse thieves,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Etzeeah fell back with an angry  gesture. &ldquo;I am no horse thief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All the horses you see are mine, and  my people&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drove away the governor&rsquo;s  horses,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;And drove them back after he had gone. They are company  horses. It was a foolish thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Ascota who speaks me ill,&rdquo;  cried Etzeeah with a great display of anger. &ldquo;He comes here, and he makes  trouble. He calls us thieves and bad men. What do I know of white men, and  white men&rsquo;s horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what Jean Paul told him  to say,&rdquo; Mary murmured in English. &ldquo;They were going to make believe to quarrel  before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when has the chief of the  Sapis learned to lie?&rdquo; demanded Jack coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, no liar!&rdquo; cried Etzeeah, taken  aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told a different tale when  Ascota came to your lodge last night.&rdquo; .</p>
<p>Etzeeah was silenced. His jaw  dropped, and his black eyes looked old and furtive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come for the sick white  man, Garrod,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen no sick white man,&rdquo;  muttered Etzeeah. &ldquo;Ascota ask me already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your women hear you lie,&rdquo; said  Jack scornfully. &ldquo;They are laughing behind you. I have had enough lies. Call  everybody out of the tepees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah stood motionless and  scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call them out!&rdquo; repeated Jack,  &ldquo;or I will pull them out by the hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah raised his voice in sullen  command, and the rest of the women and the children issued out of the tepees,  the little children scurrying madly to hide behind their mothers, and clinging  to their skirts. </p>
<p>Jack pointed to the bottom of the  square. &ldquo;All stand close together!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The men scowled and muttered, but  obeyed. There was no reason why any one of them should not have put a bullet  through Jack&rsquo;s breast, sitting on his horse before them empty-handed &mdash; no  reason, that is, except the terrible blue eyes, travelling among them like  scorching fires. Many a little man&rsquo;s soul was sick with rage, and his fingers  itching for the trigger, but before he could raise his gun the eyes would fall  on him, withering his breast. It was the white man&rsquo;s scorn that emasculated  them. How could one fire at a being who held himself so high?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go through the tepees as quickly  as you can,&rdquo; Jack said to Mary. &ldquo;I will hold your horse and watch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismounting, she made her way to  Etzeeah&rsquo;s lodge.</p>
<p>A hundred pairs of black eyes  watched their every movement. Etzeeah made to edge back toward the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; Jack  commanded. &ldquo;I am not through with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah lowered his eyes, and  stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etzeeah, you are a fool,&rdquo; said  Jack, loud enough for all to hear. &ldquo;Ascota feeds you lies, and you swallow them  without chewing. Do you think you can fight all the white men with your  eighteen lodges? To the south there are more white men than cranes in the  flocks that fly overhead in the spring. When your few shells are spent, where  will you get more bullets to shoot the white men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ascota will give us plenty  shells!&rdquo; cried a voice in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t Ascota here now to help  you?&rdquo; asked Jack quickly. &ldquo;He said he would be here to show you how to fool me?  Why? Because I tied him like a dog in his tent, with a boy to watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other and  murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did drive the white men  away,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;how would you kill the moose for food without their  powder? Who would buy your furs? Where would you get flour and tea and tobacco,  and matches to light your fires? Wah! You are like children who throw their  food down and tread on it, and cry for it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What effect this had, if any,  could not be read in the dark, walled faces that fronted him.</p>
<p>Mary returned to Jack, bringing a  gun, which she handed him without comment. He recognized it. It was a weapon  that had lately been aimed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the sick man&rsquo;s gun,&rdquo; he  said, looking hard at Etzeeah.</p>
<p>The chief threw up his hands. &ldquo;A  Winchester thirty-thirty, like all our guns,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;There are twenty  here the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other men held up their weapons to  show. Jack merely turned the gun around, and pointed to initials neatly  scratched on the stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F. G.,&rdquo; he said grimly; &ldquo;Francis  Garrod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; said Etzeeah  excitedly. &ldquo;I have no letters. If it is the white man&rsquo;s gun, Ascota left it.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img alt=""  src="1600881h-images/page270.png" width="500" height="750"><a name="270"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ascota does not leave a gun,&rdquo;  said Jack. &ldquo;Where is Garrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; muttered Etzeeah.  &ldquo;I have not seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are lying,&rdquo; Jack said coldly.  &ldquo;For the last time I ask you, where is Garrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah fell back on a sullen,  walled silence.</p>
<p>Jack turned to Mary. &ldquo;Is there a  woman or a child that he sets great store by?&rdquo; he asked swiftly in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etzoogah, his son, the pretty boy  yonder,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>Following her glance. Jack had no  difficulty in picking out the one she meant. He was a handsome, slender boy, a  year or so younger than Davy. Where the other children were in rags, he was  wearing an expensive wide-brimmed hat from the store, a clean blue gingham  shirt, new trousers, and around his waist a gay red sash. Moreover, he had the  wilful, petulant look of the spoiled child; plainly the apple of the old man&rsquo;s  eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me a horse and a rope  bridle,&rdquo; Jack whispered to Mary.</p>
<p>There were several horses picketed  within the square, handy to their owners&rsquo; uses, and Mary made for the nearest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take my horse?&rdquo; Etzeeah  demanded, scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for your son to ride,&rdquo; Jack  said with a grim smile. &ldquo;Etzoogah, come here!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>The boy approached with an awed,  scared air. Etzeeah started to his side, but Jack coolly separated them by  moving his horse between. Mary returned with the other horse, and the boy fell  into her hands. She smiled at him reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s  going to hurt you. Come with us to our camp. Davy is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the children knew Mary and  Davy. Moreover, there were always good things to eat in a white man&rsquo;s camp. The  boy was well pleased to obey. Etzeeah shrilly commanded him to dismount, but  the apple of his eye merely laughed at him. The old man began to break. His  eyes dulled with anxiety; his hands trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you do with my boy?&rdquo; he  demanded. &ldquo;We shoot if you take him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &ldquo;A red man can&rsquo;t  shoot a white man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His hand shakes too much. We will take the boy to  our camp. We will keep him until you bring the sick white man to us. If you  don&rsquo;t bring him back, well, maybe we will send the boy outside and make a white  man of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack gave him a moment. There was  no sign from Etzeeah, except his trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride on,&rdquo; Jack said to Mary.</p>
<p>They wheeled their horses, and  Etzeeah broke down.</p>
<p>His hand went to his throat.  &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he muttered thickly. He did not cry out or protest. He merely shrugged.  &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; he said stoically. &ldquo;I will find Garrod if I can. Ascota took him  away from camp two days ago, and came back without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed him?&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>Etzeeah shook his head. &ldquo;He was  mad. Madmen are not harmed. He took him into the bush and left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left him to starve?&rdquo; cried Jack.  &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was mad,&rdquo; repeated Etzeeah.  &ldquo;The beasts and the birds will bring him food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shrugged impatiently. &ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more lies. You come back and show me the place  now, or I take the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Etzoogah, get  down. Get my blanket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy obeyed, none too  willingly, and Etzeeah mounted in his place. &ldquo;You feed me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is plenty,&rdquo; said Jack. To  Mary he said in English. &ldquo;Make him ride ahead of you out of camp. I&rsquo;ll stay and  hold the crowd. Sing out when you reach the trees, and I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of herself, fear for him  transfixed her eyes. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>He frowned. &ldquo;No weakness. You must  do as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah got his blanket, and he  and Mary rode out of the square. The Indians stirred and muttered angrily, but  the blue eyes still held them chained. When Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; reached his  ears, Jack turned his horse, and, swinging himself sidewise with a thigh over  the saddle, walked out of the square, watching them still. The theatrical  instinct of a young man suggested rolling a cigarette to him. Slipping his arm  through the bridle rein, he got out the bag of tobacco and the papers.</p>
<p>At a hundred yards distance the  spell that held the Indians began to break, and they moved forward between the  tepees, cursing Jack, and brandishing their arms. Jack&rsquo;s horse started forward;  pulling him in, he moistened the cigarette, watching them still. Guns were  raised at last &mdash; and fired. Still Jack walked his horse. He could see that as yet  the gun-play was merely to save themselves in the eyes of their women. No  bullets came in his direction. But he could not tell how long He lit his  cigarette.</p>
<p>A bullet whined overhead. Another  ploughed up a little cascade of earth alongside, and his horse sheered off. A  chorus of maniacal yells was raised behind him. It was only fifteen yards to  the trees. Jack threw away the cigarette, and gave the horse his head. They  gained the forest, with the bullets thudding deep into the trunks on either  side. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>XVII<br>
  Ascota Escapes</b></h3>
<p>&quot;When Etzeeah caught sight of  the little tents through the trees, he pulled up his horse. Extending a  trembling forefinger, he asked hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ascota, is he there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t hurt  you. He&rsquo;s tied up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah slipped from his horse. &ldquo;I  wait here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I not go where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; asked Jack with  curling lip. Etzeeah had turned pale; his eyes darted from side to side, and he  moistened his lips. &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he muttered doggedly. &ldquo;He is more than a  man. He has made the beasts speak to me; the porcupine, the bear, the beaver,  each after his own nature. He has made men mad before my eyes, and brought  their senses back when it pleased him. He mastered the white man, and made him  kneel before him, and bring him his food. This I saw. The like was never known  before. Who would not be afraid? What if he is tied? He will wither me with his  eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Mary looked at each other  in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blindfold Jean Paul,&rdquo; Mary  suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jack with clearing  brow. &ldquo;Watch him,&rdquo; he added in English, &ldquo;and come over when I wave my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack led his horse across the  brook. Here another evidence of Jean Paul Ascota&rsquo;s evil power awaited him. Davy  at sight of Jack sprang up with an odd, low cry, and came running to meet him,  running waveringly as if his knees were sinking under him. He cast himself on  Jack, trembling like aspen leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad &mdash;  oh, Jack! Jean Paul &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe. Oh, Jack!&mdash;he said &mdash;  he&rsquo;s a devil, Jack. He made me want to let him go! He said &mdash; oh! it&rsquo;s horrible!  He said &mdash; oh! I can&rsquo;t tell you! Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s agonized voice trailed  off; he sighed, and, his slender frame relaxing, hung limply over Jack&rsquo;s arm.  Jack let his horse go, and waving to Mary to keep back, he bent, and dashed the  cold brook water in Davy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He revived in a moment or two, and  clung to Jack. &ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never come! I was near  crazy. He said &mdash; oh! I can&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, old boy,&rdquo; said  Jack gruffly. &ldquo;Forget it! Mary and I are both here. It&rsquo;s all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried him up the bank, and  put him down by the fire. A sip from Jack&rsquo;s flask further restored him. Then  Jack turned with grim eyes and clenched fists toward Jean Paul&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You devil!&rdquo; he muttered. It was  the word they all used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to smoke,&rdquo; Jean Paul said  impudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie there and want it, damn you!&rdquo;  said Jack. He had much ado to restrain himself from kicking the beast. As it  was he flung him over none too tenderly, and taking the handkerchief from the  breed&rsquo;s neck, tied it tight round his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somet&rsquo;ing you don&rsquo;t want  me to see, huh?&rdquo; sneered Jean Paul.</p>
<p>Jack was a little staggered by his  perspicacity.</p>
<p>He waved his hand to Mary. She  brought Etzeeah across, and flew to comfort and restore Davy. They never did  learn exactly what Jean Paul had said to him. At any mention of the subject the  boy&rsquo;s agitation became painful to see.</p>
<p>Etzeeah after coming into camp  never once opened his mouth. He regarded Jean Paul&rsquo;s tent as nervously as if  its flimsy walls confined a man-eating grizzly. He sat down at some distance,  and at the side of the tent where Jean Paul could not have seen him even had  his eyes not been blindfolded.</p>
<p>Jack brought wood, and Mary  started to prepare a meal for them all, before taking to the trail again. At a  moment when there was comparative silence a loud voice suddenly issued from the  tent, speaking the Sapi tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etzeeah is there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all started violently. It was  uncanny. Etzeeah paled, and sprang up. Jack laid a heavy hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell him!&rdquo; the voice of Jean  Paul went on, full of mocking triumph. &ldquo;Nothing can be hidden from me! Etzeeah  has betrayed me! Bound and helpless though I am, don&rsquo;t think you can escape me,  old Etzeeah! My medicine travels far! Your son, your fine boy Etzoogah, shall  pay. He&rsquo;s paying now! He falls and twists on the ground with the frothing  sickness &mdash; the fine boy! He curses his father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was struggling with the  frantic father. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, stop his mouth!&rdquo; he cried to Mary. &ldquo;A gag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flew to the tent, and  presently the voice was stilled. The last sound it uttered was a laugh, a  studied, slow, devilish laugh, frightful to untutored ears. We are accustomed  to such tricks on our stage.</p>
<p>Etzeeah lay moaning and wailing,  clawing up handfuls of earth to put on his matted gray head. Jack arose from  him white and grim, and with a new light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had about enough of this,&rdquo;  he muttered between his teeth.</p>
<p>Mary, divining what was in his  mind, flew to him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Not that! Not that!&rdquo; she  gasped, breathless with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do it here,&rdquo;  Jack said harshly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him away. What else can I do? Look at Davy! Look  at the Indian! This breed is like a pestilence among us! He&rsquo;ll have us all  stark mad if I don&rsquo;t &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she implored, clinging  to him. &ldquo;You and I are strong enough to stand it, Jack. We&rsquo;ll come through all  right. But we never could forget&rdquo; &mdash; her voice sunk low &mdash; &ldquo;not his <i>blood</i>, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His purpose failed him. He caught up  her hand and pressed it hard to his cheek with an abrupt, odd motion. Dropping  it, he turned away. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said shortly. His eyes fell on Etzeeah.  &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he cried scornfully. &ldquo;This is old woman&rsquo;s talk! If he can send  sickness through the air, why doesn&rsquo;t he strike <i>me</i> down, who bound him, and blinded, and gagged him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etzeeah, struck by the  reasonableness of this, ceased his frantic lamentations.</p>
<p>In an hour they were ready for the  trail again. Jack sent Mary and Davy on ahead with Etzeeah and the pack-horses.  It was arranged that as soon as they reached the site of the former Indian  camp, where Etzeeah said Jean Paul had turned Garrod adrift, they were to drop  the baggage and go in search of the missing man.</p>
<p>As soon as the others had ridden  out of sight, Jack removed the blind and the gag from Jean Paul and cut the  cord that bound his ankles and his wrists together. He freed his wrists; his  ankles he left bound. The half-breed stretched out, and rolled on the ground in  an ecstacy of relief. Finally he sat up, and Jack put the food that had been  left for him where he could reach it. Jack stood back, watching him grimly, a  hand on the butt of his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; to shoot me?&rdquo; Jean  Paul demanded coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t waste good food on you  if I were,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;Hurry up and put it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not got the nerve to shoot  me,&rdquo; sneered Jean Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to hypnotize me and you&rsquo;ll  see,&rdquo; Jack said with a hard smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad of an excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo; you shoot me now?&rdquo; Jean  Paul persisted, with a look like a vain and wilful child, experimenting to see  how far he can go against a stronger force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather see you hang,&rdquo; said  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police can&rsquo;t touch me. I do  not&rsquo;ing against the law, me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thing called treason in  this country,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You can hang for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul laughed. &ldquo;Fort Cheever  long way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You not bring me there, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll bury you on the way,&rdquo;  said Jack with his grim start of laughter. </p>
<p>When Jean Paul had eaten. Jack  bound his hands in front of him this time, and liberated his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the  horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make me,&rdquo; Jean Paul  said with his sidelong look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; said Jack coolly.  &ldquo;You can run along at my horse&rsquo;s tail if you&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul scowled at the suggested  indignity, and climbed on without more ado. Jack tied his hands to the saddle  horn.</p>
<p>It was seventeen miles down the  forested valley back to the site of the former Indian camp. This, the ancient  route between Forts Cheever and Erskine, was a good trail, and they covered the  distance without stopping. Jean Paul rode ahead, Jack following with his  revolver loose in its holster. It may be said that he almost hoped the breed  would try to escape, to give him a chance to use it, but perhaps Jean Paul guessed  what was in his mind. At any rate he rode quietly.</p>
<p>Issuing out of the forest at last,  the Spirit River valley was spread before them, with the big stream winding  among its wide, naked bars. The abandoned camp lay below them, a village of  bare tepee poles in a rich meadow surrounded by an open park of white-stemmed  poplars. As they approached it a fresh anxiety struck at Jack&rsquo;s breast, for he  saw the three pack-horses picketed to the trees with their packs on their  backs. He knew that only an emergency would have taken Mary and Davy away  without unloading them. The animals had been rolling, to the no small detriment  of their baggage. Jean Paul laughed at the sight.</p>
<p>Jack had no recourse but to  possess his soul in patience until they came back. Meanwhile he unpacked the  horses, and pitched their four little tents, two on each side of the fire. He  bound Jean Paul securely as before, and put him in his own tent. He hung the  gag from the ridge-pole with significant action. Jean Paul&rsquo;s lips were already  bruised and blue as a result of the previous application.</p>
<p>Not until late afternoon was  Jack&rsquo;s anxious breast relieved by the sight of the three horses single-footing  it across the meadow. Davy rode first, then Etzeeah, looking crestfallen and  sullen, and Mary bringing up the rear, her rifle across her arm, and  determination making her girl&rsquo;s face grim. Evidently there had been trouble;  but the three of them, and, uninjured! Jack could have shouted with relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ran away,&rdquo; Mary explained  briefly. &ldquo;Davy and I had hobbled two of the riding horses, when he suddenly  jumped on the third and headed north. He got a couple of minutes&rsquo; start before  we could get the hobbles off and after him. When he got in the timber, he  turned the horse adrift, and we lost more time following its tracks. But I  guessed he would make back to the trail as soon as you had passed, so we  patrolled it, and we nabbed him at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; said Jack briefly. It  did not occur to him that there was something rather extraordinary in a mere  girl and boy bringing in the headman of the Sapi Indians by themselves. He  expected it of their white blood.</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing for it  now but to bind Etzeeah hand and foot also, and to convert Jack&rsquo;s tent into a  cell for him. The two prisoners lay in their separate shelters on one side of  the fire, while their captors watched them from the other. Jack was to sleep  with Davy, and except for Mary&rsquo;s rifle, all the weapons in camp were stowed in  that tent. The long-threatened rain set in steady and cold, and the night  threatened to be as dark as winter.</p>
<p>They ate their supper inside  Davy&rsquo;s tent, while the fire sputtered and sulked in the rain. A heavy silence  prevailed; for one thing, they were dead weary, and their difficulties were  pressing thick upon them. The rain did not lighten them. Jack, looking at Mary  and Davy, thought with softening eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re clear grit! But if I only  had another man!&rdquo; The instant they had finished eating he ordered the two  youngsters to bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feed the two of them,&rdquo; he said, nodding across the  fire, &ldquo;and clean up. It will help keep me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need sleep more than either  of us,&rdquo; Mary objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I once let myself go I&rsquo;d never  wake,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you at midnight.&rdquo; It was tacitly  understood between them that Davy was not to keep watch.</p>
<p>His work done, Jack sat down  inside the door of Davy&rsquo;s tent to smoke, and if he could, to keep the fire  going in spite of the rain. He found that it required too great a blaze to be  proof against the downpour. He had not nearly enough wood to last throughout  the night, so he let it out in order that Mary might enjoy what remained of the  fuel. When the fire went out he could no longer see into Jean Paul&rsquo;s tent, so  he crossed over and sat down beside him. Throughout the weary hours he sat  smoking to keep himself awake, until his mouth was raw. From the adjoining tent  issued the reassuring sound of Etzeeah&rsquo;s snores; Jean Paul, too, never stirred,  and his breathing was deep and slow.</p>
<p>Midnight had passed before Jack  had the heart to waken Mary. He first took advantage of a lull in the rain to  start the fire again. As he threw back the curtain of her little tent, the  firelight shone in her face, rosy and serene in sleep, her cheek pillowed on  her round arm. The sight stirred him to the very core of his being. He knelt,  gazing at her breathlessly. He forgot everything, except that she was lovely.  He suddenly bent over her with a guilty air, and lightly kissed her lips.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. He sprang  away in a panic at the thought of her scorn. But she awoke with an enchanting  smile. &ldquo;Jack I dreamed&mdash;&rdquo; she began, as if it were the sweetest and the most  natural thing in the world for her to find him bending over her at night &mdash; and  caught herself up with a burning blush. Jack hastily retreated outside. Neither  of them referred to it again.</p>
<p>Jack was asleep as soon as he  stretched himself beside Davy. The next thing he knew, something had happened,  what it was he could not tell. He staggered to his feet, and out into the open,  drunken, paralyzed with sleep, and fighting for consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; cried Mary.</p>
<p>That awakened him. He saw her on  her knees before Jean Paul&rsquo;s tent, and ran to her. The tent was empty. The rain  poured down on their heads unheeded. The fire was out.</p>
<p>Mary was in great distress. &ldquo;My  fault,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It rained harder than ever, and the fire went out. I could  not bear to sit beside him as you did. It made me sick to be so near him! I  thought I could watch from my tent. The wind came up and it was hard to see. He  fixed the blanket to look as if he was still under it. He must have slipped out  of the back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tied hand and foot!&rdquo; cried  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cords are here,&rdquo; she said,  displaying them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s searching hand found two  small stones in the blanket that she showed Jack; one had a sharp, jagged edge,  and the explanation was clear. Throughout the hours when Jack sat beside him,  and he seemed to be so sound asleep, the wily breed had been patiently rubbing  at the cords until they frayed apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more your fault than mine,&rdquo;  said Jack grimly. Simultaneously the thought of Etzeeah occurred to them, and  they sprang to look under the adjoining shelter. At first glance in the  darkness, the Indian seemed to be safely there, but when Jack put out his hand  the puffed-up blanket collapsed, and there was nothing under it. At that, for  the first, their strong young breasts were shaken by awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Jack gasped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got  him, too! How could he? With you not twenty feet away. And not a sound. Is it a  man or a devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pegs that held down the back  of Jack&rsquo;s lean-to were drawn, showing how Jean Paul had entered, and how he had  removed his prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etzeeah&mdash;&rdquo; said Mary tremblingly,  &ldquo;do you suppose Jean Paul has&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would hardly take him alive,&rdquo;  said Jack grimly, &ldquo;without a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he had no weapon, we know  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he did,&rdquo; faltered Mary,  &ldquo;why would he take &mdash; take the body away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. &ldquo;They are  always mysterious,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be near,&rdquo; whispered Mary.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dangerous to us until he  gets a weapon,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Wake Davy, and you two watch our guns. I&rsquo;ll bring  in the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was near four, and beginning to  be light. The rain ceased, and a thick white mist clung to the river-meadows.  It was not easy to find the horses. Jack satisfied himself that two of them  were missing. Why two? he thought. He did not find the body of Etzeeah, as he  half expected.</p>
<p>He had to wait for better light  before he could look for tracks. He found them at last, leading back up the  Darwin valley, the fresh hoof-prints of two horses superimposed on the  confusion of tracks they had made coming and going. The horses had been ridden  at a gallop. Jack returned to tell Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone all right,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;And alive or dead, he&rsquo;s taken Etzeeah with him. The second horse carried a  load too. He&rsquo;s gone back to the Sapis for grub and a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary searched Jack&rsquo;s face with a  poignant anxiety to see what he intended to do. &ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; she suggested.  &ldquo;We know that Garrod is near here somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack stood considering with bent  brows and clenched hands. He finally shook his head. &ldquo;He could come back  to-night, and pick us off one by one around our fire. We&rsquo;ll have no peace or  security until I get him, Mary. I&rsquo;ll have to leave Garrod to you and Davy. You  know how much finding him means to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; she faltered, her eyes  wide with terror for him, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t go back alone to the Sapis. They shot at  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s uncertainty was gone. He  raised a face, transfigured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! That mongrel crew!&rdquo; he  cried. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the least of my difficulties. I&rsquo;ll drop on them before Jean  Paul can work them up to mischief.<i> I&rsquo;ve  got to get that breed!</i> No murder can be done in my camp, and the murderer  get away! No redskin shall ever live to brag of how he bested me! I&rsquo;ll get him  if I have to ride to hell and drag him out!&rdquo; </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br>
  The End of Ascota</b></h3>
<p>Two hours later Jack rode into the  Sapi village for the second time, and flung himself off his tired and dripping  mount. The horse stood with hanging head, and feet planted wide apart, fighting  for breath. This time Jack&rsquo;s arrival created little visible sensation. The  people were otherwise and terribly preoccupied. A strange silence prevailed,  extending even to the children and the dogs. Many of the people were gathered  around the entrance to Etzeeah&rsquo;s lodge. They merely turned their heads with a  scowl, and the men drew on the walled look they affect in the presence of  whites. In the faces of the women and children awe and terror were painted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ascota, where is he?&rdquo; Jack  demanded.</p>
<p>Hands were silently pointed up the  valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour,&rdquo; one said.</p>
<p>Outside the square Jack saw two  more dead weary horses still wet from their punishing ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Etzeeah?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>There was no answer. All the heads  turned as one toward the tepee. </p>
<p>Jack threw back the blind that  hangs over the entrance, and, stooping, entered. He was prepared for what he  saw. The body of the old man sprawled on its back beside the fire. All around  the tepee squatted his wives and his sons in attitudes of sullen mourning.  Etzoogah, the best-beloved, eyed the body askance with scared eyes, and chewed  the tassel of his red sash. Etzeeah was not a comely sight. Death was in his  face, but none of the majesty of death. His grimy, wrinkled &rsquo;skin was livid and  blackened. The marks on his scrawny throat showed how he had met his end.</p>
<p>Stooping, Jack picked up his hand,  and let it fall. It was significantly cold and stiff. He decently composed the  dead man&rsquo;s limbs, and signed to one of the women to cover the body with her  shawl.</p>
<p>Rising, he looked grimly around  the circle. &ldquo;This is murder!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>None showed in any way that they  heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will ride with me to catch  the murderer?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>None moved. The faces of the women  showed a start of terror.</p>
<p>Jack went outside again, and  looked over the silent crowd. Seeing Charlbogin, one of the deserters, among  them, he went to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Ascota speak?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The sulky boy could not resist the  command. &ldquo;Ascota throw Etzeeah on the ground, so!&rdquo; he said with a striking  gesture. &ldquo;He say: &lsquo;This is a man who betrayed me! Bury him!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>A shudder passed through the  crowd. Children wailed and whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He take a gun and a blanket, and  moose meat from the fire; he catch a horse and ride west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you let him go!&rdquo; exclaimed  Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ascota is not a man like us,&rdquo; the  young man muttered. &ldquo;He does what he likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More woman&rsquo;s talk!&rdquo; cried Jack.  &ldquo;Are there any men among you? Come with me, and I&rsquo;ll show you stronger magic  than Ascota&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men affected to smile  contemptuously as at an idle boaster. None moved to follow him. The obstinacy  of their terror faced Jack like a wall, and he saw the futility of trying to  move it.</p>
<p>He cursed them roundly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go  alone then,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Bring me the best horse there is. I&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shrugged as much as to say:  &ldquo;Let him, as long as he pays.&rdquo; One went to get the horse. In five minutes Jack  was pounding the trail again.</p>
<p>Beyond the village the valley narrowed,  and the roar of the plunging stream rose from the bottom of it. The bordering  hills rapidly became steeper and higher. The trail did not follow the course of  the river, but found an easier route along the face of the hills a hundred feet  or so above. The sides of the hills had been burned over here, and the forest  was only a wilderness of naked, charred sticks. Many of these had fallen in the  trail, making slow going for the horse. Occasionally the little river paused  for a while in its headlong descent to wander back and forth through a green  meadow. The trail came down to cross these easy places, and it was only here  that Jack could extend his horse.</p>
<p>The plain tracks of Jean Paul&rsquo;s  horse led him on. Jack could read that the breed was riding recklessly and  distancing him steadily mile by mile, but he would not on that account risk his  own horse&rsquo;s legs through the down timber. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him,&rdquo; he said to himself  coolly, with the terrible singleness of purpose of which he was capable. In  such a mood he was no longer a man, but an engine</p>
<p>Jack had come across the mountains  from Fort Erskine by this trail, and he knew it well. It was evidently for Fort  Erskine, where he was not wellknown, that Jean Paul was making. Ahead, through  the forest of bare sticks that hemmed him in, Jack could see the gateway to the  mountains, the magnificent limestone pile of Mount Darwin on the right. He had  worked around the base of Darwin, and all this was familiar ground.</p>
<p>It was about noon when Jack and  his horse, rounding a spur of the hill, were brought up all standing by the  sight of a dark body lying in the trail ahead. Dismounting, and tying his  trembling animal to a tree, Jack went forward to investigate. It was a horse,  Jean Paul&rsquo;s horse, with a broken foreleg, and abandoned to its fate. Jack&rsquo;s  heart beat high with hope; the end of this thing was in sight now. The poor  brute raised agonized eyes to him. Jack could not put a bullet through its head  without betraying his whereabouts, but he mercifully cut its throat.</p>
<p>He proceeded warily. He was  covered from above by the very steepness of the hill and the impenetrable  barriers of the fallen timber. The prints of Jean Paul&rsquo;s moccasins led him  ahead. The trail dropped steeply to a little stream that he knew well; it  drained the easterly slope of Mount Darwin. It marked the edge of the  burned-over tract, and on the other side the trail plunged into virgin forest  again.</p>
<p>Jack went forward as cautiously as  an Indian, taking advantage of every scrap of cover. At the brook he lost Jean  Paul&rsquo;s tracks. It was clear the breed had waded either up or down. Jack was  pretty sure he would not be far away, for the redskin of Jean Paul&rsquo;s type has  no love for long journeys afoot. But it promised to be a somewhat extended  stalk and his horse was no use to him. He therefore went back, cached his  saddle, and turned the beast out hobbled, trusting that it would find its way  back to the last river-meadow they had passed. Blanket and grub Jack strapped  on his back, and his gun he carried under his arm.</p>
<p>He spent an hour searching up and  down the shores of the creek for tracks, without success. Neither was there any  evidence of Jean Paul&rsquo;s having returned to the trail farther along. If Jack was  well skilled in reading tracks, the breed was adept in hiding them. Jack&rsquo;s only  recourse was to climb. There is a little eminence abutting on the base of Mount  Darwin and on the top of it a knoll of naked rock that overlooks the valley for  miles up and down. Knowing the natives&rsquo; deep-rooted aversion to drinking cold water,  Jack guessed that Jean Paul would have to build a fire, and from this point of  vantage a fire, however small, would almost surely betray his whereabouts.</p>
<p>Taking his bearings, he made a  beeline up the steep slope through the heavy, old timber that reached up from  the valley, and through a dense light growth of poplar above. This part of the  mountain offered no special difficulties in climbing, and in half an hour he  threw himself down on the flat top of the knoll, with the valley spread before  him.</p>
<p>Mount Darwin reaches a long  promontory down the valley it has given its name to. The promontory consists of  seven little peaks in a row, each one rising over the head of the one in front,  and the seventh is the actual summit of the mountain. It was on number one of  these little summits that Jack now lay, looking down the valley up which he had  ridden that morning. A mile or so away was a patch of green with a black dot  upon it, that he guessed was his horse.</p>
<p>Off to his left, hidden in the  forest, the creek came tumbling down from the snows above; on his right hand  the river washed the rocky base of the monarch. The easiest way to the summit  is right on up over the succeeding peaks; indeed on this side there is a  mountain goat trail direct to the top. Darwin can also be climbed, but not so  easily, by ascending the creek for a couple of miles, thence up a steep slide  to a long hogback that leads back to the sixth peak. On the river side the  rocky cliffs tower six thousand feet into the air, sheer and unscalable. Such  was the theatre of the pursuit of Jean Paul Ascota.</p>
<p>In all the wide space opened to  Jack&rsquo;s eye there was not a sign of life, except the black pin-point that he  supposed was his horse, and a pair of eagles, sailing and screaming high above  the forest. Nowhere in the brilliantly clear air was there the least sign of  smoke. He ate some of his bread and meat while he watched, and smoked his pipe.  He marked a place around to the right below where the trail passed over a rocky  spur. On the other side it was open to him through the down timber; so that  Jean Paul could not pass either way on the trail without his seeing him.</p>
<p>It was hard on the engine of  retribution to be obliged to sit and wait. When his pipe went out he moved  restlessly up and down his little plateau or shelf of rock. Behind him, the  forest grew close and high, hiding the rest of the mountain. He never knew  quite how it happened, but at one end of the rock, near the place where he had  come up, he suddenly found himself staring at the perfect print of a moccasined  foot in a patch of moss! His breast swelled with satisfaction at the sight; at  the same time he frowned with chagrin to think of the valuable time he had  wasted sitting within twenty feet of Jean Paul&rsquo;s trail</p>
<p>Jean Paul&rsquo;s path up through the  thickly springing poplar saplings was not more than two yards from Jack&rsquo;s own.  Such are the caprices of the Goddess of Chance! He had crossed the rock, and  continued on up the mountain by the mountain goat trail, which first became  visible here. Evidently believing that he had shaken off pursuit, and that no  one would dream of looking for him on the mountain, he was no longer taking any  care to cover his tracks</p>
<p>Jack hastened after, as keen and  determined as a high-bred hound whom nothing short of a cataclysm could divert  from his purpose. The rough track followed the top of a stony ridge, which  dropped steeply to the river on one side, and sloped more gradually into a  forested hollow on the other. A thick growth of pines afforded him perfect  cover. Like all animal paths, the trail wound like a tangled string among the  trees. The growth ended abruptly on the edge of a shallow rocky cut athwart the  ridge. On the other side of the cut rose the steep face of the second little  peak in the series.</p>
<p>Jack paused within the shelter of  the trees to reconnoitre. The great slope of rock opposite, with its wide, bare  ditch, made a well-nigh perfect natural fortification. He watched the top of it  lynx-eyed, and presently he was rewarded by the sight of a wisp of smoke floating  over the edge. Jack drew a long breath and grimly smiled. So that was where he  was!</p>
<p>He had chosen admirably. The  growing timber ended at the spot where Jack was, but up above there was enough  down timber to keep the breed in fire until the judgment day, if he wished to  stay, and his fire would be invisible from any point in the valley. For water,  all the ledges and hollows on the northerly side were heaped with snow; for  food there were mountain goats and ptarmigan; for defence he had only to roll a  stone down on the head of any one who tried to climb to his aerie.</p>
<p>While Jack watched, carefully  concealed, Jean Paul suddenly showed himself boldly on the edge of the cliff.  The distance was about three hundred yards, a possible shot, but at a difficult  angle. Jack held his hand. It was all important not to put the halfbreed on his  guard just yet. Jean Paul carelessly surveyed the approaches to his position,  and went back out of sight.</p>
<p>Any attack from in front was out  of the question. Only one thing suggested itself to Jack: to climb the mountain  by the other possible route, and come down on Jean Paul from above. As soon as  it occurred to him he started to retrace his steps, without giving a thought to  the enormous physical exertion involved. This way was beset with difficulties;  the bed of the creek was heaped with the tangled trunks brought down by the  freshets. But Jack set his teeth doggedly, and attacking these obstacles, put  them behind him one after another.</p>
<p>The sun was three hours lower  before he stood at the edge of the timber line on the other great spur of the  mountain. He hesitated here. Above him extended a smooth, steep slide of earth  and stones at least two thousand feet across, and without so much as a bush or  a boulder for cover. At the top of this slide was the hogback that led back to  the sixth peak. If Jean Paul was watchful he could scarcely fail to see Jack  mounting the naked slope. True, nearly half a mile separated them, but a moving  black spot, however small, would arrest his attention if he saw it. He would  not mistake it for an animal, for the only animal on the upper slopes is the  snowy mountain goat.</p>
<p>However, Jack had to chance it.  His principal fear was that Jean Paul, seeing him, might climb down from his  rock and gain a long start of him to the valley. But he reassured himself with  the thought that the Indian could not guess but that there were others waiting  below. It would require a stout heart to climb down that rock in the face of  possible fire from the trees.</p>
<p>Jack started his climb.  Occasionally he could see Jean Paul moving around on his distant rock.  Sometimes he thought the black spot seemed to stand and watch him, but this was  his fancy. However, when he was halfway up, he saw him without doubt begin to  climb the face of the third peak, and Jack knew that he had been discovered.  Jean Paul was going up instead of down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him now,&rdquo; Jack told himself.</p>
<p>Thus began a strange and desperate  race for the summit of the mountain. Until near the end it was anybody&rsquo;s race;  Jean Paul was the nearer, but he had the steeper way to go; he was also the  fresher of the two, but Jack was insensible of fatigue. The Indian kept himself  out of sight for the most part, but occasionally the configuration of the rocks  obliged him to show himself, and Jack marked his progress keenly. Meanwhile his  own climb was nearly breaking his heart. He found that it was only a heart  after all, and not a steam-chest. One cannot run up a mountain with impunity.</p>
<p>Jean Paul mounted the fourth peak  about the same time that Jack reached the hogback, and threw himself down to  ease his tortured breast for a moment. Jack had now to turn at right angles,  and every step brought them nearer to each other. Jack had cover behind the  summit of the ridge all the way to the foot of the last climb. It was  impossible for either to guess the outcome. Jean Paul was still the nearer, but  Jack was making better time. He ran along the slope on a level line and gained  a hundred yards.</p>
<p>When he looked over the top again  he was encouraged to see that Jean Paul was labouring hard. He had often to  throw himself down in full sight to give his heart a chance. Meanwhile they  were coming very close. They were already within gunshot when the peak they  were both striving for intervened between them. The breed was aiming for one  side, Jack for the other. Jack wondered, should their heads rise over the top  simultaneously, which would have the strength to lift his gun.</p>
<p>Toward the base of the peak of  rock the ridge became steep and broken. Excruciating pains attacked Jack&rsquo;s  legs, and his sinews failed him. He dropped to his hands and knees, and crawled  on. He had almost reached the little peak, when suddenly a dark face looked  down on him from over the top, and he had just time to drop behind a jutting  shoulder of rock to escape the bullet that whistled overhead. The race had gone  to Jean Paul.</p>
<p>Jack lay debating his next move.  Meanwhile it was grateful to rest, and to feel the strength steal back. His  case was not yet hopeless, he decided. The rounded cone of rock that Jean Paul  held was easily accessible from any point of the arc visible to Jack, and from  the speed with which the breed had gained the summit, he guessed that it must  be even easier from the other side. With darkness to aid him he ought to be  able to surprise his enemy. The sun was setting now. At close quarters Jack&rsquo;s  revolver would give him an advantage.</p>
<p>But this same train of reasoning  must have passed through the breed&rsquo;s mind, for later, upon peeping around his  rock, Jack saw that Jean Paul had retreated from his peak, and was running off  to the right across the flat battlement that connected it with the slightly  higher cone that was the true summit of Mount Darwin. He had started to  scramble up the face of the rock. Springing up, Jack fired at him, but it was  too far, and there was cover behind the jutting ledges. Jean Paul gained the  top in safety.</p>
<p>Jack promptly seized the position  he had abandoned. Rising cautiously over the side farthest from Jean Paul, he  built himself, stone upon stone, a little parapet upon the summit, behind which  he could lie and watch his enemy through the interstices. Presently he saw that  Jean Paul was following suit, covering himself behind his wall while he raised  it. A shot or two was exchanged, but without effect, and as if by mutual  consent they left off. Their lead was too precious to be splashed on the rocks.</p>
<p>So they watched, each holding  alone, as it were, a heaven-piercing tower of the same castle, with the  battlement between. It was a dizzy perch. The whole world was spread beneath  them, a world of confused gray, and brown mountain peaks like vast stalagmites  pointing fingers toward heaven. It was like a nightmare sea suddenly petrified  with its waves up-heaved. In the whole vast wilderness there was no suggestion  of mankind or of life. Up there the thin, cold air sharpened the senses; one  seemed to become aware of the great roll of our planet to the east, and  instinctively clung to the rock to keep from being flung off into space.</p>
<p>About two hundred yards separated  the white man and the breed. Jean Paul&rsquo;s position was some fifty feet higher  than Jack&rsquo;s, and Jack had therefore to build the higher parapet. Nevertheless  Jack&rsquo;s heart beat strong; he had him trapped now. At the same time it was a  well-defended trap, and there he might sit watching him until starvation took a  hand in the fight. Jack had only full rations for one day more; he suspected  Jean Paul might be better provided. A red man starves slower than a white. Each  could reach plenty of snow to quench his thirst, but there was nothing to burn  up there. Jack looked through his peepholes, and considered how he might bring  matters to an issue.</p>
<p>On his right in the corner between  the hogback and the final peak there was a bowl a thousand feet deep or more,  with a little lake in the bottom of a colour between sapphire and emerald. The  sides of the bowl were steep slopes of rubble. Jack could not see all this from  where he lay, but he had marked it on the way up. After dark he thought it  might be possible to crawl around the rim of the bowl to the base of Jean  Paul&rsquo;s tower of rock, and scale it from that side. This he could see, and he  scanned it hard. It was a staggering climb &mdash; say, two hundred feet of  precipitous limestone. But it was scarred and ridged and cracked by centuries  of weather; and it was not absolutely perpendicular. It might be done.</p>
<p>Having made up his mind, he coolly  rolled up in his blanket to sleep behind his parapet until dark. Small chance  of Jean Paul&rsquo;s venturing across the battlement.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was as dark as it  would get. He fortified himself with bread and meat washed down by snow-water.  He left his gun rolled in the blanket &mdash; the revolver would serve better &mdash; and  he propped his hat on a stone so that the crown would peep above his little  wall. If it should become light before he reached him, it might serve to occupy  Jean Paul&rsquo;s attention for a little. If he succeeded in knocking it off its  stone, so much the better.</p>
<p>The passage around the rim of the  bowl offered no special difficulty, except the danger of starting a miniature  avalanche down the slope, and putting the breed on his guard. He took it a foot  at a time. In an hour he drew himself up the first steps of his rocky tower,  with the stars looking over his shoulder. Stars, too, seemed to be glancing up  at him out of the depths of the black gulf. He would not let himself look down.  With the faculty he had, he closed his brain to any thought of failing or of  falling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get him! I&rsquo;m going to get him!&rdquo; it beat out like a  piston, to the exclusion of everything else. Darkness aided him in this, that  it prevented the awful hazard from forcing itself on him through his eyes.</p>
<p>His hands had to serve him for  eyes, groping, feeling for the ledges and cracks like the antennae of an  insect. He gave himself plenty of time; he did not wish to arrive at the top  until there was light enough to make sure of his man. He had it figured out in  his odd, practical way: three hours, a hundred and eighty minutes; a foot and a  half a minute was ample. He could afford to rest and to steady himself on every  wide enough ledge.</p>
<p>The face of the rock unrolled  itself like a map under the eyes of his hands, and he remembered each foothold  as he put it behind him. When he came, as he did more than once, to a smooth,  blind face of rock that barred further progress, he patiently let himself down  again, and hit off at another angle. His aim was to work himself gradually  around to the back of Jean Paul&rsquo;s tower of rock, and fall on him squarely from  the rear.</p>
<p>He became aware of the approach of  dawn through a slight change of colour in the rock on which his eyes were  stubbornly fixed. He could not tell how far he had yet to climb, but he had  confidence in his calculations. Only once was his nerve shaken. A ptarmigan  suddenly flew out from a cranny above his head with a soft whirring of wings.  He wavered for a second, and the sweat sprung out all over his body. But he  gripped the rock hard, and grimly forced the rising tide of hysteria down.  &ldquo;Twenty feet more and I&rsquo;ll have him!&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>At last, above his head, the face  of the rock receded under his exploring hand, and he knew he had come to the  top. This was the difficult moment, for how was he to know upon drawing himself  over the edge that he would not find himself looking into the grinning face of  his enemy. A little push back would be enough! He paused for a while,  listening. Suddenly his heart was gladdened by the sound of a shot. Jean Paul  had fallen into his trap, and was popping at the hat. Jack called on all the  forces of his body, and with a great effort drew himself silently over the  rounded edge of the rock.</p>
<p>Jean Paul was ten yards away, and  a few feet above him. His back was turned. He was exposing himself boldly over  the top of his parapet, wondering perhaps why his shots had drawn no reply.  Against the vast expanse of sky the silhouette still had the neat and  ministerial outline; the Testament still peeped out of the side pocket. Jack  sprang over the rock. Jean Paul turned, and Jack had an impression of blank  eyes, fixed as by a blinding flash at night. Jack&rsquo;s rush bore him down before  he could raise his arms; the gun exploded in the air. Jack wrenched it out of  the man&rsquo;s hands and sent it spinning over the edge. They never heard it fall.</p>
<p>Drawing his revolver, Jack got up  from the breed. Jean Paul lay motionless. Jack watched him warily. It was dimly  borne in on him that after all he had been through his difficulties were only  now beginning. He had got his man and so kept his vow to himself; but, richly  as he deserved death, he couldn&rsquo;t shoot him disarmed. What was he to do with  him then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;and  over the wall with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul raised himself to a  sitting position. He had not yet fully recovered from the shock of surprise.</p>
<p>He stared at Jack with a kind of  stupid wonder. &ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Jack was willing enough to take  the breathing-space himself. Both men were near the point of physical  exhaustion. After the excitement of the chase the actual capture was tame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;ere we are,&rdquo; said Jean  Paul with an odd start of laughter. &ldquo;W&rsquo;at you goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take you to the fort or bury you on the way. I keep my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence between them.  They were motionless on their little platform of rock, remote in the great  spaces of the upper air. Jean Paul looked straight ahead of him with his hard,  flat black eyes, in which there lurked something inhuman and inexplicable, and  he idly plucked bits of moss from between the stones. What thoughts were  passing through his head only God who made the redskins knows. When he turned  his eyes again to Jack, it was with the old vain, childish, sidelong look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You t&rsquo;ink you one brave man, huh,  to climb up the rock las&rsquo; night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Jack  coolly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know yet what white men can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Paul sprang up with an  extraordinary display of passion. &ldquo;White men!&rdquo; he cried, flinging up his arms.  &ldquo;You are not the only men! I am a man as much as you! I am half white and I  hate the whites! My fathers were white as well as yours. They beget as and they  spit on us. Is it my fault that my blood is mixed? Am I your brother? No, your  dog that you kick! Very well. I will do something no pure white man ever did.  You go back and tell them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the side of the river, the rock  they were on ran up and ended in a row of jagged points like the jaw of a steel  trap, overhanging a well nigh bottomless void. With his last words Jean Paul  ran out on one of these points of rock, and stood there, with arms flung up,  like a diver before he makes his cast.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s heart contracted in his  breast. &ldquo;Comeback!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and get me, white man!&rdquo;  cried Jean Paul over his shoulder. Exaltation was in his face.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt=""  src="1600881h-images/page306.png" width="500" height="750"><a name="306"></a></p>
<p>Jack put up his revolver and,  crouching, made to seize the man&rsquo;s legs. Jean Paul, with a strange, loud cry,  stepped off, and was no more. No sound of any fall came up. Jack had not the  stomach to look over.</p>
<p>Four hours later he found the  thing below. He had no tools to dig a grave, and he heaped a cairn of stones  over it. On the face of a great boulder that overlooked the cairn he scratched  an epitaph with the point of his knife:</p>
<p align="center">JEAN  PAUL ASCOTA<br>
  Killed by leaping from the summit<br>
  of Mount Darwin<br>
  August &mdash; 19 &mdash;<br>
  A bad man and a brave one.</p>
<p>Then Jack lay down and slept  around the clock. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>XIX<br>
  An Old Score Is Charged Off</b></h3>
<p>Drawing near to the Sapi village  on his return, Jack first came upon a group of children picking wild  strawberries in the meadow, who fled screaming in advance of him into the  compound. There, every task was dropped, and every dark face turned toward him.  Fairly startled out of their affectation of stolidity, they streamed toward him  from under the sun shelters and from out of the tepees with cries of  astonishment. Jack was not deceived by the apparent warmth of their welcome;  they were not glad to see him, only amazed that he should have come back at  all.</p>
<p>He pulled up his horse in the  centre of the square, and remembering the last time he had addressed them,  looked them over with a kind of grim scorn. Just now he was unable to feel any  of the kindness for these feather-brained children of the woods that Mary had.  He knew the value of scant speech with them, and he made them wait for his  announcement.</p>
<p>At last he said: &ldquo;Ascota is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stirred, and softly  exclaimed, but one man laughed. His example was infectious; incredulity-showed  openly in their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big talk!&rdquo; one said insolently.  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the proof?&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p>Jack quietly untied a little  bundle from the back of his saddle, and unrolling the flour bag in which he had  carried his grub, produced a little book and held it up. It was Jean Paul&rsquo;s  Testament, that they all knew. There was a dark and swollen blotch on the  leather cover. The absolute silence with which it was received was more impressive  than their cries.</p>
<p>Jack handed it to the man who had  spoken. It opened in his hands. There was a crimson stain around the edges of  the printed page &mdash; wet crimson. The man who held it started back, and those  looking over his shoulders gasped. The book was passed among trembling hands.  Finally it came back to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you where his body is  hidden,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;A mile beyond the crossing of the creek out of Mount  Darwin there is a big spruce on the right-hand side of the trail. On it I made  a blaze with the sign of the cross in it. One hundred and ten paces from that  tree as you walk toward the mountain he lies under a pile of stones. There is a  big rock above, with his name and his story cut upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very clear that none of  them had any desire to seek out the spot; indeed, from that time the Fort  Erskine trail was closed to the Sapis by reason of Ascota&rsquo;s grave being upon  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the head man now?&rdquo; Jack  demanded.</p>
<p>They turned toward Etzeeah&rsquo;s  eldest son, a sullen broad-shouldered brave, the best physical specimen among  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take warning,&rdquo; said Jack clearly,  &ldquo;you and your people! Ascota was a bad man, a big mouth, a troublemaker, who  tried to stir you to evil, while he kept himself clear. He dared to speak  against the great white father across the sea. It was the chickadee piping at  the eagle. He is dead. We are all the children of the white father; his  children and his servants. His police are now at the fort. You will do well to  ride in and make your peace, before they come to punish you. That is all I have  to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One silently brought him the horse  he had left there, and, leading it, he rode through the quadrangle and away by  the trail, without looking back. There was no demonstration against him now.  The awe that Ascota had inspired in them was transferred to the man who had  brought about his death.</p>
<p>Three hours later, as Jack&rsquo;s horse  sidled down the hill into the Spirit River valley, his rider looked with a  beating heart for the four little tents he had left in the meadow below. They  were not there. A great disappointment filled him, and a sharp anxiety. What he  had been through had made greater inroads on his reserve forces than he knew,  and in Mary&rsquo;s deep eyes his weary spirit was unconsciously seeking harbourage.</p>
<p>However, as he rode up to the  ashes of their fire he saw that he had not been forgotten. In the forks of two  little sticks driven into the ground was laid a peeled wand roughly shaped like  an arrow, and pointing northeast. On it had been printed with a piece of  charcoal: &ldquo;7 miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riding in the direction it pointed  he found a freshly blazed trail through the trees. It led him among the poplars  along the foot of the bench to the opening of a coulee, up which it turned. It  took him north through a narrow valley wooded with great spruce trees. Through  openings in the trees on either hand he could see the steep, naked, uncouth  forms of the foothills that hemmed the valley in. A trickle of water flowed  musically in the bottom of it.</p>
<p>It was difficult going for the  horses over the fallen and rotting trunks of the untrodden forest, with its  treacherous, moss-hidden pitfalls. The seven miles seemed to stretch out into  thrice that distance before he came to the end of his journey. He smelled the  smoke of a campfire long before he could see it. Finally the trail turned at  right angles, and started to climb. He issued out of the trees, and there on a  terrace of grass above him he saw the little tents and the fire; he saw Mary  turning toward him with harassed, expectant face.</p>
<p>A little cry escaped her, and she  came flying to meet him. Jack slipped off his horse. A little way from him she  caught herself up, and her body stiffened. The action brought to Jack&rsquo;s mind  all that he had forgotten, and he turned a dull red. It had been in his heart  to seize her in his arms. A horrible constraint descended on them both. They  did not touch hands; they could not meet each other&rsquo;s eyes; speech was very  difficult and painful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all right?&rdquo; she murmured.  &ldquo;Not hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jean Paul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started with horror, and in  spite of herself glanced at Jack&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed himself,&rdquo; Jack added  quickly.</p>
<p>Her hands betrayed a movement of  relief. There was a silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; mumbled Jack,  scowling. &ldquo;What are you doing up here? Where is Davy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to show you,&rdquo;  she said, with a strange look.</p>
<p>He followed her up the slope. He  wondered why there were three tents pitched. The third was Jean Paul&rsquo;s A-tent.  Mary threw back one of the flaps, and he saw a blanketed form inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid!&rdquo; he murmured, full of  anxious concern. But even as he said it, he saw that it was not Davy. Stooping,  and looking farther within, he saw a gaunt travesty of the face of Frank  Garrod. The eyes were closed.</p>
<p>Something clutched at Jack&rsquo;s heart.  He fell back. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got him! Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Sleeping,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Come away a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat on the other side of the  fire. &ldquo;Davy has gone back to the cache,&rdquo; she said, taking care to avoid Jack&rsquo;s  eyes, &ldquo;for milk powder, if there is any, and whiskey, and any medicines he can  find. He will be back before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he said anything?&rdquo; asked  Jack, looking toward the tent.</p>
<p>Mary shook her head. &ldquo;Nothing you  could understand. He is very low. We will not get him back to the fort. He was  four days in the bush. He had only berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s too late after all,&rdquo;  said Jack apathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;They  say often they get their full senses back for a little while before they die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shrugged. &ldquo;Who would believe  what he said at such a time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was silent. Her capacity for  silence was greater perhaps than Jack&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about finding him,&rdquo; Jack  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started out as soon as you  left,&rdquo; she said, carefully schooling her voice. &ldquo;It was clear Jean Paul would  take him among the hills to lose him, so we struck up the coulee at once. Too  many days had passed for us to find their tracks, and it had rained. But I was  sure we would find him in the valley. The hills were too steep; besides, even a  madman stays by the water. We looked all day without finding anything until  near dark. Then we came on some tracks in the mud by the stream. We camped  right there the first night. There were many coyotes on the hills, both sides,  and I thought he must be near and they were &mdash; waiting.&rdquo; She shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning we found him,&rdquo; she  went on in a low voice. &ldquo;Just below here. He had fallen down beside the water.  His face was in the mud, but the mosquitoes had not left him. So I knew he was  not dead. Davy and I carried him up here where it was dry. I fed him a little  bread soaked in water. Davy went back for the other horses and the dunnage, and  to leave a sign for you. That was yesterday. This morning Davy went to the  cache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary! what a woman you are!&rdquo;  Jack murmured out of the deeps of his heart.</p>
<p>She rose with an abrupt movement,  and went to look at the sick man. She came back presently with a pale, composed  face, and quietly set to work mixing dough for their evening meal. There was a  long and sufficiently painful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny situation, isn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; said Jack at last, with a bitter note of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not talk about it,&rdquo; she  murmured. &ldquo;Let us just wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being forbidden to talk about it,  the desire to do so became overmastering. &ldquo;Suppose he doesn&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; he  began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make any difference to  your friends,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They know you&rsquo;re not a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer business this having  a good name and not having one,&rdquo; Jack went on, plucking blades of grass. &ldquo;As if  anybody cared who took the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary offered no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d lose my claims,&rdquo; Jack went  on. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go out to file them. But the governor would never put the  police on to me, now. He&rsquo;d be too jolly glad to get rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary refused to raise her eyes  from the dough.</p>
<p>Jack thought she hadn&rsquo;t understood  what he was driving at. &ldquo;You see it would let me out there,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;This  would be my country for ever and ever, and the people up here my only friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another silence. He looked  at her hungrily. The hard young face was soft enough now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he murmured hoarsely at  last; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn if he never speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dough-pan was dropped at last.  She lifted a tortured face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she murmured low and swiftly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  see what it means? Don&rsquo;t you see how you&rsquo;re hurting me? You mustn&rsquo;t wish it.  Maybe our thoughts are influencing his sick brain this minute. He <i>must </i>speak! He must tell the truth and  clear you. Nothing else matters. You must be able to go wherever you choose.  You must be able to look any man in the face. I couldn&rsquo;t bear anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack scowled, very much hurt &mdash; and  a little ashamed perhaps. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you were so anxious to send me  outside,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>She threw him the look of pity and  despair that women have for the men they love who will not understand them,  and, springing up, went to look at her patient again.</p>
<p>By and by Davy arrived. His  greeting to Jack supplied the warmth that Mary&rsquo;s had lacked. Jack hugged the  boy with a sidelong look at his sister. Afterward Jack briefly and baldly told  his story by the fire. Our hero had no talent for description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slept until dark, and then just  crawled around the edge of the slide below the ridge, and climbed up the back  of the rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davy&rsquo;s and Mary&rsquo;s eyes were big.  &ldquo;Climbed up the back of the summit at night?&rdquo; murmured Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I took it slow  and easy. As soon as I got light enough I dropped on him from behind. That was  one surprised redskin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo; demanded  Davy, breathlessly.</p>
<p>Jack frowned. &ldquo;He jumped off,&rdquo; he  said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumped?&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Was he  killed?&rdquo; asked Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Jack grimly. &ldquo;And  some to spare.&rdquo; That was all they could get out of him.</p>
<p>They ate their supper, and the sun  went down. Mary, leaving the boys smoking by the fire, took up her vigil within  the door of the little A-tent. Davy chattered about the prairie chicken that  had flown across the trail, about the squirrels that had broken into the cache,  about the moose he had seen swimming the river. Jack with an unquiet breast sat  listening for a sign from Mary.</p>
<p>Suddenly she came out of the tent,  dropping the flaps behind her. &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>He sprang to her.</p>
<p>Her clenched hands were pressed  hard to her breast. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awake,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he &mdash;sane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said a  little wildly. &ldquo;He looked at me so strangely. Oh, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her trembling hand in his  firm one. There was no selfish passion in him now. &ldquo;Steady, Mary,&rdquo; he said  deeply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done the best we could. Whatever will happen, will happen.  Better go away for a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave his hand a little  squeeze, and shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack threw back the flaps, and,  stooping, entered. &ldquo;Hello, there!&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>The sick man turned his head. His  eyes were unnaturally bright, and a feverish colour suffused his face; his lips  were swollen. &ldquo;Macgreegor,&rdquo; he whispered. He passed a hand across his eyes. &ldquo;It  is Macgreegor, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something melted in Jack&rsquo;s breast  at the sound of the old boyish nickname. &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; he said, kneeling beside  him.</p>
<p>Garrod reached out his hand, and  Jack took it. &ldquo;Thank God, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he murmured in the soft, hurried  accents of the fever patient. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Macgreegor. I&rsquo;ve made a rotten mess  of it, haven&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ll be glad to go if I can square myself with you first.  Where are we? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Can anybody take down what I want to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes were big with tears.  She produced the pencil Jack had given her, but it appeared there was not a scrap  of blank paper in the outfit, not a scrap of paper except the little Testament  with its ugly stains. Davy handed it to her. On the fly leaves, with their  damp, red borders, Mary prepared to write as Garrod dictated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift me up a little, Macgreegor,&rdquo;  Garrod said. &ldquo;I can breathe easier. Your arm under my shoulders. That&rsquo;s good.  It&rsquo;s like the day at Ste. Anne&rsquo;s when I fell out of the tree. We were seventeen  then. You were always holding me up one way and another, Macgreegor. You never  knew what you were to me. It was quite different from your feeling for me. I  can say it now, anyway. I was a bit cracked about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear yourself out  talking,&rdquo; said Jack with gruff tenderness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take me long,&rdquo; Garrod  said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expressed no further curiosity  as to where he was, or how Jack had come there. He referred to no recent  happening. His attention was fixed on the all-concealing gray curtain ahead,  through which he must presently pass, and he hurried to get what must be said,  said in time. There was something uncanny in the perfect clearness of his  thoughts, after what had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonder how I could do as I  did if I felt like that toward you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Well, sometimes I hated you  too. I was jealous of you, you were so much cooler and stronger than I, so much  more of a man. I don&rsquo;t suppose you understand. We&rsquo;re not supposed to be like  that. I guess! I was born with a queer streak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other side of Garrod sat  Mary, ready with the pencil and the book. Davy, large-eyed and solemn, filled  the doorway.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;I, Francis Garrod, being about to  die, do desire to make my peace with God if I may, and with my friend Malcolm  Piers, whom I have deeply wronged. It was I who took the money from the Bank of  Canada that he was accused of stealing. None but I knew beforehand that he was  going away, nor his reasons for going. The morning after he went the sight of  the money in the vaults tempted me. He had influential friends and relatives,  and I knew there would be no scandal. I took the money in old bills that could  not be traced. I have not known a  minute&rsquo;s peace since then. It drove me mad by degrees, and it is the cause of  my death.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Should any doubt be cast on this  confession, it is easy to verify it. Within a month of the theft I opened  accounts in the following banks and branches of banks in Montreal.&rdquo; A list of  the banks followed. &ldquo;In each I deposited a small sum. The total will be about  forty-five-hundred dollars. The rest I kept by me. Furthermore, among the  papers in my desk will be found a letter from Malcolm Piers dated from Winnipeg  a few days after his disappearance. The postmark is intact. In every sentence  of this letter there is proof that the writer had no theft on his conscience  when he wrote it, and no money. So help me God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garrod signed the page with a  sufficiently firm hand, and Davy and Mary wrote their names beneath for  witnesses. Jack gave Mary the grim little volume to keep for him, and she and  Davy went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; murmured Garrod  with a sigh. His fictitious strength seemed to ebb with the sigh. He slipped  down on Jack&rsquo;s arm a little. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, Macgreegor,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right with us now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I won&rsquo;t leave you,&rdquo; said  Jack.</p>
<p>The voice came in a whisper now  with many breaks and pauses. &ldquo;The lights of Ste. Catherine&rsquo;s street,  Macgreegor, on a Saturday night, and the crowds, and the stairs up to the  gallery of the old Queen&rsquo;s, how they echoed under our feet! We saw the &lsquo;Three  Musketeers!&rsquo; . . . &rsquo;Member the rink in the winter? And the old Park Slide? . .  . And Ste. Anne&rsquo;s, with the sun shining on the river? There&rsquo;s another pair of  kids winning the tandem paddles now, eh? . . . How good it is to have you here,  old fel&rsquo;! &rsquo;Member the first day I came to work at the bank! You blacked Husky  Nickerson&rsquo;s eyes because he blotted my ledger. We nearly all got fired, but you  saved us with your pull. Husky, too! How I admired you, with your crooked  eyebrow, and your curly hair, and your straight back!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over for me, old  fel&rsquo; . . . and nothing to show! I&rsquo;ll be twenty-six next month. . . . Life&rsquo;s a  sad thing . . . and empty! . . . I wish &mdash; I wish I had done differently. . . .  It&rsquo;s good to feel your arm, Macgreegor! . . . What time is it, old fel&rsquo;? Pretty  near closingtime? . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later Jack, Mary, and  Davy rode into Fort Cheever in the evening. On the fourth horse was lashed a  significant looking bundle neatly wrapped in canvas, the canvas of the other  dead man&rsquo;s tent. A heartfelt welcome awaited them. David Cranston showed no  anger at his children. He only looked from Mary to Jack and back again with a  kind of wistful, inquiring scowl.</p>
<p>During the interval of their  absence the steamboat had arrived, and after waiting twenty-four hours, had  returned down river only that morning, taking Sir Bryson and his party. Since  nothing could be guessed of the probable return of Jack, the captain had not  felt justified in waiting. Jack guessed, furthermore, that Sir Bryson had not  exerted his authority to delay the steamer. The lieutenant-governor had had his  fill of the North. The steamboat had brought up Sergeant Plaskett of the  mounted police, and a trooper from the Crossing.</p>
<p>Garrod was buried at dusk on the  hillside behind the fort. Sergeant Plaskett read the burial service. Afterward  Jack told his story, and at daybreak the policemen started west to interview  the Sapi Indians. Before noon they had returned with Ahcunazie, the eldest son  of Etzeeah, and the members of his immediate family. He was on his way in to  make peace with the authorities, as Jack had advised.</p>
<p>David Cranston learned something  more from Mary, and something from Jack. The situation was too much for the  honest trader. He shook his head dejectedly, and had nothing to offer. Measles  broke out again among the Indians at Swan Lake &mdash; at least Mary said it had. At  any rate, she rode away with Angus, Davy&rsquo;s next younger brother, the following  day, and Jack did not see her again.</p>
<p>Cranston had a letter for Jack.  Thus it ran, the paper blistered with tears, and the headlong words tumbling over  each other:</p>

<p class="letter">My Own Jack: You<i> are</i> mine, aren&rsquo;t you? I am nearly  crazy. I don&rsquo;t know where you are or what has happened, and they&rsquo;re taking me  away! How could you go without saying a word to me? How can you be so hard? As  soon as you get this, come to me! Come to me wherever you are, or whatever has  happened! I&rsquo;ll bring father around! Only come! I can&rsquo;t live unless you come!  When I think of your failing me, I am ready to do anything! I have no one but  you. They all look at me coldly. I am disgraced. Only you can save me. I love  you! I love you! I love you! . . .</p>

<p>And so on for many pages. Older  heads can afford to smile, but to the inexperienced Jack it was terrible.</p>
<p>The police hearing was concluded  two days later. At evening that day Jack, declining a lift down the river in  Plaskett&rsquo;s canoe, pushed off alone on the same little raft that had brought him  to Fort Cheever a month before. </p>
<h3 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>XX<br>
  The Little Great World</b></h3>
<p>Mr. Malcolm Piers stood before the  mirror tying a white bow at the top of an effulgent shirt bosom. It was a room  in Prince George&rsquo;s best hotel, and it had been his room for six weeks. His  brown ruddiness had paled a little, and his face looked harder and older than  the wear of only two months warranted. Unhappiness or perplexity, or indeed any  emotion, caused Jack to look like a hardy young villain. Only the eyes told a  tale; a profound discontent lurked in their blue depths.</p>
<p>He finished dressing and took down  his overcoat and topper. Evening dress became him well, and he knew it, and  took a certain satisfaction in the fact, for all that the world was going  badly. His abounding health and his hardness marked him out from the usual  dancing man. Hunching into his overcoat, he put out the light, and with the act  the night out-of-doors leaped into being. Struck by it, he went to the window  and flung it up.</p>
<p>The stars were like old friends  suddenly brought to mind. So they shone over his own country where there were  no grosser lights to outface them impudently; so they shone nights he had lain  well-wrapped on the prairie, counting them while he waited for sleep; so they  shone through the spruce branches in the valleys. The town of Prince George is  built on top of the bench, and his window looked into the deep valley of the  river. It brought to mind his own river, the serene Spirit; his and Mary&rsquo;s;  Mary&rsquo;s whose eyes were as deep and quiet and healing as the stars.</p>
<p>Leaning against the window-frame,  he lost count of time. He thought of the nights he had careered over the  prairie on horseback under the stars. He had called his new horse Starlight, a  thoroughbred. How the beast would love the prairie! How his knees ached for him  this minute, to bear him away from all this back to <i>her!</i> How her eyes would shine at the sight of Starlight! Never had  such a horse been seen north of the Landing. How he would love to give him to  her! How fine she would look on Starlight! He fell to picturing her under all  the different circumstances he remembered. Sweetest and most painful was the  recollection of how he had kissed her sleeping in the light of the fire, and  how her soft, warm lips had smiled enchantingly under the touch of his.</p>
<p>He was brought back to earth by  the ringing of the telephone bell in the room behind him, and a summons from  below. He went down stairs cursing himself. &ldquo;You fool! To let yourself get out  of hand! What good does it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the night of the hospital  ball in Prince George.</p>
<p>The provincial parliament had  reassembled, the courts were sitting, and the little western capital was  thronged with visitors more or less distinguished. The ball was held under the  largest roof in town, that of the armory; the band had been imported all the  way from Winnipeg, and the decorations and the gowns of the women would have  done credit to Montreal itself. To the women the particular attraction of the  occasion was the presence of an undoubted, aristocrat, Lord Richard Spurling,  seeing Canada on his grand tour.</p>
<p>Linda was radiant, the greatest  little lady there! There was nothing here to suggest the frightened child who  had left such a desperate note for Jack. Her world had not turned its back on  her; on the contrary, she had made a grand re&eacute;ntr&eacute;e with the halo of adventure  around her pretty head. She was wearing a dress of rose-madder satin straight  from Paris, a marvel of graceful unexpectedness, hanging from her thin,  alluring shoulders by a hair, and clinging about her delicate ankles. She was  wearing all the pearls that had shared her adventures, besides some new ones,  and a jewelled aigrette in her dark hair. A whole company of cavaliers dogged  her footsteps, including the lordling himself, a handsome and manly youngster,  irrespective of the handle to his name.</p>
<p>Jack was not one of the company  that surrounded her. Jack and Linda had been leading a kind of cat and dog life  the past few weeks. Their engagement was admitted, but had not been announced.  Jack did not shine in Linda&rsquo;s world; glumness is the unpardonable sin there.  Moreover, Jack was a perpetual reminder of things she was ashamed of now. And  there were so many other men! At the same time she kept a tight hold on him by  the means that such little ladies know so well how to employ.</p>
<p>Jack kept out of her way until it  was time for the first of the two dances she had vouchsafed him. As he  approached her she could not but acknowledge his good looks, she was a  connoisseur, but a good-looking thundercloud! The dance was not a success; they  were out of harmony; they stepped on each other&rsquo;s toes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop,&rdquo; said Linda  fretfully.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of  earshot of the crowd she opened on him: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been near me all evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m at your disposal,&rdquo;  Jack said stiffly. &ldquo;But I will not make one of that train of young asses that  follow you around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; retorted  Linda. &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t be rude. Follow whoever you please around, but for  heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t stand against the walls with a face like a hired mute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This stung. Nevertheless, Jack  doggedly admitted the justice of it to himself, and &ldquo;took a brace,&rdquo; as he would  have said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Linda,&rdquo; he said manfully; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit off my feed  to-night. You know I&rsquo;m no good at this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was merciless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only  to-night. It&rsquo;s all the time; ever since you&rsquo;ve been here. It&rsquo;s not very  flattering to me to have you go round with me as if you were dragged against  your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack pulled in his lip  obstinately. He had made his apology; she had rebuffed him; very well. Linda,  glancing sideways under her lashes, saw that she would get no more out of him  in this connection. She made another lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to the north end of the  gallery,&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;I promised to meet Lord Richard there at the end of  this dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack obeyed without comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an awfully good sort, isn&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo; she went on, with another sidelong glance at Jack. &ldquo;I was surprised to  find out how well he dances. Englishman,you know! He likes Canada better every  day, he says. He&rsquo;s going to stay over for the golf tournament if I will let  him. He is looking for a ranch somewhere near town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack woke up. &ldquo;First-rate head,&rdquo;  he said heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the North. He wants to make a trip  with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda bit her lip.</p>
<p>Later Jack sought out Kate  Worsley, with whom he had a dance. These two had made great progress in  intimacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we dance?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Linda  says I dance like her grandfather. One gets rusty in five years!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;To sit out then,&rdquo; said Kate.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get in the first row of the gallery, where we can hang over and watch  the giddy young things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their conversation did not  flourish. The night outside still had Jack by the heartstrings; loping over the  prairie under the stars, the far-off ululation of a wolf, a ruddy campfire in  the dark, and beside it, Mary!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not exactly garrulous  to-night,&rdquo; remarked Kate.</p>
<p>Jack turned a contrite face to  her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I wouldn&rsquo;t be rude to you, Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart! you don&rsquo;t have  to talk unless you are moved to it. I don&rsquo;t like to see a pal looking so down,  that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down?&rdquo; said Jack with a laugh.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m living in hell, Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, old man. You  can, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk  about it. I only sound like a fool. It only makes matters worse to talk about  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate knew her men. &ldquo;Change the  subject then,&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;How are business matters going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I have  sold my claim and the other one to Sir Bryson&rsquo;s company for twenty-five  thousand &mdash; a fair price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash or stock?&rdquo; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash. I have no talent for  business. I don&rsquo;t want to be in the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other claim?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Cranston&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he said  self-consciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there were three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third belongs to Linda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do  now?&rdquo; she asked. He looked at her in surprise. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too good a man to hang on  here in town,&rdquo; she said off-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m staying because  I want to?&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Good heavens, I&rsquo;m mad to get away! I hate all this!  I&rsquo;m fighting myself every minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him inscrutably. &ldquo;My  young friend, you&rsquo;re blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; muttered  Jack miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she said, wistful and  smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought quite a lot about your case, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I  had the right to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kate!&rdquo; he said turning to her  quickly; &ldquo;you know I&rsquo;d take anything from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at the way he put it.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to abuse you. My advice to you is simply &mdash; to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Ride away!  Ride back to your own work in your own country, the place you suit, and that  suits you. You&rsquo;d never be any good here. Look at Linda in her finery! This is  the breath of her nostrils. She has her eye on Montreal &mdash; London eventually.  How could you two ever hope to pull together? Mind you, I&rsquo;m her friend too, and  I believe that I&rsquo;m doing her a service in advising you to ride. Girls get  carried away temporarily like men, though they&rsquo;re not supposed to. Girls often  get hysterical, and write much more than they mean. Letter-writing between the  sexes ought to be made a felony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has my word,&rdquo; muttered Jack.</p>
<p>Kate shrugged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the man of  it! It is a fetich! Would you spoil Linda&rsquo;s life for the sake of keeping your  word, not to speak of your own life and &mdash; perhaps a third!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face was obstinate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see Linda and put it straight to her,&rdquo; he conceded.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s eyebrows went up. &ldquo;These  men!&rdquo; she said helplessly. &ldquo;You ought to know her a little by this time. That  will do no good. Much better go without. It&rsquo;s a thing that ought to be broken  off. What matter who does it, or how it&rsquo;s done? The result will be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go unless she releases  me,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>Kate got up smiling. &ldquo;We must go  back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A man must do as he will. You are an awfully nice boy, Jack.  I believe I love you for your very mulishness. Write to me sometimes out of the  North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t gone yet,&rdquo; he said  grimly. &ldquo;You must promise to forget every word that has been said if I ask you  to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, dear old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Jack to think of a thing was  to put it into instant execution. He set off in search of Linda. One of the  likeliest places to find her was on the balconies. There was a suite of rooms  across the front of the armory, the officers&rsquo; club, with a long narrow balcony  overhanging the street. For the occasion of the ball, potted palms had been  placed at intervals down the balcony, making a series of little nooks, each  with two chairs, and each reached through its own window. The largest of the  rooms with the balconies outside had been set apart for Sir Bryson and his  party.</p>
<p>Dancing was in full swing below,  and Jack found the room empty. None of the little nooks outside were occupied.  In one of them Jack sat down to wait for the end of the dance. Almost  immediately two people entered the next bower to his. Their voices were pitched  low, and at first he did not recognize them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a cigarette,&rdquo; said the  man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky man,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  dying for a puff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it  from you, if any one comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence, and the  striking of a match. Then a long-drawn feminine &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; which was undoubtedly  Linda&rsquo;s. Jack stood up to speak to her over the dividing palms. It was not a  thing to do, but Jack was a man of one idea at a time; he had to speak to her,  and his other dance was at the tail of the evening. He wished merely to make an  appointment to speak with her later.</p>
<p>As his head rose over the palms he  was just in time to see the blond head of the English boy and Linda&rsquo;s darker,  bejewelled head draw close together, and their lips meet and linger. They did  not see him.</p>
<p>Jack dropped back as if he had  been shot, blushing and furious with himself. To be a peeping Tom! a thing he  loathed. He silently cut across the room within the balconies, praying that  they might not hear him. Wild horses would never have dragged any admission  from him of what he had seen.</p>
<p>But when he got his breath again,  as one might say, oh! but he found his heart was beating blithely! He felt as  if he had burst out of a hateful chrysalis. Life was full of joy after all! A  little song rang in his ear: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right! It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Laughter trembled  in his throat.</p>
<p>He waited about on the stairs for  Linda to come down. She finally appeared, cool and scornful, her heels tapping  on the stairs, the thing in her hair nodding and sparkling. Who would ever  guess that her little Mightiness had just been kissed! The spring of laughter  bubbled up inside Jack. He presented a bland face to her, but he could not hide  the shine in his eyes, nor the smirk about the corners of his lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Linda, staring  at the change in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom have you the next dance  with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She named a name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Wait for  me upstairs, and I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t make an exchange. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused, and  she went back upstairs with Lord Spurling. In five minutes Jack had rejoined her,  and the two of them went out on the balcony again, in the same nook Linda had  shared with the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linda,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve done  nothing but quarrel since I came. Let&rsquo;s cry quits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been my fault,&rdquo; she said,  all ready for another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind whose fault,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over you?&rdquo; she asked  curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;up North I  promised that I&rsquo;d come and claim you as soon as I cleared myself. Well, I came,  and I&rsquo;ve been here long enough to show us both that it&rsquo;s no go. We&rsquo;re not  suited to each other. We only get on each other&rsquo;s nerves. Give me my word back  again, Linda. Let&rsquo;s shake hands on it, and say good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linda started, and looked at him  with big eyes. &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d desert me? You can&rsquo;t mean it? What  would I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got no further. The great  eyes, the plaintive tremulo, the threatened tears, all the old tricks after  what he had just seen, struck Jack as too funny! His laughter broke its bonds.  He threw back his head, and gave it way. There was nothing mocking or bitter in  it; it was pure laughter from the relief of his heart. He laughed and laughed.  He had had no laughter in weeks. He was obliged to lean against the  window-frame and hold his ribs as at a vulgar farce.</p>
<p>Linda&rsquo;s expression graduated from  amazement to pale fury. She sprang up. The jewelled aigrette fairly bristled  with rage. &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Shut up! I hate you! You make me feel  like a perfect fiend! I&rsquo;d like to scratch your eyes out! Go back to your squaw!  It&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re fit for. I was going to speak to you myself. Understand, I&rsquo;m  throwing you over! I despise you!&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;Go back to her, and  be damned to you both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She vanished. Such was the end of  that affair.</p>
<p>Jack went in search of Kate, and  found her on a man&rsquo;s arm bound supperward. &ldquo;Could I have a word with you urgent  and private?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Kate looked at his happy eyes and  nodded. &ldquo;Front balcony, five minutes,&rdquo; she murmured back.</p>
<p>The balcony again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate, I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This  very night. In an hour I&rsquo;ll be pounding the North trail on Starlight. I&rsquo;m so  happy I can&rsquo;t keep the ground. If the boats have stopped running, I&rsquo;ll ride the  whole way through. Kate, dear, you&rsquo;ve been a powerful good friend to me. I&rsquo;d  like to kiss you good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may,&rdquo; she said, smiling and  lifting her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There! and  there! and there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to  retire to the dressing room for repairs! Good-bye, and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the family had gone to bed,  Mary and Davy Cranston stole back into the living-room, and quietly blowing up  the fire, put on fresh sticks. They sat down before it, nursing their knees.  Nowadays there was a stronger bond than ever between Mary and Davy. In that  disorganized household in the winter this was the only chance they had to talk  together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he&rsquo;s doing  to-night?&rdquo; said Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;A party  of some kind, or the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If father had let me go out with  him,&rdquo; said Davy, &ldquo;I could have written and told you everything he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was right,&rdquo; said Mary.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll let you go when the time comes. But that sort of thing would only  unsettle you. We&rsquo;re not society people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said  Davy stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too complicated to explain,&rdquo;  she said in a level voice. &ldquo;Anyway, I wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever Jack does is all right,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was born to it,&rdquo; said Mary.  &ldquo;That makes the difference. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he likes it either.  But it&rsquo;s necessary for him just at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see him!&rdquo; cried  Davy.</p>
<p>Mary was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to be just like him,&rdquo; Davy  went on. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll ever be as strong as that?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Mary,  staring into the fire. &ldquo;You can be as brave and honourable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the front  door. Brother and sister looked at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sick Indian,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>Davy went to see. He closed the  door of the room after him. Presently Mary heard a little cry, quickly  smothered. Davy came in again breathless, and with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s &mdash; there&rsquo;s some one wants  to see you!&rdquo; he said shakily. &ldquo;Oh, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran out into the hall. The  front door was open, and he stood there, broad-shouldered and bulky with much  clothing, dark against the field of snow. He was bareheaded, and the moonshine  was making a little halo around the edges of his curly pate. He held out his  arms, and in a twinkling she was in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary! My love!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I  nearly went out of my mind wanting you. I&rsquo;ve come back for you! Never to leave  you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their lips met, and their tears  ran together. Mary was the only woman who ever saw those hard blue eyes fill  and overflow.</p>
