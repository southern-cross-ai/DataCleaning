<p align="center"><b>Part I<br>
  Out of the Ark</b></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CI"></a>Chapter I<br>
  Departure Of The Animals</b></h2>
<p>It  was early in the afternoon of a bright autumn day that Tommy Toddles sat by the  window in the big playroom at the top of the house, looking wistfully out over  the swaying trees toward the distant hills. He was beginning to feel lonely,  for he had been left to himself almost an hour since luncheon, and everything  in the house was so quiet that it seemed as if every one had gone to sleep. Not  even the memory of two large pieces of plum-pudding was sufficient to occupy  Tommy&rsquo;s mind for so long as an hour, and the toys which lay about the floor  appeared uninteresting, he had been playing with the curiously colored wooden  animals of his Noah&rsquo;s Ark until they no longer offered any attraction, and then  he had climbed up on the window-seat, and had pressed his little nose against  the window-pane for what seemed to him a very long period of time. How he  wished that his Uncle Dick were there to take him out for a wild romp across  the fields! How they would climb fences and jump ditches, and pick up  queer-shaped stones and fallen birds&rsquo;-nests! But Uncle Dick was not there, and  there was no use hoping for him, because he had gone away, and would not be  back again from the distant city for at least a week. And in the meanwhile no  one else would ever think of taking Tommy for a tramp in the woods. He could  play in the big garden as much as he wished to, but he must not go beyond the  gate; and as he looked out at the hills and the fields and caught a glimpse of  the blue ocean far off in the distance, he sighed at the thought of the barrier  gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I suppose there is no use wishing for things,&rdquo; he thought, almost out loud.  &ldquo;The only thing to do is to wait, and I do get so tired of waiting. I wish I  had asked Uncle Dick to send me the sheep instead of waiting to bring it with  him. And I do hope it will be a nice, white, woolly sheep, as big as a real  one, and strong enough for me to ride on,&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  woolly sheep that Tommy was thinking about had been the subject of a long  discussion between him and his Uncle Dick just before the latters departure.  Uncle Dick had promised to bring back from the city anything that Tommy might  ask for, and the little boy had promptly demanded a goat&mdash;a live billy goat! He  thought it would be nice to have it on the lawn in front of the big house, and  to hitch it to his express-wagon and drive it about. But, unfortunately, when  Tommy&rsquo;s mother heard of this plan, she firmly objected to his having a live  goat. She said she would not allow any such animal about the house. Tommy then  suggested a sheep&mdash;a little woolly sheep, that could have a blue ribbon around  its neck with a bell hanging from it. But his mother objected to the sheep,  too, and so, after a long talk with Uncle Dick, the little boy compromised on a  stuffed sheep which should be very white and very woolly, and should have some  sort of interior mechanism that would make it bleat.</p>
<p>Consequently,  as Tommy gazed out of the window, he kept picturing to himself what glorious  times he would have when his uncle got back with the woolly sheep; but at the  thought of all these future joys he grew very drowsy, He turned from the window  and wondered what he could do to pass away the long afternoon. There stood the  Noah&rsquo;s Ark on the floor just as he had left it, with the animals walking down  the gang-plank, two by two, in the order of their sizes&mdash;the giraffes first and  the guinea-pigs last. How often he had arranged them that way! Sometimes they  seemed to walk up the gang-plank and sometimes they seemed to walk down, but as  a matter of fact they <i>always</i> stood  still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  they could only be alive,&rdquo; mused Tommy, &ldquo;and really walk. If they could go in  and out like real animals, and have pens and houses and eat things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  as he thought of the wonderful outcome of such a possibility, it suddenly  seemed to him that the animals actually did begin to move. He looked again, and  became sure that they <i>were</i> moving!  The long line of wooden animals was actually wobbling along down the  gang-plank! And how funny they looked with their stiff wooden legs and their  awkward wooden bodies!</p>
<p>Tommy  Toddles was so surprised at the behavior of his toys that he just sat  stock-still and stared at them. They seemed to be paying no attention whatever  to him. They were moving on down the gang-plank and across the floor, the two  giraffes leading the way, and all the other animals following in perfect order,  just as he had arranged them. They progressed slowly toward the open door which  led to the hallway, but every now and then the procession was delayed by the  last guinea-pig, which kept getting its toes caught in the threads of the  carpet. They passed through the doorway and marched out into the hall, and then  actually began going down the stairs. Tommy got up from the window-seat and  followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is very queer,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;If Uncle Dick could only see them <i>now!&rdquo;</i> And then he started down-stairs in  the wake of the guinea-pigs. &ldquo;I do hope we won&rsquo;t meet the cook,&rdquo; he continued,  mentally, as the procession reached the first landing; &ldquo;she is so near-sighted  she might not see them, and she would be sure to step on those in front and  break their legs. Then they would not be able to walk any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time the animals had reached the ground-floor, for they were moving along  quite rapidly, and the head of the column, led by the giraffes, started  straight for the front door. The toys now appeared to Tommy as if they were  very much larger than usual. It seemed to him as if they had grown during the  trip down the stairs; but in spite of this sudden and unnatural growth none of  them was anywhere near tall enough to reach the door-knob, and the little boy  wondered how they were going to get out into the garden, for it was evidently  their intention to go there. He sat down on the steps to watch.</p>
<p>The  procession moved steadily onward, and when the giraffes reached the door they  marched right through it as if there had not been any door there at all. The  other animals did the same thing. Tommy could see them approach the door and  gradually fade away into it, and then he thought he could hear them treading on  the gravel path outside.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I2"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page007.jpg" width="800" height="689"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  that is the most wonderfulest thing I ever saw!&rdquo; he gasped, quite regardless of  grammar. &ldquo;I have heard of people <i>seeing</i> through a door, and <i>hearing</i> through a  door, and <i>smelling</i> through a  door&rdquo;&mdash;and here Tommy recollected vividly the odor of pancakes coming through  the closed kitchen door&mdash;&rdquo; but I never saw anything<i> go</i> through a door before. These animals must all be like sounds or  smells or sights,&rdquo; concluded the little boy, for that was the only rational  explanation he could make to himself for their odd behavior. &ldquo;But I wonder  where they are going?&rdquo; and he got up from his seat on the steps and ran down to  the front door. He did not stop to take his cap or to tell his mother he was  going out, as he usually did, but he opened the front door and stood on the  porch watching the procession, which by this time had gotten quite a distance  down the broad driveway.</p>
<p>The  animals passed out through the open gate, and as they got farther and farther  away down the road they seemed to grow larger and larger instead of becoming  smaller, as, according to all optical laws, they should have done. They still  maintained their relative positions in line, with the little guinea-pigs  toddling along in the rear, almost running in their breathless endeavors to  keep up with the others; but by the time the latter had reached the gate they  appeared to be life-size, and as the little boy glanced over the shrubbery  which screened the garden from the public highway, he could plainly see the  tall heads and long necks of the giraffes moving away in the distance. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CII"></a>Chapter II<br>
  Tommy Makes A New Acquaintance</b></h2>
<p>When  the last of the animals had disappeared, Tommy Toddles looked about him to see  if any other things were going to happen. He almost expected to see the animals  turn around and come back. But they did not. The tramp, tramp, tramp of their  feet grew less and less distinct, until it gradually died away entirely, and  there was no other sound but the rustling of the wind in the tree-tops.</p>
<p>Tommy  reflected for a few moments, and then started for the gate. He knew he was not  allowed to go beyond it, but he felt as if he ought certainly to go that far to  see, if possible, what became of his animals. Perhaps he might even be forgiven  for going farther, if he explained later to his mother exactly what had  happened, for surely this must be a sufficient excuse, as no one ever before  had heard of wooden toys coming to life and growing up and deliberately walking  away! And so Tommy went to the gate and looked along the road, which stretched  away for a short distance down the hill and then disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>The  animals were not in sight. They had had time to reach the woods, and only a  light cloud of dust showed that they had passed that way. Tommy looked back at  the big house, but no one was visible, and most of the window-shutters were  closed so as to keep out the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know I ought not to,&rdquo; thought Tommy, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll just run down the road a little  way to see where they went. They may get lost, and that, of course, would never  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  so saying, he gave one more glance toward the house behind him and started off.  He ran as far as the bend in the road, and then looked ahead into the woods,  but, alas! there was not the sign of an animal anywhere. The little boy was  very much perplexed. He was entirely at a loss as to what he should do under  the circumstances, and for lack of inspiration he sat down on a big stone by  the way-side to think the matter over. He was still debating whether he should  follow after the animals and wander off into the woods, or whether he should  give them up as lost and return to the play-room, when he heard a rustling  sound in the bushes near by.</p>
<p>He  turned around, and there, standing not ten feet away from him, he saw the  prettiest, whitest, woolliest sheep that his eyes had ever rested upon. The  sheep had great blue eyes, that turned toward the little boy in an inquisitive  sort of a way, and presently it stepped entirely out of the bushes and nodded  in a most friendly manner,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,  Sheepy!&rdquo; said Tommy, getting up and holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;  answered the woolly Sheep, as he trotted up and placed one of his fore-feet in  Tommy&rsquo;s proffered hand.</p>
<p>Now  our little boy had been surprised, to say the least of it, at the conduct of  the Noah&rsquo;s Ark animals; but this surprise was nothing compared to the amazement  which almost overpowered him when the woolly Sheep not only shook him by the  hand, but actually spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  look disturbed.&rdquo; said the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; stammered the little boy&mdash;and that was all he could say for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  should not be disturbed or surprised at anything,&rdquo; continued the woolly Sheep  in the most natural way in the world. &ldquo;I got over being surprised at things  years and years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless.  Tommy <i>was </i>surprised and very much  disturbed in his little mind, and for some minutes he said not a word, but  merely stared at the Sheep. The latter returned the stare complacently with his  large blue eyes, and when at last the silence began to be embarrassing, he  said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am looking for my animals,&rdquo; replied Tommy, as naturally as he could, for he had  not quite gotten used to the situation yet. &ldquo;Have you seen them pass this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes,&rdquo; answered the Sheep; &ldquo;they all went down the road some time ago. Were  those your animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  and I am afraid they will get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you go after them?&rdquo; asked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know where to go,&rdquo; said Tommy, mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither  do I; but if you like, I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  little boy wondered how the Sheep could go to a place without knowing where  that place was, but as long as he had so generously offered to do so Tommy did  not exactly like to suggest this difficulty, and, besides, he thought it would  be more polite to accept. So he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither  do I,&rdquo; added Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  we must ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  whom can we ask?&rdquo; inquired the little boy, looking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  can ask any one we meet,&rdquo; said the Sheep, &ldquo;If we start into the woods we will  surely meet some one. We won&rsquo;t meet any one if we stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  struck Tommy as being a sensible view to take of the situation, and he told the  Sheep he would be glad to have him go along with him to aid in the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; pursued the latter. &ldquo;Wait until I get my things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Sheep trotted off into the bushes again, and soon returned wearing a jaunty hat  on the top of his head and carrying a cane which was neatly decorated with a  gilded ram&rsquo;s horn for a handle. He was now walking on his hind-legs, too, instead  of on all-fours, as he had been when Tommy first saw him. In this attitude he  was almost as tall as the little boy.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="i3"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page015.jpg" width="800" height="688"></p>
<p>Before  they started, Tommy again hesitated somewhat as to whether he ought to go with  the Sheep in search of his animals, or whether it would not be better to turn  back to the house, but everything had been so queer that afternoon that he  thought his mother would accept the queer excuses he would have to make when he  got home.</p>
<p>They  followed the road into the woods, and as they went Tommy looked about him to  see if he could recognize any old landmarks, for he had frequently gone that  way with his Uncle Dick. But for some reason the trees did not appear to be the  same trees that had stood by the way-side only a few days since, and the road  seemed to take twists and turns that Tommy had never known it to take before.  Yet, somehow, these things did not bother Tommy much at the time. Presently the  Sheep said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have forgotten your hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  I was in such a hurry, you know,&rdquo; answered the little boy. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think I  will catch cold; do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; continued the Sheep, patronizingly; &ldquo;if you do, just, give it to me.&rdquo; But  Tommy didn&rsquo;t comprehend exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wonder if my animals can talk, too?&rdquo; thought he, as they went along. &ldquo;I hope we  will catch up with them soon, so that I can find out. And how I do wish I could  keep this woolly Sheep instead of having the one Uncle Dick is going to bring  me! I don&rsquo;t think mamma would object to a live Sheep like this one&mdash;a white,  woolly Sheep that wears a little hat and can talk.&rdquo; </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CIII"></a>Chapter III<br>
  No Information From The Loon</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  Toddles and his companion had advanced but a short distance into the woods when  the little boy thought he heard some one laughing very loud and heartily,  apparently at no great distance from them. He paused a moment to listen, and  when the sounds of laughter were repeated he touched the Sheep on the shoulder  and they both stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you hear that?&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  one is laughing; let us go and ask about the animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask <i>him</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the Sheep, in a  tone of deep scorn; &ldquo;<i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  who is it?&rdquo; asked the little boy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Loon. He&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; and the Sheep started on down the road again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  he might have seen the animals, even if he is crazy,&rdquo; persisted Tommy. &ldquo;Let us  go and ask him, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Sheep asserted that this would be an utterly useless proceeding and an absolute  waste of time; but Tommy finally persuaded him to make the attempt, at least,  and so they turned off from the main road and plunged into a thicket out of  which the sounds of laughter appeared to come. As they broke their way through  the bushes the noise of the Loon&rsquo;s laughter grew plainer and plainer. Presently  the thick growth of underbrush opened up into a sort of clearing surrounded by  tall trees, and reaching down on the farther side to the edge of a lake. Near  the shore stood the Loon, and when Tommy first caught sight of him he thought  this was the most solemn-looking bird he had ever seen. He was standing beside  a tree trunk which looked very much like a butcher&rsquo;s block, and every few  minutes he placed some imaginary or invisible object on the top of the trunk,  and then struck it vigorously with a large hammer which he held. After every  blow the Loon lifted up his head and laughed as if there had never been  anything so funny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see, he&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; said the Sheep, deprecatingly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is he doing?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know; he&rsquo;s just crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  you ask him if he has seen the animals,&rdquo; for by this time the two had  approached quite close to the Loon, who, however, seemed to be entirely  unconscious of their presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ba-ah!&rdquo;  said the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quack!&rdquo;  said the Loon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>And  then the Loon brought his hammer down hard on the block and laughed as though  his sides would split. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen the animals?&rdquo; asked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  answered the Loon, briefly, and then he pounded the block again.</p>
<p>After  the laughter had subsided, Tommy spoke. &quot;Have not you seen my animals go by  here, Mr. Loon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  an animal,&rdquo; responded the bird. &ldquo;I have been too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you doing?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you see what I&rsquo;m doing?&rdquo; snapped the Loon; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cracking jokes,&rdquo; and he brought  the hammer down once more with a vigorous blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cracking  jokes?&rdquo; repeated Tommy, in a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;cracking  jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  where are the jokes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  jokes are on the block.&rdquo; replied the Loon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see any jokes,&rdquo; and Tommy looked closely at the beaten top of the tree  trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  did not suppose you could,&rdquo; retorted the Loon, &ldquo;You are as stupid as all the  rest. No one ever sees my jokes.&rdquo; Whereupon he rapped the block again and  fairly shrieked with merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> crazy,&rdquo; said Tommy, turning to the  Sheep.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I4"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page021.jpg" width="800" height="653"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I  told you so,&rdquo; answered the latter, triumphantly, &ldquo;Let us leave him alone with his  jokes, and go up to the head of the lake. They&rsquo;ll know up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  did not even say good-bye to the Loon as they made their way out of the clearing,  for the bird was not paying any attention to them. They turned into a narrow  path that led off in the direction of the lake and then followed along the  shore. It was a very pretty lake, with trees growing down close to the water,  and Tommy wondered that he and his Uncle Dick had never discovered it before.  As they trudged along, jumping over fallen logs now and then, they could hear  the Loon&rsquo;s laughs growing fainter and fainter in the distance.</p>
<p>Presently  they came to a low point of land that jutted out into the water, and when they  had walked out to the end of it Tommy noticed a queer-looking building standing  in an open space about a quarter of a mile away at the head of the lake. It was  a two-storied house with a shingled roof, and any quantity of windows in the  sides. The most peculiar thing, however, was that the side of the house  fronting the lake was painted white, and one end of the building was painted  blue, and the other end was painted red. The little boy, of course, could not  see the fourth side, and he wondered what color that was. He looked at the  strange building as they advanced, and in a few moments said to the Sheep,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is that house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Poorhouse,&rdquo; answered the Sheep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I  never knew of a Poorhouse around here,&rdquo; said Tommy, as be gazed at the queer  structure, &ldquo;Is there any one in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only  two poor people,&rdquo; answered his companion, &ldquo;but they are both <i>very</i> poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  is an ex-Pirate, and the other is a Reformed Burglar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  Pirate and a Burglar!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy. &ldquo;I did not know there were any more pirates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the Sheep, testily. &ldquo;I said an <i>ex</i>-Pirate. He was driven out of the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  was a little abashed by the Sheep&rsquo;s tone, but after a brief pause he resumed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  he a <i>real</i> Pirate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  <i>was</i>&rdquo; answered the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what does he do now?&rdquo; continued the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is very poor now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought all pirates got rich,&rdquo; persisted Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  did. Some got rich and some got killed. This Pirate got rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you just said he was poor,&rdquo; objected the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is <i>now,</i>&rdquo; answered the Sheep, &ldquo;You see,  when things got into such a state that the pirate business was no longer  profitable, this one sold his ship and all his hidden gold and retired. Then he  started in to write poetry, and now he&rsquo;s in the Poorhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  could not quite follow this explanation, but he thought it must be all right,  and as they walked along he tried, although without any very gratifying  success, to think it out. After a while he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  the ex-Pirate still write poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered the Sheep, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s so poor now that it does not make any  difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  the Burglar?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s very good now; he has reformed entirely.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  not he steal any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  And, besides, there is nothing to steal at the Poor-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does he do, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  does not do anything but paint the Poorhouse. Since his reform he has become a  good man and a patriotic citizen, and so he paints the house red, white, and  blue. He paints one side every day, so that every fourth day the sides have a different  color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must use an awful lot of paint,&rdquo; thought Tommy. But by this time the two had  gotten almost up to the house, and the little boy could see the Reformed  Burglar in a pair of overalls, with a pot of red paint in his hand, painting  one end of the house. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b>Chapter IV<a name="CIV"></a><br>
  Concerning The Reformed Burglar</b></h2>
<p>As  the two approached the Reformed Burglar caught sight of them, and turned around  to see who his visitors were. Then he stuck his head in through an open window  and shouted,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi  there, below! All hands on deck to repel boarders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  he think we are coming here to live?&rdquo; asked Tommy of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess not,&rdquo; answered the Sheep. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  said something about boarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s only an idiom of the piratic vocabulary,&rdquo; replied the Sheep,  learnedly&mdash;so learnedly, in fact, that Tommy was just as much in the dark as he  was before he put the question.</p>
<p>When  he looked up at the house again a wild-eyed individual with long hair and a  fierce mustache, holding a knife in his teeth and a pistol in each hand, burst  out of the door and stood beside the Reformed Burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  must be the ex-Pirate,&rdquo; thought Tommy, as he cautiously got behind the Sheep. I  wonder if he&rsquo;ll shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I5"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page027.jpg" width="803" height="750"></p>
<p>But  the ex-Pirate was not that kind of a man at all. When he saw that there were  strangers present he put his pistols back into his belt, and came up to the  visitors with a genial smile, and shook hands with the Sheep and then with Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome  to the Poorhouse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is nothing here, and so you will find nobody  any richer than yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we have not come to stay,&rdquo; murmured Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing  comes to stay,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate, with a sigh, &ldquo;Everything that comes,  goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During  this conversation the Reformed Burglar, who had put down his paint-pot,  approached the group. Tommy noticed that he had only one eye. and that he wore  a blind over the other. He wanted to ask him what was the matter with this  other eye, but he thought the Reformed Burglar might feel offended at such a  question, so he merely said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day  I do it in red,&rdquo; answered the Reformed Burglar, with a bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I did not ask you that,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  should have,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;it is important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like red,&rdquo; interrupted the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;I prefer black. I wanted him to  paint the house black,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  that would have looked so sad,&rdquo; remarked the little boy.</p>
<p>No  matter; black is the Pirate&rsquo;s color, and I like it.&rdquo; The ex-Pirate was getting  somewhat excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black  is a beastly color!&rdquo; shouted the Reformed Burglar. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  better than red!&rdquo; retorted the ex-Pirate, hotly, and then there followed a  lively dispute between the two inmates of the Poorhouse as to the relative  merits of red and black for mural decoration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> doing the painting, anyhow,&rdquo;  sniffed the Reformed Burglar, finally, and he went back to his pot and brushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  that way,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, turning to Tommy in an apologetic way. &ldquo;But  won&rsquo;t you sit down? We have no chairs, but there is a bench. I painted the  bench. You see, it&rsquo;s black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  felt grateful for this invitation, for he was beginning to feel a little tired  after his walk. There was a rude table in front of the bench, and they all sat  down and leaned back against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  write here sometimes,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, as he sat down between his two  guests.</p>
<p>Tommy  didn&rsquo;t know exactly what kind of a reply this statement called for, so he said,  &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate, facing the little boy, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t  believe it, ask the Reformed Burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  do believe it,&rdquo; answered Tommy, somewhat timidly, for he feared he had offended  the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;What I meant to say was &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo;or something of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; continued the ex-Pirate, cordially. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you doubted  me. Some people doubt pirates, you know, and although I am not a pirate now, I  was once, and my reputation clings to me. If you would like  to see how I do it, just to be convinced, I will write some poetry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Sheep, impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  if you prefer, I will recite some of my own compositions,&rdquo; continued the  ex-Pirate heedless of the Sheep&rsquo;s protest. &ldquo;I can recite something I wrote  here. Would you like to hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Tommy, politely; &ldquo;is it about pirates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  it&rsquo;s about the Reformed Burglar. Would not you like to hear about him? I can  recite something about pirates afterward, if you would like me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind. Let us hear about the Reformed Burglar,&rdquo; said the Sheep, wearily.</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate appeared to be pleased at receiving even this slight encouragement.  He climbed up on to the top of the black table, and Tommy and the sheep turned  around so as to face him. He bowed very politely and elaborately in all  directions, just as if there had been a large audience present, and then began.  His manner of speaking was very melodramatic, and Tommy suspected once or  twice that he saw the Sheep hiding a smile. But the little boy was very much  interested, because he had wanted all along to know more about the Burglar, and  this piece of poetry told him a good deal,</p>
<p align="center">THE  RIME OF THE REFORMED BURGLAR</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;There  was a bold, bad burglar<br>
  Whose name was One-eyed Bill,<br>
  He used to burgle shops and banks,<br>
  And also lap the till. </p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Now  in the street where William lived<br>
  There dwelt a little maid;<br>
  Her face was very pretty, 
  and <br>
  Her name was Adelaide.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Alas,  she was an orphan,  for <br>
  Her parents both were dead,<br>
  And her father&rsquo;s brother cared for her<br>
  Now in her mother&rsquo;s stead,</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Her  uncle was a constable<br>
  Upon the town police,<br>
  And he used to keep a watchful eye<br>
  Upon his pretty niece,</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;But  Adelaide, as maidens will<br>
  Nine cases out of ten,<br>
  Would sit upon the front-door step,<br>
  And smile upon the men.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;It  happened thus that One-eyed Bill<br>
  Came walking down that way,<br>
  And seeing pretty Adelaide,<br>
  He wished her a good-day.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;And  Addie said: &lsquo;Good-morrow, sir,<br>
  How is the world with you?<br>
  Would you sit down here beside me<br>
  If I should ask you to?&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;So  William went right up the steps,<br>
  And sat upon her left <br>
  (For, if you will remember, 
  of<br>
  One eye he was bereft).</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;He  sat there all the afternoon<br>
  With pretty Adelaide,<br>
  And when, he went back home again<br>
  He loved the gentle maid.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Said  he unto himself: &lsquo;Ha! ha!<br>
  True unto my profession,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll burgle this young woman&rsquo;s heart<br>
  And make it my possession.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;But  this was his last burglary;<br>
  For when he won her heart,<br>
  She made him swear that he and his<br>
  Profession then should part.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;So  One-eyed Bill and Adelaide<br>
  Were married very soon,<br>
  And sailed away to foreign lands<br>
  To spend their honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When  the ex-Pirate had finished speaking he clambered down from the top of the table,  and bowed again to Tommy and to the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  the burglar really get married?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  answered the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;he married Adelaide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  where is she now? Is not she poor too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, with an air of embarrassment, as he glanced  stealthily toward One-eyed Bill, who was still zealously painting the side of  the Poorhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask so many questions,&rdquo; whispered the Sheep, severely. &ldquo;It is very embarrassing  sometimes. When in doubt, always change the subject,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  did not like to be talked to in this fashion, especially by a sheep, although  he knew down in the bottom of his heart that it was a <i>little</i> inquisitive to ask questions about the private affairs even  of a Reformed Burglar. But it was evident to him that the ex-Pirate felt  slightly disturbed over the matter, and so he tried to change the subject as  the Sheep had suggested. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CV"></a>Chapter V<br>
  An Interrupted Lecture</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  could not think of anything to say, but the ex-Pirate soon broke the silence himself  by remarking,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I </i>wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy, seizing the opportunity to say something pleasant at  last, &ldquo;The poetry was <i>very</i> nice. It  sounded like some of the funny things Uncle Dick learned at college. But you  said you would recite something about pirates too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate with alacrity, and he climbed up on top of the  table again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you a selection from my autobiography. I was just  writing it as you came,&rdquo; and he pulled a large roll of manuscript out of his inner  pocket. &ldquo;This is Chapter XVII. If you prefer, I will go and get the preceding  sixteen chapters, the introduction, and the preface, and read them to you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; interposed the Sheep. &ldquo;Chapter XVII. will do. We have not time to hear any  more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate, clearing his throat; &ldquo;I will only read Chapter  XVII.; </p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The  following day the sun rose up as usual from the East,<br>
  The sea was calm, the sky was clear, the stormy winds had ceased;<br>
  The <i>Black Avenger</i> sped along before a  gentle breeze,<br>
  And the starboard watch loafed on the deck in true piratic ease&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>What  is it?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate, interrupting his lecture and turning toward Tommy,  who looked as if he wanted to ask a question,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was wondering what the <i>Black Avenger</i> was,&rdquo;  said the little boy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  supposed so,&rdquo; replied the poet, reproachfully&mdash;&ldquo;supposed so. The <i>Black Avenger </i>was the name of my pirate  ship, and if you had let me read the first sixteen chapters of the  autobiography you would have known all about the ship by this time. I think I  had better go and get the other chapters,&rdquo; and he started to step down from the  table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; put in the Sheep. &ldquo;We know what the <i>Black  Avenger</i> is now. It&rsquo;s your ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the ex-Pirate, dramatically; &ldquo;she was a low, trim craft, with tall, rakish  masts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just  like all pirate ships,&rdquo; interrupted the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it!&rdquo; shouted the ex-Pirate, vehemently. &ldquo;She was <i>not</i> like any other ship afloat, you mutton-head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you call me a mutton-head!&rdquo; retorted the Sheep, hotly, rising from his seat on  the bench. &ldquo;You may think that because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;  began the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;because  you are up there on that table&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;  began the ex-Pirate again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t tell him to butt!&rdquo; cried Tommy, who was beginning to fear there might be  a fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, turning to the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  both of you stop quarrelling,&rdquo; continued Tommy, asserting himself. I think it&rsquo;s  very rude of each one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate looked at the little boy as though he did not quite understand, and  the Sheep moved off to the far end of the bench and began to sulk. Tommy was  surprised to see this, for, until then, he had entertained a very favorable  opinion of his new friend. He was surprised to see the Sheep sulk, because it  was something he never did himself, as he had been told that it was unmanly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it is not unsheeply,&rdquo; thought Tommy, who was willing to make every excuse  possible for the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall  I go on?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate to Tommy, as he glanced at the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  replied the little boy; &ldquo;He is very ill-behaved. He ought to be ashamed of  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess he is,&rdquo; remarked the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;he certainly looks sheepish;&rdquo; and  although this did not strike Tommy as being odd at the time, he wondered  afterwards how a sheep could look otherwise.</p>
<p>The  little man on the table glanced over his manuscript, and, having found the  place where he left off, read again:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  took my breakfast down below, and when I came on deck<br>
  I looked about, and far away I saw a little speck<br>
  Upon the blue horizon, and I knew it was a&mdash;&rsquo; </p>
<p align="center"><a name="I6"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page039.jpg" width="708" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess I&rsquo;ll have to stop here,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, suddenly, putting his papers  into his pocket and looking around uneasily,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tommy, noticing his evident nervousness. The Sheep, too,  had straightened up and was looking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you smell anything?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  what is it?&rdquo; inquired Tommy, sniffing and looking about like the rest of them.  But before the ex-Pirate could answer, the little boy heard a sort of shuffling  noise coming from the direction of the woods, and presently he saw a most  peculiar-looking animal, such as he had never seen or heard of before, waddle  out into the open, grassy space in front of the Poorhouse. The strange beast  seemed to be about the size of a hippopotamus, yet, he resembled a rabbit. And  he was yellow. As he came nearer his body looked as if it were made of cheese,  and his long ears resembled pieces of toast. A sort of white vapor floated off  the creature&rsquo;s back, and, as the breeze wafted it toward the group at the  table, Tommy noticed that it had a fragrant and appetizing odor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is that thing?&rdquo; he asked, somewhat tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Welsh-Rabbit,&rdquo; whispered the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Tommy. &ldquo;Uncle Dick eats one every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo;  said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, he might hear you.&rdquo; The Sheep was  frowning severely, and Tommy feared that he had said something indiscreet. In a  few moments he was sure he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  talk of <i>eating</i> things,&rdquo; said the  Sheep. &ldquo;It is a tender subject with some people. How would you like to have a  lion come along here now and look at you and ask me if you were good to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  question, with its suggested possibilities, made Tommy feel uncomfortable, and  he moved nearer to the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  there any lions hereabouts?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  might be,&rdquo; replied the Sheep; &ldquo;but they are all well-bred lions, and they don&rsquo;t  talk about things to eat.&rdquo; This statement reassured the little boy, but it made  him again eager to change the subject of the conversation.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CVI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
  The Welsh-Rabbit&rsquo;s Visit</b></h2>
<p>It  was an easy matter to change the subject this time, because the Welsh-Rabbit  was there to talk about. Tommy looked at the strange creature and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  he poor too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate laughed out loud. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s very rich. He is one of the  richest things I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  he does not live here?&rdquo; continued Tommy, pointing toward the Poorhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed. He has a stock-farm down the road, where he raises all sorts of queer  animals. He comes here occasionally to give us things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does he give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  usually gives me a night-mare,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  night-mare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  he raises them on his stock-farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  was about to ask what sort of an animal a nightmare was, but the Welsh-Rabbit  had come so close to them by this time that his two companions turned toward  the visitor and wished him good-day most cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;  replied the Welsh-Rabbit, bluntly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it is not night,&rdquo; said Tommy; whereupon the Sheep pulled his coat-sleeve  abruptly, and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk like that. The Welsh-Rabbit wants to be polite, He does not often wish one  &lsquo;good-night.&rsquo; Say something nice to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  couldn&rsquo;t think of anything particularly polite to say right on the spur of the  moment, so he naturally spoke of what was uppermost in his mind;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen my animals, Mr. Welsh-Rabbit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I have not,&rdquo; answered the Welsh-Rabbit. &ldquo;Have you seen mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  have you lost yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed!&rdquo; and the Welsh-Rabbit laughed until the cheese of his back fairly bubbled  over with mirth. &ldquo;Would you like to see my animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I7"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page045.jpg" width="800" height="698"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Tommy, for the Sheep was tugging at his coat-sleeve again.  &ldquo;What are they like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can show you all kinds,&rdquo; answered the Welsh-Rabbit, patronizingly. &ldquo;There are  green monkeys with pink tails, yellow rats with purple eyes, cerulean dragons  with crimson claws, and blue elephants with five legs and lavender tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  my!&rdquo; gasped Tommy; &ldquo;but I never heard of any such animals as those. I don&rsquo;t  think I want to see them, but you are very kind to offer to show them to me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  mention it,&rdquo; replied the Welsh-Rabbit, waving his toast ears lazily; &ldquo;I will  show them to you some other day, whether you want to see them or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  did not quite understand how this could happen, but he said nothing, because  the Sheep was persistently pulling at his coat-sleeve. Both he and the  ex-Pirate seemed to be very much in awe of the Welsh-Rabbit, who appeared to  Tommy like such a mild and good-natured creature.</p>
<p>The  Reformed Burglar had now almost finished painting the side of the Poorhouse,  and he came up and joined the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you like that color?&rdquo; he asked of the Welsh-Rabbit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  color?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  color of this side of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  reminds me of tomato catsup,&rdquo; said the Welsh-Rabbit, after having glanced at  the red side of the Poorhouse, &ldquo;and you know I don&rsquo;t like tomato catsup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think you will agree with me when I say that the house should have been painted  black,&rdquo; put in the ex-Pirate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed,&rdquo; said the Welsh-Rabbit; &ldquo;I disagree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  always do,&rdquo; retorted the ex-Pirate, with unexpected asperity,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially  at night,&rdquo; added the Reformed Burglar, and then it began to look as if  something serious were going to happen. But fortunately the Welsh-Rabbit merely  waved his toast ears a bit, and then waddled off down the road without saying a  word of farewell to any of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  that way,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate to Tommy, in the same apologetic tone he had  formerly used with regard to the Reformed Burglar. &ldquo;Sometimes he&rsquo;s right  agreeable, and sometimes he&rsquo;s right disagreeable. He&rsquo;s mostly disagreeable.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tommy  watched the Welsh-Rabbit as he ambled off toward the shore of the lake, like a  huge yellow ball, leaving a savory odor of cheese behind him. When the queer  creature finally disappeared among the trees, the little boy turned to the  others:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  peculiar animals he must have!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  peculiar sometimes,&rdquo; remarked the Reformed Burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  does he keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  his farm,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to see them,&rdquo; ventured Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never heard of a blue elephant with five legs and a lavender tail,&rdquo; continued  the little boy. &ldquo;Has he got many of those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  most of his animals are bugbears. But he has a lot of night-mares, and he gives  them to lots of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  he give me a night-mare?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  reckon he would,&rdquo; said the Reformed Burglar, with a broad smile, for he seemed  to be enjoying the little boy&rsquo;s questions immensely. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think you  would like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you would either,&rdquo; added the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tommy, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but I would like to have my own  animals. Have you seen them pass this way, Mr. Pirate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  animals have passed this way to-day,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;but we can go up  on the hill and look around, and from there perhaps we can see where they are.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sheep; &ldquo;I never thought of that. Let&rsquo;s go up on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  would like very much to go with you,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  right, come along,&rdquo; answered Tommy. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you come too, Mr. Bill?&rdquo; he  added, turning to the Reformed Burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I can&rsquo;t. I must paint. But I think I can guess where your animals went to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  asked Tommy, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess they went to the fight. All the other animals went. That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t  see any about here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we saw the Loon and the Welsh-Rabbit,&rdquo; objected Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  they don&rsquo;t count,&rdquo; put in the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;The Loon is crazy and don&rsquo;t know what  is going on, and the Welsh-Rabbit never attends fights. He&rsquo;s too soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  did not know the fight was to be to-day,&rdquo; remarked the Sheep, in a tone of  surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,  it&rsquo;s to be to-day,&rdquo; asserted the Reformed Burglar. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s probably all over  with by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  let&rsquo;s go to the hill anyway,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;From the summit we can see  as far as the beach, and we can easily tell if there are any animals there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  they bade good-bye to the Reformed Burglar, who returned to his pot and  brushes, and Tommy, the ex-Pirate, and the Sheep started off on the road which led  to the hill. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CVII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
  The Guinea Pig School</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  was most curious to know what this fight was that his new acquaintances had  been talking about, and after they had walked along in silence for a few  moments he asked the ex-Pirate to tell him about it. The latter expressed some  surprise that Tommy should be so ignorant in this matter, and asked him if his  animals had not told him of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  they never tell me anything,&rdquo; answered Tommy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re wooden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate; but before Tommy could explain the  misunderstanding his companion began telling him about the fight. It seems that  the Penguin lived in a house near the sea-shore, and was the editor of a  newspaper which he called <i>The Tidal Wave.</i> In it he chronicled the events of the animal world, and frequently said pretty  sharp things about the beasts, the birds, and the fishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see, the Penguin is half bird and half fish,&rdquo; explained the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;and as  he lives on land he counts as a beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it seems that this editorial Penguin had made some sarcastic remarks in his  paper about the Sword-Fish, who was a captain of Sub-Marines; and the  Sword-Fish, being a very haughty personage, had taken offence, and had  challenged him to fight a duel. The Penguin, although he was, so to speak, a  man of peace, accepted; and all the beasts and birds and fishes were invited to  witness the contest and to decide which was the mightier of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I suppose the fight took place to-day,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the ex-Pirate in conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  won?&rdquo; asked Tommy, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; we&rsquo;ll find out when we get to the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time they were nearing the foot of the hill. The road ran alongside of a  stone-wall that was just about as high as Tommy&rsquo;s head, and it seemed to the  little boy that he could hear, now and then, strange sounds, like squeals,  coming from the other side of it. He asked the Sheep what the sounds were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Guinea-Pig School in there,&rdquo; said the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  must be recess,&rdquo; remarked the ex-Pirate. I can hear them playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  there Guinea-Pigs on the other side of that wall?&rdquo; inquired Tommy, with much  interest,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds  of them,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  we climb up and look at them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course we can.&rdquo; And in less time than it takes to tell about it all three had  clambered to the top of the wall, and were looking down into the Guinea-Pig  school-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  is the school-house?&rdquo; asked the little boy, as he gazed at the hundreds of  funny little animals clambering over one another, playing tag and leap-frog,  and every now and then giving vent to little squeaks of delight. They did not  even notice the three on-lookers sitting on the wall, so busy were they in  having a good time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you know,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate to Tommy, &ldquo;that if you pick up a Guinea-Pig by  the tail his eyes will fall out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle  Dick told me so once, but I did not believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, jumping down into the play-ground. He  approached a Guinea-Pig who was not looking, and picked him up by the tail.  Sure enough, his eyes fell out, and rolled around on the ground with a most  terrified expression. Then the ex-Pirate put the little beast down again, and  he groped about until he found his eyes, and put them back where they belonged.  He looked quickly about to see who had played the trick on him, and, seeing the  ex-Pirate laughing, he stuck out his tongue at him, and ran away to join a  group that was playing blind-man&rsquo;s-buff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does  not that hurt the Guinea-Pig?&rdquo; asked Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;they like it. It tickles the eyes to roll about  like that. Don&rsquo;t you see them playing blind-man&rsquo;s-buff over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Guinea-Pigs don&rsquo;t carry handkerchiefs, so they have to do the best they can  without them. The way they get around this is to take the one who is It, hold  him up by the tail, and let his eyes fall out. Then he&rsquo;s just as blind as if he  had his eyes bandaged with a handkerchief.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And  it&rsquo;s cheaper, too,&rdquo; added the Sheep, as he fanned himself with his hat.</p>
<p>Tommy,  of course, was much surprised at all the ex-Pirate had told him, but he said to  himself philosophically that so many things had been surprising that afternoon  that there was no reason why he should waste any emotion on the Guinea-Pigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you ever hear them sing?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can <i>they</i> sing?&rdquo; asked the little boy,  gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>can</i> sing,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;but  they usually sing only just before vacation,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now it&rsquo;s just after vacation,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish they <i>would</i> sing,&rdquo; said Tommy,  looking up at the ex-Pirate pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I can persuade them to,&rdquo; said the latter, good-naturedly, for he understood  that this was what Tommy wanted him to do. He walked over towards the group  that was playing blind-man&rsquo;s-buff. As soon as they saw him approaching they  scurried off in every direction, until they considered themselves out of his  reach, and then they sat up on their haunches and stuck out their tongues,  which was very ill-bred of the Guinea-Pigs, thought Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm  not going to hurt you!&rdquo; shouted the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;  squeaked a little spotted Guinea-Pig, as he put his fore-paws up to his eyes to  make sure they were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really  I&rsquo;m not. I want you to sing,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is not time to sing yet,&rdquo; said another Guinea-Pig, who looked very wise, and  winked at his companions as if he had discovered some ruse on the part of their  visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  matter about that,&rdquo; urged the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Sing your song, and make believe you  are practising for vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  suggestion apparently struck the Guinea-Pigs favorably, for at heart they  really enjoyed their singing very much. They all huddled together and held an  excited debate, during which there were no end of squeaks and squeals, and they  finally decided that they would sing&mdash;just once, &ldquo;for practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  the ex-Pirate returned and sat down on the top of the stone-wall next to Tommy  and the Sheep, and the Guinea-Pigs approached in a very dignified way, and  arranged themselves in a semicircle in front of their audience. The spotted  Guinea-Pig sat out in front, facing the others, and beat time with his  fore-paws, while the others sang in chorus:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Oh, let us away<br>
  To the land of Kathay,<br>
  Where the peppermint candy grows;<br>
  Where all the streets<br>
  Are paved with sweets<br>
  And the lemonade river flows.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll revel in quince,<br>
  And slices of mince,<br>
  And dine on chocolate-creams;<br>
  And visions of tarts<br>
  Shall please our hearts.<br>
  And fill our peaceful dreams.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Oh, let us away<br>
  To fair Kathay&mdash;<br>
  The summer days are coming.<br>
  For now we know<br>
  It&rsquo;s time to go;<br>
  The bumblebees are humming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course the bumblebees aren&rsquo;t humming,&rdquo; said the spotted Guinea-Pig, turning  around. &ldquo;This is only a <i>practice</i> song, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I8"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page053.jpg" width="800" height="688"></p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate thanked the little fellows for their courtesy. Thereupon they ran  away again, and lifted one of their number up by the tail and resumed their  game of blind-man&rsquo;s-buff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  is the land of Kathay?&rdquo; asked Tommy, as soon as the Guinea-Pigs had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s miles and miles away,&rdquo; said the Sheep, and then he jumped down from the  top of the wall, and told his companions to hurry along, for they had been  wasting time in their journey to the top of the hill. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CVIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
  Luncheon On The Hill-Top</b></h2>
<p>It  was a steep climb to the top of the hill, and when they reached the summit  Tommy was quite out of breath and very warm. He looked about for some place to  rest, but there was not any. The top of the hill was bare except for a few  stubby alder-bushes and half a dozen white birches, which trembled in the  breeze that was blowing in from the sea, &ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said the Sheep,  presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see any other place around here,&rdquo; retorted the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;so I suppose  this must be the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  place?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you see?&rdquo; queried the ex-Pirate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  I see what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything.  This is the place where you see everything,&rdquo; And the ex-Pirate waved his hands  out toward the horizon.</p>
<p>In  fact, it seemed as if what he had said were true. Tommy thought he really could  have seen everything if his eyes had only been strong enough. The view appeared  to have no bounds. The hill was not so very high, yet it seemed to the little  boy as if he were up in a balloon, and was looking down upon the whole world.  Not far distant was the sea, with the waves breaking on the broad, sandy beach,  and the deep, blue water stretching off immeasurably toward the sky. In the  other direction were hills and valleys and green fields; and far away were  peaceful towns and villages with church-spires sticking up out of a tangle of  roofs and chimneys. Tommy felt very much impressed, and wondered again how it  was that he and his Uncle Dick had never discovered this beautiful spot, &ldquo;How  nice it would be to have a house up here!&rdquo; mused the little boy, and then he  suddenly bethought himself of his own house that he had run away from so  unexpectedly. He looked over in the direction where he thought the big house  ought to be, but he could not locate it anywhere in the landscape, and he did  not quite like to ask the Sheep or the ex-Pirate to show it to him. &ldquo;It must be  an awful long way off,&rdquo; he concluded, mentally, &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t see it from here,&rdquo;  And then he sighed, and wondered how he was ever going to get back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t see them!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sheep, who had been standing on top of a boulder,  and peering intently in the direction of the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t see who?&rdquo; asked Tommy, coming out of his reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  they are behind that knoll yonder,&rdquo; suggested the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;The Penguin lives  there, and they may be calling at his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  may be,&rdquo; said the Sheep. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo; And he jumped to the ground. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But  can&rsquo;t we rest a little while first?&rdquo; pleaded Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an excellent idea. Let us rest. We might as well  have some luncheon, too. Do you ever eat luncheon?&rdquo; This to Tommy, who opened his  eyes very wide and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  I ever eat luncheon? Indeed I do. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo;  answered the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;But, you know, some do and some don&rsquo;t; and at the  Poorhouse we are sometimes irregular about our meals. But won&rsquo;t you kindly ring  the bluebells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  had taken a seat on the grass near one of the birches, but he had not noticed  that there was a beautiful spray of bluebells growing almost at his elbow. When  the ex-Pirate called his attention to them he leaned over and touched the flowers,  and as he did so they tinkled merrily and loudly, just like his mother&rsquo;s  tea-bell at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; said the Sheep, quite heedless of Tommy&rsquo;s surprised look. &ldquo;That will  bring the Dumb-Waiter. Indeed, there he comes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All  three looked down toward the foot of the hill, in the direction pointed out by  the Sheep, and they saw some one coming rapidly up toward them. As he  approached, Tommy perceived that the new-comer was an undersized man with a  bald head and side whiskers, He wore a short black coat and a long white apron  that hung down to his toes, just like the waiters Tommy had seen in the city  restaurants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Dumb-Waiter,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate to the little boy, &ldquo;What do you want to  eat?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; what can I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;d like something sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  can have a sweet-potato,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate; and then, turning to the Sheep, &ldquo;What  will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you spare a grass?&rdquo; asked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you <i>like</i> asparagus?&rdquo; broke in Tommy;  but before the Sheep could answer the ex-Pirate turned on the little boy  sharply and said, &ldquo;Keep quiet until your next turn comes, You have ordered  once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  so Tommy leaned up against the birch and said nothing more, but just gazed at  the Dumb-Waiter, who stood near by in silence, bowing his head respectfully as  each order that was given to him by the ex-Pirate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  what will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess I&rsquo;ll take some Hayberry Long-cake,&rdquo; replied the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well. Hayberry Long-cake for him,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;and you may bring me some  soft-boiled egg-plants and some watermelon on toast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what shall we have to drink?&rdquo; asked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real  pain, I guess,&rdquo; suggested the ex-Pirate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real  pain?&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; explained the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;and thoroughly harmless. You take a  bunch of grapes and put them in a glass, and bruise and hurt them with a spoon  until you get real pain. This yellow, fuzzy, foamy sort of stuff that comes in  big bottles from France is only sham pain.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then,  turning to the Dumb-Waiter, the ex-Pirate said: &ldquo;Make it real pain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Dumb-Waiter bowed again, and began making his preparations for serving the  luncheon, All his dishes and knives and forks seemed to be at the foot of the  hill, and he kept running up and down for some time to collect them. He never  seemed to bring up more than one or two things at a time, and seldom the thing  that was wanted. The ex-Pirate kept finding fault with him and scolding him,  and at last he turned to Tommy and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  always the way with these Dumb-Waiters. They never bring up what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  at each word of reproof the Dumb-Waiter would exclaim, &ldquo;Oh my, but I do get so  tired of running up and down!&rdquo; And then he would disappear down the hill again  and bring up what was wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought you said, he was a <i>dumb</i> waiter?&rdquo; remarked Tommy, after he had heard the servant speak several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> a Dumb-Waiter,&rdquo; replied the Sheep,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I thought a dumb waiter meant one who could not talk,&rdquo; continued the little  boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; laughed the Sheep. &ldquo;We call him a Dumb-Waiter because he runs up and down.  All Dumb-Waiters run up and down, you know.&rdquo; And as Tommy had never seen any  dumb-waiters that did not run up and down (except when they were out of order),  he was forced to be contented with this peculiar and rather unsatisfactory  explanation.</p>
<p>When  the Dumb-Waiter had brought up all that was necessary for the meal, the  ex-Pirate got down on his hands and knees and wanted the servant to set the  table on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; asked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  I want this luncheon to be on me, you know,&rdquo; explained the ex-Pirate, genially;  but the Sheep would not agree to this, and wanted it to be on him. A wrangle  ensued, in which Tommy wisely decided to take no part, and the two disputants  finally compromised on allowing the ex-Pirate to sit down and hold the dishes  on his lap instead of having them served on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am glad you like sweet things,&rdquo; he remarked to Tommy, as the little boy began  to eat his sweet-potato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say that I care much for sweet-potatoes, though,&rdquo; ventured Tommy, who was  forcing himself to eat so as not to be impolite to his host,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no matter,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, pleasantly; &ldquo;try something else.&rdquo; (But  Tommy noticed that there was nothing else to try.) &ldquo;All sweet things are sweet,  you know,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;even things that apparently have no taste. Now  love-letters, for instance, are sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed&rdquo; put in the Sheep. &ldquo;The Monkey&rsquo;s love-letter must have been sweet. But  then he wrote it in jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you ever hear about that?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate, turning to Tommy, and upsetting  several dishes into the grass as he did so. &ldquo;It is a classic&mdash;one of <i>my</i> classics.&rdquo; And without waiting for  the little boy to answer, he began to recite;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Said the Monkey to the Tapir,<br>
  One Sunday afternoon,<br>
  &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me have some paper,<br>
  With some jelly and a spoon?</p>
<p align="center">For I want to write a letter<br>
  To a pretty Perroqueet,<br>
  And I really think I&rsquo;d better<br>
  Make the message rather sweet.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was raspberry jelly,&rdquo; commented the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  exclaimed Tommy. &ldquo;Did the Monkey use a spoon for a pen and raspberry jelly for  ink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what he did,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;It was a red-letter day for the Perroqueet,  I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I9"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page063.jpg" width="516" height="750"></p>
<p>Further  conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the Hayberry Long-cake. This was  a new dish to Tommy. It was a sort of cake, apparently stuffed with hay or  straw, and was fully three yards long. The Dumb-Waiter brought the cake up the  hill on roller-skates. One skate was fastened to each end of the cake, so that  it looked like an eight-wheeled toy wagon. The Sheep ate several yards of the  odd delicacy, and the ex-Pirate likewise took a number of slices, and when they  had eaten as much, as they could, they called the Dumb-Waiter and made him eat  some of it, because, as they explained afterwards to Tommy, they always feed  the waiter. Then they all three arose and started down the hill toward the sea  shore.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CIX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
  The Erratic Thingumbob</b></h2>
<p>The  path to the sea led first down the hill, then across some fields, and finally  through a little stretch of woods. These were dark and spooky, and as Tommy  tramped along under the trees between the Sheep and the ex-Pirate he imagined  several times that he heard strange noises in the underbrush. These noises  sounded like distant roars and growls&mdash;very faint, indistinct roars and growls,  to be sure, but roars and growls, nevertheless&mdash;and the little boy could not  help recalling what the Sheep had said about lions at the time of the Welsh-Rabbit&rsquo;s  visit to the Poorhouse. He tried not to display any timidity, but he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are  there any lions around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes,&rdquo; answered the Sheep, in the same careless tone he would have used if Tommy  had said &ldquo;trees&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;lions&rdquo;; but when he noticed that the little boy  looked frightened, he added, &ldquo;They are not dangerous lions, though; they are  only Dandelions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon  Tommy felt much relieved, and skipped along merrily until he saw an ordinary  mud-turtle spread a pair of wings from under his shell and fly up into the air  and rest on the limb of a maple-tree. This was too much even for a little boy  who had seen nothing but impossible things all the afternoon. He stopped right  short in the middle of the road and gazed up at this new wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t stand there and stare at that Turtle-Dove,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, somewhat  impatiently; &ldquo;we have not time to stand around and study unnatural history. If  we don&rsquo;t hurry we won&rsquo;t reach the Penguin&rsquo;s till dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was a very strong argument with the little boy, so he gave one last glance at  the Turtle-Dove, and ran along until he caught up with his two companions. In a  few moments they broke out at the edge of the wood, and found themselves only a  short distance from the sea-shore. The breakers were making a great noise on  the sand, and back of them the calm blue sea stretched away unspotted by any  smoke or sail. Purely out of habit the ex-Pirate put his hand up over his eyes  and looked around from north to south the entire-length of the sky-line. Then  he shook his head sadly and sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  no good at scanning the horizon any more. This business of scanning hexameters  and pentameters and Alexandrines spoils a man utterly for a good, all-around,  everyday, smooth horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  did not even try to understand what he was talking about, but trudged right  along in silence beside the Sheep.</p>
<p>They  had not gone very far before they caught sight of two figures in the distance. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  bet that&rsquo;s Thingumbob,&rdquo; said the Sheep, calling the ex-Pirate&rsquo;s attention to  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just who it is, and I wonder what he is doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  certainly <i>was</i> doing something&mdash;this  figure whom they called Thingumbob. As they drew nearer to him Tommy thought he  must be making a speech, for he could see that he was waving his arms and  shaking his fists at his companion, who appeared to be very much affected by  what was being said. The second figure Tommy soon made out to be a Seal. He was  a rather large Seal, and was sitting on a rock, while Thingumbob stood on the  sand in front of him. Tommy tried later to describe Thingumbob to his Uncle  Dick, but he found himself unequal to the task. At times the queer creature  resembled everybody Tommy had ever known, and yet again he looked like nobody  in particular. He was a nondescript sort of being, entirely indescribable.</p>
<p>As  they came nearer they could hear him using the most dreadful kind of language;  he was scolding the Seal, and calling him names in a most outrageous manner. He  was so engrossed in pouring out this vituperation that he did not notice the  approach of Tommy Toddles and his companions. The Seal was apparently greatly  distressed over what Thingumbob was saying, for he held his fins up to his  eyes, and wept bitterly. Neither the ex-Pirate nor the Sheep seemed in the  least affected by the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is that awful person doing?&rdquo; asked Tommy, as they came quite close to him.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I10"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page069.jpg" width="800" height="689"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?  Thingumbob?&rdquo; said the Sheep. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right! But I suppose you don&rsquo;t  understand. Look at him now,&rdquo; Thingumbob was holding a dipper in front of the  Seal&rsquo;s face, and was catching the poor beast&rsquo;s tears while he scolded him in  the most dreadful manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thingumbob  always does that,&rdquo; the Sheep went on to say. &ldquo;Whenever he meets a Seal he  scolds him and blackguards him until the poor thing begins to cry. Then he  catches the tears in his dipper, because Seals weep sealing-wax, you know.&rdquo;  Tommy did not know it, but he nodded his head and looked to the Sheep for more  information. &ldquo;Thingumbob is a great collector of sealing-wax. He has lots of it  at home. All colors, you know. Most of it is red, though. Young Seals weep red  sealing-wax, and it is easier to make them cry. If you just pinch a young Seal,  or say &lsquo;Booh!&rsquo; at him, he&rsquo;ll cry. The middle-aged Seals weep yellow and blue  and brown and black sealing-wax. The old fellows shed golden tears, but it&rsquo;s  pretty hard to make them cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  one is crying in blue,&rdquo; said Tommy, for they had now gotten close enough to  Thingumbob and the Seal to be able to see the contents of the dipper. It was almost  full of blue sealing-wax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;  said Thingumbob, when he saw the three; and, turning toward them, he waved his  dipper in a friendly sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May  I go now?&rdquo; whimpered the Seal, seizing the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  you may go,&rdquo; shouted Thingumbob, fiercely; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you let me catch you at  it again!&rdquo; The Seal hobbled off the rock toward the surf, shedding blue tears  on the sand as he went (which Thingumbob carefully picked up as he followed  along behind), and then jumped into the waves and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  pretty good for ten minutes&rsquo; talk, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Thingumbob, holding out  his dipper for the others to inspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did you get it?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I scared him half to death. I told him he had been putting the Sea-Fox up to  stealing my Chicken-Lobsters, and that I&rsquo;d have him arrested and put up in an  Eagle&rsquo;s nest on top of a mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Sheep and the ex-Pirate seemed to think what Thingumbob said was very funny,  for they laughed and asked him a lot of questions. Tommy, in the meanwhile, was  more interested in Thingumbob&rsquo;s personal appearance than in what he said. He  was certainly the queerest-looking creature the little boy had ever  encountered. He never looked twice alike. When they had first come up Tommy  thought Thingumbob had gray side whiskers, but as he looked now he had no  whiskers at all. His pockets were stuffed and fairly bulging with all sorts of  odds and ends, among which Tommy could see bits of string, pieces of spangled  cloth, an old clock, a broken saw, a tin horn, a match-box, shells, ribbons,  picture cards, and all sorts of trash. The ex-Pirate was evidently as much  amused as Tommy at the sight of this odd collection of useless material  sticking out of Thingumbob&rsquo;s pockets; for he presently asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you carrying all that stuff around for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I always do,&rdquo; replied Thingumbob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s nothing but a lot of trash&mdash;a lot of trumpery,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; continued Thingumbob, calmly; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you know that you can always  tell a man by the trumpery he keeps?&rdquo; And having thus spoken, he sat down on a  rock and began to brush his hair, using the bottom of his tin dipper for a  mirror. It was a very old brush that he used, and it was very full of hairs,  and as Thingumbob proceeded with his toilet he frequently paused to look at it.  Finally he said to the Sheep, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is about wool, but a hair on  the head is worth, two in the brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  they say,&rdquo; replied the Sheep; &ldquo;but we have not time to stay here and discuss  that. We want to find out about the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all over,&rdquo; said Thingumbob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  forget,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Either the Sword-Fish or the Penguin won. I don&rsquo;t remember  which. But here come some Clams; perhaps they know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  then, as Thingumbob had said, half a dozen Clams stepped out of the breakers,  and strolled over to where Tommy and his friends were conversing. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CX"></a>Chapter X<br>
  Unpleasant for the Clams</b></h2>
<p>With  the Clams was a strange creature that looked to be half horse and half  vegetable. It had four hoofs, and all the rest was leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  in the world is that with the Clams?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Horse-Radish,&rdquo; answered the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse-Radish  always goes with Clams, you know,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, condescendingly.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I11"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page075.jpg" width="800" height="623"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course; I ought to have thought of that,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;And with Oysters, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the Oysters are away now,&rdquo; said one of the Clams, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone away for the  summer. They never stay about in May, June, July, and August,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully  high-toned mollusks, those Oysters,&rdquo; sniffed a Little Neck Clam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  just think of having four months&rsquo; vacation every year,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was talking with a little Oyster in his bed the other day,&rdquo; continued the first  Clam, &ldquo;and he said four months wasn&rsquo;t half enough.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must have been a very young one,&rdquo; ventured the Horse-Radish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the way with those young ones,&rdquo; commented Thingumbob. &ldquo;You give them an  Inch-Worm and they want an Elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  notice the old Oysters are glad enough to get a rest of four months,&rdquo; continued  the Horse-Radish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose they think half a loaf is better than no vacation at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  odd of them!&rdquo; put in Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd?&rdquo;  queried the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like the Oysters? Or do you prefer the  society of the Clams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?  I like Oysters, and I like Clams too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clam  stew!&rdquo; shrieked the Little Neck Clam, in great dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too,&rdquo;  said Tommy, who noticed that the Clams were becoming very much alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo;  repeated Thingumbob, with woful lack of tact; &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ve seen chowders where  there was only one Clam.&rdquo; But this line of conversation had become so  distasteful to the Clams that they were rapidly sinking into the sand. Thingumbob  noticed this, and branched off on another subject. &ldquo;I know why the Oysters go  away in the summer,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t like the Flies. The  Flies go away in the winter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  do we,&rdquo; said the Clam, now somewhat reassured,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  do the Flies go to?&rdquo; asked Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wondered where they went in the  winter-time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what the pink-eyed Gosling asked,&rdquo; said Thingumbob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  asked where the Flies went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  it&rsquo;s a classic, too. Another one of my classics,&rdquo; put in the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Would  you like to hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  ahead! Go ahead!&rdquo; said Thingumbob, pounding on the rock with his dipper. &ldquo;Go  ahead, whether he wants to hear it or not. We&rsquo;ll hold him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  so the ex-Pirate bowed to all, and began to recite, in his usual melodramatic  manner:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo; &lsquo;Where do the Flies go in winter-time?&rsquo;<br>
  The pink-eyed Gosling asked.<br>
  &lsquo;They go to a balmy, distant clime,<br>
  Where the sun is never masked;<br>
  To a land where clouds are still unknown,<br>
  Where the cold north wind has never blown,<br>
  And the seeds of sin are yet unsown,<br>
  Where all is true and good.&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo; &lsquo;And do the little Flies remain<br>
  All winter in this land,<br>
  Or do they find the constant strain<br>
  Too great for them to stand?<br>
  For, even with the little Flies,<br>
  It seems occasion must arise<br>
  To weary of the cloudless skies,<br>
  Where all is true and good.&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;The Gander knit his furrowed brow,<br>
  And frowned upon his child,<br>
  And said, &lsquo; &lsquo;Tis plain to see that thou<br>
  Art yet both young and wild;<br>
  But harken to the old who preach,<br>
  And listen to the wise who teach.<br>
  Or else that land thou&rsquo;lt never reach<br>
  Where all is true and good.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>No  one had apparently noticed it, but while the ex-Pirate was reciting; the six  Clams had sunk into the sand until they were wholly out of sight, and the  Horse-Radish had entirely withered away. Thingumbob sighed when it was all  over, and began brushing his hair again. He also brushed his whiskers, for they  had grown out anew. Presently he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since  you are speaking poetry, how do you like this:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Quoth the Codfish to the Pelican;<br>
  &lsquo;Can you swim as well as I?<br>
  If you do not know how well I can,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll let you see me try.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that all?&rdquo; asked Tommy, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing  happened. Nothing ever happens,&rdquo; added Thingumbob, rather peevishly. &ldquo;For  instance:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;The Zebra and the Crocodile,<br>
  The Quagga and the Gnu,<br>
  All started out one afternoon<br>
  To see what they could do.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;They wandered quite a long way off,<br>
  And had such loads of fun,<br>
  That when they came back home again<br>
  None knew what they had done.</p>
<p>And  so, you see, practically, or as far as the outside world was concerned, nothing  happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate pulled Tommy away a little to one side and whispered in his ear:  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s that way. You see, he&rsquo;s been talking too much. Let us leave him alone and  go on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Tommy suspected that the real reason why the ex-Pirate wanted to leave was  because he was becoming jealous of Thingumbob. Nevertheless, as the Sheep was  also inclined to proceed, they bade farewell to the queer creature and  continued along the beach. Tommy noticed, as they walked on, that the beach  gradually became, harder and harder to the step, and that the sand no longer  gave way beneath his feet as softly as well-regulated sand should. He would not  have minded such a thing, probably, if he had not been somewhat fatigued by his  long walk; but he was a tired little boy by this time, and did not much care to  have his progress made any more difficult. He looked down at the sand to see  what the trouble was, and discovered that there was no longer any sand there at  all. He was now walking along on shingles. He looked about him, and it seemed  as if he and his companions were travelling on the roofs of houses that had  been built so closely together that there was no room for streets in between  them. And the rocks, too, that had been scattered along the shore had in some  unaccountable manner disappeared to give place to chimneys, out of some of  which thin clouds of smoke coiled skyward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  are we now?&rdquo; asked the little boy, when he had completely taken in the transformation  of his surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  are we?&rdquo; echoed the Sheep, as if he did not quite understand the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  what are we walking on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see. Why, this is the shingle beach. There aren&rsquo;t many like this. Isn&rsquo;t it  queer? But we will be off of it in a minute,&rdquo; and, sure enough, a few rods  farther on the shingles melted into sand again, and the rocks ceased to be  chimneys, and the landscape became as perfectly natural as it had been before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  it is!&rdquo; shouted the ex-Pirate, just after they had left the shingle beach  behind them. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Penguin&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; and he directed Tommy&rsquo;s attention  to a queer-looking structure about two hundred yards ahead of them, sheltered  by a low cliff and well set back from the sea,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that where the Penguin lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the place. That&rsquo;s his office, too. Don&rsquo;t you see The Tidal Wave written over  the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  Toddles had made up his mind not to be astonished any more at anything he might  see that day, or he doubtless would have been much more impressed than he was  with the Penguin&rsquo;s mansion, and later with the Penguin himself and with his  queer establishment. The house was built of oyster and clam shells, and had  four columns in front of it. These columns were profusely decorated with  lobster claws and crabs and starfish, and supported a sort of triangular  pediment, along the base of which was written in shiny pebbles the name of the  Penguin&rsquo;s newspaper, and on the apex of which roosted a large stone Gargoyle&mdash;that  is, he looked to be of stone, for he was gray of color and sat perfectly still;  but as the three came nearer, Tommy could plainly see that the thing had red  eyes, and that the red eyes were firmly fixed on him. The house was fairly  large, and had a wide front door and several windows, through which, even from  a distance, you could see into the interior of the rooms, where the Penguin  appeared to be very busy at his work.</p>
<p>On  the steps outside were a crowd of little Crabs that were all talking at once,  and pitching pennies and squabbling with one another, just like a pack of very  badly behaved young crustaceans that they were.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
  The Penguin&rsquo;s House</b></h2>
<p>The  Sheep stepped up to the house and knocked on the door with his gold-headed  cane, and when the Penguin came in person to see what was wanted he introduced  Tommy and the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  have come,&rdquo; began the Sheep, &ldquo;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the Penguin interrupted him, and said, in a nervous, jerky manner: &ldquo;I hope you  will excuse me, but I am very busy just at present. If you will come in and sit  down I shall be through with my work in a short while, and will then be able to  spare you a few moments of my very valuable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I12"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page087.jpg" width="800" height="703"></p>
<p>So  saying, he nodded his head to each one of them and hurried back into his  office, where he climbed on a high stool, leaned over his desk, and began to  write assiduously. He wrote so fast that every few minutes his pens gave out  from sheer friction; but the editor had a Porcupine tied to his stool, and  every time a pen broke he leaned over and pulled a quill out of the captive at  his feet. The only fun the Porcupine seemed to get out of life was to roll over  and jab the office Catfish in the ribs every time he got a chance, a proceeding  which was not only exceedingly distasteful to the office Catfish, but it  likewise greatly annoyed and disturbed the Penguin. The only other living being  in the editorial-room was the printer&rsquo;s Devil-Fish, who seemed to be  compositor, pressman, proof-reader, and everything else all rolled into one. He  was the busiest creature Tommy had seen since he bade good-bye to the Reformed  Burglar. Occasionally, when the Crabs made so much of a racket outside that the  Penguin could no longer hear the wheels turning in his head, the printer&rsquo;s  Devil-Fish would leave his work and spare a minute to jump up on the  window-sill and shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See  here, you newsboys out there! If you don&rsquo;t make less noise I&rsquo;ll have you all  deviled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does he mean by that?&rdquo; asked Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  you ever heard of deviled Crabs?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  but how can the printers Devil-Fish devil Crabs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  ought to hear him sometimes,&rdquo; remarked the Sheep. Then, reflectively, &ldquo;Those  newsboys are a bad lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  the Crabs the newsboys?&rdquo; queried the little boy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.  They have to be. They are the only ones who can run around as easily on land as  under water, They distribute the extras along the shore, and they also skim along  the bottom of the sea and up the rivers, and sell the papers to the fishes. I  guess the Penguin is getting out an extra now. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  forgot to ask him who won,&rdquo; put in the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  let&rsquo;s go out and ask the Gargoyle about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think we can get him to come off the roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess so. He must be in good humor to-day; the sun is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  not he good-humored unless the sun is out?&rdquo; asked Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed. The Gargoyle is greatly influenced and affected by the weather. On  cloudy days he is glum and morose and disagreeable, and won&rsquo;t speak to any one;  and on rainy days he becomes very sad and weeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon,  without warning, the ex-Pirate began:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;The Gargoyle roosts fantastically<br>
  On the curling eaves,<br>
  His head&rsquo;s thrust out bomabastically:<br>
  All things he perceives.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;His stony eyes stare very steadily<br>
  At everything below,<br>
  And when it rains they very readily<br>
  Shed quarts of tears or so.</p>
<p align="center">Thus, wrapt in moisture and obscurity,<br>
  His lonely watch he keeps,<br>
  And at the thought of grim futurity<br>
  He weeps,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He weeps,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  weeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  had never noticed that about Gargoyles,&rdquo; remarked Tommy, &ldquo;but I suppose it must  be true.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Pirate, who was inclined to take Tommy&rsquo;s half-implied  doubt as a personal injury. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe it, ask the Gargoyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  all three stepped out in front of the house, and the Sheep, bowing politely to  the Gargoyle up above him, asked him if he would not come off the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will, with the greatest of pain,&rdquo; replied the Gargoyle, blinking his red eyes  at the Sheep. Then he began to move along down the edge of the pediment, slowly  and awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  got the rheumatism badly,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  can you expect?&rdquo; retorted the Sheep. &ldquo;He stays out all night. No wonder he has  the rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he is all covered with moss,&rdquo; remarked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said the Sheep, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s merely a sign of his green old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Gargoyle slipped carefully down one of the pillars, and hobbled stiffly over to  where Tommy and his friends were seated in the sand on the opposite side of the  house from where the Crabs were making so much noise, and with a series of  grunts and moans he sat down himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;as soon as I get fixed; but it&rsquo;s no fun getting fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  got near enough to the Gargoyle to feel of him, and he found that he was as  hard and as cold as a stone. The little boy, of course, had marvelled at  hearing the animals converse, but words from a stone image filled his cup of  amazement to the brim. This brief interval of wonderment and reflection drew  his mind back to the point he had started from (viz,, his stray animals), and  he bethought him, with a twinge of conscience, that for some time past he had  neglected to make the diligent inquiries he should have made along the route.  So he hastened to speak to the Gargoyle before the ex-Pirate had time to put  his question about the result of the duel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you seen any animals to-day, Mr. Gargoyle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowds  of animals; I never saw so many in all my existence, and I have been carved a  long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you see <i>my</i> animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are they like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was a poser for Tommy, because he felt that he really did not know what his  toys were like, since they had taken it upon themselves to grow up and become  animated and walk away. So he answered, non-committally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  just like animals,&rdquo; which conveyed but little information to the Gargoyle.  Then, in the brief pause that followed, the ex-Pirate jumped into the  conversation with his questions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  animals were here to see the duel, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  who won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  won?&rdquo; exclaimed the Gargoyle, in amazement, &ldquo;The Penguin, of course. He is  getting out an extra, now, with an account of the fight in it. It is to be  illustrated with pictures of himself and of the Sword-Fish, and the Sword-Fish&rsquo;s  father and mother and his two little daughters, and the rocks near which he was  born, and the school-books he used when he was a little Sword-Fish, and all  sorts of things that have nothing to do with the matter at hand.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  said the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  continued the Gargoyle, &ldquo;and I suggested the head-line for the main story  myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is brief and to the point. It sums up the whole situation in one sentence, thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;The Penguin Is Mightier Than The Sword-Fish.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  pretty good,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;but, you know, we have not heard anything at  all about the duel yet. And you must have had a splendid view of it from the  house-top. Won&rsquo;t you tell us something about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  answered the Gargoyle, good-naturedly, &ldquo;But afterward you must buy a <i>Tidal Wave </i>extra, and read about it for  yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  agreed to do this, and the Gargoyle then began to relate the incidents of the  fight. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
  Story Of The Fight</b></h2>
<p>The  Gargoyle shifted about in the sand until he got his stone legs comfortably  fixed, and blinked his red eyes at his auditors, especially at Tommy, who sat  beside him with his legs crossed, like a tailor, and his face resting on his  hands, his elbows on his knees. The little boy was all attention.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I13"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page093.jpg" width="800" height="668"></p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was the largest congregation of animals I ever witnessed,&rdquo; began the stone  image. &ldquo;There were more here today than I ever saw at a Jabbergather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is a Jabbergather?&rdquo; interrupted Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  him what a jabbergather is,&rdquo; said the Gargoyle, turning to the Sheep,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  Jabbergather,&rdquo; explained the latter, somewhat ungrammatically, &ldquo;is when the  animals gather together and jabber about things that have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  a sort of five-o&rsquo;clock tea,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the Gargoyle; &ldquo;because a Jabbergather is always held at night, and they  don&rsquo;t drink tea. They eat mushrooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  indigestible,&rdquo; thought Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you must not interrupt any more,&rdquo; said the Sheep, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  continued the Gargoyle, without heeding the Sheep&rsquo;s remonstrance to the little  boy. &ldquo;there were about twice as many animals as come to a Jabbergather, and the  fishes all sat on the waves, many rows of them, reaching far out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like  seats in a theatre,&rdquo; put in Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut  up!&rdquo; growled the Sheep, and Tommy subsided again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course the Penguin and the Sword-Fish were ready to fight, and the Horned Owl,  who was to be referee, was on hand. But just before the duel began there was a  great rumpus on the third wave from the front, which created such a commotion  that we had to send a Monkey and a Porpoise out there to see what the trouble  was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did you happen to send a Monkey?&rdquo; asked Tommy, much to the Sheep&rsquo;s evident  displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  sent him on Porpoise,&rdquo; answered the Gargoyle. &ldquo;They came back and told us that  the Sole and the Flounder were sitting on the same wave and had gotten into a  row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  same old dispute, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  same one they had at the last Jabbergather,&rdquo; assented the Gargoyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what did they dispute about?&rdquo; asked Tommy, who was very anxious to know all  about what was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May <i>I </i>tell him?&rdquo; urged the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  made a classic out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly, go ahead,&rdquo; said the Gargoyle, who  did not appear to be at all annoyed by these continual interruptions.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Said the Sole to the Flounder,<br>
  &lsquo;You shameless old rounder,<br>
  I&rsquo;d have you to understand clearly<br>
  That your constant assumption<br>
  Of my rightful function<br>
  Shall be punished&mdash;and punished severely.&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;But the Flounder, he laughed<br>
  And gurgled and chaffed,<br>
  And said without any apology,<br>
  &lsquo;If Men are such Moles<br>
  They take Flounders for Soles<br>
  I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t teach ichthyology.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle  Dick told me once that you could not tell a Flounder from a Sole,&rdquo; ventured  Tommy. But the Sheep frowned severely at this, and said: &ldquo;Now, nobody must  interrupt any more;&rdquo; and the Gargoyle then proceeded with his narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After  the Sole and the Flounder had been separated, the Horned Owl called Time, who  came in out of the past and sat down on his hour-glass at the side of the ring.  The duel then began. The Sword-Fish fought with his sword, and the Penguin  fought with a long pen that looked like a spear. I tell you it was exciting!  They jabbed and struck each other, and ran around on the sand, and fell down  and got up again, and all the animals kept shrieking and shouting, and the  seals kept yelling, &lsquo;rah! rah! hah!&rsquo; It was immense! Time must have gotten  scared, for he flew. The duel kept on, nevertheless, and pretty soon the  Sword-Fish began to show signs of weariness. The Penguin kept jabbing him with  his pen, and thrusting at him until he finally knocked him down, and the Sword-Fish  cried for mercy. The Horned Owl called Time again, but Time had flown so fast that  he was away up in the clouds. So the Horned Owl looked at him and said Time was  up, and then the fight was all over, and the Penguin had proved himself to be  mightier than the Sword-Fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Gargoyle had scarcely finished his story when there was a great hubbub in the  direction of the house, and hundreds of little Crabs came surging around the  corner shouting at the tops of their voices:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extra! <i>Extray! Extree!</i> All about de big  fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  scampered off in all directions along the beach, and some of them rushed into  the breakers and disappeared under the sea. They all had little bundles of  papers under their arms, and were hastening away to dispose of their wares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  extra is out,&rdquo; said the Gargoyle. &ldquo;You can get one now and read a detailed  account of the great battle for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  curious!&rdquo; mused Tommy, &ldquo;I never thought before to look to see if little crabs  were carrying anything when I have seen them running along the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When  all the Crabs had disappeared the Printer&rsquo;s Devil-Fish came out and sat on the  front stoop of the house, and presently the Penguin himself sauntered over to  the group sitting in the sand and stood beside them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  he said to the Sheep, &ldquo;I am at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s of any use for me to ask you if you have seen my animals?&rdquo;  said Tommy, before the Sheep could answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  of the slightest use,&rdquo; replied the Penguin, haughtily. &ldquo;Editors never see  anything,&rdquo; and to emphasize this statement he took a pair of blue spectacles,  which he had been holding in one hand, and put them on. &ldquo;We look at everything  through colored glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;s  the pity,&rdquo; said the Sheep. &ldquo;But if you have not actually seen the animals, can&rsquo;t  you tell us what direction they took when they went away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said the Penguin. &ldquo;They started that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  that way,&rdquo; repeated the Gargoyle; &ldquo;off over the dunes and in toward the hills  and the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  we must go that way too,&rdquo; said Tommy, getting up from the sand, feeling very  much rested; and his companions did likewise, and they all bade farewell to the  stone image and to the Penguin. As they passed over the dunes they looked back  and saw the Gargoyle laboriously climbing back to his perch on the house-top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  that way,&rdquo; murmured the ex-Pirate, sighing deeply.</p>
<p>The  three walked for some time in silence over sand-hills and through underbrush,  and pretty soon they took a road that led through broad and sunny fields.</p>
<p>Away  off, as far as they could see, Tommy noticed a cloud of dust, and what looked  to him like a moving crowd of some sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those  must be my animals!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate climbed up on a fence, and put his hand up over his eyes, and stared  as hard as he could at the things the little boy had pointed out to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> animals,&rdquo; he said, finally. &ldquo;I can  see them plainly. There are two of each kind, and they are walking in pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those  are <i>mine</i>, surely!&rdquo; cried the little  boy, now greatly excited, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run and catch up with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  let&rsquo;s run,&rdquo; chimed both the Sheep and the ex-Pirate; and the three immediately  started off at break-neck speed down the road in the direction of the dust  cloud. Tommy felt as though he had never run so fast in his life. The fence  posts and bushes fairly whizzed past him. His companions kept pretty well  abreast of him at first, but they gradually fell behind, and after a while,  when Tommy looked back over his shoulder, they appeared only like specks far  back on the yellow highway. The little boy tried to slow up in order to wait  for them, but his legs had got to going so fast that he could not stop himself.  He was travelling along the road at a terrific rate, and all the time he was  rapidly approaching the procession of animals that now seemed to be fully  life-size. The lions and tigers and leopards looked very fierce, and yet Tommy  felt as if he could not stop himself from running right into them, and he began  to get very much frightened. Pretty soon he was almost on top of the  guinea-pigs, and in his terror he stumbled head over heels, and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  oh! oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  he opened his eyes and found himself lying on his back on his own window-seat  in the play-room, and his mother was leaning over him in the twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  little man, wake up,&rdquo; she said, as she pushed his hair back from over his  little warm face and eyes. &ldquo;You have been sleeping here like a little pig all  the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  I?&rdquo; said Tommy, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;And, oh, Mamma, I&rsquo;ve had such  a funny dream,&rdquo; he added. Then he looked at his Noah&rsquo;s Ark on the floor, and  saw his wooden animals standing two and two, just as he had placed them there  hours ago. &ldquo;I have been dreaming about <i>them</i>,  Mamma,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to his toys. &ldquo;I thought they had run away and I  went after them, and I had such a long journey, and saw all sorts of  things&mdash;Burglars, Pirates, and a nice woolly Sheep, and a Penguin, a Loon, a  Welsh-Rabbit, a Gargoyle, and the queerest creature in the world, called  Thingumbob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid that two pieces of plum-pudding are too much for my little boy,&rdquo; said  his mother, with a smile, &ldquo;But come down to supper now, and there you may tell  us all about your wonderful dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  he washed his face and hands and went down with his mother to the dining-room,  and after supper he told them all about these really very wonderful adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Part II<br>
  In The Ark</b></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
  Through The Halls Of Time</b></h2>
<p>It  took a long time for Tommy Toddles to recover from the exquisite sensation of  surprise and wonder which clung to him after his strange adventures with the  Sheep and the ex-Pirate. He used to talk to his Uncle Dick continually of what  he had seen and done during that famous afternoon, and many and many a time the  two went out into the woods together and searched through the bushes and the  trees for the haunt of the Loon, and for the lake by the side of which had  stood the Poorhouse. But they never found anything; and Tommy was consequently  forced to sit at home and content himself with recollections and reminiscences&mdash;&ldquo;which  are decidedly unsatisfactory substitutes,&rdquo; thought he.</p>
<p>So  it frequently happened that the little boy sat all alone in the big room at the  top of the house, and went over and over again in his mind those peculiar  incidents in which so many strange creatures had figured, and in which so many  odd things had been said and done. But one rainy day he seemed to be more  affected by his reminiscences than he had ever been before, and so he settled  back on the window-seat, and gave himself up entirely to thoughts of the ex-Pirate,  the Sheep, the Reformed Burglar, and of all the quaint creatures of his  acquaintance. He was smiling quietly to himself at some of the funny things  Thingumbob had said on the beach, when all of a sudden he thought he heard  somebody knocking on the door. Nobody ever knocked before coming into Tommy&rsquo;s  playroom, and so the little boy looked up in a curious way, wondering who it  could be, and wishing that no one would come in to disturb his reverie. The  door was ajar, and he could see that there was some person standing out in the  hall. Presently there was another knock. Tommy straightened up on the window-seat,  and called out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  door swung slowly inward, and who should be standing there looking straight at  Tommy but his old friend the ex-Pirate! It was the same old ex-Pirate of days  and days ago, with his fierce mustaches and long hair, and his big pistols  sticking out of his sash. He looked at Tommy for a moment, just as if he wanted  to make sure that he was calling on the right little boy, and then a pleasant  smile spread all over his face, and he walked rapidly across the room. Tommy  jumped from the window-seat and hastened to meet him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  I&rsquo;m awfully glad to see you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. ex-Pirate? And  how did you get up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate laughed, and shook hands with Tommy, and then he said: &ldquo;Oh, I just  came. Things come and go, you know; and I just came. Wasn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully  nice,&rdquo; said Tommy, enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about you. I was  beginning to think you were not real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I&rsquo;m real,&rdquo; asserted the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Just as real as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not real,&rdquo; suggested Tommy; and  then, becoming alarmed at the thought, he felt in his pockets, and pulled at  his hair to see if he were all there. Reassured on that point, he added, &ldquo;Where  is the Sheep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess he&rsquo;s running yet,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, laughing. &ldquo;Poor fellow; I left  him &lsquo;way behind. But I never saw anybody run like <i>you</i> in all my life. You ran faster than Time, and Time runs pretty  fast now, I tell you! He can go pretty near as fast as Money&mdash;and you know how  fast Money goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  did not know how fast money went, because he had never seen very much of it,  but he thought that, from the nature of his past business, the ex-Pirate must  have had wide experience in those matters. So he said, &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; continued the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;that&rsquo;s perfectly right. But I ran as fast as  I could, and I&rsquo;ve only just arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must be tired,&rdquo; remarked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I never get tired. I&rsquo;m ready to keep right on, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep  right on?&rdquo; queried Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;On  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  looking for the animals,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I found them,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did?&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Pirate, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.  They were right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right  in this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  Toodles would have given his word, fifteen minutes before the ex-Pirate asked  him this question, that his Noah&rsquo;s Ark with the animals in it was on the floor  near the table; but when he went to look for it to show it to his friend he  could not find it anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  gone,&rdquo; he said, finally, after several minutes of vain searching under tables  and sofas. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone, and all the animals too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  gone?&rdquo; repeated the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Tommy, dejectedly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve gone away again. Not only the animals, but the  Ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Ark!&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Tommy. &ldquo;My animals belonged in the Ark. There were two of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  Noah&rsquo;s Ark?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  did you never see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  what nonsense!&rdquo; laughed the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;That was hundreds and hundreds of years  ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know it was,&rdquo; said Tommy, with dignity. &ldquo;But my animals were imitations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate was gazing absent-mindedly out of the window over toward the ocean.  &ldquo;Your animals had invitations?&rdquo; he said presently, recovering himself, &ldquo;Of  course. They all did. The Ark was no promiscuous affair. There was admission by  card only. All those that had invitations got in; the others got drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  saw that the ex-Pirate did not quite understand what he had said to him, so he  thought it would be wiser to branch out on some other topic; but before he  could do so his visitor remarked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  had lots of fun in the Ark,&rdquo; and he chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Sheep told me. He was one of the Few Hundred. I should like to have been on  board too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  should I,&rdquo; assented Tommy, eagerly, &ldquo;especially if they were all as nice as the  animals we met the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>would</i> have been fun to take that  trip,&rdquo; continued the ex-Pirate, musingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but that we can, even  now, fix it to go on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  board the Ark?&rdquo; cried Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.  We would have to go a long way back through the Ages; but perhaps we can fix  that up with old Father Time. He might take us back and let us go aboard,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  stared vacantly at his peculiar companion, and wondered silently if he had gone  mad. Pretty soon the ex-Pirate said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  board the Ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  shall we do it?&rdquo; asked Tommy, who felt that it could do no harm to humor his  caller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  will find Father Time, and see if he will go backward for us. Where is the clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the hall down-stairs,&rdquo; answered the little boy.</p>
<p>The  two went out into the corridor and down the stairs to where the old Dutch clock  stood under the staircase, ticking loudly through the silent house. It was much  taller than either Tommy or the ex-Pirate, and as they approached the little  boy was amazed to see the clock&rsquo;s face brighten up and smile, and wave its  hands in greeting to the ex-Pirate. The latter returned the courteous salute,  and knocked on the door below. The door immediately opened, and old Father  Time, with his scythe and his hour-glass, stepped out into the hallway, and  nodded cheerfully to the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you do?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty  seconds to the minute, as usual,&rdquo; answered Father Time, genially. &ldquo;What can I  do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you go back a little?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; asked Father Time.</p>
<p>And  then the ex-Pirate started in to explain what he wanted. His argument was most  involved, and Tommy Toddles could not follow it at all; but the ex-Pirate kept  on talking as fast and as impressively us he could, and occasionally he pulled  out his pistols and shook them vigorously in the air over his head, Father Time  listened attentively, and shook his head negatively for a long time, but  finally he appeared to yield to the ex-Pirate&rsquo;s persuasive arguments, and when  he spoke he said he would do what was wanted,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you go?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, turning quickly to Tommy. The little boy hesitated  a moment, because he did not know exactly where the ex-Pirate wanted him to go,  or how long he would be gone if he went; he hesitated, but it was only for a  moment, because he soon noticed that Father Time was growing impatient, and the  ex-Pirate looked slightly displeased at the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said, impulsively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  had hardly spoken these words when Father Time slung his scythe and his  hour-glass over his shoulders, grabbed the ex-Pirate with one hand and seized  Tommy with the other. Then the old Dutch clock began buzzing and whizzing, as  if all the wheels were revolving as fast as they could turn; and they must have  been, for when Tommy glanced at the face of the clock to see what the hour was  the hands were racing around so fast that he could hardly see them&mdash;and they  were turning in the opposite direction from the way clock hands usually travel.  There was no time to notice this slight peculiarity, however, for the little  boy felt himself rudely jerked off his feet, held firmly by the tight grasp of  Father Time, and before he could exclaim, or object, or expostulate, he saw  himself flying through space at what seemed to be the rate of many hundreds of  miles a minute. Father Time was vigorously working his wings, and was speeding  backward, his long gray beard flowing in the wind between Tommy and the  ex-Pirate, who were sticking out straight behind, and neither had breath enough  left to be able to say anything. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
  A Pair Of Unfortunate Turtles</b></h2>
<p>As  soon as Tommy recovered his self-possession&mdash;or as much of it as he could under  these trying circumstances&mdash;he opened his eyes and looked about him. He could  not see much, for they were apparently racing down a dark, narrow corridor, &ldquo;like  a telegram in a pneumatic tube,&rdquo; he thought. But his eyes gradually grew  accustomed to the darkness, and he could see that there were pictures on the  walls&mdash;battle pictures, and scenes representing all sorts of historical events.  He caught a glimpse of Washington crossing the Delaware, and of the battle of  Bunker Hill; he saw the taking of the Bastille, and the great London fire. Soon  he saw the Spanish Armada and the Crusades, and, later, the burning of Rome,  Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon, the siege of Carthage, the building of the  Parthenon, the destruction of Troy, the fall of Babylon, and afterward many  other things that be could not recognise. They all seemed to whiz past him in a  sort of confused blur. He screwed up courage enough finally to call out to the  ex-Pirate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wh-wh-at  is th-this pl-pla-ce, and how l-long are we g-going to go l-like th-this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th-th-these  are the halls of Time!&rdquo; the ex-Pirate shouted in reply. &ldquo;We are going back  through them as far as the Deluge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  explanation was not very satisfactory to Tommy, and although up to the present  moment he had not had a chance to think of getting scared, he now began to feel  slightly alarmed at what had happened. He was about to question the ex-Pirate  again, when suddenly there was a great burst of light, and they seemed to shoot  out of the tunnel they had been travelling through. Tommy felt the grasp of  Father Time&rsquo;s hand loosen, and the next thing he knew he was rolling head over  heels on top of a big hay-stack in the middle of a broad, sunny field. He  pulled himself together as soon as he could, and found the ex-Pirate sitting in  the hay beside him with a somewhat bewildered expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think I like that sort of thing very much,&rdquo; remarked Tommy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t quite say that I do either,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, feeling to see if his  pistols were still in his sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  is Father Time?&rdquo; continued the little boy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps he is going ahead again now at his regular rate of sixty  seconds to the minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  scratched his head meditatively and looked about him. The field in which the  haystack stood was surrounded by hills and forests, and here and there could be  seen various kinds of animals travelling in pairs. Over the crests of the  trees, directly in front of them, the little boy espied something that looked  like the roof of an immense barn. He called the ex-Pirate&rsquo;s attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  must be the Ark,&rdquo; said the latter, rising. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  clambered down the hay-stack into the field, and started off in the direction  of the woods. There was not any path for them to follow, and occasionally they  had to wade through tall grass that reached almost up to their waists. In one  of these clumps of herbage they heard voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  dear! oh dear!&rdquo; said one voice, &ldquo;I am sure we shall be late. We are <i>always</i> late. Oh dear! oh dear! I wonder  what time it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  and the ex-Pirate stopped and looked about them; but they could not see any  one, and were about to proceed on their way, when they heard the same plaint  again. They parted the tall grasses and searched in the direction whence the  sounds appeared to come, until they found two Turtles plodding along as fast as  they could over the rough ground. It was the larger of the two Turtles that was  wailing over the probability of their being late in arriving wherever they were  going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>The  Turtles paused and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  matter?&rdquo; exclaimed the larger Turtle, &ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; and he pulled a newspaper  clipping out from under his shell. &ldquo;I am sure we shall be late,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate took the piece of paper and looked at it. It was an advertisement:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1600941h-images/page116.jpg" width="800" height="295"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sure we shall, miss the boat,&rdquo; continued the Turtle, nervously. &ldquo;What time is  it, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  and the ex-Pirate looked at each other. Neither one had a watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you what time it is,&rdquo; answered the little boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not big enough  to have a watch; and the last time I saw the clock it was going so fast I could  not tell what time it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the Turtle, &ldquo;you are more polite than the Cuckoos, anyway. But I am sure we  shall be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess not,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, reassuringly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get nervous about it.  There is always a delay. The Ark won&rsquo;t sail on time. And besides, they will  have to wait for the mails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; persisted the Turtle. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have to wait for the males, because we  are going aboard in pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  we carry the poor things?&rdquo; suggested Tommy. &ldquo;It would be too bad if they got  left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Turtle looked up at the little boy with an expression of overwhelming  gratitude. This was all that was needed to persuade the ex-Pirate, and so he  and Tommy leaned over and each picked up a Turtle and tucked it under his arm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This  reminds me of a conversation I overheard once,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, as they  started off again. &ldquo;I made a classic out of it; and as the Sheep is not here to  object now, I will recite it to you:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is much to be regretted,&rsquo;<br>
  Said the Turtle to the Snail,<br>
  That as rapid-transit creatures<br>
  We so signally must fail.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;&lsquo;But yet we should be thankful<br>
  That Nature still allows us<br>
  To carry on our weary backs<br>
  The wherewithal to house us.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo;  blurted out the Turtle from under the ex-Pirate&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Is there any danger of  these pistols going off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;they are loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right, then,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh of relief; &ldquo;I was afraid they were not  loaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  and the ex-Pirate, with the Turtles under their arms, picked their way slowly  through the trees toward the Ark, They proceeded in silence for some moments, until  the little boy, who had apparently been thinking very seriously about  something, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  did the Turtle mean by saying we are more polite than the Cuckoos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  you ever heard about what the old Turtle did to the Cuckoos with Agathea&rsquo;s wish-box?&rdquo;  returned the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never did,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me now as we go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it was a long time ago, of course,&rdquo; began the ex-Pirate, complaisantly; &ldquo;almost  long enough ago for me to begin by saying, &lsquo;Once upon a time . . .&rsquo; But I won&rsquo;t  say that if you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  old Turtle lived down by the swamp, and had a very easy time of it, and withal  was a very good old Turtle. One day he got a message from his brother, who  lived near the pond over the hill, saying that two little new Turtlets had just  arrived, and asking him to come over to the christening the next day. So the  Turtle got up bright and early that morning, and polished his shell until it  shone in the sunlight like burnished gold, and then he started off along the road  toward the pond. He had not gone very far when he came to a beautiful wild-rose  bush in full bloom, and underneath it sat Agathea, the pretty little forest  fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Good-morning,  Mr. Turtle,&rsquo; said Agathea.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Good-morning,  pretty one,&rsquo; answered the Turtle, very politely. &lsquo;You look as sweet as the dawn  of a May morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;And  where are you going so early m the day?&rsquo; asked the Fairy, blushing with  pleasure at the Turtle&rsquo;s compliment,</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m  going over the hill and down to the pond, where my brother has two little  Turtlets that are to be christened to-day.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two  little Turtlets!&rsquo; exclaimed Agathea. &lsquo;And will you take them a present from  me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;With  the greatest pleasure,&rsquo; said the Turtle, for he knew that a present from the  forest fairy could not but be welcome to his nephews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agathea  picked up a little box from the moss under the rose-bush, and handed it to the  Turtle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &lsquo;In this box,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is a wish. You may have it. Think of what you would  most like to happen, and say the words out loud when you open the box. Then  your wish will come true. Be very careful about keeping the box closed until  you get to the christening, for if you should wish for something on the way and  open the box, then that wish would be granted. You must wish in the presence of  the ones the wish is to affect. So be careful, and wish in the presence of the  Turtlets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying  this, Agathea gave the box to the Turtle, and bade him good luck on his  journey. He thanked her effusively, and continued on his way. He plodded along  up the hill, which was a good deal longer and a good deal steeper than he had  expected to find it, and after a while, as the sun kept getting higher and  higher in the heavens, he began to fear he would be late at the christening. So  he hurried on as fast as he could, and soon he found himself passing through a  wood where there were any number of Cuckoos. They all appeared to be very busy  building nests for the little Cuckoos, and they did not pay much attention to  old Uncle Turtle, who was crawling along as hard as he could with his wish-box  in one hand. Pretty soon he stopped and spoke to one of the Cuckoos.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Good-morning,  Mr. Cuckoo,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Can you tell me what time it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the Cuckoo was so busy that he did not pay any attention to the Turtle&rsquo;s request,  and presently flew away. The Turtle went on a little farther and met another.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Please,  Mr. Cuckoo,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;can you tell me what time it is? I am going to the  christening of the little Turtlets, and I am afraid I shall be late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  guess you will,&rsquo; answered the Cuckoo; and he went on building his nest, but he  wouldn&rsquo;t tell the Turtle what time it was. The latter was getting very angry by  this time, because he had never been treated so impolitely before by the  Cuckoos or by any one else, but he went on a little farther, and every time he  met a Cuckoo he asked what time it was. Some of them paid no attention to him,  others said they did not know the hour, and others again told him they had no  time to stop and fuss with Turtles. So the Turtle kept getting angrier and  angrier, and by the time he had reached the top of the hill he was the angriest  old Turtle you ever saw. There he met two more Cuckoos, and he spoke to these  as a last effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Please,  Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo, what time of day is it? I am going to the christening of  the little Turtlets, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;  &lsquo;Bother the Turtlets,&rsquo; said one of the Cuckoos, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;We  don&rsquo;t know what time it is,&rsquo; added the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These  replies made the Turtle so angry that he did not know what to do. He looked  down at his box, and on seeing it, he remembered that by opening it he could  have any wish he wanted. So for the moment he forgot all about the Turtlets,  and he said to himself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just wish something about these Cuckoos that will  make them sorry they did not tell me what time it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  he crawled up on a stone, and prepared to open the box, saying out loud as he  did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;May  all the Cuckoos that ever live be compelled to tell the time of day, Every hour  shall they call the time out loud, so that all within hearing may know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  as he said this, the Turtle opened the box and let the Wish escape. All at once  every Cuckoo in the woods began to tell him what time it was, and from what  they said he knew it was almost too late for the christening, But he hurried  on, and when he came to the pond he told the Turtlets all about what had  happened to him, and although they were not much pleased at the use he had made  of Agathea&rsquo;s gift (for little Turtles have no appreciation of time), yet they  were so glad to see their uncle that they did not cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  so,&rdquo; concluded the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;on account of the Turtle&rsquo;s wish, every Cuckoo  has to call out the time of day every hour in the twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  there aren&rsquo;t any Cuckoos here,&rdquo; blurted out the Turtle who had first spoken, &ldquo;and  I am sure we shall be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  they advanced they could hear sounds as of a vast congregation of creatures,  and at last, when they came to the edge of the woods, they looked out upon a  broad plain, in the centre of which rested the huge house-boat that Noah had  constructed. Around it were gathered hundreds and hundreds of animals, and in  the air above were flying countless birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  that Ark is just like mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy, &ldquo;only a million times larger.&rdquo; The  ex-Pirate looked at him in a half-surprised way, but made no reply.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I15"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page117.jpg" width="800" height="651"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess you can drop us here,&rdquo; Said Tommy&rsquo;s Turtle; &ldquo;and we are ever so much  obliged.&rdquo; As soon as the two creatures had been put down upon the ground again  they scampered off in the direction of the Ark as fast as their legs would  carry them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  what shall <i>we</i> do?&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess we had better hold a council of war. When you don&rsquo;t know what to do,  always hold a council of war,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, and the two sat down in  the shade of a big oak to consult.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
  Tommy And The Ex-Pirate Get Into The Ark</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  often wondered afterward why it was that he did not feel frightened when he  found himself so close to this great congress of wild animals But at the time  he did not feel in the least alarmed, and he and the ex-Pirate sat quietly  together under the oak planning as to what they had better do. Perhaps Tommy  felt no fear because all the animals seemed to be on such good terms with one  another, and so gave evidence that they would not harm any one else. The little  boy noticed the Lion and the Lamb lying down together; the Fox was playing tag  with the Geese (&ldquo;Fox and Geese, I suppose,&rdquo; thought Tommy); the Red Wolf was  strolling about, arm in arm with a bearded Goat and his Kids; and half a dozen  Mice were having all sorts of fun with an old Tomcat who wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess the only thing for us to do,&rdquo; remarked the ex-Pirate at last, &ldquo;is to just  walk over and go aboard. There&rsquo;s no use sitting here any longer. We have not  any umbrellas, and it is liable to begin to rain at any moment, Let&rsquo;s try our luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it would be best for us to walk around to the other side,&rdquo; suggested Tommy,  &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be so many animals there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  companion approved of this, and they started off together, making a circuit  which soon brought them to the other side of the huge house-boat. There were  scarcely any beasts in sight, and so they boldly approached the great craft  which towered high up above their heads. When they had come quite close, the  ex-Pirate&rsquo;s keen eye caught sight of a small port-hole near the stern, and  after calling Tommy&rsquo;s attention to it they decided to try to get in that way.  The port-hole was very narrow, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the  two managed to squeeze through. But they succeeded, nevertheless, and found  themselves in a sort of dark chamber where there was a ladder that led to the  upper regions of the Ark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  all right now,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Do you think this will be too much for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  asked Tommy, who did not quite understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you mean?&rdquo; asked the little boy, now somewhat puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are a lad, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  this is a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was not anything that Tommy could very well answer to any such statement; but  then he had long since given up any idea of following the peculiar arguments  and reasonings of the ex-Pirate. Yet, in order to show him that, even if the  ladder was more than he, he was certainly equal to climbing it, he seized the  rungs and clambered up. It ended at a trap-door which, when lifted, opened into  a very large room that appeared to occupy the entire length of the Ark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  exclaimed the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;This is where they have the boxing-matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  they have any?&rdquo; asked Tommy, eagerly, and his eyes opened very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;but this is the spar-deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did you get here?&rdquo; suddenly asked a familiar voice from behind them; which so  startled Tommy that he almost stepped into the open trap. When he looked around  he saw, to his great joy, that it was the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  we just came,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, quickly. &ldquo;Things come and things go, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve heard that before,&rdquo; interrupted the Sheep. &ldquo;But if Noah catches you,  he&rsquo;ll put you ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we don&rsquo;t want to go ashore,&rdquo; said Tommy, who at seeing his old friend the Sheep  had entirely recovered from his momentary alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m very busy now,&rdquo; continued the latter, &ldquo;and the animals will be coming in  pretty soon. If you want to see them, you had better go up to the other end of  the Ark and sit on a rafter over the entrance. But don&rsquo;t let the Bull see you.  He&rsquo;s in a mighty bad humor. Good-bye,&rdquo; and the Sheep trotted off and  disappeared almost as suddenly as he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess  we&rsquo;d better do that,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, meditatively. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get  put out.&rdquo; So they walked to the other end of the big room, being very careful  to make as little noise as possible, and when they came to the large arched  entrance with the heavy bolted doors the ex-Pirate helped Tommy climb up a  post, and the two slid out on a rafter, from which they could obtain a  first-rate view of anything that might happen. Just below where they sat, and  directly opposite them, was a window with a small counter in front of it and  the words &ldquo;Ticket Office&rdquo; painted over it. Below the counter, nearer the floor,  was another window, only smaller&mdash;&ldquo;for the little animals, I suppose,&rdquo; thought  Tommy, When their eyes had become accustomed to the semi-obscurity of their  surroundings they found that they were not the only occupants of balcony seats.  A few feet away from them sat a Gopher. He wore a pink sun-bonnet, and looked  somewhat timidly at the intruders. As soon as the ex-Pirate saw him, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you doing up here? Why aren&rsquo;t you outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I16"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page129.jpg" width="800" height="633"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost  my ticket,&rdquo; answered the Gopher, timorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost  your ticket?&rdquo; repeated the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; continued the little animal, meekly. &ldquo;Not exactly lost it, I put it in my  mouth, and forgot, and swallowed it. I&rsquo;ve got it inside.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get it back as soon as we start,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  may I stay?&rdquo; asked the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  certainly,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate, affably, waving his hand in a grandiose way,  just as if he had been the proprietor of the Ark; whereupon the Gopher looked  much pleased and relieved, and settled down comfortably again at his end of the  rafter.</p>
<p>Just  then the shutter of the ticket-window was thrown up with a loud bang that made  Tommy jump, and the Bull stuck his head out and peered up and down the large  room. He was a very fierce-looking Bull, and be wore on his head a cap with the  word &ldquo;Purser&rdquo; embroidered on it in gold letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  aboard!&rdquo; he bellowed, in a voice that fairly made the timbers tremble, and  scared the Gopher half out of his wits. And then some one from the outside  opened the heavy doors and the animals began coming in. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
  The Animals Come Aboard</b></h2>
<p>The  animals poured into the Ark like the tide through a sluice. They pushed and  shoved and crowded, and many tried to get to the Purser&rsquo;s window ahead of their  turns. The big ones brushed the little ones aside with a total disregard of  gentleness or consideration. But the Bull soon put a stop to this sort of  thing. He stuck his head out of the window and said all sorts of horrible  things, and vowed he would have the doors closed if the beasts did not preserve  better order. Things went along better after that.</p>
<p>The  larger animals came in first: Lions, Tigers, Elephants, Hippopotami,  Rhinoceroses, Camels, Giraffes, Dromedaries, Buffaloes, Polar Bears, Grizzly  Bears, and every other kind of Bear. Tommy thought he had never seen so many  different animals in all his life, It beat a circus all hollow, and it reminded  him of the college song his uncle Dick used to sing about:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;The animals came in two by two,<br>
  Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
  The animals came in two by two,<br>
  Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
  The animals came in two by two,<br>
  The Elephant and the Kangaroo,<br>
  And they all got into the Ark before it began to rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After  the large animals followed a long procession of deer &mdash; Elks, Antelopes,  Gazelles, Chamois, Moose, and Caribou. Behind these came dogs of every kind&mdash;big  dogs, little dogs, thin dogs, fat dogs, gay dogs, sad dogs, shaggy dogs, sleek  dogs, and all-colored dogs; Greyhounds, Mastiffs, Pugs, St. Bernards, Fox  Terriers, Setters, Pointers, Poodles, Great Danes, Skyes, Black-and-Tans, and  Collies. Toward the end of the procession came a long-bodied brown dog with big  ears and long, straight legs. Tommy had never seen that kind before,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is he?&rdquo; he said, pointing downward.</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate shook his head, but the Gopher answered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Dachshund,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  Dachshund?&rdquo; repeated Tommy; &ldquo;I guess not. Dachshunds are not built like that.  Look at his long legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  that <i>is </i>a Dachshund,&rdquo; insisted the  Gopher; and then he pulled his sun-bonnet over his head and closed his eyes for  a nap.</p>
<p>The  French Poodle was the only one that had any trouble with the Bull, because the  Bull could not speak French, and refused to understand what the Poodle said.  Tommy plainly heard the dog muttering to himself as he left the window:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esp&egrave;ce  de John Bull! Il est toujours comme &ccedil;a!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the little boy could not understand what the Poodle meant any more than the  Bull could, because he had not gotten along any farther in his French exercise-book  than &ldquo;Have you seen the good General&rsquo;s red slippers under the green table of  the wine-merchant&rsquo;s beautiful mother-in-law?&rdquo; And he did not recognize any of  these words in the Poodle&rsquo;s plaint.</p>
<p>The  Bull had been losing his temper pretty rapidly ever since the doors opened, and  he seemed to be waiting for a chance to do or say something ugly. Pretty soon a  couple of harmless and sleepy-looking Oxen came plodding up the gang-plank and  strolled through the doorway,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  here!&rdquo; the Bull shouted at them, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to leave your chewing-gum outside!  No gum chewing allowed on the Ark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One  of the Oxen protested, but the Bull asserted that if the Ox made any trouble he  would come outside and settle the matter himself; and so both Oxen regretfully  stuck their chewing-gum under the gang-plank and passed in. A little while  later a Lizard came along and handed in his ticket through the small window  near the floor. The Bull looked at it and frowned, and then stuck his head out  over the counter and glared at the little Lizard, who actually turned green  with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by presenting this ticket?&rdquo; asked the Bull, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  sir, I want to come into the Ark,&rdquo; replied the Lizard, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  you can&rsquo;t get in on this ticket&mdash;see?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  sir, it&rsquo;s the only one I have,&rdquo; continued the Lizard, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  look here, young fellow,&rdquo; snorted the Bull, getting angrier as he spoke; &ldquo;this  ticket is your shape, but it is not your size. You bought it from a speculator  outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the Lizard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what you say. This is the Crocodile&rsquo;s ticket, and it ain&rsquo;t your  size, and you can&rsquo;t get in on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  sir, I did not know,&rdquo; mildly protested the Lizard. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read, sir,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t you know that the pauper, the insane, and the illiterate are not allowed  on this Ark?&rdquo; roared the Bull, apparently deriving much pleasure from the fact  that he was scaring the Lizard half to death. The little fellow did not in the  least understand the meaning of these big words, but he was so frightened by  the Bull&rsquo;s ferocious manner that he turned away and scurried frantically down  the gang-plank, and hid under a big stone in the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  awfully mean for the Bull to talk like that to such a little animal!&rdquo; whispered  Tommy to the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what he always does. Never takes a fellow his size,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;He  bullies the little ones; that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s called a Bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently  a Crocodile came stamping up the gang-plank. He had a business-like expression  in his eye, and a cold, sarcastic smile displayed his glistening rows of sharp  teeth. He stepped right up to the ticket-window, and thrust his long snout in  so suddenly that he almost knocked the Bull off his stool.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I17"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page137.jpg" width="800" height="669"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by sending me a miniature ticket like this?&rdquo; he shouted, fiercely.</p>
<p>The  Bull stuttered, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir; but won&rsquo;t you allow me to look at the  ticket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Crocodile passed the paper in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s all a mistake,&rdquo; began the Bull, apologetically, &ldquo;I assure you it is all a  mistake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should say it was,&rdquo; interrupted the Crocodile, who appeared to be in an  exceedingly unpleasant frame of mind. &ldquo;Do you think for a moment that I am  going to take any such accommodations as that? Do you think I can sleep in any  berth that was built for a Lizard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a mistake,&rdquo; repeated the Bull, affably. &ldquo;Your quarters are on the main-deck,  starboard side, No. 417,&rdquo; and he passed out the ticket he had taken away from  the Lizard.</p>
<p>The  Crocodile did not appear satisfied. He stuck his nose through the window again  and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I want satisfaction! I want satisfaction, and I&rsquo;m going to have it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the crowd of animals in line behind the Crocodile, tired of waiting, gave a  push that sent the latter past the window and out into the main hall, still  mumbling something about &ldquo;satisfaction.&rdquo; The Bull looked out of his office,  much relieved, and shouted down the line,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody  tell that Lizard he can come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  did not take so long as Tommy thought it would for all the animals to get on  board. When the last one had passed in, preparations were made to haul up the  gang-plank, for the wind had freshened, the skies had darkened, and the general  appearance of the heavens betokened the approaching storm. Just as the big  plank was about to be taken aboard, faint voices were heard from the ground  outside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment! wait a moment!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Wait for us; we&rsquo;re almost there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was the Turtles. By so close a margin did they get into the Ark. The Bull  scolded them as they passed, and then slammed down the window, and the Gopher,  on the rafter next to Tommy, heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Soon  afterward it began to rain. The big drops fell noisily upon the shingled roof  of the Ark, and pattered on the window-panes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is that noise?&rdquo; asked a little Armadillo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the rain, dear,&rdquo; replied its parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no,&rdquo; said the little one; &ldquo;the Reindeer are sleeping downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  then there was a great jolt, and the Ark floated off on the flood. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
  A Far-Reaching Accident</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  and the ex-Pirate and the Gopher remained quietly perched on the rafter for  some minutes after the big Ark had begun to move; but when they found that none  of the animals noticed them, since all seemed so busy attending to their own  affairs, they slid along the beam until they could look out into the main room  and see what was going on&mdash;that is, Tommy and the ex-Pirate slid along, but the Gopher  remained where he was, apparently sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you suppose they will do next?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight  or eat, I guess,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;All animals fight or eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think I should like to see them fight,&rdquo; continued Tommy. And then he  added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is getting dark in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  much so,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, looking about. &ldquo;I suppose they will light up  pretty soon. It&rsquo;s always dark on a rainy day, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  kind of lights do you suppose they will have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ark-lights,  of course,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;What other kind would you expect on a boat of  this kind? Did you suppose the two Tapirs would be bright enough? If you had  ever had any dealings with a Tapir you would know what a stupid beast he is.  Don&rsquo;t you remember my classic about him:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Said the Monkey to the Tapir,<br>
  One Sunday aftenoon,<br>
  &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me have some paper.&rsquo; etc., etc. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Tapir sold writings paper, you see. But he was too stupid to get along in the  business. That&rsquo;s why it is called a stationery business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  was about to answer&mdash;he hardly knew what&mdash;when a bump and a squeal interrupted  the conversation. The sleeping Gopher had fallen off the rafter. This accident  might have caused a good deal of trouble if a great hubbub had not started at  the other end of the room at the same moment. There were squeals and howls and  yelps, as if some one was being killed. In the rush and confusion the Gopher  mixed with the crowd, and Tommy could only occasionally catch a glimpse of his  pink sun-bonnet bobbing up now and then in the swarm that was struggling in the  distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wonder what has happened?&rdquo; said the little boy, leaning as far forward as he  dared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First  fight, I guess,&rdquo; muttered the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;But I think we had better stay up  here and wait till it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess we had,&rdquo; assented Tommy. But they did not have to wait very long, for the  Gopher soon came scurrying back and climbed quickly up beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!  Goodness me!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Dachshund was playing tag with a Chinese Pug, and he fell through the  trap-door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  my!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  ought to see him,&rdquo; pursued the Gopher. &ldquo;He fell all the way down to the hold, and  his legs are jammed away up into his body and twisted all out of shape. They&rsquo;re  only about three inches long now, and even the Elephant could not pull them out  straight. He is disfigured for all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  any one help him?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t let any one. The Duck, who was educated in divers practices, offered his  services as doctor, but the Dachshund would not have him. Said he was a quack.&rdquo;  There was a brief silence; then the Gopher added: &ldquo;They are trying to find out  who opened the trap-door, and so I ran away. I came in that way; but I&rsquo;m sure I  shut the trap after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  came in that way too,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  and I came up first,&rdquo; put in Tommy, &ldquo;You were last up. Did you shut the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess I did not,&rdquo; admitted the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;But it was the Sheep&rsquo;s fault; he put  it out of my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time the excitement had abated, and the animals were scattered in groups  again. The Dachshund went waddling about the floor on his short, crooked legs,  to the great amusement of the Storks and Cranes, who still had long, straight legs,  and Tommy said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I never knew before how it happened that those dogs had such funny legs.&rdquo; But  the Gopher said nothing, and still trembled for fear some one would find out he  had come in through the trap.</p>
<p>The  wind was blowing fiercely outside, and as it howled around the corners and  under the eaves of the Ark it sounded notes like those of an &AElig;olian harp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Tommy. &ldquo;It sounds like a fiddle,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate almost jumped off the rafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle!&rdquo;  he exclaimed. &ldquo;Who said fiddle? Is there a fiddle on board? If there is, I&rsquo;m  going to jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  did not say there was a fiddle on board,&rdquo; remonstrated Tommy, &ldquo;I said it <i>sounded</i> like a fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you so afraid of a fiddler for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I tell you, you will easily understand,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, with a deep  sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  tell us. Is it interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  and I can give it to you in rhyme. Will you have it in four verses or in six?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess four will do,&rdquo; answered the little boy, and he leaned over and pulled the  Gopher up closer. &ldquo;Come and hear the poetry,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate turned toward his audience on the rafter, and recited: </p>
<p>&ldquo;There  once was a fiddler whose name was McPhee,<br>
  And he fiddled, he fiddled, he fiddled, did he.<br>
  He fiddled so loud and he fiddled so long<br>
  That the neighbors all thought there must be something wrong<br>
  With this fearful old fellow, this fiddler McPhee,<br>
  For he fiddled, he fiddled, he fiddled, did he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  one day the neighbors all went up to see<br>
  What the cause of this unceasing fiddling could be.<br>
  They appointed committees to go in and speak<br>
  In behalf of them all to this fiddling freak,<br>
  Who had fiddled all day and all night for a week;<br>
  But their efforts all failed with this frightful McPhee,<br>
  Who fiddled for fun, he fiddled, did he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  first man to face the fiddler McPhee<br>
  Was a fat little fellow, who said, &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he,<br>
  &lsquo;You fiddle all night and you fiddle all day,<br>
  You fiddle and fiddle your whole time away;<br>
  Won&rsquo;t you tell us the reason why all this should be?&rsquo;<br>
  But the fiddler still fiddled, he fiddled, did he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  finally, while fiddling, he said, &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he,<br>
  &lsquo;You will greatly oblige me by letting me be;<br>
  All your fussing and fretting and fuming,&rsquo; said he,<br>
  &lsquo;Is nothing at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s fiddlededee!&rsquo;<br>
  So he kept on a fiddling, this fellow McPhee,<br>
  And he fiddled, and fiddled, and fiddled, did he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  I was one of the neighbors,&rdquo; added the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  did not Mr. McPhee stop?&rdquo; asked Tommy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No. We all had to move. He had a ninety-nine  years&rsquo; lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; said the Gopher.</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate was about to propose reciting four more verses when there occurred  another commotion, and the Hippopotamus stood up on his awkward hind-legs and  shouted: &ldquo;Lets organize! We ought to organize! What is life without  organization? I move we elect a president&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I18"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page145.jpg" width="800" height="660"></p>
<p>But  before he could express his views any further the Lion stepped up to him and  buffeted him with his paw, and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit  down! If there is any organizing to be done, <i>I</i> will do it, I want you to understand that I am the King of  Beasts, and we won&rsquo;t have any Presidents this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon  the poor old Hippopotamus rubbed his sore jowls, and waddled slowly off to  another part of the room. Then the Lion got up on a big chair, with the Lioness  at his side, and made a speech. Tommy and the ex-Pirate could not hear what he  said, because they were so far away; but the animals all seemed very attentive  and much pleased, for they continually nodded their heads, and at the close of  the oration the Gopher, who in some manner had managed to catch every word,  waved his sun-bonnet in the air and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hoo</i>ray! We&rsquo;re going to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  told you so,&rdquo; whispered the ex-Pirate; and then he suggested to Tommy that they  go down to the floor and mingle with the animals, and try to find the Sheep, so  as to have a chance at the meal, if that were possible.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
  The Banquet Begins</b></h2>
<p>None  of the animals paid the slightest attention to Tommy and the ex-Pirate when  they came down from their uncomfortable perch on the rafter and strolled about  the big room. The Gopher, probably emboldened by his neighbors&rsquo; action,  descended, too, and mingled with the other beasts, But, for some reason, he  managed to remain within sight of Tommy and the ex-Pirate, so that if anything  had happened to him he could have run to them for protection or assistance.  Occasionally he would join them and converse for a few moments, and then he  would wander off again by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  guess they take us for a pair of animals,&rdquo; observed Tommy, as he glanced about  at the peaceful beasts. &ldquo;Some new kind,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  must be it,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate; absent-mindedly; &ldquo;but I wish we could find the  Sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  this crowd?&rdquo; exclaimed the Gopher, who came up at that moment. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s  like looking for a beetle in a smoke-stack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  three walked along for some time in silence, and they saw all sorts of queer  things as they went. In a retired corner the Hippopotamus was shaving himself with  a razor-backed Hog, much to the displeasure of the Hog, who kept up a perpetual  snorting and grunting. Near by an old mother Pig was putting her little Pigs&rsquo;  tails up in curl-papers for the night. Farther along the Armadillo, the  Turtles, the Hedgehog, and the Porcupine, squatted on the floor together, were  playing dominoes, A Leopard-like creature sat near by, watching the game,  looking very much disappointed and mournful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t let him play,&rdquo; volunteered the Gopher, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s a Cheetah.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I19"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page151.jpg" width="800" height="621"></p>
<p>All  this time there was much bustle and preparation going on in the middle of the  hall. The Monkey tribe, of which there must have been a hundred, were bringing  up tables and stools and benches from down below somewhere, and were stretching  these out the entire length of the big room. They made a banqueting-board much  longer than Tommy had ever seen before, and then they laid plates and mugs  along the edges, enough to accommodate all. The Monkeys made first-rate  waiters, and the big Gorillas bossed them around, and kept them working &ldquo;just  like real waiters in a restaurant,&rdquo; thought Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the Sheep!&rdquo; shouted the ex-Pirate, suddenly, and he pointed out their old  friend sitting on a bench about a third of the way down from the head of the  long table. They hastened toward him, followed by the Gopher, who was doubtless  afraid of being crowded out, for the animals were taking seats rapidly. </p>
<p>The  Sheep was overjoyed when the ex-Pirate sat down beside him, and he moved up  closer to his neighbor on the other side so as to make room for Tommy and the  Gopher. The little boy sat on the bench with the ex-Pirate on his left and the  Gopher on a high stool at his right. The Lion and Lioness occupied the head of  the table, some distance away, and the Bull sat at the foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have been looking all over for you,&rdquo; began the Sheep, &ldquo;but you were so well  concealed I could not find you. Where did you pick up that Gopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his ticket inside,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Gopher almost fell off his stool, He whispered to Tommy, &ldquo;Tell him not to talk  about my ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  before Tommy could deliver the message the Monkeys began bringing the soup in  on trays, and placed a plateful in front of each one at table. The Gopher  seized his plate and lifted it greedily to his face and swallowed all at one  gulp. Then he threw the plate under the table, and began snapping his fingers  loudly, just as if he had not been served at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not do that,&rdquo; remonstrated Tommy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I must,&rdquo; said the Gopher. And then he held up both hands and snapped all  his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  dreadful table manners the Gopher has,&rdquo; said the little boy to the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;Did  you see what he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered the latter. &ldquo;It was very reprehensible. Worse than anything I ever  saw. Worse than the Bishop of Shinnikoree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Arch-Bishop,&rdquo; put in the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arch-Bishop  nothing,&rdquo; retorted the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;He was only a Bishop,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  he is an Arch-Bishop <i>now</i>&rdquo; persisted  the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <i>dead</i> now,&rdquo; retorted the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  and they carved him in stone, and put him up over the entrance of the  Cathedral, and so he is an Arch-Bishop, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I suppose so. Anyhow, he was mighty queer at table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  never told me about the Bishop before,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;But if I had the third volume of my collected  poems here, I could read to you about him. He was dreadful. Worse than the  Gopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you remember about him?&rdquo; pleaded the little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part.  I guess. Let me see;&rdquo; and the ex-Pirate reflected in silence for a moment. Then  he began:</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;There once was a Bishop<br>
  Who tossed every dish up<br>
  The moment he sat down to table;<br>
  At juggling with plates<br>
  Full of apples and dates<br>
  He was really exceedingly able.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;He would stand on his head<br>
  When he buttered his bread,<br>
  And his neighbors he gayly would banter,<br>
  While he gave a wild whoop<br>
  At the sight of pea soup<br>
  Which was served in a cut-glass decanter.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;With fish-balls and prunes,<br>
  And fresh macaroons,<br>
  The Bishop was likewise quite clever;<br>
  To pile them up high,<br>
  And swallow them dry,<br>
  Was his constant, consistent endeavor.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;He could drink salad oil<br>
  By the pint, and not spoil<br>
  The perfect success of digestion;<br>
  And having well dined,<br>
  And copiously wined,<br>
  He could turn a handspring! without question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo;  commented Tommy. &ldquo;Where did you say he bishoped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  Shinnikoree,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  did not hear that last verse,&rdquo; broke in the Gopher, swallowing his sixth plate  of soup. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you recite it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I cannot,&rdquo; replied the ex-Pirate, severely. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look out I&rsquo;ll write a  piece about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  seemed to frighten the Gopher, for he snapped his fingers again and took  another plate of soup.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
  Tommy Exchanges Ideas With The Gopher</b></h2>
<p>It  seemed to Tommy as if the Gopher would never get enough. The little boy had  never before witnessed such voracity. By actual count he had seen seventeen  plates of soup vanish into his neighbor&rsquo;s system, and yet there was no apparent  ill effect. The Gopher threw each empty dish under the table, so that the pile  of crockery was now so high in front of his chair that he could rest his feet  on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo;  said Tommy, at last, &ldquo;I never saw such a greedy thing as you in all my life,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; answered the Gopher, complacently; &ldquo;the eating question is a  most important one, and I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ll all get up and say dinner is over  before I&rsquo;ve had half enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that you have had more than enough. And, besides, I have an aunt  who says one should always arise from the table hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  you mind that Ant.&rdquo; said the Gopher. &ldquo;Ants don&rsquo;t count. They are so little they  can&rsquo;t hold anything, anyhow. As for getting up from the table hungry, that is  something I cannot understand. I always sit down hungry; and it would never do  to be hungry at both ends of the meal, now would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On  reflection Tommy did not think it would, and as he had been more than half  inclined at the outset toward the Gopher&rsquo;s view of the case, they soon agreed  on this point. Then the little animal said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thtsnawflyfnnyunsnt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t understand you when you talk with your mouth full,&rdquo; replied Tommy.</p>
<p>The  Gopher made a great effort, and swallowed so hard that his eyes fairly bulged.  Then he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awfully funny one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  one next to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo;  said Tommy, pointing at the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo;  continued the Gopher, nodding his head, for his mouth was full again. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is a very nice gentleman,&rdquo; remarked Tommy, for lack of anything more definite  to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  kind is he?&rdquo; asked the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  an ex-Pirate,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  Pie Rat? Goodness, how he has changed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, he has changed,&rdquo; continued Tommy. &ldquo;He is very good now. He has entirely  reformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should say he had. His form is entirely different. I knew a Pie Rat once, but  he was not at all like this one. <i>He</i> does not look like a Pie Rat at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes he does!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy, eagerly, although he realized as soon as he had  spoken that he had never seen any real, active pirate. But he added, &ldquo;He is all  fixed up just like a real pirate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Gopher, dictatorially. &ldquo;The Pie Rat I knew looked like any  other rat, but he only ate pie. Does this one eat pie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you say rat?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  said Pie Rat,&rdquo; answered the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  you don&rsquo;t want to let him hear you say rat. You must say ex-Pirate; that means  that he is not a pirate any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I said,&rdquo; persisted the Gopher. &ldquo;I said he did not look like a Pie  Rat, and so he is not a Pie Rat, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it,&rdquo; Then he threw  up his hands and shouted, &ldquo;Oh my! look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  glanced up toward the head of the table, and saw that the Lion was helping  himself to fully half of what had been placed before him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a lot he takes!&rdquo; remarked the little boy, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo;  said the Gopher, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the Lion&rsquo;s share, and I suppose he is entitled to  it. I wish I were a Lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tommy, hastily, for he felt that he much preferred a small animal  like the Gopher for a neighbor to a possible Lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t really believe I would like to be a Lion, after all,&rdquo; the Gopher went  on to say. &ldquo;If I could make myself all over again, I should be part Elephant, part  Camel, and part Giraffe,&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a funny-looking creature you would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I would not mind that. I don&rsquo;t care much about appearances. Eating is what  interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should think so,&rdquo; commented Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  then think of the advantages of such a combination,&rdquo; pursued the Gopher. &ldquo;If I  were part Elephant I should be as big as any animal; and if I were part Camel I  should have four stomachs; and then I should want a Giraffe&rsquo;s neck. Just think  of how long things taste good in a Giraffe&rsquo;s throat. Why, it&rsquo;s two yards long!  And mine is only about half an inch. How many times better does a piece of pie  taste to a Giraffe than it does to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Tommy Toddles, very promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ve figured it all out many a time,&rdquo; added the Gopher, &ldquo;and I can tell you. A  throat two yards long is twice thirty-six inches long, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  seventy-two inches. And if my throat is only half an inch long, the Giraffes  throat is one hundred and forty-four times as long as mine, and so the pie  tastes one hundred and forty-four times as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  marvelled at the Gopher&rsquo;s proficiency in arithmetic, but his mind soon reverted  to the question at hand, and he began to wonder how much better pie would taste  if his own neck was one hundred and forty-four inches long. He was going to ask  his neighbor for further information on the subject, but when he turned around  toward the Gopher he saw that the little animal had in some way gotten possession  of the soup-tureen, and had thrust his head into it, and was almost drowning  because he could not get it out. And then, just as the ex-Pirate and Tommy had  rescued the Gopher from a soupy grave, the Lion arose at the head of the table,  and pounded loudly on the board and called the assembled multitude to order.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I20"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page157.jpg" width="800" height="679"></p>
<p>When  silence had spread over the room, the King of Beasts announced that the Goat  had eaten the passenger list and other important notices off the bulletin  board, and that it was thus impossible for him, as toast-master, to know who  was present and who was not, and so he could not call on any one by name to  make a speech. He added, however, that any one who desired to make a speech  might do so, or, instead of a speech, any animal could sing a song or tell a  story. Having made this announcement, the Lion sat down again: and all the  animals glared frowningly upon the Goat, who stroked his whiskers nervously and  looked embarrassed, either because of these rebuking glances or possibly  because of the antediluvian ink on the passenger list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  feel awfully sorry for that Goat,&rdquo; whispered the Gopher to Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you get up and make a speech then, and distract the general attention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know any speech,&rdquo; answered the Gopher; &ldquo;but I know a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  the joke,&rdquo; urged Tommy; and so the Gopher stood up in his chair, and took off  his pink sun-bonnet, and said he wanted to tell his joke.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
  A Portion of the Ex-Pirate&rsquo;s Autobiography</b></h2>
<p>The  Lion bowed in a dignified manner to the Gopher, and rapped on the table again  to bring the Parrots to order, and then the Gopher said, very slowly and  deliberately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  is a door not a door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  animals stared at one another, and whispered, and gazed up and down the table  as if they thought they might possibly derive inspiration from the dishes.  Tommy and the ex-Pirate said not a word. Presently the Gopher repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  is a door not a door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  no one could guess, and after a few moments more of anxious and strained  silence the Gopher said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose I shall have to tell you. A door is not a door when it is ajar.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I21"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page163.jpg" width="800" height="637"></p>
<p>The  animals fairly roared and shrieked with laughter. They bellowed and howled and  pounded on the table, and the Gopher became so much affected with appreciation  of his own wit that he fell over backward, and almost stunned a young Grampus  who was trying to get his nose above the table to see what it was all about.  Tommy had never realized before what the expression &ldquo;to roar with laughter&rdquo;  really signified, and he concluded he never wanted to experience such a  realization again. The noise was so great that he had to put his fingers to his  ears. When the merriment had partially subsided, the little boy leaned over to  the ex-Pirate and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have heard that joke before; haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed  I have,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, &ldquo;many a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an awfully old one, isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  always suspected it was first gotten off in the Ark.&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate,  shaking his head knowingly; but I did not know the Gopher was responsible for  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time the animals had recovered themselves, and some were shouting to the  Gopher for more jokes. He got up and protested that he did not know any more;  and then, suddenly pointing to the ex-Pirate, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a funny one. He can <i>recite</i> things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon  the animals all gazed at the ex-Pirate, and the Lion said, &ldquo;Recite things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate never needed much urging to do this sort of thing, and so when Tommy  whispered to him to read the seventeenth chapter of his autobiography which he  knew his friend had in his pocket, and of which the little boy had only heard  the first few lines, the ex-Pirate arose, and, bowing in his usual way to all  his hearers, he pulled his manuscript from his coat and began to read:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;The  following day the sun rose up as usual from the East,<br>
  The sea was calm, the sky was clear, the stormy winds had ceased;<br>
  The <i>Black Avenger</i> sped along before a  gentle breeze,<br>
  And the starboard watch loafed on the deck in true piratic ease.<br>
  I took my breakfast down below, and when I came on deck<br>
  I looked about, and far away I saw a little speck<br>
  Upon the blue horizon, and I knew it was a sail,<br>
  For, in matters of this nature, my eyesight could not fail,<br>
  I called my swarthy Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n, and I said to him, said I:<br>
  &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t overtake that ship, I&rsquo;ll know the reason why;<br>
  If we don&rsquo;t overtake her ere the sun shines overhead<br>
  I&rsquo;ll cut the whiskers off the crew before I go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n nodded cheerfully and swore a fearful oath,<br>
  (He called upon the Sun and Moon, and scandalized them both,)<br>
  And then he hitched his trousers up and piped his whistle shrill,<br>
  And made the loafing pirates heave the halyards with a will.<br>
  The <i>Black Avenger</i> sped along and  ploughed the boiling sea.<br>
  The rigging creaked, the sails stood out, the foam flew fast and free.<br>
  The pirates gathered on the deck and buckled on their swords,<br>
  Rolled up their sleeves, and combed their beards, and spoke piratic words.</p>
<p>But  suddenly the Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n came a-rushing up to me,<br>
  His face was pale, his nose was red, he spoke: &ldquo;Good sir,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;Yon vessel is from Switzerland, and, verily, I fear<br>
  We&rsquo;ll find she is not what she seems, as soon as we get near;<br>
  She looks to me as though she might&mdash;might be a privateer!&rdquo;<br>
  (But when he found she wasn&rsquo;t one, he shed a private tear.)</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I22"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page167.jpg" width="496" height="750"></p>
<p>Said  I: &ldquo;Load up the cannons, boys, with ten-pound cannonballs;<br>
  I care not what yon ship may be, into my hands she falls!<br>
  We&rsquo;ll take her, and we&rsquo;ll take her guns, her captain, and her crew,<br>
  Her cook, her cabin steward, and her precious cargo, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  the Gunner and the Gunner&rsquo;s Mate they lifted up the hatch,<br>
  And they called upon the pirates who formed the starboard watch<br>
  To help them lift the cannon-balls from out the magazine<br>
  Where all the cannon-balls were kept, wrapped up in bombazine.</p>
<p>But  presently the Gunner&rsquo;s Mate came rushing to the rail,<br>
  His hair was standing up on end, his face was very pale,<br>
  He cried; &ldquo;Oh, Captain, woe is me, no cannon-balls are left;<br>
  Of shot and shell of every kind the magazine&rsquo;s bereft!<br>
  There&rsquo;s not a piece of shrapnel, no canister or grape,<br>
  There&rsquo;s not enough of buckshot to kill a good-sized ape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n, who stood near at hand, gazed sadly at us both,<br>
  And then he pulled his pistols out and swore a mighty oath:<br>
  &ldquo;How shall we take yon Switzer ship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without a shell?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I23"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page170.jpg" width="650" height="572"></p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  got to fight,&rdquo; I answered him. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t cheese do just as well?&rdquo;<br>
  For two days previously, you know, we met a brigantine<br>
  From Amsterdam for Zululand, by name the <i>Bandoline</i>,<br>
  And in her hold she carried a fine cargo, if you please,<br>
  Consisting of a hundred thousand dozen Edam cheese.<br>
  We took a hundred dozen and stowed them on the poop<br>
  Between the after cannon and the Captain&rsquo;s chicken-coop.<br>
  (The crew had used the cheeses and some bottles from the galley<br>
  The day before to improvise a sort of bowling-alley.)</p>
<p>Said  I: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take these Edam cheese and put them in the guns,<br>
  And shoot them at the Switzer ship until she sinks or runs;<br>
  For surely such proceedings will be worse than shot or shell,<br>
  Just think of being <i>hit</i> with  cheese&mdash;say nothing of the smell!&rdquo;<br>
  The pirates laughed and vowed my scheme would give them lots of fun;<br>
  And soon a big, red, round, Dutch cheese was rammed in every gun.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I24"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page171.jpg" width="800" height="460"></p>
<p>It  was not long before the <i>Black Avenger</i> came abreast<br>
  And hailed the ship from Switzerland with true piratic zest;<br>
  But not a Switzer said a word, nor made they any sign,<br>
  But all the sailors on the ship were ranged along in line,<br>
  And leaned upon the starboard rail, with sunken, pallid cheeks,<br>
  As though they had not tasted food for six or seven weeks,<br>
  The Swarthy Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n hailed again, and as no answer came<br>
  The Gunner&rsquo;s Mate averred it was high time to start the game,<br>
  I spoke the word, and seven guns all loaded up with cheese<br>
  We fired at the Switzer ship as nicely as you please;<br>
  And then a second volley went, and soon again a third,<br>
  And when the smoke had cleared away we saw what had occurred.<br>
  Each cheese had hit the Switzer ship and flattened on her decks,<br>
  The Switzer men were wading in the cheese up to their necks.<br>
  We waited then to see what sort of fighting they would make,<br>
  And wondered how much cheese these Switzer sailor-men could take.<br>
  But as we waited silence came all o&rsquo;er the Switzer craft,<br>
  And not a seaman seemed to move, or forward or abaft.<br>
  I called the Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n to the bridge, and &ldquo;Take the gig&rdquo; said I;<br>
  &ldquo;Go board yon ship, where all is still, and learn the reason why,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n quick, got in the gig with sixteen of the crew,<br>
  He took along a cannon and an Edam cheese or two,<br>
  And half an hour he was gone, then slowly rowed he back;<br>
  He said to me: &ldquo;Good Captain,&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;alas, alack!<br>
  Upon that floating vessel there&rsquo;s no one left to fight;<br>
  There&rsquo;s not a living creature, not a living thing in sight.<br>
  No man remains to give reply to any kind of question;<br>
  The Switzers ate up all the cheese&mdash;and died of indigestion.&rdquo; &rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was another great demonstration of approval as soon as the ex-Pirate had  concluded, but Tommy paid little attention to the noise this time, because he  had become somewhat accustomed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate, apologetically, &ldquo;I could not very well read anything  like that&mdash;all about cheese &mdash;in the presence of the Welsh-Rabbit; could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; agreed Tommy; &ldquo;but is it true that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  say,&rdquo; interrupted: the Gopher, leaning in front of Tommy and addressing himself  to the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;I know another joke now. I know what the Bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n said to the  Gunner&rsquo;s Mate when he told him to shoot at the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  what did he tell him?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate, incautiously. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese  it!&rdquo; shouted the Gopher, who was immediately seized with such a violent fit of  laughter that he fell under the table, and almost buried himself under the pile  of broken soup-plates. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXXI"></a>Chapter XXI<br>
  A Game Of Bumpolump</b></h2>
<p>The  ex-Pirate very good-naturedly put his head under the table and pulled the  Gopher out from the pile of debris and broken crockery. The little beast did  not appear to have suffered any injury beyond tearing a gash in his pink sun-bonnet,  and as soon as he had resumed his place at the table he looked about him, and  smiled just as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem to mind your fall a bit,&rdquo; remarked the Sheep, somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mind it at all,&rdquo; answered the Gopher, complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought you would be dreadfully cut up,&rdquo; put in the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  did I, at first,&rdquo; continued the Gopher; &ldquo;but only my sun-bonnet got cut, and  that was badly cut in the beginning anyway, so that this extra slash does not  make any particular difference. And what do you suppose I saw under the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feet,&rdquo;  said the ex-Pirate, at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  pretty good for a first guess,&rdquo; retorted the Gopher; &ldquo;but I saw something else.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What  did you see?&rdquo; quickly asked Tommy, who was beginning to feel that he had been  out of the conversation quite long enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  saw It,&rdquo; answered the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed  I did. Do you want to play a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I&rsquo;m getting awfully tired of sitting here, Let&rsquo;s play a game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish you would explain,&rdquo; broke m Tommy. &ldquo;You are talking about all sorts of  things, and I can&rsquo;t understand a word. What is this all about? What is it the  Gopher saw under the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  he saw It,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  what is that?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know what It is?&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Pirate, his eyes opening very wide with  surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the little boy, bluntly, &ldquo;and I wish you would explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo;  gasped the Gopher. &ldquo;Where did you come from? Did not you ever play any games?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said the little boy; &ldquo;but what has that to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  could not very well play any games without It,&rdquo; insisted the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It,&rdquo;  declared the ex-Pirate very slowly and impressively, &ldquo;is the one that runs  after you when you are playing tag, and the one that hides his face and shuts  his eyes when you play hide-and-go-seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ve played those games lots of times,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you must have seen It,&rdquo; put in the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did you play, then?&rdquo; asked the ex-Pirate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  of us was It, of course,&rdquo; explained Tommy; &ldquo;and when he caught another, the  other was It,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  funny,&rdquo; said the Gopher. &ldquo;Why, with us It is always It. That&rsquo;s the fun of the  game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course it is,&rdquo; added the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could play without It.  We had an It on board the <i>Black Avenger</i>,  and we used to play tag for exercise when we were becalmed. But one day, in a  storm, It was washed overboard, and we had to go without playing games all the  rest of the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  stupid of you!&rdquo; remarked Tommy. &ldquo;Why did not you take turns being It?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  thought of such a thing,&rdquo; admitted the ex-Pirate, frankly. &ldquo;You will explain to  us how it is done, some time, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  of course,&rdquo; replied Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it simpler than dominoes?&rdquo; inquired the Gopher, &ldquo;I never could understand  dominoes. You see, there&rsquo;s no It in that, and that makes it so complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  the lack of an It complicates games very much,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate. &ldquo;But let us  play an easy game now. Go down and butt him out from under the table,&rdquo; he  added, turning to the Sheep. </p>
<p>The  latter obligingly jumped to the floor and disappeared under the table. A few  moments later Tommy heard a thump, followed by a whizzing sound, and then a  queer-looking something sped out from under the table and slid along the floor  as though it had been shot out of a catapult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  It,&rdquo; said the Gopher, unconcernedly. And then they all got up and walked over  to where a new sort of a queer creature, such as Tommy had never seen before,  was getting itself together after its encounter with the Sheep&rsquo;s head. Tommy  took in the peculiar features of the new-comer as carefully and completely as  he had taken in the other unusual events of the day.</p>
<p>It  was an undersized being that walked on two legs, and corresponded somewhat to  the little boy&rsquo;s idea of what a dwarf ought to be, except that Tommy had always  thought of dwarfs as being round and fat, whereas this creature was exceedingly  thin, almost bony, &ldquo;by reason of his constantly playing games,&rdquo; explained the  ex-Pirate. Its head went up almost to a point, on top of which grew a little tuft  of hair, which Tommy at first took to be a small fur cap; and the utter lack of  expression in his pallid face betokened that It had no understanding whatever  beyond his own sphere of utility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  that&rsquo;s why he is willing to be It all the time,&rdquo; thought Tommy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he  does not look as if he knew enough to object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time the Sheep had rejoined the group and was ready to play. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to play any game of chance,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate when the Gopher  asked what it should be,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  we won&rsquo;t have any game of chance,&rdquo; agreed the Sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how you could,&rdquo; ventured Tommy, &ldquo;if It is in the game. It strikes me  that if It is always It, there is no <i>chance</i> for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no chance for him ever. But we  don&rsquo;t consider him. <i>We</i> take all the  chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy  did not understand, but this was nothing new to him, and he consented to play  anything that would please the rest.</p>
<p>They  decided to have a game of Bumpolump, It took the ex-Pirate fully fifteen  minutes to explain to the little boy how Bumpolump was played, and even then  Tommy never got a clear idea of it, and was unable to give his Uncle Dick the  slightest explanation of how it was done, except that It had an inordinate  amount of running about to do, while the others seemed to get all the fun. And  at the end everybody got a prize except It.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should not think you would like this,&rdquo; said Tommy to It, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered It. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten quite beyond that. My life is one long  pursuit of the unattainable. How does it feel to succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I25"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page177.jpg" width="800" height="701"></p>
<p>Tommy,  not knowing just what to say under the circumstances, hesitated; but before he  could reply It continued: </p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see, I always apparently succeed in all I do&mdash;just as in Bumpolump&mdash;but I never  enjoy the fruits of success. The others always get the prizes, and I have to  start all over again. Some day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  just then an Ibex came along, and saying &ldquo;Excuse me&rdquo; to Tommy, he butted It up  to the other end of the room, where a lot of little Ibexes and Zebus  immediately began to hop about, apparently playing some game with It, who was  laboring with his utmost energy. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="CXXII"></a>Chapter XXII<br>
  The Lion&rsquo;s Displeasure</b></h2>
<p>Tommy  stared for some minutes at the antics of the Ibexes, and then turned to the  ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  very odd!&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  assented the other. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you beginning to feel sort of queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t notice any motion at all,&rdquo; replied Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean <i>that</i>,&rdquo; said the ex-Pirate,  looking reproachfully at the little boy. &ldquo;But, personally, I am beginning to  become affected by all these animals. I almost feel as though I could become a  second Abou-Ben-Din.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  second Abou-Ben-Din?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  continued the ex-Pirate, scarcely noticing the interruption. &ldquo;But I hardly  think it would pay. I doubt if there are any other craft hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  are you mumbling about, anyway?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was not mumbling at all. I was thinking of Abou-Ben-Din. <i>There</i> was a pirate for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never heard of Abou-Ben-Din,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read about Captain Kidd and the  Dey of Algiers, and lots of others&mdash;but that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  if you had allowed me to read the first sixteen chapters of my autobiography,&rdquo;  exclaimed the ex-Pirate, becoming somewhat excited, as he always did when the  subject of his autobiography came up, &ldquo;you would have known all about Abou-Ben-Din  by this time. He was a Hindoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  can&rsquo;t you tell me about him now, just as well?&rdquo; pleaded the little boy, anxious  to get another pirate story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  might,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate, meditatively&mdash;&ldquo;I might. It is a favorite story  of mine, but I don&rsquo;t think this is very good company to tell it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  is not it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  before the ex-Pirate could answer, the Lion arose and roared so fiercely that  the rafters shook, and many of the birds fell from their perches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;What does all this skylarking signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not doing anything,&rdquo; put in the Skylark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut  up,&rdquo; continued the Lion, even more fiercely. &ldquo;This banquet has not been  adjourned yet. Why are so many of you standing and running about? Everybody sit  down! I want you to understand that this is a continuous performance&mdash;booked for  forty days and forty nights&mdash;and if some one does not perform pretty soon, I&rsquo;ll  take a hand in the entertainment myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody  knew what that meant. There was only one kind of entertainment that the Lion  knew anything about, and that was eating. He was very good at that, and he cast  his eyes about on the smaller animals gathered at the board. But the warning  was sufficient; there was a grand rush for seats again, and a general  inclination to be entertaining was displayed by all. Tommy and his companions  got their old places, but the Gopher was so frightened that he retained his seat  with difficulty, and he trembled so that he was unable to keep his sun-bonnet  on straight.</p>
<p>In  the meantime the Lion was scowling and waiting for some one to volunteer. No  one appeared inclined to do so. His eyes finally fell on the shaking Gopher,  and he said, grimly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know another joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  poor little animal almost fainted with fright, and for lack of a better  inspiration he pointed at the ex-Pirate and gasped,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> knows<i> lots</i> of things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  so the King of Beasts, who was rapidly losing patience, glared at the ex-Pirate  and roared,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  ex-Pirate hesitated; but Tommy, who was not feeling at all comfortable,  whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give  them Abou-Ben-Din!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a pretty risky thing to do,&rdquo; answered his neighbor; &ldquo;but I guess I shall have  to. I can&rsquo;t think of anything else,&rdquo; And so he arose in his customary way and  bowed to all. The smaller animals appeared very much relieved, and looked gratefully  toward him who had so gallantly come to the rescue at this critical juncture of  the feast.</p>
<p>When  the murmurs of approval had ceased the ex-Pirate announced that he would recite  another selection from his autobiography entitled,</p>
<p align="center">THE BALLAD OF ABOU-BEN-DIN</p>
<p align="center"><i>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s  many a tale that I like to tell,<br>
  And many a yarn to spin,<br>
  But there&rsquo;s none I love one-half so well<br>
  As the story of Abou-Ben-Din.</i></p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;For Abou-Ben-Din was a terrible man,<br>
  A blood-thirsty wretch through and through;<br>
  A pirate on quite an original plan,<br>
  And he captained a terrible crew.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Not a <i>man</i> did he have on his swift-sailing craft,<br>
  But a hundred and ten wild beasts,<br>
  That snarled on the deck while Abou stood aft,<br>
  And steered them toward movable feasts.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;For all day the brutes, with eyes opened wide,<br>
  Would eagerly watch for a sail,<br>
  And as soon as their vessel was brought alongside<br>
  They would swarm like rats o&rsquo;er the rail.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Then after the lions and tigers had dined,<br>
  Old Abou would visit the ship,<br>
  To collect all the booty and goods he could find<br>
  Then drive his beasts back with a whip.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Thus it soon came to pass that the sailors were few<br>
  Who would sail in the India seas,<br>
  Where Abou-Ben-Din and his man-eating crew<br>
  Were eager and ready to seize.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;But <i>I</i> was  no coward, and none of my crew<br>
  Had ever been known to show fear;<br>
  So I said, &lsquo;We will capture this nautical Zoo;<br>
  Toward Abou-Ben-Din let us steer!&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;The men all agreed, and we started that day<br>
  With cheering and waving of caps;<br>
  And down in the hold I had hidden away<br>
  A hundred and fifty steel traps.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;These were brought up on deck as soon as we spied<br>
  Old Abou-Ben-Din and his ship,<br>
  And were set and all covered with sawdust to hide<br>
  The teeth that were ready to grip.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Then the men went below and closed down the hatch.<br>
  While I clambered up on the mast,<br>
  Where, safe from the lions, &lsquo;twas easy to watch<br>
  What happened from first to the last.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Well,  the pirate approached, He came alongside,<br>
  And the beasts all scrambled aboard;<br>
  And I never have heard such cries as they cried,<br>
  Or such terrible roars as they roared.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Each  lion was caught, and he couldn&rsquo;t get free,<br>
  Each trap held an animal fast;<br>
  And the way that they struggled was fearful to see&mdash;<br>
  And I saw it all from the mast.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;But  Abou-Ben-Din merely gazed in dismay,<br>
  And when he knew what had occurred,<br>
  He plunged in the sea, and sank straightaway,<br>
  Without ever speaking a word.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;Aye,  there&rsquo;s many a tale that I like to tell,<br>
  And many a yarn to spin,<br>
  But there&rsquo;s none I love one-half so well<br>
  As the story of Abou-Ben-Din!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a dead silence when the ex-Pirate finished his recital, and Tommy noticed  that the Lions and Tigers were shifting about restlessly in their chairs. He  turned quickly to the Gopher, and said, in low tones,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t seem to like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid it <i>was</i> a trifle personal,&rdquo;  answered the Gopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  we had better retire,&rdquo; suggested the ex-Pirate, prudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  can we go?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  can go to the Dogs,&rdquo; said the Gopher,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not talk like that,&rdquo; observed Tommy, sharply. </p>
<p>He had  heard his Uncle Dick use that expression before, and it shocked him a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; exclaimed the Gopher. &ldquo;The Dogs are all right, even if they are down  below. They might be of some assistance to us if the Lions get ugly,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  exclaimed the little boy; but before he could say any more the Lion coughed  very fiercely, and spoke to the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  many Lions and Tigers did you say there were on board of that ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About  a hundred and ten, I reckon,&rdquo; answered the ex-Pirate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  hundred and ten,&rdquo; repeated the Lion, slowly. &ldquo;And you gathered them all in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  did. Every single one.&rdquo; The ex-Pirate&rsquo;s recklessness staggered Tommy and the  Gopher. Then the Lion growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  being the case, I think I shall have to gather <i>you</i> in.&rdquo; And he arose, followed by the Tigers, and began to  approach the ex-Pirate and the little boy. The Gopher became so alarmed that he  dropped under the table and was never seen again. Tommy was so scared that he  could not move. But the ex-Pirate jumped upon the table, and, drawing both his  pistols from his belt, aimed them at the approaching beasts and fired.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="I26"></a><img src="1600941h-images/page189.jpg" width="627" height="750"></p>
<p>The  flash, the bang, and the smoke caused Tommy to close his eyes tightly for a  second, and he felt as though his heart had leaped into his throat. </p>
<p>When  he opened them again he was sitting on the window-seat in his own room, and his  mother was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not leave the door and the windows open at the same time, Tommy,&rsquo;&rdquo; she was  saying. &ldquo;That causes a draught and makes the door slam. Get ready for supper:  it is nearly tea-time.&rdquo;</p>
