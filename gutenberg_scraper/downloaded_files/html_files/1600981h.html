  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="pubnote"></a>Publisher&rsquo;s Note</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;SYDNEY PAST AND PRESENT&rdquo; was  first published serially in the &ldquo;Town and Country Journal,&rdquo; and the great interest  taken by the public in the subject was shown not only by the large demand for  copies of the paper, but also by the frequent enquiries received by the Editor  as to whether the illustrations and letterpress would be published in book  form. THE NEW SOUTH WALES BOOKSTALL COMPANY aware of this demand, purchased the  book rights of the letterpress and pictures, and the public have now an  opportunity of acquiring in a connected form, this record of the oldest  Australasian city.</p>
  <p>During the first publication of the  articles several letters were received correcting obvious errors of the Press,  and less obvious ones of the author, who has in some cases made alterations in  the text suggested by these letters.</p>
  <p>Some of the illustrations, for  which no good proof of authenticity could be obtained, have been omitted, and  some good views of the Rocks, first published in the &ldquo;Sydney Mail,&rdquo; added by  permission of the proprietors of that newspaper. In the case of some of the  illustrations it is difficult to ascertain the authorship. But to the skilful  pencil of the late Mr. John Rae, Sydney owes a great number of the best  old-time pictures of the City&mdash;between the later thirties and the early fifties.  And many of the blocks in this book have been reproduced from copies of these drawings.  Most of the Modern Sydney pictures came from the studios of Messrs. Kerry &amp;  Co., photographers, George Street, Sydney.</p>
  <p>Of course the ideal book on the  subject should contain complete sets of pictures of the City at different  periods, accompanied by letterpress supplying an accurate description to  correspond with them. But the lack of historical material in a new country,  such as ours, renders this impossible. This book, however, represents what,  after a good deal of search and study among old records, could be found  possible to use in reasonable and convenient form.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter  I<br>
    The Founding of the City</b></h2>
  <p>THE founder of Sydney was Captain Arthur Phillip, who, in 1788,  discovered that Port Jackson, in place of being the mere open bay that Cook,  years earlier, had taken it for, was in reality one of the finest harbors in  the world, with space in its waters for a score of navies; on its shores for as  many cities.</p>
  <p>In 1770 Captain Cook had discovered Botany Bay, and recommended it to  the Government as a good site for a colony. But it was not until eighteen years  later that, wanting a site for a convict settlement, the authorities of the day  bethought themselves of Botany Bay, and sent Captain Arthur Phillip in charge  of eleven ships, since known as the &ldquo;First Fleet,&rdquo; to establish himself on its  shores. But Phillip didn&rsquo;t care about Botany. Water, he said, was scarce, the  soil comparatively poor; and unable to endorse Cook&rsquo;s glowing eulogy, the  captain decided to go further afield and explore the coast to the northward.  This he did in three open boats. More out of curiosity than otherwise, they  turned in between the Heads to have a look at Cook&rsquo;s &ldquo;open bay, in which there  appeared to be good anchorage.&rdquo; And thus was discovered the wonderful harbor  and the site of the future capital of the colony.</p>
  <p>After first landing at Manly Beach (so named because of the courage shown  by the natives), a spot for the settlement was eventually selected on the banks  of a small fresh water stream that fell into a cove on the southern side of the  harbour.</p>
  <p>Soon the whole fleet came round, and brought up in the little bay,  which was promptly named Sydney Cove, in compliment to the secretary of State. &ldquo;In  it,&rdquo; to use Phillips&rsquo; own words, &ldquo;ships can anchor so close to the shore that  at a very small expense quays may be made at which the largest ships may  unload. This cove&hellip; is about a Quarter of a mile across at  the entrance, and half a mile in length.&rdquo; And here did the old Sirius and her  consorts anchor in that space of water, surrounded by the site of what is known  to us now as Circular Quay. Low hills, scrub-grown, ran down to the water&rsquo;s  edge, and represented the position of the future capital of a little more than  a century later, when ocean steamers by the score should line the wharves of  the cove, and the highest developments of science, commerce, and art have combined  to form the great city behind and around it.</p>
  <p>But to return. A space having been cleared in the scrub large enough  the military and the convicts to camp upon, on the 26th day of January a  company came ashore near the spot where, in Macquarie Place, now stands the  Obelisk, the stone from which all the roads in the colony take their distance  and measurement. The national flag was hoisted, the marines saluted and fired  three volleys, and the Governor, surrounded by his officers, proposed the  healths of &ldquo;The King and the Royal Family&rdquo; and &ldquo;Success to the New Colony.&rdquo;  Later, on the 7th of February, there took place another ceremony no less  impressive, when the colonists, numbering 1030, were all assembled, the  convicts seated in a half circle, the marines paraded in front of them, and the  officers grouped in the centre. Then Collins, the Judge Advocate, read the  Governor&rsquo;s commission, and the commission of the other officers, also the Act  establishing the colony, and other formal documents. Then the marines fired  three volleys, and the first Governor of New South Wales, after thanking his  officers and soldiers for their behaviour so far, addressed the convicts,  promising rewards to those who conducted themselves well; unsparing severity to  offenders. After his speech the colonists dispersed, whilst Phillip and his  principal officers partook of a cold repast already laid out in a marquee.  During the proceedings, at intervals, the band played, and after the commissions  were read, &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo; was performed.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page009a.png" width="800" height="550"></p>
  <p>And thus was consummated the founding of the colony. The residence of  the Governor, what he quaintly calls his &ldquo;Canvas House,&rdquo; and the tents of the  officers, were pitched on the east side of the little creek (presently known as  the Tank Stream), with the flag staff reared in front of them, and close to  were planted the various fruit trees procured at Rio Janeiro and the Cape of  Good Hope.</p>
  <p>The marines and the convicts in their charge were housed in huts on the  west side of the cove. Phillip writes to his patron, Lord Sydney: &ldquo;I have the  honor to enclose your Lordship the intended plan for the town. The  Lieutenant-Governor has already begun a small house, which forms one corner of  the parade, and I am building a small cottage on the east side of the cove,  where I shall remain for the present with part of the convicts and an officer&rsquo;s  guard. The convicts are distributed in huts, which are built only for immediate  shelter. On the point of land (now Dawes Point) which forms the west side of  the cove, an observatory is building, under the direction of Lieutenant Dawes,  who is charged by the Board of Longitude with observing the expected comet. We  now make very good bricks, and the stone is good, but do not find either lime  stone or chalk&hellip; The principal streets are placed so as to admit a free  circulation of air, and are 200ft. wide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page009b.jpg" width="800" height="555"></p>
  <p>And in such wise was the founding of the city of Sydney. Unfortunately,  succeeding Governors altered those wisely-laid out streets of Phillip&rsquo;s, with  the result of giving us the miserable lanes of the present day. All this,  however, was the work of much time and labour, and for long only the principal  officers could boast of being lodged in wooden huts; for the rest, it was still  canvas. The hard gum timber blunted and broke the shoddy tools of the workmen,  who, in addition, were anything but mechanics. Also, there were continual  complications and troubles to retard the progress of the infant colony and its  capital. Phillip writes: &ldquo;I am very sorry to say that not only a great part of  the clothing, particularly the women&rsquo;s, is very bad, but most of the axes,  spades, and shovels, the worst that ever were seen. The provision is as good.  Of the seeds and corn sent from England part has been destroyed by the weevil;  the rest is in good order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Most pathetic and forlorn must have appeared to us, could we of this  latter day have seen it then, the little settlement on the shores of the Cove,  with its few scattered buildings, most of them &ldquo;formed of rough boards nailed  to a few upright posts shabbily covered with bark,&rdquo; and situated mainly on the  hill lying to the north-west of the Cove. Stumps of trees studded the hardly  indicated streets; no wharves, even of the rudest description, had yet been  formed; except around the mouth of the Tank Stream the scrub grew thick to the  water&rsquo;s edge, and loomed grey and monotonous on every inland hill, on every  harbor headland. And to those of us who, passing to and fro the Cove of to-day,  and threading the busy streets of the great city behind it, ever cast a thought  to the scene it must have presented in those early months, years, even, the  whole thing should appear little less than a miracle.</p>
  <p>But, despite all hardships, trials, and sufferings, the stout heart of  the brave founder never failed him, his patience, nor his absolute faith ever  wavered. He, however, was the sole exception. Let us see, for instance, what  the Lieutenant-Governor, Ross, has to say about the business. Writing to  Under-Secretary Nepean, he wails:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, there is not a man in this place (he should have  excepted his superior) but wishes to return home, and indeed they have no less  than cause, for, I believe, there never was a set of people so much upon the  parrish as this garrison is, and what little we want, even to a single nail, we  must not send to the Commissary for it, but must apply to his Excellency for  it; and when we do he alwayes sayes there is but little come out, and it is but  little we get&hellip; If you want a true description of the country, it is only  to be found amongst many of the private letters sent home; however, I will, in  confidence, venture to assure you that this country will never answer to settle  in, for, although I think corn will grow here, yet I am convinced that if ever  it is able to maintain the people here, it cannot be in less time than probably  a hundred years hence. I, therefore, think it will be cheaper to feed the  convicts on turtle and venison at the London Tavern than be at the expense of  sending them here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was written only six months after landing. And early though this  was to show the white feather, the dreariness of the outlook and the weary  hopelessness of the life might have excused a much stronger man than Ross was  for weakening under the strain. There, however, can be no excuse for his  incessant grumbling, and attempt to put every possible obstacle in the Governor&rsquo;s  way, instead of doing what he could to help him through his many and constant  troubles.</p>
  <p>As time passed, bricks were made, stones hewn, timber shaped, and  houses built, in spite of difficulties which had at first sight appeared almost  insurmountable. The winter rains made matters terribly uncomfortable for both  bond and free; but the hardships thus engendered acted as a spur to them to  provide efficient shelter from the elements.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page010b.png" width="800" height="549"></p>
  <p>Thus, in the winter of 1788. we find the settlers busily employed in  carrying out the details of Phillip&rsquo;s plan, long since dispatched to Lord Sydney.  Barracks for marines were erected; houses for the Governor and the  Lieutenant-Governor; the hospital was roofed with shingles, and the Observatory  begun at the future Dawes Point. This last building, however, was scarcely  finished before it was found to be too small, not only for its principal  object, but to accommodate the lieutenant&rsquo;s family. So the masons and other  workmen set about building another Observatory in the same spot. On the other  hand, the barracks, when finished, proved far too large for the military alone,  and, therefore, was partially used as a store. The greatest inconvenience was  felt throughout these operations for lack of men with any practical knowledge  of building and the other trades necessary to make any progress with the  erection of the city.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page010a.jpg" width="800" height="483"></p>
  <p>In October, 1789, came about a rather momentous event, no less than the  launching of the first boat built in the colony. This craft was intended for  the transport of stores from the newly-formed farm at Rose Hill, close to where  Parramatta now stands. The boat was a huge and unwieldy specimen of the builder&rsquo;s  art. The convicts called it satirically the &ldquo;Rose Hill Packet.&rdquo; Then, learning  by much hard experience how difficult it was to shift her, they altered that  fancy name to the more appropriate one of &ldquo;The Lump.&rdquo; A magazine was about this  time erected near the Observatory, and a house built for the Judge Advocate.  The roadways&mdash;bogs in wet weather, and dust-heaps in dry, were made a little  more passable towards Christmas time. Also a guard-house was built on the east  side of the cove, close to the bridge, that had been thrown over the Tank  Stream.</p>
  <p>In the beginning of 1790 a flagstaff was erected at the South Head, by  means of which the arrival of ships could be signalled to the infant Sydney.  And from there during the terrible year of &lsquo;90 many anxious eyes swept the  desolate ocean for signs of that relief so eagerly expected. Food was giving  out and necessaries of every description, and famine stared the embryo colony  in the face. For nearly two years the colonists had been isolated. Apparently  the Home Government had forgotten their very existence, notwithstanding many  appeals from Phillip. And but for that same Phillip it is quite possible that  not only would there be no Sydney to-day, but that Australia would be under  French or Dutch rule instead of British. If Ross, for instance, had been in  Phillip&rsquo;s place the chances are twenty to one that on his lachrymose  representations all attempt at colonisation would have been abandoned. But,  fortunately for us, and for England, too, Phillip, the naval sea-captain, was  the man of all men fitted for the occasion.</p>
  <p>Famine was upon him and his charges, and night and day the seamen of  the Sirius kept watch at the new flagstaff in hopes of being able to signal to the  town the approach of those supply-ships that everybody believed with the most  implicit faith must be long ere this well on their way from England.</p>
  <p>But the events of this memorable year of 1790 are history, and Sydney,  owing to disease and famine, grew little or nothing in size during it.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page011a.jpg" width="800" height="592"></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page011b.jpg" width="800" height="533"></p>
  <p>A fresh storehouse was finished, and a landing place formed at the head  of the Cove; and, the bad year once passed, the young settlement seems to have  steadily, if slowly, grown and spread, first along the foreshores and the  course of the Tank Stream, until, cradled though it had been in despair and  famine, and handicapped by the quality of its inhabitants, it presently began  to be apparent to everyone that there was forming on the shores of the cove the  nucleus of a city. In 1792 Phillip left the colony and went home to England,  more secure than ever in the belief, which, indeed, had never deserted him,  that the prosperity of the settlement was thoroughly assured.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page012a.jpg" width="800" height="499"></p>
  <p>One incident of &lsquo;91 should be noted, in that the first convict settler,  who had made a declaration that he was able to support himself on a farm he had  occupied for fifteen months, received a grant of 140 acres of land. At the  present day many of our settlers would be only too proud to be able to declare  a similar fact.</p>
  <p>In 1792 flour was 9d. per lb.; potatoes were 3d. per lb. A sheep cost  &pound;10 10s; a milch goat, &pound;8 8s; breeding sows, each &pound;7 7s to &pound;10 10s; laying  fowls, 10s. By these figures it may be seen what terrific value was attached to  live stock of any description in these early days.</p>
  <p>Tea was a luxury, indeed, at 8s to 16s per lb. Sugar was comparatively  cheap at 1s 6d per lb. Spirits at 12s to 20s per gallon were cheaper than at  present, and porter at 1s per quart was within the reach of most people. At this  time, and for a score of years afterwards, it must be remembered that spirits,  chiefly rum, were the ordinary currency of the colony. When Hunter arrived, in  1795, the whole population, with the exception of 179, was dependent on the  public stores for rations.</p>
  <p>Briefly, the events of his five years&rsquo; term embraced the first use of  the printing press, the discovery of the lost herd of cattle, and the forming  of the settlement of Newcastle, on the Hunter River.</p>
  <p>So far as Sydney itself was concerned, the only building of importance  seems to have been that of the first school. Here 300 children were taught,  and, after service each Sunday, catechised by the Rev. Mr. Johnson. Various  windmills, too, were erected to grind the settlers&rsquo; corn. This was done gratuitously  by the government. In 1800 Captain Hunter was superseded by Captain King.</p>
  <p>During the latter&rsquo;s term the Female Orphan School, of which more anon, was  founded; the first issue of copper coin took place. A notable incident was the  establishment by a prisoner, Geo. Howe, of the first Australian newspaper,  known as the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser.&rsquo;&rsquo; This was in  1803, and original files of this ancient newspaper are now so scarce as to be  very valuable. The editorial address accompanying the first issue runs:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innumerable as the obstacles were which threatened to oppose our  Undertaking, yet we are happy to affirm that they are not unsurmountable,  however difficult the task before us. The utility of a paper in the colony, as  it must open a source of solid information will we hope be universally felt and  acknowledged. We have courted the assistance of the Ingenious and Intelligent.  We open no channel to Political discussion or Personal Animadversion.  Information is our only purpose; that accomplished, we shall consider that we  have done our duty in exertion to merit the Approbation of the Public and so  secure a liberal patronage to the &lsquo;Sydney Gazette.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter  II<br>
    Weakly Infancy</b></h2>
  <p>FOR many years Sydney does not appear to have made much headway. Even  in 1816-17 Woolloomooloo was a dense scrub, in which it was very easy to get  bushed, whilst tea (sometimes wrongly called ti) tree grew freely throughout  the city in streets and open places. Thatched houses and mud huts formed the  majority of the buildings. Where the Town Hall now stands was a public  cemetery, although not the earliest, for a burying-ground had been earlier made  further north; the Cathedral grounds of to-day were a favourite camp for  drovers and cattle dealers; and everywhere roamed the aborigine.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page012b.jpg" width="800" height="621"></p>
  <p>George-street (named after the reigning monarch) started from Dawes  Point, and ran along the western side of the Cove. The only public wharf was  that already referred to, and known as King&rsquo;s. There, all the merchandise of  the colony was landed. Near the wharf, the now almost neglected Tank Stream  flowed into the Cove. Houses were scarce and scattered. Where the Mariners&rsquo;  Church stands there was one of the few weatherboard cottages. On the other side  of the Cove were situated the Government boatsheds.</p>
  <p>The roads were still mere bush tracks of dust or mud, according to the  weather. For some inscrutable reason other, an orphanage had been built at the  corner of Bridge-street. Apparently the authorities expected a prolific crop of  orphans. These, however, proved so scarce that in a few years the building was  abandoned, and the land subdivided, and sold. Out of this re-arrangement Queen&rsquo;s  Place was formed. There was a bank&mdash;the Australia&mdash;at the corner of George and  Essex streets. And here took place the first Australian bank robbery. The  thieves tunnelled from a drain in an adjacent paddock until they reached the  strong room, and, forcing that, got away in safety with much plunder.</p>

  <p>Where the Bank of Australia now stands were the Government stores, whence  rations were served out to the convicts. Across Bridge-street the Tank Stream  flowed sluggishly, spanned by its thick-set bridge of a pattern seen over  country brooks in England. The origin of the word &ldquo;Tank&rdquo; may not be generally  known. It seems that a butcher at that time had his shop in Hunter-street, and  his land extended back to the stream. On one side of his property were a number  of excavations, or tanks, cut out of the solid rock, and in these the soldier&rsquo;s  wives washed clothes. Other accounts, however, say that out of these &ldquo;tanks&rdquo;  the town derived its water supply. The two stories, even in those days, could  hardly be compatible. Probably the latter is correct.</p>
  <p>On the site of our present General Post Office stood a small house in a  fruit garden, whilst near by was a clump of detached cottages and some  fenced-in paddocks. At the corner of George and Barrack streets was in 1817, a  cow-yard, which fronted George-street for a considerable distance. In the  cottage next to the milkman&rsquo;s lived a turner, and next him stood a three-roomed  public-house.</p>

  <p>The above is a facsimile of the copper plate which was discovered in  March, 1899, when excavating a telephone tunnel near the corner of Philip and  Bridge streets. Collins, the contemporary historian of the First Fleet,  describes the laying of the foundation of the first Government House, and  relates how this plate was then deposited. Collins prints the inscription,  which last year saw the light for the first time for 111 years.</p>
  <p>The site of the old markets was enclosed by a strong four-railed fence,  and here were a number of sheds for the display of produce brought in by the  settlers. North of the market stood a wooden pillory, large enough to hold a  couple of offenders. Prisoners sentenced to floggings were brought to this  place, tied to a cart-tail, and publicly whipped in view of the crowd of  marketing women.</p>
  <p>On the site of the present Cathedral, in a &ldquo;wattle and daub&rdquo; cottage, lived  a drover. In this cottage he was one day found dead, and, dying intestate, the property&mdash;thought  little of at the time&mdash;reverted to the Crown, and eventually was secured by the  Church of England authorities, to whom Governor Macquarie made a grant of it.  Later, he laid the foundation stone of the present Cathedral. As one stocks  would not suffice, there were, in conspicuous places about the city, four more.</p>
  <p>As long before as 1796, Sydney&rsquo;s first theatre had been opened.  Certainly it could not have been much of a building, costing, as it did, only  &pound;100. The first play performed in it was Dr. Young&rsquo;s tragedy, &ldquo;The Revenge,&rdquo; a  piece long since dead and forgotten, but which, in the latter part of the 17th  century, had no small reputation as a public favourite. But it is the prologue  of the old play that, first mouthed in the first Australian theatre, made the  occasion so memorable, and for ever rescued from oblivion the title, at least,  of Young&rsquo;s play. And although the passage alluded to above is one of the stock  quotations of the language, it may not be out of place to here give the four famous  opening lines&mdash;</p>
  <p class="verse">&ldquo;From distant climes, o&rsquo;er widespread seas we come,<br>
    Though not with much eclat or beat of drum<br>
    True patriots we, for, be it understood,<br>
We left our country for our country&rsquo;s good&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tariff of admission was not extravagant, or does not seem so to us,  seeing that a seat in the gallery, the fashionable part of the house in those  days cost only one shilling cash, or its equivalent in spirits, flour, meat, or  other necessaries. This, however, so it is said, was not actually the first  entertainment of its kind in the colony, inasmuch as a performance of Farquhar&rsquo;s  &ldquo;The Recruiting Office,&rdquo; has been traced back to June 4, 1789&mdash;the birthday of  George III.&mdash;&ldquo;on which date some prisoners were graciously permitted to show  their loyalty to their Sovereign by acting this play&rdquo;&mdash;The 1796 theatre came to  a bad ending. Whether truly or not, it was said that owing to its establishment  crime increased to such an extent that the Governor ordered it to be pulled  down; and for some years Thespian entertainments were not heard of except as  private indulgences. Authorities are divided as to the authorship of the  prologue, although it has been generally attributed to the notorious convict,  George Barrington. This claim is, however, strongly contested by the late Mr.  Samuel Bennett, in his valuable work, &ldquo;The History of New South Wales,&rdquo; in  which the author considers it highly probable that the lines were written by  Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, and that the fathering them upon Barrington was  merely by way of joke. Be this as it may, the prologue, apart from the single  verse given, is an extremely clever bit of work, teeming with sly allusions to  the former proclivities of the actors.</p>
  <p>The open Haymarket space of to-day was in these years, 1817-20,  occupied by the Government brickyards. Hence the Brickfield Hill of our own  time. In the meantime, the site of the present Town Hall had been occupied by a  public pound, which, when the ground was presently required for other purposes,  was removed to that upon which the brick fields stood. Also, upon the  Haymarket, was situated the first toll-bar. A paddock extended from here right  through to Hay-street, whilst a creek ran out into a large pond, that took up most  of Ultimo. It was known as Dickson&rsquo;s Pond, and was a common resort of the  citizens when they felt like going for an afternoon&rsquo;s duck shooting.</p>
  <p>There were few other streets, and these mostly nameless, besides the  ones already mentioned. Bush tracks, to be made into thoroughfares later on,  abounded. Before Governor Macquarie appeared on the scene, there were indeed no  &ldquo;streets.&rdquo; The sparsely built upon and straggling ways were known as &ldquo;rows.&rdquo; But  in Macquarie&rsquo;s time these were altered. Thus &ldquo;Pitt&rsquo;s Row&rdquo; became Pitt-street. &ldquo;Soldiers&rsquo;  Row&rdquo; Park-street, &ldquo;Back Soldiers&rsquo; Row&rdquo; Kent-street, etc. Market-street was  merely a boggy lane; Woolloomooloo a farm, and Hyde Park a racecourse. Tribes  of blacks roamed about Botany, North Shore, and Manly, and camped around and in  the infant city itself.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page014a.jpg" width="800" height="535"></p>
  <p>The Botanic Gardens, Farm Cove, and most of the bay shores and  headlands were all primitive bush. On the banks of the little creek in the  Gardens, then a sparkling stream, now a sluggish pond, bridged, and with its  course obstructed, was a favourite corroboree-ground of the natives. The present  University grounds were known as Grose&rsquo;s Farm; but the other suburbs, Newtown,  Marrickville, Leichhardt, Glebe and Forest Lodge, were all thick bush, with,  perhaps, here and there, the small cleared patch of some enterprising settler.</p>
  <p>The barracks lay between George, Clarence, Margaret, and Barrack  streets, and are remarkable only as the scene of the first step towards Bligh&rsquo;s  deposition by Major Johnson, and the New South Wales Corps of notorious memory:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The drums beat to arms; the New South Wales Corps&mdash;most of them men  primed with rum&mdash;formed in the barrack square, and with fixed bayonets, colours  flying, and band playing, marched to Government House, led by Johnson. The  Government House guard waited to prime and load, then joined their drunken  comrades, and the house was surrounded.&rdquo; The rest is matter of common history.</p>
  <p>Prominence has purposely been given to the foregoing picture of Sydney,  in order, if possible, to place before the reader some idea of what changes had  taken place since Phillip left it&mdash;practically a city of great distances, and  but little else. In 1809 Macquarie had arrived, and, as we have seen, took to  the work of improving and extending Sydney with a ready and willing mind. Grose  and Hunter had done little in this way, lacking opportunity and time. The  former was only in office two years; and Hunter had his hands too full with the  squabblings of the New South Wales Corps to admit of leisure for much else.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page014b.jpg" width="800" height="496"></p>
  <p>His term of office though, was notable for one happening, i.e., the  first civil action of any magnitude was tried in Sydney The facts are worth  stating:&mdash;&ldquo;A soldier of the New South Wales Corps shot a hog, belonging to a Mr.  Boston, for trespass. The owner of the hog used abusive language to the  soldier. At the instance, so Boston alleged, of two of his officers, the  soldier beat him with a musket. For this Boston claimed &pound;500 damages. The trial  lasted two days, and the court (a military one) gave a verdict against two of  the defendants, with damages 20s each. The Governor, on appeal, confirmed the  verdict. Thus, as a contemporary writer gleefully observes, &ldquo;Though it was  sought to make the Government a sort of military despotism, yet the seeds of  civil freedom were sown, and would, in due season, bud and blossom,&rdquo; a  prediction, as we who now read, can amply testify, thoroughly borne out. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page015.jpg" width="800" height="564"></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page016.jpg" width="800" height="565"></p>
  <p>Let us see, now what Macquarie thought of his charge. He writes in his first  dispatch:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I found the colony barely emerging from infantile imbecility, suffering  from various privations and disabilities; the country impenetrable beyond forty  miles from Sydney; agriculture in a yet languishing state; commerce in its  early dawn; revenue unknown; threatened with famine, distracted by faction; the  public buildings in a state of dilapidation; the few roads and bridges almost  impassable; the population in general depressed by poverty; no credit, public,  or private; the morals of the great mass of the population in the lowest state  of debasement, and religious worship almost entirely neglected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Truly a terrible indictment this to draw up against any people! And  though it was, probably, in great measure true, there is all the more credit  due to our ancestors for having survived such a state of things, and made us  what we are.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page017a.jpg" width="800" height="500"></p>
  <p>Nor must it be imagined that, for all the pessimistic declaration just quoted,  the lieges were entirely without their pleasures and recreations. There was,  for instance, racing in Hyde Park, lasting three days, and conducted after the  Newmarket fashion, followed by an ordinary and two balls. The principal prize  was a &ldquo;Lady&rsquo;s Cup,&rdquo; presented to the winner by Mrs. Macquarie. &ldquo;The  subscribers&rsquo; ball,&rdquo; says &ldquo;The New South Wales Gazette,&rdquo; &ldquo;took place on Tuesday  and Thursday night, and was honored by the presence of his Excellency the  Governor and his lady, his honor the Lieutenant-Governor and his lady, the  Judge Advocate and lady, the magistrates and other officers, civil and  military, and all the beauty and fashion of the colony&hellip; A supper followed the  ball&hellip; After the cloth was removed the rosy deity asserted his pre-eminence, and  with the zealous aid of Momus and Apollo, chased pale Cynthia down into the  Western World; the blazing orb of day announced his near approach, and the God  of the chariot reluctantly forsook his company. Bacchus dropped his head; Momus  could no longer animate.&rdquo; All of which, put in modern phrase, means simply a  very wet night indeed, and no one with much less than three bottles under his  belt at daylight.</p>
  <p>In the earlier days of the colony Divine service was performed in the  open air, soon after sunrise, and under the most shady trees procurable. In  1793, a temporary church had been built at the back of the huts on the eastern  side of the Cove, near the corner of what are now Hunter and Castlereagh  streets. It was erected at the sole expense of the Rev. Mr. Johnson, already  mentioned, of strong posts, wattles, and plaster, and thus enjoyed the  distinction of being the first Christian Church in Australasia. In 1798 it was  burnt down. Then the brick store built in the premier year of the colony was  utilised as a church. The same store, which appears to have been the very first  house in the colony worthy of the name, stood a little behind the site of the  present Bank of Australasia.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page017b.jpg" width="800" height="466"></p>
  <p>The first part of old St. Phillips&rsquo; (since replaced by the present fine  Gothic structure) to be built was the clock-tower. This was finished in 1797;  but in 1806 it fell down. Formerly of brick, it was rebuilt of stone the same  year. The church itself was begun in 1800; but not until nine years later did  the Rev. W. Cooper officiate therein for the first time. It was finished about  a year afterwards, and a handsome altar service of solid silver was presented  to it by his Majesty King George III. St. Phillip&rsquo;s was consecrated by the Rev.  Samuel Marsden, a gentleman of varied attainments and pursuits. On the last  Sunday in December, 1809, Lachlan Macquarie, not long landed, attended service  at the new church.</p>
  <p>Marsden, of whom the early chronicles have much to say, was, in  addition to a clergyman, a magistrate, landowner, and stockbreeder. Thus in the  very next number of the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; to the one announcing the consecration of St.  Phillip&rsquo;s, appears his name in conjunction with two other settlers, offering a  reward of &pound;1 sterling, or a gallon of spirits, for all skins of native dogs.</p>
  <p>And now, 90 years later, we are still offering from &pound;1 to &pound;5 for dingo  scalps!</p>

  <p>With the advent of Macquarie, Sydney began to shufle off something of  the squalor and dinginess of those earlier days at which we have glanced. We  have seen Phillip living in his four-roomed tent; then, later, in the hut  dignified by the name of &ldquo;Government House,&rdquo; and surrounded by tenements, to  which even it was a palace; we have seen the little settlement born in much  travail to the accompaniments of hunger and hardships of every description, and  the clanking of chains; the miseries alike of bond and free throughout the  desperate struggle for existence during years that might well have depressed  the stoutest hearts, dismayed the most sanguine souls. Then came the twelve  years of Macquarie&rsquo;s blended rule of despotism and benevolence; clear views and  narrow, stubborn ones. You have read his first dispatch sent home when the  first appalling impression of Sydney and its surroundings were hot upon him.  Now read what posterity has to say of him:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He found New South Wales a gaol, and he left it a colony; he found  Sydney a village, and he left it a city; he found a population of idle  prisoners, paupers, and paid officials, and he left a large, free community,  thriving in the produce of flocks and the labour of convicts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Macquarie&rsquo;s work as a builder there will be much occasion to refer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter  III<br>
  The Harbor&mdash;Macquarie's Buildings </b></h2>
  <p>FINE a harbour as Port Jackson was, the early days, as may be supposed  saw few opportunities for the use of it as such. The comings and goings of  ships were confined to those of a few transports with convicts, and of  provision vessels at long intervals from England or the Cape. Later, trade was  opened with the East Indies and with the United States.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page019a.jpg" width="777" height="650"></p>
  <p>Passages were of great length. For instance, one ship, the Ceres, took  nearly six months to come out. A curious incident happened on the trip.  Touching at Amsterdam Island she took off four men, two English and two French,  who had apparently been marooned from a brig called the Emilia. For no less  three years had these unfortunates lived in that desolate spot, subsisting  mostly on seal flesh. About 1794 a little trade with India begins; for we read that  &ldquo;the snow Experiment, from Bengal, and the sloop Otto, from North America, anchored  in the Cove&rdquo;&mdash;the last named five months and three days out from Boston. Trust  Jonathan to discover a chance for trade, no matter how distant the scene of  operations! His notions, too, we may be very sure were welcome enough to the  citizens, and his bargains profitable to himself.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page019b.jpg" width="800" height="607"></p>
  <p>As time passed, however, the duties of the signalman at South Head  became less and less of a sinecure, and on occasions there was almost what  might be called a rush of ships. Many of these oversea arrivals had curious  stories to relate, some of the weather, others of their cargoes. Amongst the  last Mr. Michael Hogan, who brought &ldquo;the Marquis Cornwallis from Ireland, with  233 male and female convicts of that country,&rdquo; seems to have had a very rough  experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; says the report, &ldquo;from Mr. Hogan that there had been a  conspiracy to take the ship from him. This was, however, happily defeated.  Nevertheless, the commander felt it his duty to punish many of the ringleaders  very severely; in fact, when they arrived in Sydney they were carried from the  ship to the hospital.&rdquo; That is all. But reading between the lines one can  imagine unpleasant things.</p>
  <p>Emboldened, perhaps, by the cruise of the Experiment, a sister snow,  the Susan, presently arrived&mdash;231 days from Rhode Island. She took her time, and  touched nowhere. She was laden with spirits, broadcloth, and a variety of  useful articles. A desperately long and lonely journey for a small vessel of,  likely enough, not 300 tons.</p>
  <p>One vessel, the Britannia in these years&mdash;1794-1798&mdash;is constantly  mentioned as bringing stores and live stock to the infant colony from Calcutta,  Madras, and Capetown. Perhaps she may be looked upon as entitled to the  distinction of the first &ldquo;regular trader&rdquo; to Sydney.</p>
  <p>Of course we had nothing much to export, as yet. Nor was our first  shipment, when we did imagine we had found something worth sending away, much  of a success. Somebody, it appears, had made a big lot of grindstones out of  the coarser sort of freestone. These were sent to the Isle of France, and  deposited there with an agent for disposal. But one morning a slave, rushing  into his master&rsquo;s room, exclaimed, &ldquo;Massa, massa, oh my gad, grindstone all run  away!&rdquo; It had rained in tropical fashion during the night, and demolished the  stack of Australian grindstones, floating some of them out of the yard, and  about the streets, and washing the more porous ones into mere sand. This story  is, however, probably apocryphal.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page020a.jpg" width="800" height="498"></p>
  <p>But although these sporadic exits and entrances of wandering ships made  Sydney, even in those far-off days, a port, journalistic recognition of the  fact did not come until the printing of the first newspaper, in 1803. In it&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given that the ship Castle of Good Hope will  positively sail for India on Sunday, the 13th current; and Captain M&rsquo;Askell  requests that all claims may be given in to him by the 10th.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then again, the editor, to make the most of his one ship, expatiates as  follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Castle of Good Hope is the largest ship that has ever entered this  port, and measures about 1000 tons. During the passage she lost twelve cows and  one horse, fell in with no other vessel, and met with no accident. Her passing  through Bass&rsquo;s Straits instead of going round Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land considerably  shortened her passage, and saved many cows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a day or two, however, the paper is enabled to chronicle the arrival  of a &ldquo;whaler, the Greenwich, with 1700 tons of spermaceti oil, procured mostly  off the north-east coast of New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And ever as the months pass, so does &ldquo;ship news&rdquo; require more space for  both deep-sea and coasting&mdash;the last under the title &ldquo;Boats.&rdquo; &ldquo;Came in from the  Hawkesbury on Saturday last, the 19th instant, the William and Mary, W. Miller,  owner, laden with wheat,&rdquo; and so on, and so on. Deep-sea ships lay at anchor in  the Cove, the small fry came up to the &ldquo;Sydney Wharf.&rdquo; &ldquo;On Sunday morning last  came five boats from Kissing Point with fruit, poultry, vegetables, and  potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whalers seem to have put in pretty regularly to refit and re-victual;  heaving down on some soft spot on the shores of the Cove for caulking of seams  and patching of copper after the long cruise. In the thirties, whaling became a  very flourishing industry indeed, attracting many men and ships from England and  Scotland. But we shall have occasion to glance now and again at the state of  the port during the progress of this chronicle.</p>
  <p>On February 15, 1811, the second year of the reign of Macquarie, was  born the first Australian by an Australian mother. His name was Arthur Devlin, his  birthplace Liverpool, on the banks of George&rsquo;s River in the County of  Cumberland, New South Wales. His subsequent career is of interest from his  having been one of the first whaleboat&rsquo;s crew which claimed the championship of  the colony. His companions were James and George Chapman, William Howard,  Andrew Melville, and George Mulhall. The first race took place in 1830, and was  from Dawes&rsquo; Battery round Shark Island, and back to the starting place. At that  time the port was full of whalers, and competition was therefore keen. But these  six young Australians, all standing over six feet, were too much for any of the  other boats, and won easily.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page020b.jpg" width="800" height="541"></p>
  <p>Early in 1895 a contractor working on a piece of vacant ground in North  Sydney, used as a market garden twenty years ago, unearthed three tombstones.  And to these stones hangs a story that is part of the story of our city, and  must be here briefly told.</p>
  <p>The inscriptions, then, on these tombstones commemorated the deaths of  the surgeon, the chief officer, and the master of the ship Surrey, all of whom  died on the ship&rsquo;s first passage to Sydney&mdash;a very terrible one, indeed. Early  in the month of July, 1814, the ship Brexhornebury, while off Shoalhaven, fell  in with a big vessel lying-to, her sails in confusion, and signals of distress  flying. She proved to be the Surrey, transport, from Spithead, with 200 male  and 139 female convicts on board. There was also a detachment of 25 soldiers.  Contagious fever had broken out on board, not only among the convicts, but also  among the officers and crew. The captain informed the master of the  Brexhornebury that 28 of the male convicts, two soldiers, the chief officer,  and two seamen had died; that he and the remainder of his officers and crew  were still suffering; and he implored help to take his fever-stricken ship into  Port Jackson.</p>
  <p>Naturally there was no disposition to eagerly board the Surrey, and the  boat&rsquo;s crew lay on their oars, and doubtfully surveyed the floating pesthouse  and the scared and disease-marked faces that peered wistfully over her  bulwarks.</p>
  <p>At length a man, turning to the captain of the Brexhornebury, said, &ldquo;I  can navigate. I&rsquo;ll go on board and take her in.&rdquo; This unknown hero did so, and  brought the Surrey to Sydney with her captain, Paterson, dying, and the other  officer little better. Most unfortunately, there is no mention of that man&rsquo;s  name. It was worthy of mention.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page021a.jpg" width="800" height="624"></p>
  <p>The Surrey got into port on July 27, and was anchored in a convenient  position &ldquo;near the North Shore.&rdquo; But not until April 31 was the camp, in which  her people had lived in tents, broken up, and the ship brought round to the Cove.</p>
  <p>This old &ldquo;Surrey&rdquo; or, as the early records call her, the &ldquo;Surry,&rdquo; was  one of the oldest traders, or, rather, transports, to Sydney, making between  1814 and 1840, no less than eighteen voyages; and she must have been almost  identified with and looked upon by the citizens as part of their history. The  tombstones, it may be mentioned did not distinguish the site of the burial, but  were merely memorials placed there by sorrowing friends and shipmates at a much  later period.</p>
  <p>Of interest, as showing at what an early age men in those days reached  positions of sea-responsibility, it is recorded that Captain Paterson and  Surgeon Brooks were only 24 years old; while Chief Officer Crawford was but 28.  Where the last resting places of the captain and the surgeon were really  situated there seems no evidence. The chief officer was probably buried at sea.</p>
  <p>During the twelve years of Macquarie&rsquo;s rule he made roads, erected public  buildings, and constantly travelled about the colony, distributing grants to  deserving settlers, planning townships, and pardoning industrious prisoners.  Fifteen months after the discovery of the long-sought-for-passage across the  Blue Mountains by Wentworth, Lawson, and Blaxland, the Governor had, by placing  nearly every convict in the colony at the work, formed a good road to the  western plains. And along this he presently, accompanied by his wife and suite,  journeyed, and founded the town of Bathurst.</p>
  <p>But Sydney was the chief centre of this indefatigable man&rsquo;s exertions.  And he did nothing by halves. For instance, seeing that the old markets, close  to the wharf, were most unsuitable for the purpose, he issued a proclamation  that he intended to at once remove them to &ldquo;that piece of open ground, part of  which was lately used by Messrs. Blaxland as a stockyard, bounded by  George-street on the east, York-street on the west, Market-street on the north,  and the burying-ground on the south, and, henceforth, to be called Market  Square.&rdquo; If the shade of Macquarie ever revisits Sydney, what, one wonders,  does it think of the great pile that now stands on part of the same ground?  Does it envy the questionable achievement, and feel regret at not having been  able to stand sponsor for yet another &ldquo;Macquarie&rdquo; effort; for he, too, often  built well but not wisely.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page021b.jpg" width="800" height="640"></p>
  <p>Presently he erected a wharf at Cockle Bay (now Darling Harbor) for the  reception of sea-borne goods, and, more particularly, grain and corn. And there  have been wharves on that spot ever since for that especial purpose. He it was,  too, who built a market house &ldquo;surrounded by a cupola and lantern, and with a  front portico supported by Grecian pillars.&rdquo; Many of us remember this imposing  structure as the late Central Police Court, dingy, dirty, and quite unfitted  for such business. But in those days it was deemed a really superb building.</p>
  <p>Years ago, in the time of Governor Hunter, a half-moon battery had been  erected by the ship&rsquo;s company of the Supply, and armed with some of the tender&rsquo;s  guns. This promontory was then called Point Bennilong, from the fact that, on  the site of the battery now known to us as Fort Macquarie, Governor Phillip had  built a house for Bennilong, the native who accompanied him to England, and  afterwards returned with Hunter. In a plan of Sydney presented by the Hon. P.  G. King to the Legislative Council, dated 1820, Fort Macquarie is shown, but  mentioned as carrying sixteen guns. In that year, the point on which it stood  was separated by a narrow stream from the mainland, and it was necessary to  cross a drawbridge before entering the fort. Later on, the moat was filled in,  some land reclaimed from the sea, and an outer wall built. Little, however,  seems to be known of its history, because the earlier Governors devoted more  attention to fortifying Dawes&rsquo; Point, and the fort, named after Phillip, which  occupied the site of the present Observatory. This defence commanded the harbour;  and with the battery on George&rsquo;s Head, erected in 1803, and the one on old  Bennilong Point, was considered sufficient for the defence of Sydney.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page022a.jpg" width="800" height="543"></p>
  <p>Probably the ever-restless Macquarie took the old Fort in hand, and did  something for it, besides endowing it with his own patronymic. It is of  interest to remember that at the time of the Crimean war this battery was  provided with additional guns; during the latter end of 1870 it was  strengthened by the addition of five 42 pounders. The last occasion upon which  it was used was in March, 1871, when the guns were manned by fifty men, and the  fort took a share in the spectacle known as the &ldquo;defence of Sydney.&rdquo; It has now  totally disappeared to make room for a nondescript land of castellated barn,  intended to serve as a tram terminus. In triumphs of grotesque uncouthness the  architects of Macquarie&rsquo;s and those of our own time seem thoroughly at one.</p>
  <p>No less indefatigable as a former of streets than as a builder, did  Macquarie prove himself. Already it has been told how he cut George-Street out  of a thick scrub between the markets and the Cove; cleared and named many  others, and by his exertions did much towards making the city out of the  village. It must be remembered, however, that, unlike his less fortunate  predecessors, he had the British Treasury at his back, and unlimited muscle at  instant command. Plenty of land he also had to give away. And that he was  liberal with it the story of Burwood House amply proves.</p>
  <p>Mr. Alexander Riley was an enterprising gentleman, who, wishing to go  in for scientific farming on a large scale, applied for and received a grant of  no less than 1000 acres, extending from Parramatta to the Liverpool Road, and  embracing much of the present boroughs of Croydon, Burwood and Strathfield. Here,  with the aid of a small army of assigned servants, he fenced the whole of the  estate, cleared half, subdivided it into paddocks, and laid down English  grasses, besides building Burwood House. At this day the ancient mansion  presents much the same appearance as it did in 1820, and its preservation  speaks well for the endurance of the native timbers, and the excellence of  early workmanship. Of course, as time passed, it was bit by bit shorn of its  surrounding grounds and the last we hear of it was when, in 1885, Messrs.  Hardie and Gorman sold the house, with 200ft frontage to Burwood Park Road, for  &pound;3550. Let us hope that whoever owns the eighty-year old house will deal gently  with it, and not pull it down to build suburban red brick villas on its site.</p>
  <p>We have seen the building of the first permanent church&mdash;old St. Phillip&rsquo;s.&mdash;Now,  in 1819, was laid the foundation-stone of the second &mdash;St. James. Says an old  writer:&mdash;&ldquo;The spire surmounting the brick tower at the west end not only takes  away from the heaviness of the edifice but also forms a conspicuous object from  every part of the city and its neighbourhood.&rdquo; This spire, it may be  remembered, was renovated some years ago, and the interior of the building  materially enlarged. Still, in all essentials, the church remains as it was in  the days of Macquarie.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page022b.jpg" width="800" height="605"></p>
  <p>In the same year was finished and occupied the Hyde Park Barracks, used  as the principal convict depot of the colony. All these prisoners on their  arrival were forwarded here, and after being duly registered were open for  assignment to the free inhabitants as servants. The Supreme Court was begun in  1820, but not completed for another eight years. Three years previously had  arrived our first judge, Mr. Baron Field; also an Auxiliary Bible Society had  been established; there was a free school, prisons, Churches, and a racecourse;  but there were as yet, no free press and no trial by jury to complete the  civilising of the city.</p>
  <p>Before leaving Macquarie and his works, in stone and mortar, reference  must be made to one of them, if only for the curious means by which he got it  built, and the curious means the builders took of paying themselves.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page023a.jpg" width="800" height="571"></p>
  <p>The then colonial architect had been told to prepare plans for a  general hospital. This he did, but on such a costly and lavish scale&mdash;a centre  building and two detached wings to be erected of cut stone, with a covered  portico completely surrounding each of the three piles &mdash;that Macquarie,  although sorely tempted, considered the expense doubtfully, and for a while  hung back. But only for a while. And, presently, he made an agreement with  three well-known citizens by which these gentlemen contracted to erect the  building in its entirety on condition of receiving a certain quantity of rum  from the King&rsquo;s store, and of having the sole right to purchase, and to land  free of duty, all the ardent spirits that should be imported into the colony  during a certain term of years, The &ldquo;Rum Hospital,&rdquo; as it was called at the  time, was eventually completed in accordance with these conditions. The wages  of those so employed were as was usual in those days, paid for half in cash and  half in &ldquo;property,&rdquo; i.e., in tea, sugar, ardent spirits, wine, clothing, etc.,  or any other article the contractors happened to have in their store, and,  which, of course, was charged to the labourer at an enormous percentage above  its true value. And to make a clean sweep, the contractors erected several  public houses in the vicinity of the works, at which the emancipist and convict  labourers might spend their wages. Says Dr. Lang: &ldquo;In the year 1824 the Rum  Hospital was calculated to be worth &pound;20,000. I am confident that a good  building could now (1834) be erected for &pound;10,000. The quality of Bengal rum  received by the contractors was 60,000 gallons, worth at that time the whole  estimated cost of the building. The monopoly was for three years, afterwards  extended to three-and-a-half years, and as the contractors could purchase  spirits at three shillings (a gallon) and retail them at forty, the right was  supposed to be at least &pound;100.000.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in this extraordinary fashion did Sydney get her first general  hospital.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page023b.jpg" width="800" height="589"></p>
  <p>Surely never any charitable institution founded under such, to say the  least of it, disreputable circumstances! Still though Macquarie&rsquo;s contemporaries  raged bitterly against him doubtless, out of the evil that attended its birth came  eventually much good and comfort to the suffering. It served its purpose, even  as does the beautiful building that now stands on the site of the &ldquo;Rum Hospital&rdquo;  a portion of which, the southern wing, still remains with us in the shape of  the Mint.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter  IV<br>
    Early Social Life </b></h2>
  <p>WRITING of Sydney in about 1821-2, a visitor remarks: &ldquo;This town covers  a considerable extent of ground, and would, at first sight, induce the belief  of a much greater population than it actually contains. This is attributable to  two circumstances&mdash;the largeness of the leases, which, in most instances,  possess sufficient space for a garden; and the smallness of the houses erected  on them, which, in general, do not exceed one story. From these two causes it  happens that the town does not contain above seven thousand souls. There are in  the whole upwards of a thousand houses; and although they are, for the most  part, small, and of mean appearance, there are many public buildings, as well  as houses of individuals, that would not disgrace this great metropolis  (London). Of the former class, the General Hospital and the Barracks are,  perhaps, the most conspicuous; of the latter are the houses of Messrs. Lord,  Riley, Howe, Underwood, and Nichols. Land in this town,&rdquo; the writer goes on to  say, &ldquo;is in many places worth &pound;1000 per acre, and is daily increasing in value,  rents are, in consequence, exorbitantly high. It is very far from being a  commodious house that can be had for a hundred a year unfurnished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page024a.jpg" width="800" height="555"></p>
  <p>He visited the market, already described, and was rather pleased with  it, finding it well supplied with grain, vegetables, poultry, butter, eggs and  fruit. It was held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
  <p>The Bank of New South Wales, he thinks, &ldquo;promises to be of great and  permanent benefit to the colony in general.&rdquo; Its capital at that time was  &pound;20,000, divided into two hundred shares, and its paper was now the circulating  medium of the colony.</p>
  <p>Education was spreading, and the schoolmaster was going, comparatively,  far afield. &ldquo;There are in this town,&rdquo; says a historian of these early twenties,  &ldquo;and other parts of the colony, several good private seminaries for the board  and education of the children of opulent parents. The best is in the district  of Castlereagh, which is about forty miles distant, and is kept by the  clergyman of that district, the Rev. Henry Fulton, a person peculiarly  qualified both from his character and acquirements for conducting so  responsible and important an undertaking. The boys in this seminary receive a  regular classical education, and the terms are as reasonable as those of  similar establishments in this country&rdquo; (England).</p>
  <p>Compare this &ldquo;seminary&rdquo; business with the first school, already  mentioned, of the Rev. Mr. Johnson, and it will be acknowledged that we were  making rapid advances indeed. Here, bearing on the same subject, is an extract  from the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette&rdquo; of the day:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sydney Academy, No. 93, Phillip-street.&mdash;Wanted a Drawing and a Dancing  master; persons properly qualified, and who can give satisfactory testimonials  as to character and abilities, will meet with liberal encouragement by applying  as above. Likewise, wanted a good laundress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And also: &ldquo;Boarding and day-school for young ladies by Mrs. Hickey,  Bent-street Sydney; opened for a limited number, where they will be instructed  in English Grammar, writing, geography, and the French language. Terms: Under  ten years, board and tuition, including English grammar and plain work, per  annum &pound;20.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, for the opposite sex: &ldquo;To parents, guardians etc.&mdash;Mr. Cuffe begs  leave respectfully to acquaint his friends and the public that he has removed  his day and evening schools from his late residence in Pitt-street to  Macquarie-street where every attention is paid to the education of youth in all  its branches, by himself, and able assistants, terms as usual. N.B.&mdash;A Sunday-school  will be spiritually and morally attended to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page024b.jpg" width="800" height="650"></p>
  <p>All this sounds very fine; but it must be kept in mind that the city  proper was as yet scarcely more than a collection of huts, with, dotted amongst  them, the comparatively huge buildings of Macquarie&rsquo;s regime: that the waters  of the Cove still washed up to where the Paragon Hotel now stands, and that the  gallows, upon which men were hung in batches, was a prominent feature of the  city.</p>
  <p>The first place of execution, by the way, was, as nearly as can be  gathered, near Hyde Park, not far from where St. James&rsquo;s Church now stands.  But, although accounts differ in this matter, it seems pretty certain that the  site of the original gallows afterwards formed part of a garden, taking in the  ground upon which is erected the Supreme Court; and, probably, this garden ran  up to the corner of our King street. However, this may be, the gallows, in  1804, began a series of journeys; close to the corner of Park and Castlereagh  streets, occupied in 1848, as it is now, by the Barley Mow Hotel; thence it was  taken to some part of Sussex-street, where, in the same year, stood Barker&rsquo;s  Mills: then it was moved to a piece of ground near Strawberry Hills; then to  the back of the Military Barracks; from there, in the beginning of the  twenties, this much-travelled machine found a resting place on the summit of a  cliff in Princes-street, at the rear of the gaol in Lower George-street. Its  final journey was to the front of the new gaol at Darlinghurst, where it  performed its first duty on two men convicted of murder, in October, 1841.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page025a.jpg" width="800" height="551"></p>
  <p>Innumerable arguments have taken place about this matter of the precise  situation of the original gibbet. But by what can be learnt from careful  research, the above is as nearly as possible its early history.</p>
  <p>A dominating feature of the Sydney landscape, to which reference has  already been made, was the windmills crowning some of the most prominent  heights, and forming, as will be seen in the old prints, a not unpicturesque  element in the scene.</p>
  <p>Steam, for the purpose of grinding com, was not utilised until about 1828.  Says the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; of 1819: &ldquo;Mr. John Blaxland begs leave to inform the public  that he has erected a mill for the grinding of grain, the stones of which are  the production of the colony; and that he will grind wheat at 1s per bushel.  Any person found taking stones from his Luddenham Estate will be prosecuted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last intimation shows that the editor of the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; had to  suffer imposition as well as his modern prototypes, it being, to all intents  and purposes, a separate advertisement. But, then, Mr. Blaxland was a person of  weight in the community, whilst the poor newspaper man of those days had to  tramp round the country for many miles, and in all weathers, humbly soliciting  payment of two, and even three, years&rsquo; overdue subscriptions.</p>
  <p>Although the readers of this book should be able to form for themselves,  aided by the pictures, a fairly accurate idea of Sydney at the various ages of  its growth already touched upon, yet, to give effect to these, something must  be said of the men and women, our forbears, who had their being, and lived their  lives under so much less happier auspices than do we the present day.</p>
  <p>But contemporary historians have not given us, in this respect, very  much to go upon. Their time was too greatly taken up by chronicling political  squabbles, and the gradual expansion of the colony outside the capital, to  afford any leisure for more in a glimpse now and again into the social life of  Sydney itself.</p>
  <p>Says an early visitor, writing just about the advent of Governor  Brisbane:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Society is upon a much better footing throughout the colony in general  than might naturally be imagined, considering the ingredients of which it is  composed. In Sydney the civil and military officers with their families, form a  circle at once select and extended, without including the highly numerous  respectable families of merchants and settlers who reside there. Unfortunately,  however, the town is not free from those divisions which are so prevalent in  all small communities. Scandal appears to be the favourite amusement to which  idlers resort to kill time and prevent ennui; and, consequently, the same  families are eternally changing from friendship to hostility, and from  hostility back again to friendship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These conditions, it may be remarked, will still hold good at present  of many other towns, besides Sydney some eighty years ago.</p>
  <p>Continues our author: &ldquo;Of the number of respectable persons some  estimate may be formed if we refer to the parties which are given on particular  days at the Government House.&rdquo; Even now many people gauge respectability by  much the same test. And notice that word &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; It occurs throughout  the old chronicles, and is pregnant with meaning. To be respectable in those  days was apparently to be &ldquo;pure merino,&rdquo; with no taint even of the emancipist,  let alone of the actual convict, about you. And that such spotless ones among  the flock were very far from being numerous is shown by the fact that at one of  these Government House festivals, in 1822, there were about 160 &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;  ladies and gentlemen.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page025b.jpg" width="800" height="499"></p>
  <p>Writing a year or two later, the author, already quoted above, remarks  rather significantly: &ldquo;There are at present no public amusements in this  colony. Many years since there was a theatre, and more latterly annual races.  But it was found that the society was not sufficiently mature for such  establishments.&rdquo; Reading here between the lines, one seems to have unpleasant  visions of what our early &ldquo;general public&rdquo; was like. Later on, as we shall see,  they matured, and, presumably, improved.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page026a.jpg" width="800" height="436"></p>
  <p>From all that can be gathered, and that is but little, our folk of the  early years led lives, that, if busy, were none the less monotonous, void of social  amusements, except, perhaps, at long intervals, a supper and ball at Government  House, or some public celebration like that of the Anniversary Dinner. Of their  home life, there has been no word-painter, and of it we know little or nothing.</p>
  <p>This function, the Anniversary Dinner, merits rather more than passing  notice. The first one on record seems to have been on January 26, 1817, and was  held by Isaac Nichols, Postmaster of Sydney, at his house in Lower  George-street, at the head of the Cove, to celebrate the 29th anniversary of  the foundation of the colony. There are forty select, and presumably thoroughly  &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; guests, who sit down to table at five in the afternoon, and  retire at ten that night.&mdash;There are loyal toasts proposed after the cloth is  removed; and the &ldquo;Muse of Mr. Jenkins,&rdquo; who is the chairman, has composed a  song, which is sung to the tune of &ldquo;Rule Britannia.&rdquo; A verse or so will suffice  to give the reader an idea of this, undoubtedly the first Australian patriotic  song:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="poem">When first Australia rose to fame,<br>
  And Seamen brave explored her shore<br>
  Neptune with joy beheld their aim.<br>
  And thus express&rsquo;d the wish he bore.</p>
  <p class="poem">Chorus&mdash;<br>
  Rise, Australia! - with peace and plenty crown&rsquo;d<br>
  Thy name shall one day be renown&rsquo;d.</p>
  <p class="poem">Then Commerce, too, shall on thee smile,<br>
  Adventurous barks thy ports shall crowd;<br>
  While pleas&rsquo;d, well pleas&rsquo;d, the Parent Isle<br>
  Shall of her distant sons be proud.</p>
  <p class="poem">Chorus&mdash;<br>
  Rise, Australia! with peace and plenty crown&rsquo;d,<br>
  Thy name shall one day be renown&rsquo;d.</p>
  <p>And who shall say that &ldquo;Mr. Jenkins&rdquo; did not make a very fine forecast  indeed, and one fulfilled to the very letter?</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page026b.jpg" width="800" height="646"></p>
  <p>Next year the celebration became official, taking place at Government  House, while in the evening Mrs. Macquarie gave a ball. Mr. Howe, the editor of  the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; was graciously allowed the privilege of a look round during the  evening&mdash;not being &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; that, of course, was as much as he could  expect&mdash;and he appears to have been very much taken with a portrait of Admiral  Phillip, which was suspended at one end of the room, encircled with wreaths and  banners, and an inscription running:&mdash;&ldquo;In commemoration of the thirtieth  anniversary of the colony of New South Wales established by Arthur Phillip,  whose virtues and talent entitle him to the grateful remembrance of this country,  and to whose arduous exertions the present prosperous state of the colony may  chiefly be ascribed.&rdquo; Which goes to show that contemporary recognition of the  first Australian pioneer was stronger than that of succeeding generations; and,  indeed, until quite recently, in our own day. The artist was a Mr. Greenaway,  the Colonial Architect; and it would be of interest to know if that old  portrait is still in existence.</p>
  <p>The thirty-second anniversary (1820) was celebrated by a public dinner  at Hankinson&rsquo;s rooms, in George-street, which was attended by &ldquo;sixty or seventy  respectable persons.&rdquo; But on this occasion there was no enthusiasm to speak of,  owing to the fact of the guests being over-charged. The tickets for the dinner  cost 40s&mdash;&ldquo;without any kind of refined articles, such as jellies or blanc  manges, and the elegance of a tip-top tavern table, such as could be had in  London for a quarter of the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some of these good people had probably been glad enough, in the  starvation years, of a feed of hominy, and now they are growling because mine  host had not provided blanc manges and jellies! And, by the way, it is  remarkable that now we find this function left chiefly to the emancipists, who,  apparently, have been admitted to call themselves &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; This was, of  course, Macquarie&rsquo;s doing; for only a month or two after landing he had shown  very clearly where his sympathies lay by making a convict a magistrate.  Certainly, the person in question had been transported for some petty offence  at the age of 16. But the affair, nevertheless, gave a tremendous shock to the  untainted members of the community.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page026c.jpg" width="800" height="559"></p>
  <p>In 1821. the thirty-third anniversary was perhaps the most successful  of any so far. It took place at Gansdell&rsquo;s Rooms, Hyde Park, when 101  emancipists sat down to a great spread. Dr. Redfern was president, Simeon Lord  was vice-president, and there were eight stewards. It is particularly noted by  the chronicler of the affair that both dinner and wines were excellent.</p>
  <p>Succeeding celebrations all partook of the same non-political and  partially representative character until 1825, of which more anon.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page027a.jpg" width="800" height="389"></p>
  <p>Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B., was now Governor of New  South Wales&mdash;the second of our military Governors. For the city, in the way of  adding to or beautifying it, Brisbane did little or nothing. Indeed, during the  whole of his four years stay, he was more or less in hot water. In the first  place, he, with a stroke of his pen, altered the financial policy of the colony.  and with such disastrous results that wheat rose to &pound;1 per bushel. Wheat, when  he arrived, was practically the currency of the country, and was exchangeable  at the Government store for vouchers representing an average rate of 10s per  bushel. These receipts were as good as cash in Sydney. Brisbane suddenly  changed this circulating medium from sterling to colonial currency, with the  result of raising the pound sterling 25 per cent above the pound currency; the  effect on the small farmers, already many of them deeply in debt to Sydney  merchants, may be imagined. Before this, however, he had fallen out with the  Scotch Presbyterians. And this was the more curious, inasmuch as Brisbane was  himself a Scot, and a Presbyterian to boot.</p>
  <p>Dr. Lang arrived in 1823, and at once set about getting a church built,  collecting, in a few days, upwards of &pound;700 for that purpose. A memorial was now  addressed to the Governor, praying for Government monetary aid for the  undertaking. To this a sharp and insulting reply was sent, refusing the  wished-for help. The committee, indignant, applied for redress to the Home Government,  who severely reprimanded Brisbane, and ordered him to advance not one-third of  the cost of the erection, but also to pay the officiating minister a salary of  &pound;300 per annum, &ldquo;regretting,&rdquo; at the same time &ldquo;that his Excellency put to  their probation members of the Church of Scotland in the colony&mdash;the Established  Church of one of the most enlightened and virtuous portions of the Empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page027b.jpg" width="800" height="670"></p>
  <p>Thus Brisbane got his snub, and the Scots their church. Later on the Governor,  however, showed himself anything but a small minded man; for, perceiving that  he had been quite in the wrong, he replaced his name on the list of subscribers,  off which, in anger, he had caused to be taken. Nay, more, he laid the  foundation-stone of the Church in July, 1924. Such is the story of St. Andrew&rsquo;s,  or, as we, at this day, more generally know it, the &ldquo;Scots Church.&rdquo; Standing at  the south end of Church Hill, it is practically unchanged; looking as stiff,  sturdy, uncompromising, and rugged as the man through whose enterprise it was  built.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter  V.<br>
  Sydney in the Twenties. </b></h2>
  <p>Dr. LANG never forgave Brisbane for the slight put upon the Sydney  Presbyterians by comparing them to their disadvantage with the Roman Catholics.  Thus, when the Governor instituted yearly and half-yearly races in the capital,  Lang calls him the &ldquo;patron saint of Australian jockey-ship.&rdquo; The Scot divine  says bitterly: &ldquo;There are the Sydney and the Parramatta races&hellip; There are the  Windsor races, and the Liverpool and the Campbelltown races. There are races at  Maitland and Patrick&rsquo;s Plains; two different stations on Hunter&rsquo;s River; at  Bathurst, beyond the mountains; and at Goulburn Plains, 200 miles from Sydney,  in the district of Argyle. In short, &lsquo;the march of improvement&rsquo; is much too  weak a phrase for the meridian of New South Wales; we must, therefore, speak of  the &lsquo;race of improvement,&rsquo; for the three appropriate and never-failing  accompaniments of advancing civilisation in that colony are a racecourse, a  publichouse, and a gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was unfair and unjust. But Dr. Lang was at times both. Later he  wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;When I ask what Sir Thomas Brisbane did for New South Wales, I pause in  vain for a reply. When I ask what memorial he left behind him to endear his  memory to the country and to perpetuate his fame, a hundred fingers point to  the &lsquo;Brisbane Cup.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page027c.jpg" width="800" height="572"></p>
  <p>But Brisbane did more than this, for he established a fine Observatory  at Parramatta. Also, before he left, he launched a thunderbolt at the  exclusives of Sydney by actually dining with &ldquo;the elite of the emanpists.&rdquo;  During his regime, too, was, in 1824, established our first Executive Council;  and there arrived our first Chief Justice, Francis Forbes (afterwards Sir  Francis); Saxe Bannister, the Attorney-General; John Stephen, father of the  late Chief Justice (Sir Alfred Stephen), as Solicitor-General and Commissioner  of the Court of Requests; John Mackness, as Sheriff; and T. E. Miller, as  Registrar. The first trial by jury was empanelled in a civil cause in February,  &lsquo;25. Noteworthy, too, was the establishment of the first independent newspaper,  the &ldquo;Australian,&rdquo; which was published by Messrs. Wardell and Wentworth.</p>
  <p>It will thus be seen that if, during this period, there was little  increase in the growth of the city, there were a good many events of importance  that were most intimately connected with its present welfare and its future  history.</p>
  <p>Recurring to the establishment by the Governor of the periodical race  meetings so contemned by Lang, it may be of interest to know how the boundaries  of the old-time course ran.</p>
  <p>The grand-stand, then, in 1821, and the winning-post stood at the top  of what is now Market-street; the course took a sweep to the right in the  direction of Hyde Park Barracks, thence past the site of St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral  and the Sydney Grammar School, passing in front of Lyons Terrace, obliquely to  the top of Bathurst street, then along what is now Elizabeth-street, to the  corner of Park-street, and thence to the winning post. When first formed, the  length of the course was one mile and a quarter, but it was afterwards shortened  to a mile and six yards.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page028a.jpg" width="800" height="486"></p>
  <p>The first race took place about 1810, when the 73rd Regiment arrived  under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice O&rsquo;Connell (the late Sir Maurice  O&rsquo;Connell), and the first prize was won by a horse named &ldquo;Chance,&rdquo; the property  of Captain Ritchie; the Colonel&rsquo;s mare, &ldquo;Carlo,&rdquo; won the second; and one  belonging to D&rsquo;Arcy Wentworth, the third. But shortly after Governor Brisbane&rsquo;s  arrival houses began to spring up so quickly around this quarter that the  course was removed to what was known as the Sandy Racecourse, about four miles  to the southwards, towards Botany Bay.</p>
  <p>One curious event of 1824 was the seizing of a vessel, while at anchor  in Sydney Cove, by a King&rsquo;s ship, acting on behalf of the East India Company.  This company, it appeared, claimed the exclusive right of trading in Eastern  waters. Now, the colonial Government had chartered a ship&mdash;the Almorah&mdash;and had  sent her to Batavia whence she returned with a valuable cargo of rice, tea,  sugar, etc. Presently some of the Sydney merchants, jealous of official  meddling with their prerogatives as traders and importers, laid an information  against the Almorah with the captain of an English man-of- war, then lying in  the harbor; and she was seized in open defiance of the Government, and sent off  with her cargo as a prize to India, on a charge of infringing the Company&rsquo;s  charter. The mere fact, it was alleged, of her having tea on board was  sufficient excuse for this arbitrary proceeding.</p>
  <p>Of course there had been bushrangers in the colony before Brisbane&rsquo;s  time, but not any calling for special mention until the Donohoe gang, who  flourished in 1825, and the three following years, instituted a very reign of  terror in Sydney and its immediate neighborhood. Donohoe&rsquo;s gang contained a  dozen ruffians; but his chief companions were Walmsley, Webber, and  Underwood&mdash;all transported convicts except the last, who was native-born. After  a time, however, his mates discovered that he had been keeping a diary of their  proceedings. Disgusted with this literary effort, they effectually stopped all  chance of publication by deliberately murdering the unfortunate author. He had,  so it was alleged, joined the gang from mere love of adventure.</p>
  <p>For four years these men set the police at defiance, notwithstanding  that a reward of &pound;100 was offered for the ringleaders. Between Sydney and  Parramatta they murdered and robbed, and fought the police with an impunity  that says little for the constitution of the &ldquo;force&rdquo; of those days. So great  did the terror of the band become that travel&rsquo;ers joined together for  protection. Says a newspaper of the time, speaking of Donohoe and his  depredations: &ldquo;Some half dozen constables or so, we believe, have been packed  off up the Parramatta and Liverpool roads, but have returned to town as usual,  safe and sound and empty-handed&hellip; Some effective measures should be taken, and  that speedily, to suppress this alarming evil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dress of the three leaders has been described, and shows that they  wanted for little, in that respect at least. &ldquo;Donohoe: Black hat, superfine  blue cloth coat, lined with silk, surtout fashion, plaited shirt (good  quality), laced boots, and snuff-coloured trousers.&rdquo; He seems to have been the  dandy of the trio. His two aides, however,&mdash;Walmlsey and Webber&mdash;were almost  equally well-dressed.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page028b.jpg" width="800" height="528"></p>
  <p>At last the residents, harassed beyond endurance, rose in their own  protection and gave battle to the bushrangers at Raby, now Bringelly. Here  Donohoe was shot. But most of the others managed to escape through the thick  scrub. Later on, Walmsley and Webber were captured on the Western road.  Walmsley turned king&rsquo;s evidence against Webber, who was presently hanged.  Through the informer others of the gang were at intervals captured, and the  long reign of &ldquo;Bold Jack Donohoe&rdquo; and his banditti was over.</p>
  <p>But during Brisbane&rsquo;s official term dozens of men seem to have taken to  the bush, and had more or less long and successful careers, ending in death by  the gallows or the bullet. The Bathurst district was especially prolific of  bushrangers; but, compared with the bloodthirsty Donohoe gang, the majority of  them appear to have been mere station-hut robbers and petty pilferers of that  kind. Nor did we ever produce anything equal to the terrible Tasmanian outlaws.  But whilst for robbery under arms they most surely swung, at times, a merciful  judge, for simple thieving, might only send them to Norfolk Island, &ldquo;to be  worked in chains during their lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In 1825 were first established the Mounted Police, drawn chiefly from  the infantry regiments serving in Sydney. At the beginning, they consisted of  only two officers and thirteen troopers. Nor was it until fourteen years later  that the force could make anything like a respectable show with nine officers, a  sergeant-major, and 156 non-commissioned officers and men, with 136 horses;  twenty of the corps being footmen.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page029a.jpg" width="800" height="501"></p>
  <p>The officers were magistrates, and the body was subject to military law  and discipline. They were armed with carbine, sword, and horse-pistols, and  were uniformed as light dragoons. The headquarter division, consisting of the  commandant, the adjutant, and some score of men, was stationed in Sydney. As a  service, it was an excessively rough, hard, and perilous one, and not by any  means so popular as it is now.</p>
  <p>The Anniversary Dinner of 1825 demands especial notice, because of its  entirely different features to those that came before it. They were merely  loyal and sentimental functions. This particular one, however, was in the  highest degree political as well. The chair was taken by an eloquent young  Australian, who had just returned from a visit to England, full of wide and  liberal ideas, eager, too, to give the benefit of them to his native land. His  name was William Charles Wentworth; and he was the practical champion of  constitutional government, as opposed to that military despotism so familiar to  his early youth.</p>
  <p>Tickets, on this occasion, were only 5 dollars each; the feast was held  at Mrs. Hill&rsquo;s tavern, Hyde Park. A military band was in attendance, and some  of the toasts indicate the progress that the colony was making towards reform  and freedom: &ldquo;To the memory of Governor Phillip, the Founder of the Colony,&rdquo; &ldquo;The  Memory of Major-General Macquarie, Our Late Revered and Lamented Governor.&rdquo;  There were also toasted: &ldquo;Sir James Mackintosh and the other Advocates of  Australia in the British Senate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Trial by Jury,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Freedom of the Press,&rdquo; &ldquo;A  House of Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The vice-president was Dr. Redfern, and amongst the stewards was Robert  Campbell, son of the first real Sydney business man, known even to this day as &ldquo;Merchant&rdquo;  Campbell.</p>
  <p>Architecturally, except in the matter of private houses, Sydney during  Brisbane&rsquo;s term, as has been remarked, had little more to shew than when  Macquarie left&mdash;a Governor who should have been buried in the centre of the city  with the one word, &ldquo;Circumspice,&rdquo; cut for an epitaph on his tomb. Still, the  political and social happenings of Brisbane&rsquo;s years, few though they were, had  more effect on the future of the capital and the colony than all the building  of Macquarie, and are so bound up in the early history of our city as to render  ignoring any notice of them, however slight, impossible.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page029b.jpg" width="800" height="584"></p>
  <p>Between Governor Brisbane&rsquo;s relinquishing the rule of the colony and  the arrival of his successor, another military man, Lieutenant-General Sir  Ralph Darling, K.C.B., there was only an interregnum of eighteen days, during  which the administration was in the hands of Colonel (afterwards General)  Stewart, of Bathurst, an honor which formed the one boast of that officer&rsquo;s  existence, and the standing joke of the district during the remainder of his  life.</p>
  <p>One of the chief advantages gained by Sydney and the colony during  Darling&rsquo;s reign seems to have been the establishment of a general Post Office;  and for this purpose he set aside the piece of land in George-street then  occupied by a police station. The quarters of the force were removed to the  Market House (old Central Police Station), while sheds for market purposes were  erected at its rear.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page030.jpg" width="800" height="529"></p>
  <p>Readers will remember mention of Mr. Isaac Nichols, &ldquo;Postmaster of  Sydney,&rdquo; in whose house took place the first-recorded Anniversary dinner. Well,  this is the person who is said to have built the first post office in our city,  using it, at the same time, as a residence. The house was only pulled down about  11 or 12 years ago, and was situated in Lower George-street, near the Queen&rsquo;s  wharf, Circular Quay; it was numbered 144. Behind it in those days, was a  store; and directly in front of this was a wharf, on the banks of the Tank  Stream, at which small coasters used to discharge goods. The house, supposed to  have been built about 1800, was substantially constructed of brick, made,  probably, in the old Government brickyards. When Nichols died, in 1819, the  post office was removed to where the present great building stands the police,  who occupied it, being, as already stated, established in the Market House. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page031a.jpg" width="800" height="633"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;At his death, Nichols&rsquo;s post  office changed hands, and became the Australia Hotel. For years prior to its  being demolished it had been occupied, like so many other houses in this, the  oldest quarter of Sydney, by Chinese merchants. Almost opposite to the site of  the original post office there was, some years ago a butcher&rsquo;s shop, once the  residence of Mr. Thomas Moore, superintendent of dockyards. Further south is a  structure believed to be the oldest residence in Australia. It was built by a  Mr. Cubitt, at the corner of George-street and Brown Bear lane, and was of  stone, and two stories high. Later on it was known as the Cat and Fiddle Hotel,  and an additional story of brick was added. This old bit of history is now  occupied by Chinese.</p>
  <p>Needless to say that in Postmaster Nichols&rsquo;s time there were no  pillar-boxes and no postmen. People had to travel from all parts of the settlement  to post or receive letters at the old house in Lower George-street. And it may  be remarked of this street that not only does it give us a capital idea of what  that quarter of the city looked like over half a century ago, so little has it  changed, but, into the bargain, is almost a perfect facsimile of scores of  streets in English country towns. Our first builders were nothing if not  conservative, and they reproduced, as nearly as possible, in the new country  the unsuitable conditions of architecture they had left behind in the old one.  As to the new post office, it still, so far as looks went, remained allover a  police station, until improved almost out of knowledge in 1847-8.</p>
  <p>In the second year of Sir Ralph Darling&rsquo;s reign an event happened that  shook Sydney society, both exclusive and otherwise, to its very foundations;  and, as being part of the history of the city, may be here briefly touched  upon.</p>
  <p>Sudds and Thompson were two private soldiers in the 57th Regiment doing  duty in Sydney. Sudds was a steady man, who had saved some money; Thompson was  a scamp. But both wished to remain in the colony, instead of returning home  with the regiment.&mdash;As to procure their discharge was out of the question, Sudds  proposed to his mate that they should gain the coveted paper by becoming  convicts. This being agreed upon, they went to a shop and stole some cloth;  were, as they intended, caught and tried; and sentenced to be transported to  one of the auxiliary penal settlements for seven years. Then the Governor  stepped in, took the two prisoners out of the hands of the civil power, and  condemned them to work in chains on the roads for the full term of their  sentence, and afterwards to be returned to service in the ranks.</p>
  <p>On a day appointed, the Sydney garrison was assembled, and formed into  a hollow square. The culprits were brought out, their uniforms stripped off,  and replaced by the convict dress; iron-spiked collars, and heavy chains, made  expressly to the Governor&rsquo;s orders, were riveted around their necks and to  their legs, and then they were drummed out of the regiment to the tune of &ldquo;The  Rogue&rsquo;s March.&rdquo; Sudds was in very bad health at the time, and his illness,  aggravated by the disgrace and the long exposure in the hot sun, together with  the utter downfall of his hopes, plunged him into such a fit of hopeless  despondency that he died a few days afterwards. Thompson became insane.</p>
  <p>Then the fun began. The &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; defended, the &ldquo;Australian&rdquo; attacked,  the conduct of the Governor; sides were taken, and Sydney was convulsed.  Indeed, Darling may be said never to have heard the last of this extraordinary  case of despotic military interference and uncalled for cruelty on his part.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page031b.jpg" width="800" height="477"></p>
  <p>In 1827 there were no less than four newspapers in Sydney&mdash;the good, old  conservative &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; the organ of the Government; the &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; a fighter;  the &ldquo;Gleaner;&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Australian.&rdquo; And these three last were all arrainged  against the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo; and the Government. So sore did the authorities feel  about these constant attacks that they presently imposed a duty consisting of fourpence  upon any sheet, half-sheet, or piece of paper whereof any newspaper (within the  meaning of the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act) should consist.</p>
  <p>Howe, the editor of the &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; confident of Government support,  only protested mildly against this imposition, but the others fulminated to  such good purpose that the Act never came into force. Indeed, the Chief Justice  refused to certify to its being a proper one. But for that, perhaps, the &ldquo;Monitor&rdquo;  and its two contemporaries might, after all, have had to do as they threatened,  and appear as magazines, to evade the duty, or to suspend altogether.</p>
  <p>Bent-street owes a prominent old landmark to this era, i.e., the Free  Public Library, originally known as the Australian Library. The originator of  this institution was Thomas de la Condamine, private secretary to Governor  Darling, aided by the Revs. W. Cowper and Hill, and many of the most  influential merchants. The first meeting was held at the Sydney Hotel, when  Alderman M&rsquo;Leay was elected President. This was on February 3, 1826. By the  judicious arrangement of the committee, aided by a liberal subscription list,  donations from the Governor and from Archdeacon Scott, together with a bequest  of books from T. Campbell, the library was opened on October 1, 1827, at No. 1,  Terry&rsquo;s Buildings, Pitt-street, or somewhere about the site of Messrs. Batt,  Rodd, and Purves&rsquo;s auction rooms. These premises were held jointly with the  newly-established Sydney Dispensary, whose officer also served as a temporary  librarian from 1 to 4 p.m. daily. Shortly afterwards the Governor granted for  its use some valuable allotments of land. Two of these were situated in Hyde  Park, between where now are St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral and the Sydney Grammar School.  There were also two other pieces above Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay. These were sold, later  on, in about &lsquo;41, by public auction, and realised &pound;3384.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page032a.jpg" width="800" height="602"></p>
  <p>Sir Richard Burke, however, cancelled the ground in Hyde Park,  notwithstanding many protests on the part of the committee and others. Finally,  Sir George Gipps granted the site of the present edifice, of which the  president (Alexander Macleay) laid the foundation-stone in 1843. It took three  years in building, the cost being over &pound;5000. Eventually it was purchased by  the Government, and declared free for the use of the people. Additions have  since been made, but substantially it is the same as it was in the twenties.</p>
  <p>Darling&rsquo;s reign has been known as one of libels, because the press  seemed during the whole administration perpetually in hot water. Even the &ldquo;Gazette&rdquo;  was bitter by the prevailing epidemic, and was criminally prosecuted for an  alleged libel on the first, and retiring, Attorney-General of the colony, Saxe  Bannister, Esquire. The paper, however, won its case. But Hall, of the &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo;  (&ldquo;who had deserved especially well of the colony in having reared a numerous  and virtuous family&rdquo;), Wentworth and Wardell, of the &ldquo;Australian,&rdquo; and the  others, were always more or less in trouble. The liberty of the press was  certainly established but the fact was that the authorities had not as yet  thoroughly realised what such a matter meant; nor had the editors, on their  side, made a moderate use of their liberty. Hence the friction.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page032b.jpg" width="800" height="492"></p>
  <p>But for Darling, in 1826, the colony would have been bankrupt. Some  idiots spread a rumour that the bank of New South Wales was about to stop  payment. The inevitable scare followed, and only that the Governor helped the  bank from the Treasury-chest, disaster would probably have taken place. Mrs.  Darling, the wife of the Governor, established a Female School of Industry, not  far from St. James&rsquo; Church. Major Goulburn, the first Colonial Secretary, after  whom the well-known Sydney street was named, returned to England. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo;  remarked his biographer, &ldquo;a man of uncontaminated spirit, marked integrity, and  indefatigable zeal. He was succeeded by the Hon. Alexander Macleay who, with his  wife and family, arrived in the Marquis of Hastings.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="vi"></a>Chapter  VI.<br>
    Sydney In The Twenties (Continued}</b></h2>
  <p>IN April, 1826, Mr. Howe informes us in his &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; that Mr. Iceley&rsquo;s  thoroughbred mare, imported ex Columbia, dropped a fine bay foal; this being  the first blood horse born on Australian soil. And, by the way, it should be  said, that the original Howe (George) had now been dead some years, and that Robert,  his son, ran the paper in these, comparatively, good, new days. The filial  eulogium is worth reproducing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. George Howe, the Institutor, Printer, and Publisher of the &lsquo;Sydney Gazette&rsquo; and &lsquo;New South Wales Advertiser,&rsquo; as well as the Compiler and  Publisher of the New South Wales Pocket Almanack, yielded up, on the 11th of  May, all his arduous labours at the visitation of death. He has the undisputed  honor of being the primary Editor of Australia, and his memory will run coeval  with New South Wales; having succeeded in rearing up and establishing, amidst  hosts of difficulties, that humble but important structure, the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette&rdquo;  and thus attained the genuine Printer&rsquo;s greatest ambition&mdash;even in death&mdash;a  typographical monument, in which, though silent in the tomb, he will ever  proclaim himself to us the Progenitor of Printing! We hope that the reprint of  our paternal and beloved Typographist will (in the technical phraseology of  Franklin) appear once more in a new and more beautiful edition, corrected and  amended by the Author.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page032c.jpg" width="800" height="556"></p>
  <p>Poor old man, from what can be gathered, despite his son&rsquo;s tall talk,  he had, on the whole, a very hard, dreary, and squalid time of it. Snubbed by  one faction, kicked by another, and swindled by both.</p>
  <p>Late in October, 26, there arrived the Waterwich, the first  seventy-four to enter an Australian port. She was in command of Commander Sir  James Brisbane, brother of the late Governor, and was bound from Trincomalee to  South America. Fine and high and imposing she must have bulked to the eyes of  the citizens.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page033a.jpg" width="800" height="631"></p>
  <p>During Darling&rsquo;s time, too, we find the second recurrence of that &ldquo;novel  and severe distemper,&rdquo; influenza, or &ldquo;catarrh,&rdquo; as they called it then, with  which we of to-day are so unpleasantly familiar. It prevailed &ldquo;throughout the  colony, and gave rise to much distress.&rdquo; Its first visitation was in 1820, when  &ldquo;it by the violence and fury of the attack, consigned many people to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next year whooping cough was introduced by the ship Morley, and the  disease killed so many children, and became so virulent that the schooner  Alligator had to be formed into a quarantine station. Later on the transport  Bussorah Merchant introduced a slight epidemic of smallpox. Otherwise the  health of the city and the colony kept throughout fairly good.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page033b.jpg" width="800" height="595"></p>
  <p>In the time of Governor Darling was produced the first Australian ghost  story, which merits notice because from out a commonplace and brutal murder was  evolved a romance which has not only had, in diversly embroidered aspects, an  almost world-wide reputation, but is very firmly believed in by many persons at  the present day.</p>
  <p>The commonly accepted story, in its bare outline, is that Worrall and  Fisher were two well-to-do farmers of Campbelltown. Suddenly Fisher  disappeared. Worrall, pretending to be in his confidence, hinted that he had gone  to England to escape prosecution for forgery, and so wished his departure kept  secret. By and bye, he produced a letter empowering him to sell the farm and  belongings of the absent man; also a power of attorney. Then he advertised all  Fisher&rsquo;s property for sale. But the very day before this came off (note the &ldquo;psychological  moment&rdquo;), an old man saw Fisher, or his ghost, sitting on a fence. The vision  according to the best etiquette in such matters, appeared three times. Rumors  spread; the place was searched, blood marks and footsteps were found, the last  leading towards a water-hole, in which the decomposed body was discovered by a  blackfellow, and identified as that of the missing man. Suspicion naturally  turned to Worrall, as being the last person seen in Fisher&rsquo;s company, and as  being in possession of his property. Worrall was apprehended, tried, and  executed, making, at the last moment, a full confession of his guilt.</p>
  <p>The true facts of the case were that Worrall murdered Fisher, and,  coolly taking possession of his farm and effects, tried to sell them piecemeal,  saying that he had documents that gave him power to do so. In one or two  instances he forged receipts, in Fisher&rsquo;s name, for the purchase of stock, etc.  It was a long premeditated crime, to get hold of his victim&rsquo;s property, which  was worth some thousands of pounds, in land, houses, and horses.</p>
  <p>Worrall, in the actual matter of fact version, never advertised the  farm for sale; no talk of any ghost appeared in the proceedings at the trial.  Both Fisher and Worrall were ex-convicts, and both bore but indifferent  characters. The crime was an ordinary, brutal, clumsy murder. Nor were there  any of the sensational effects recorded by romancists attending either its  discovery or the expiation of it.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page034a.jpg" width="636" height="650"></p>
  <p>Actually the most striking and dramatic incident of the whole case was  furnished by the blackfellow, Gilbert, employed as tracker, when, skimming the  top of the pool with a leaf, he tasted it, and exclaimed that it was &ldquo;the fat  of a white man!&rdquo; But Worrall did not, in spite of the story writers, throw the  body of the victim into the pool at all. He merely hid it in some rushes close  by. Then, growing uneasy, he removed it, and buried it a few yards away. Of  course, the juices of the decomposing body may have drained into the pool. But,  probably, Gilbert was only &ldquo;gammoning&rdquo; and he, or his fellows, had already seen  indications of the grave. However, here condensed, are the false and the true  stories of &ldquo;Fisher&rsquo;s Ghost;&rdquo; but to convince many folk that the first version,  ghost and all, is not the correct one, would be a very hard task.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page034b.jpg" width="800" height="618"></p>
  <p>Let us now take a glance at the Sydney of 1826-28. George-street was,  of course, the main, and, indeed, the only thoroughfare of importance, and  extended, with many and frequent gaps, for about a mile and a half along the  hollow through the centre of which once ran the Tank Stream&mdash;now a trickling  rill being gradually civilised out of existence. &ldquo;The town,&rdquo; writes an  historian of that day, &ldquo;occupies the whole of the hollow, creeping up the  gradual ascent on each side. The ridge on the left is successively crowned by  the lofty-looking buildings of the horse barracks, the colonial hospital, the convict  barracks, and a fine Gothic Catholic chapel; beyond these lies the promenade of  Hyde Park, flanked towards the town by a row of pretty cottages, and towards  the country by a high brick-walled garden appertaining to the Goverment. On the  ridge to the right of the Cove, rows above rows of neat white cottages present  themselves, overlooked by the commanding position of Fort Phillip, with its  signal post and telegraphic appendages (these last probably the semaphore by  means of which communication was maintained with the Governor when absent at  Parramatta). Following this, we behold, in succession, the military hospital  and windmill, St. James&rsquo;s Church, the Gothic Presbyterian Kirk (Dr. Lang&rsquo;s),  and, beyond these, the military barracks, forming three-fourths of a large  square (now Wynyard), and opening to George-street, with an extensive green  plot in the centre for purposes of parade. The portion of the town to the right  is best known as the Rocks&hellip; This is considered the St. Giles, and the division  of the town to the left the St. James, portion of Sydney, most of the superior  citizens inhabiting the latter, and the lower classes chiefly the former&mdash;though  The Rocks can undoubtedly boast of many handsome houses, with highly  respectable inmates. A few hundred yards from the head of the Cove, towards the  left, stands the Governor&rsquo;s house, with its beautiful domain in front. On the  right shore of the Cove,&rdquo; continues our author, &ldquo;you first see the mansion of  Mr. R. Campbell, one of our oldest and most respectable merchants, with its  garden full of flowers and fruit trees, and wharf and storehouse next the beach;  next, you observe the town house of Captain Piper; then the Government  dockyard, against the surrounding walls whereof are built the working sheds and  storehouses, with its boat landings and little wet docks scooped out of the  adjoining shore; then came the high buildings composing the commissary stores,  beyond which is the wooden Government wharf jutting out into the harbor; and,  further on, the landing warehouses of the various merchants connected with our  imports and export trade, a low wall there terminating the Cove, to prevent its  being filled up by the alluvial deposits from the rivulet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The above is, perhaps, the best description extant of Circular Quay and  its surroundings some seventy odd years ago.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page034c.jpg" width="800" height="608"></p>
  <p>The land near the Cove was the most valuable of any, and there the  houses were built adjoining each other; further along they straggled in rows of  detached cottages, whitewashed, and generally one-storey in height; a verandah  in front, enclosed with a paling fence, and standing each in its own garden.  There are still a few of these ancient residences to be found, but not in  George street. The streets were wide because their boundaries were as yet so  slightly defined; they were unpaved and unlit, and troops of homeless cows and  goats roamed them by night and by day.</p>
  <p>Even then, in its second youth, Sydney must have presented a  pre-eminently English aspect, for one visitor says that but for the cages of  bright-coloured birds exposed for sale (look at Lower George-street now) and  the gangs of convicts marching to and fro in single file in their yellow or  grey jackets, and canvas overalls, &ldquo;daubed with broad arrows, P.B.&rsquo;s, C.B.&rsquo;s  and various numerals m black white, and red, with perhaps the gaol gang straggling  by sulkily in their jingling leg-chains,&rdquo; he might easily have imagined himself  &ldquo;at home.&rdquo; He, however, forgets the climate.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Gothic Catholic Chapel,&rdquo; mentioned above, is, of course, St. Mary&rsquo;s  or rather was the forerunner of the present great cathedral of that name, not  built until many years later, and even now incomplete. Writing in 1834, Dr.  Lang says: &ldquo;The Roman Catholic Chapel is an ambitious edifice, built of hewn  stone in the form of a cross, and occuping a very prominent situation when  viewed from the water.&rdquo; The foundation had been laid by Macquarie in October,  1821; and the Rev. J. J. Therry was the person to whose exertions much of the  success of its erection was due.</p>
  <p>But to return to our city of &lsquo;26-28. Goulburn-street was then  absolutely houseless; and for this reason was often quoted to strangers by the  jokers of the town as remarkable for no burglary ever having taken place in it.</p>
  <p>There were six places of worship: St. Phillips&rsquo;, St. George&rsquo;s, the  Scots&rsquo; Kirk, a Methodist chapel, and St. Mary&rsquo;s; there was a male orphan school  endowed by the State; and a benevolent asylum supported by private charity.  There were two steam flour mills, three water mills, and numerous windmills  which could turn a bushel of wheat into flour in a little over ten minutes.  Sydney now, too, produced its own spirits; a Mr. Cooper having started a  distillery about a mile along the Parramatta-road, a continuation of  George-street. Also, a Mr. Underwood established another upon the South Head  road. Thus, the citizens were amply supplied with home-made &ldquo;tanglefoot&rdquo; or, as  the papers of the day termed it, &ldquo;a pure spirit manufactured from the good  grain of the colony.&rdquo; </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page035.jpg" width="800" height="472"></p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Australia&rdquo; (once the first post office and home of Nichols) and  the &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; hotels in George-street, and Hill&rsquo;s Tavern, close to Hyde Park,  were said to be as good houses as those in any English town of the same size.  But there were many low pot-houses and &ldquo;publics&rdquo; scattered broadcast about the  place. Lodgings were very reasonable, the most respectable ones seldom  exceeding a pound per week, and averaging fifteen shillings each for a double  room&mdash;&ldquo;the landlady making all your purchases, and cooking and serving up all  your meals for this sum.&rdquo; At most street corners were fruit stands, from which  noisy sellers bawled their wares&mdash;a feature of our city still in full swing. The  town was divided into six police districts, each with a lockup and a night  watch attached. As to its water supply, Sydney appears to have been still  dependent on the Tank Stream excavations, but these, in a dry season, being  found inadequate, the authorities were casting about for some other source of  supply. Let us hope that the soldier&rsquo;s wives, who, as already mentioned, a  writer alleges, in 1816, washed clothes in the tanks, had discontinued the  habit.</p>
  <p>Even now amusements were very few indeed: the news of the world was six  months old when it arrived, and then only brought broken and garbled accounts.  Personal scandal still formed the most prominent feature of &ldquo;society&rdquo; talk.  Certainly, Mr. James Underwood (by the way, the builder of the first vessel  launched in Sydney) was said to be erecting a theatre, but of this undertaking  little else is to be learned. Indeed, in these days the gaol was turned into a  theatre, &ldquo;a Temple of Thespis, the debtor&rsquo;s room afforded the arena, and  persons of the highest standing in the town were not ashamed to witness the  crude representations of these dramatic enthusiasts.&rdquo; Not till 1833 did Sydney  possess a regular bona fide theatre, the &ldquo;Theatre Royal,&rdquo; opened by Mr. Barrett  Levy, the licensee of the Royal Hotel in George-street, who had some time  subsequently fitted up the saloon of that establishment for the exhibition of  the legitimate drama.</p>
  <p>The fair sex kept up the fashions as well as they could, natheless laboring  under many disadvantages. &ldquo;The moment a lady blooming fresh from England is  known to be tripping along a Sydney street you will see our prying fair, singly  or in groups, popping eagerly to take notes of the cut of her gown, the figure  of her bonnet, and the pattern and colour of the scarf, or shawl, she displays  upon her shoulders, that they may forthwith post off to put themselves in the &lsquo;dear  fashion&rsquo; too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor did our grandmothers grudge the cash to pay for their newest modes;  for one person who kept a ladies&rsquo; &ldquo;fashionable repository,&rdquo; we are told,  departed home with a nice little fortune of &pound;12,000, all acquired in less than  six years.</p>
  <p>It may be worth noticing that in the first three months of 1826 eight  hundred people, exclusive of those committed to the Criminal Court, had passed  before the Sydney Bench. But on March 12, in the same year, to the amazement of  the magistrates, there was not a solitary case. This unprecedented incident so  staggered the court that, fearing the citizens were becoming downhearted, it  issued no less than 76 spirit licences that same morning. As to the more  detailed topography of the city, accounts differ materially; the earlier ones,  written mostly by people on the spot, deal in generalities as to the locality,  and their authors, thoughtless for posterity, seem to imagine that everybody  would be always as wise as themselves respecting matters of such common  knowledge. Which practice still obtains. We know for certain, however, such  facts as that where Petty&rsquo;s hotel now stands was in these years Captain Rossi&rsquo;s  garden (Rossi was then police magistrate); that cattle were slaughtered at  Dawes&mdash;then Slaughter-house&mdash;Point; that people used to get their fire-wood in  the neighbourhood of Cooper&rsquo;s distillery, already spoken of; that where the big  shop of David Jones and Company now stands was a cowyard; a butcher&rsquo;s premises  held the site of Kidman&rsquo;s. In York-street stood a stocks, and the youngsters&rsquo;  great amusement was to pelt the unfortunates both there and in the pillories  with rotten eggs and vegetables from the market.</p>
  <p>Until Busby brought water in from the Lachlan swamp, by means of a  drain to Hyde Park, whence the citizens carted or carried it, the tanks formed  the sole supply&mdash;useless in a drought. Surry Hills was mostly all open country,  dotted sparsely with market gardens, and a few large private residences.  Between Woolloomooloo and Darlinghurst lay a deep scrub-covered valley, through  which a creek ran, and emptied itself into the bay. Children used to frequent  Flagstaff Hill, where our Observatory now stands, to cut the bushes with which  it was overgrown; out of these they made brooms. Broadly, the city boundaries  were, in these days:&mdash;On the north, the harbor; on the south, the long low ridge  of the Surry Hills; on the west, the &ldquo;beautiful lagoon of clear and extensive  salt water running two miles inland north and south&rdquo; (Darling Harbor); and on  the east, the deep valley already mentioned. Our limitations at this time were  narrow, indeed! Still, from the last period in which we had a glance at it, the  place had grown wonderfully, showing with every year that in modern parlance it  had decidedly &ldquo;come to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In 1830 was laid, by the Chief Justice of New South Wales, the  foundation-stone of the Sydney College (now our present Sydney Grammar School).  Inserted in the stone was a brass plate, with an inscription, reading: &ldquo;This  foundation stone of the Sydney College&mdash;an institution founded for the vigorous  and pious promotion of polite literature, and the liberal arts among the youth  of Australia&mdash;was laid by Francis Forbes, Chief Justice of New South Wales, on  an auspicious day, viz., the 26th of January, in the year of our Lord 1830, in  the happy reign of George IV., Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling being Governor  of New South Wales.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was erected on a portion of over an acre and a half of land, the gift  of Sir Thomas Brisbane, in 1825, to an institution known then as the Sydney  Free Grammar School, conducted in a private house, but discontinued in the  succeeding year. This land was &ldquo;very eligibly situated near the racecourse,&rdquo;  and the foundation ceremony was attended by, besides the general public, over  eighty of the trustees, who walked in procession from the Royal Hotel to the  site of the building. As in our day, so in theirs, our worthy forbears probably  seldom neglected the rite of &ldquo;wetting the stone.&rdquo; The &ldquo;saloon&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo;  however, it should be in all fairness mentioned, was their usual meeting place,  being rented from Mr. Levy for that purpose. The Chief Justice made a speech at  the ceremony, and Dr. Lang &ldquo;improved the occasion.&rdquo; The function ended &ldquo;with  the acclamations of all present, in testimony of their joy on so interesting  and auspicious an occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The first president was the Hon. Francis Forbes, with Messrs. Sam.  Torry and George Allen as treasurer and secretary respectively. And on the  first committee appear such well-known names as those of Sir John Jamieson,  Dr. Lang, Messrs. Sydney and Francis Stephen, J. E. Manning, W. Bland, D.  Cooper, S. Lord, and others, all intimately connected with the past and present  history of the city.</p>
  <p>The architect was Edward Allen, who took rank as a &ldquo;benefactor&rdquo; through  foregoing a third of his professional fees&mdash;&pound;125&mdash;for the benefit of the  institution. The requisite sum for the erection of the college was to be raised  by the sale of 200 shares of &pound;50 each, &ldquo;50 additional shares to be left open  for the convenience of residents in the East Indies or elsewhere beyond seas,  until the first day of January, A.D. 1833.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a progress payment college account, during 1830, appears an item, &ldquo;Paid  Mr. Iredale for spades, picks, etc., &pound;1 4s 2d;&rdquo; a memento, this, of the  founding of the present house of Lassetter and Company. Amongst the  shareholders occur the name of John Tawell (the convict Quaker, transported for  forgery); Mrs. Reiby (at one time supposed to be Margaret Catchpole), W. C.  Wentworth (late one of the committee), Robert Howe (editor of the &ldquo;Sydney  Gazette&rdquo;), Robert Campbell (the first merchant), and many others of note and notoriety.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page036.jpg" width="800" height="596"></p>
  <p>On January 19, 1835, the college was opened with Mr. W. T. Cape as its  headmaster, and some cash and shares in hand, an omen of prosperity and good  management that, as all of us well know, was not transitory, but has continued  throughout the history of the colony to the present day.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter  VII.<br>
    The Early Thirties.</b></h2>
  <p>WE have seen what took place at some of the anniversary dinners, and  how they gradually assumed a patriotic aspect; the emancipists, who formed the  guests, talking more &ldquo;reform&rdquo; than social business. Wentworth, &ldquo;the apostle of  liberty,&rdquo; and Darling could not hit it at all; the Governor looking upon a  patriot as little better than a rebel. So that Wentworth had to keep pretty  quiet, not even attending the great dinner of 1831&mdash;the forty-third anniversary.  The promoters said they were not going to talk politics at all. Indeed, they  called themselves &ldquo;The Australian Society to Promote the Growth and Consumption  of Colonial Produce and Manufacture;&rdquo; a sort of Chamber of Commerce,  established some time before by the principal men of business in Sydney. These  gentlemen invited their friends to dinner at Morris&rsquo;s Crown and Anchor Hotel in  George-street. Tickets were 10s.</p>
  <p>At sunrise on the 26th the Royal Standard was hoisted at Dawes Point,  and the guns there and at Fort Macquarie, at noon, fired a salute of  forty-three (one for each year), the two batteries firing alternately. At  dinner, no less than 130 guests assembled, with Samuel Terry (then, perhaps the  richest man in the colony), as president; and Daniel Cooper (the knight&rsquo;s  uncle) in the vice-chair. They toasted Macquarie as usual; &ldquo;Currency Lads and  Lasses&rdquo; (the name given to the Australian-born men and women); &ldquo;The Judges and  the Bar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;William Charles Wentworth,&rdquo; whose name was the subject for a  tremendous outburst of cheering. Then, all at once, the meeting seems to have  lost its head or, at least the younger members of it did, and violent oratory  took the place of trade talk; Darling was arraigned as a tyrant; and sedition ousted  commerce. Hall, the proprietor of the &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; who was present, was held up  as an example of one of Darling&rsquo;s victims, prosecuted time after time,  imprisoned, stripped of his property, deprived of his church pew, even, for  simply criticising the Government policy in his newspaper. Nicolls and other  young orators fairly carried the assembly with them; and their elders, grave  and reverend merchants, who had come to talk a little shop, found themselves,  before they knew where they were, cheering the speakers, and volubly talking treason&mdash;or  what in those days, was held to be very much akin to it. It was a memorable  dinner.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page037.jpg" width="764" height="535"></p>
  <p>Gradually the press was beginning to be a power in the land. The Howes,  were gone, and men like Wentworth, Nicholls, and Hall had replaced them. Robert  Howe of the &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; was dead&mdash;drowned whilst fishing off Pinchgut with his  infant son. The latter was, however, rescued by a sailor. Some kind hand writes  of Howe: &ldquo;That he was eccentric cannot be denied, but his were errors of the  head, not of the heart. As an affectionate husband and father&mdash;a kind and  considerate master&mdash;he was second to none. His hand was ever open to relieve the  distressed; and of his charities few knew the extent. May his errors be  forgotten, and the recollection of his many redeeming qualities be at once his  excuse and his epitaph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>During the last year of Darling&rsquo;s reign also died another old identity,  in the person of Boongaree, king of one of the principal coast tribes in the  neighbourhood of Port Jackson. Governors King, Hunter, Bligh, Macquarie and  Brisbane had been his patrons and protectors. Indeed, he seems to have been a  favourite with everybody. Macquarie had given him land for himself and his  tribe to camp upon between Milson&rsquo;s Point and George&rsquo;s Head; and every King&rsquo;s  Birthday when the Governor put it on his new uniform Boongaree got the old one;  and, minus the trousers and boots, which nothing could induce him to wear, he  used to parade Sydney in great state. He was a splendid mimic&mdash;as so many of his  countrymen in their wild state are still&mdash;and could, with wonderful accuracy,  depict the gestures and peculiarities of the various Governors and high  officials whom he had served under.</p>
  <p>Boongaree died in November, 1830, and he was buried on Garden Island,  and, finding there very good company in Major John Owens and Judge-Advocate  Bent, who, together with Captain Logan, late Commandant at Moreton Bay, and  mysteriously murdered there, had been brought and placed in his friend Bent&rsquo;s  tomb.</p>
  <p>The island then looked very different. Its two hummocks&mdash;one to the  north and one to the south&mdash;have now been levelled and built upon, and the whole  place turned into a depot for naval stores belonging to the Imperial Goverment.  But in those days it must have seemed an ideally peaceful place of sepulchre.  Since Phillip tried to grow cabbages there, little had been done to the island;  but, some thirty years before Boongaree was buried, a redoubt, carrying a few  guns, had been erected fronting the harbour fairway.</p>
  <p>When the island was made an Imperial naval depot the bodies were  removed to the burial ground of St. Thomas&rsquo;s church at North Sydney, where, at this  day, the curious can inspect the cenotaph that covers their remains.</p>
  <p>Queen Gooseberry, the consort of Boongaree, survived her lord and master  some years. She, however, was buried over on the North Shore; but the body was  afterwards removed to the Devonshire-street Cemetery, Redfern, where, until the  recent removals, her tomb was still to be seen. &nbsp;A Sydney gentleman is in possession of the brass  cup, holding about a pint, in which the old lady used to receive her state  allowance of rum. Altogether, we may take it that the pair had a very good time  under the rule of the white invader. Says a newspaper of the time: The  well-known aboriginal Chief, Boongaree, died, after a lingering illness, at  Garden Island. The facetiousness of the native Chief, and the superiority of  his mental endowments over those of the generality of his race, obtained for  him a more than ordinary share of regard from the whole inhabitants of the  colony, which was testified to by frequent donations suited to his condition,  not only from private individuals, but from the authorities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On May 14, 1831, the first steamer arrived from England. Her name was  the Sophia Jane, Biddulph master (he was once a lieutenant in the Royal Navy).  She came via the Cape of Good Hope, carrying passengers and cargo. This was the  first steamer to enter Port Jackson, although a couple of months earlier a  small steamer had been launched on the waters of the harbor. She was called the  Surprise, and made her trial trip from Sydney Cove to Parramatta in four hours.  Henry Gilbert Smith, one of the directors of the Commercial Bank, was her  owner, and she was brought out from England in sections to his order, put  together at Neutral Bay, and launched there on March 31, 1831. Captain Devlin,  already referred to as the first to be born in the colony of Australian  parents, was her commander; and the late Hon. George Thornton one of the  passengers on her trial trip. She does not, however, for some reason or other,  seem to have been a success, and was presently sold to a Hobart Town firm. A  few particulars about the Sophia Jane may be of interest, seeing that she was  our first steam coaster, as well as our first tug.</p>
  <p>Originally, she was built for the English coasting trade, and was  bought by a Sydney firm, for &pound;8000, to run between that port and Newcastle. She  had accommodation for 53 passengers in three classes; was 126ft in length, 26ft  in beam, and drew 6ft of water. Her tonnage was 256; her engines of 50  horse-power, and her draught of water only 6ft. Her top speed was eight knots  an hour; and she towed the first ship ever taken in that manner from her  anchorage in Port Jackson out to sea. This vessel was the Lady Harewood  (Storehouse master), which arrived in Sydney on March 4, 1831, from England  with prisoners, and left again on June 12 in the same year, bound to London.  Apparently, she was left to find her own way in&mdash;so far at least as a tow was  concerned.</p>
  <p>This year of &lsquo;31 seems to have been prolific in steamer records, for in  October there was launched on the Williams River the first one actually built  in Australia. Her builder was J. H. Grose, of Parramatta, and she, too, was  placed in the Newcastle-Sydney trade.</p>
  <p>The Sophia Jane must have been as much a revelation to the citizens of  her day as were the great liners of the P. and O. and Orient to those of our  own. Perhaps, too, she was &ldquo;thrown open to inspection,&rdquo; much after the same  manner as each new ship is to us, and the Currency lads and lasses paid their  money, and roamed over, and explored, and wondered and praised as we do when  some fresh marvel of constructive sea-science appears in our harbor.  Eventually, the historic vessel was broken up by Mr. Chowne, of Pyrmont, who  had seen her launched in England. Mr. Chowne used some of her timbers to build  a craft called, appropriately enough, the &ldquo;O.P.S.,&rdquo; because constructed from  old pieces of ships.</p>
  <p>During 1831, appeared the first number of the &ldquo;Sydney Herald.&rdquo; The  paper was started by Messrs. Stevens and Stokes, as a weekly, with the motto, &ldquo;Bound  to no party; of no sect am I.&rdquo; This declaration, however, was dropped when the  paper fell into the hands of the late Mr. James Fairfax.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the year, Governor Darling left the colony, &ldquo;after  having consistently,&rdquo; as one writer puts it, &ldquo;during the whole of his office,  attempted to throttle the aspiration of a young people, after the freedom due  to them.&rdquo; Lang, on the other hand, has much to say that is good of him.</p>
  <p>Another military governor soon took hold on the reins of office in the  person of Major-General Richard Bourke, one of whose first public visits was  made to the distillery of Mr. James Underwood, near to South Head road, which  he minutely inspected, and doubtless liberally tested the produce of.</p>
  <p>The new Governor, also, early showed himself a liberal patron of the  drama. We have already seen how Mr. Levy had given performances in the saloon  of his Royal Hotel. And here, on December 26, 1832, &ldquo;money was publicly taken at  the doors,&rdquo; Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black-Eyed Susan&rdquo; was the play; whilst Moncrieff&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Monsieur Tonson&rdquo; was selected for the farce. Encouraged by the success of his  venture, Mr. Levy built the Theatre Royal, and opened it in the latter part of  1833, with the best company that he could get together. Mr. Meredith was the  first manager. The new theatre, it should be noted, stood just at the back of  the hotel, and held about 900 people. A preliminary &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; was held under  the special patronage of the Governor. This entertainment consisted of thirteen  sketches, nine songs, (no encores allowed), and selections by the band of the  17th regiment. Half an hour interval was allowed for the audience to &ldquo;liquefy  their palates,&rdquo; much, we may be sure, to the profit of the adjacent &ldquo;Royal.&rdquo;  Such was the house-warming of our first actual and legitimate theatre. In  October, it opened with &ldquo;The Miller and His Men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Irishman in London.&rdquo;  The admission was 5s per head, and people thought themselves lucky to get a seat  at that. The press had little to say as to the merits of the performance.  Knowles being the only actor singled out for mention. Perhaps critics were blessedly  scarce in those days, and wisely preferred to let alone what they were not quite  certain about.</p>
  <p>With Bourke&rsquo;s advent, the press began to hold up its head again. A  contemporary of the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette,&rdquo; on July 3, 1832, remarks mysteriously: &ldquo;Gazette  afflicted with cholera morbus,&rdquo; also suffered much from &ldquo;sore eyes&rdquo; during the  latter part of the year. But in November (under Bourke&rsquo;s beneficent rule) we  find, &ldquo;Sydney Gazette,&rdquo; which had been in a declining state, pronounced out of  danger. &ldquo;Cholera&rdquo; and &ldquo;sore eyes&rdquo; quite gone. Jokes, these, that if falling  rather dulled on our ears three generations later, were, you may depend on it,  thoroughly appreciated and chuckled over by their makers and readers.</p>
  <p>Besides the &ldquo;Government Gazette,&rdquo; published weekly, there were now  (1834), the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette,&rdquo; published three times a week, and the &ldquo;Herald&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; twice a week. The &ldquo;Australian&rdquo; had been discontinued for some  time; but it presently started again as a weekly. There was, too, a paper  called the &ldquo;Currency Lad,&rdquo; owned and edited by a native born, and for that  reason very popular, indeed, with young Australia. But it soon died; its  friends averred for lack of a proper press, its enemies for lack of principle.  The first serial publication in Sydney was &ldquo;The New South Wales Magazine,&rdquo;  edited by the Rev. Ralph Mansfield, an ex-Wesleyan missionary, and the  successor of Howe in the management of the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette,&rdquo; and Dr. John  Shlotsky, M.D., a Bavarian. Fancy the courage of those men in trying to run a  magazine sixty-seven years ago! Mansfield, by the way, in addition to his other  avocations, was the leading one of the four booksellers then in Sydney. What  would not a bibliophile now give for the privilege of a free run amongst their  original stock?</p>
  <p>A curious incident happened in the earlier part of Bourke&rsquo;s rule, and one  that scared the citizens not a little. A brig called the Anne Jamieson lay  alongside the King&rsquo;s wharf discharging her London cargo. All her gunpowder was  supposed to have been removed to the magazine on the North Shore. Nevertheless,  she blew up with a tremendous explosion, and eight people were killed. The  casks containing the powder had, it appears, leaked freely during the voyage,  and their contents had spread among the bar and rod iron, of which her cargo  was, in a great measure, composed. Thus, when discharging, the friction set up  by drawing these out ignited the powder. The vessel was totally destroyed; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  as the old chronicler remarks, &ldquo;a melancholy occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page038.jpg" width="800" height="625"></p>
  <p>Old Dr. Lang, about this time, complains about the &ldquo;grossieretes&rdquo; (bad  manners) frequently in evidence amongst the audience at the Theatre Royal, and,  inferentially, thanks God that he has never attended a performance there. But  he was always girding at something. In the language of our present &ldquo;Currency  lads,&rdquo; he would have been termed &ldquo;a hard old case.&rdquo; He lived in  Jamieson-street, not far from his church, and cynically studied the manners of  the citizens, retaining always a deadly antipathy to emancipists; fostering  free emigration (he imported Scotch masons to build his church, and encouraged  thousands of immigrants to settle in the colony,) and showing, in spite of all  his aggressiveness a fine pride in the city, for which, despite his many faults  and foibles, he did much. Listen to his description of how the people take  their pleasure:&mdash;</p>
  <p>About 4 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, before dinner in the haut ton  circles, but some after it among people of inferior station, all the  coach-house doors in Sydney fly open simultaneously, and the company begin to  take their places for the afternoon drive on the South Head road (formed by  Macquarie, and running out to the lighthouse erected by him). In half an hour,  the streets are comparatively deserted; by far the greater portion of the  well-dressed part of the population being out of town. In the meantime, the  long line of equipages&mdash;from the ponderous coach of the member of council,  moving leisurely and proudly along, or the lively barouche of Mr. Whalebone,  the shipowner, to the one-horse shay, in which the landlord of the Tinker&rsquo;s  Arms drives out his blowzy dame to take the hair arter dinner doubles Hyde Park  corner, and arrives on the Corso; while ever and anon some young bachelor  merchant or military officer, eager to display his skill in horsemanship,  dashes briskly forward along the cavalcade at full gallop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in your mind&rsquo;s eye, you can see the grim old doctor shake his head  in censure of what he deems foolish ostentation, and waste of time, as he takes  his solitary way to &ldquo;contemplate the wonderful works of God in the romantic  walks of the Government Domain&hellip; along the margin of beautifully romantic walks,  traced with the utmost taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was during the passage of the Stirling Castle, the vessel that  brought Lang and his fifty Scots masons out, that the idea of the Sydney School  of Arts was first mooted, although the doctor himself, seems, just then, to  have had little to do with it, leaving the matter in the hands of a  fellow-minister, the Rev. Henry Carmichael. This gentleman organised,  throughout the voyage, classes among his fellow-passengers, for their better  education, and enlightenment; thus these hard headed Scots wrestled for months  with the mysteries of algebra, Euclid, logarithms, and the higher mathematics,  besides Scriptural theses and several ologies. Not only was this course of  study pursued at the time, but rules and an agreement sketched for its  prosecution and continuance when Australia should be reached.</p>
  <p>But on arrival there was so much else to be thought about and done,  that but for Mr. Carmichael&rsquo;s tireless efforts, and the liberal encouragement  of Sir Richard Bourke, the scheme would have come to naught. As it was, it  flourished and took root. The story of its actual inception is most  interesting. A Mr. John Riddell Fenwick, left a written statement with the then  president, Mr. Dalgarno, in 1887, to the following effect :</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the reign of William IV., year 1833, January 19, at 10 o&rsquo;clock in  the forenoon, three men and a boy ascended Church Hill for the purpose of  forming and founding the first School of Arts in all the Australian colonies: the  union being represented in the persons of Mr. John Reilly saddler, Pitt-street,  formerly George-street, a native of Ireland, shrewd, sharp, and clear sighted;  Mr. William Hipkiss, botanist, native of England; and Mr. David Taylor, a builder,  and a native of Scotland&hellip; They entered a brick building (probably the old  Surveyor-General&rsquo;s Office), situated half way between Dr. Lang&rsquo;s church and the  windmill, by a side door into a long, narrow room at one end of which was a  window, with twelve squares of 12 x 10 glass. A small bedroom table was placed  end-on to the window. Three empty brandy cases were put near the table for  seats. Pen, ink, paper, and a copy of the rules of an English School of Arts  were put on the table. Mr. Reilly was chosen chairman, Mr. Hipkiss secretary,  and Mr. Taylor treasurer. A strange noise being heard outside the building, the  boy went to ascertain the cause. He returned and informed Mr. Reilly that it  was made by 200 men in irons, escorted by a detachment of the 17th Regiment.  Then, said Mr. Reilly, &lsquo;the work we are engaged in to-day will assist to  unrivet those chains, and allow those people to become men again, and not as  now, beasts of burden.&rsquo; Then, looking at the boy, he said, &lsquo;You will, no doubt,  in the course of nature, be alive after we have passed away. Promise me that  you will always mention who were the founders of the Sydney School of Arts.&rsquo;  Which promise I now fulfil, and wish this statement to be read at the annual  meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Dalgamo added that Messrs. Reilly, Hipkiss, and Taylor had all  passed away, leaving only the boy, who accompanied them, to live to see the  magnitude of the present School of Arts. Also, on the president&rsquo;s motion, Mr.  Fenwick, was made an honorary life member of the institution.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page039a.jpg" width="764" height="650"></p>
  <p>In the following March of 1833, more formal proceedings were taken and  a public meeting held. Among the speakers were such men as Mr. Carmichael, Mr.  Edward Deas-Thompson, the Rev. Ralph Mansfield, Mr. Charles Windeyer, and Dr.  Lang. In 1835, it was removed to its present site, having then on its roll 112  members. Not, however, until 1859 did Sir W. Denison lay the foundation-stone  of the building of our day. Unfortunately, no official record was kept of the  proceedings of which Mr. Fenwick writes; but it was probably only a preliminary  meeting on the part of the three representatives, informal, and hardly to be  spoken of as a &ldquo;founding&rdquo; but still the first in Australia with such an object  in view.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter  VIII.<br>
    The Later Thirties. </b></h2>
  <p>In the thirties there was as yet no street connecting Sydney Cove with  Darling Harbor. And this fact led to the making of the Argyle Cut. &ldquo;The Rocks&rdquo;  at this time was looked upon as a rising suburb, and Miller&rsquo;s Point had become  quite fashionable. Fears were on that account expressed that such an enterprise  as cutting through the dividing ridge would harm the locality by introducing an  undesirable class of residents. But those people whose interests lay around the  shores of Darling Harbour (late Cockle Bay) persevered, and agitated a long  time for either a tunnel or a cut. The Surveyor-General reported upon it, and there  was as much discussion and argument about the affair as there is to-day  respecting the North Shore Bridge. Finally the cut plan was adopted, the  estimate for that being only &pound;895, as against &pound;7000 for a tunnel. Prisoners  were lent by the Government, and the job was to be finished in twenty-one  months from the beginning of October, 1832. Later on, the contractors made an  offer to build an arch to carry a roadway over the whole affair for an extra  &pound;1500. But funds had run out; and nothing was done for a long time other than  to throw a little bridge across the excavation. There seems to have been about  sixteen or seventeen promoters to the affair, with a capital of some &pound;2000.  Intermittently, gangs of convicts toiled and sweated at elaborating the rude  gorge left by the original contractors, until, when transportation ceased, they  were withdrawn to make way for free labour.</p>
  <p>In 1838, an old writer says: &ldquo;Between the north end of Kent-street, and  where it crosses to Church Hill, a deep cut has been made through the west side  of the hill on which Fort Phillip stands, this part being called &ldquo;The Quarries.&rdquo;  At the southern extremity of the street several cottages and substantial  dwelling-houses have been erected, most of them having small gardens attached,  together with a beautifully diversified landscape view of the water and shores  of Darling Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page039b.jpg" width="800" height="617"></p>
  <p>Gradually, however, the place fell into disrepute, haunted as it was by  gangs of thieves, and worse characters still, whose depredations made it unsafe  both by day and by night. Indeed, in our own time there are lots of folk who  would rather, if possible, avoid taking a walk through the Argyle Cut towards  the small hours; so difficult is it to live down a bad reputation acquired in  early life. There are people living now who well remember the first bridge, a  ramshackle, ricketty affair. But the second was looked upon as a very fine  piece of work indeed; it was lit by a big kerosene lamp for the guidance of  late wayfarers across the chasm. Before the whole work was finished it must  have cost something like &pound;30,000, including the three present massive  bridges&mdash;worthy specimens of old-time masonry that will, unless the resumption  scheme destroys them, last for many generations yet to come. </p>
  <p>Just a word as to how Sydney folk amused themselves out of doors since  we last glanced at them taking their scant pleasures sadly enough. Some  authorities, notably Lang, as we have seen, alluded to the racing and drinking propensities  of the people in Brisbane&rsquo;s time, making mention, too, of not a little gambling  in out-of-the-way corners. Probably, even then, there were &ldquo;two-up&rdquo; schools in  sequestered nooks, and our grandfathers, as likely as not, were proficient at  the old-time equivalent for &ldquo;heading &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But as far back as 1810 we have records that they indulged in wilder  species of recreation than these. In that year, for instance, at Parramatta  there was what we should now call a &ldquo;carnival,&rdquo; the principal attractions of a  two days&rsquo; sport being cock-fighting and bull-baiting. They hunted, too, and the  description of the first run is worth reading: &ldquo;Having cast off by the  Government hut on the Nepean, and drawn the cover around there for a native dog  unsuccessfully, we tried the forest ground for a kangaroo, which we soon found.  It went off in excellent style along the sands by the river side, and crossed  the cow-pasture plains (Camden), running a circle of about two miles, then  recrossed, taking a direction for Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s stock-yard, and thence to the  back of the Badge Allen Hill to the head of the Boonobohen Creek, where he was  headed. Thence he took the main range of the hills between Badge Allen and  Badge Allenbingiee in a straight direction for Mr. Throsby&rsquo;s farm where the  hounds ran into him, and he was killed after a grand run of about two hours.  The weight of the animal was upwards of 120lbs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently an &ldquo;old man&rdquo; with a very fine turn of speed; either that or  his pursuers did not press him as closely as they might have done.</p>
  <p>Pugilism was the rage in England in those days, but little seems to  have taken place in that line out here, the first record of anything of the  kind being in 1814, when John Berringer met Charles Sefton, about half a mile  from the racecourse (Hyde Park), and fought for two and a half hours. Sefton is  said to have been the &ldquo;cleverest&rdquo; of the pair. But Berringer won the &ldquo;mill&rdquo;  after very hard fighting, by reason of his greater reach and height.</p>
  <p>Boat racing was always a favourite pastime. Mention, in referring to  Devlin, has already been made of the whale-boat race in 1830. But long before  that there was a trial of speed from Bradley&rsquo;s Head into the Cove, over a  course of 3&frac12; miles. The competitors were Captain Piper, naval officer of the  port; Captain Lawle, of the Batavia, Captain Johnson, of the Guildford, and  Captain Bell, of the Minerva&mdash;all vessels lying in the harbour. The winner was  Captain Piper. In 1827, the first actual regatta took place. Its inception  seems to have been due altogether to the Hon. Captain Rous (afterwards the  well-known sporting admiral), who entered two boats of his own in the pulling  match&mdash;the Mercury and the Centipede&mdash;and won the first and second events with  them. The course was some 4 miles; time, 23min. This event was followed by a  sailing race, for a purse of 50dol., put together by the officers of H. M.  ships Rainbow and Success, added to a sweepstakes of 5dol. each. The course was  from abreast of Farm Cove, round the Sow and Pigs, and back to the starting  place. Lieutenant Preston proved the winner with his boat &ldquo;Black Swan,&rdquo; coming  in a mile and a half ahead. Then, to finish up with, there was a race for  watermen, the prize 50dol. No boat was to exceed 19ft in the keel, but could  pull any number of oars. The course was round Pinchgut. There were seven  starters, but four cried enough after the first heat. Finally, Black Boy, owner  James Shears, took the lead and won, beating Native Youth and Bungaree by  lengths.</p>
  <p>Such is a brief record of the first regatta that ever took place in our  waters, the herald of our great institution of the present day, when scores of  graceful fliers spread their white wings and speed to and fro the great steamer  doing duty as flagship, and moored perhaps in just the same spot as that in which  the bluff-bowed old whaler or merchantman served a similar purpose over three  score and ten years ago.</p>
  <p>Wherever the Anglo-Saxon sets his foot he plays cricket, and Australia  was no exception to the axiom. The first game that any account can be found of  took place on January 1, 1827, when the members of the Australia Cricket Club  played together, and had a dinner in the evening. Windsor had been challenged,  but for some reason or other refused to come to the scratch. But in 1830 there  was a great match between eleven Australians and an equal number of the 57th  regiment, the former winning by 24 runs. In March they met again, the soldiers  very confident, and played for ten guineas a side. And again the Australians  won; this time by 32 runs.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page040.jpg" width="544" height="650"></p>
  <p>In the late thirties and early forties there was plenty of  sport&mdash;horse-racing, boating, cricket, etc.,&mdash;and the well-to-do citizen could,  if he were so inclined, witness or partake in one or the other of these  pastimes every day in the week, and go to the play in the evening to finish off  with. For strength and agility in athletic exercises our country folk were  pre-eminent, especially those settled about the Hawkesbury, known even then as &ldquo;Cornstalks.&rdquo;  One newspaper, in 1831, gives a list of 32 names of persons each of whom stood  over six feet in height. Among the number was Kable, the champion boxer of that  time; he stood 6ft 3&frac12;in. Even at the present day the Hawkesbury &ldquo;natives&rdquo; are  noted for their stature. A hardy and energetic race they were, too, these men,  made so by their environments, and perhaps less given to &ldquo;letting things slide&rdquo;  than are some of their latter-day prototypes, who depend upon husbandry and  stock-keeping for a livelihood.</p>
  <p>Nor were the early-day horses a whit inferior to their masters in  strength and stamina. As an instance of this, we are told that a mare, whose  foal had just been weaned, and a filly, 2&frac12; years old, were run up out of a  clover field, and ridden a distance of 42 miles in two hours and fifty minutes,  including several stoppages on the road. The journey was for a doctor; neither  of the horses were shod; the going was rough; and the animals had never been  fed on hay or corn. Yet neither of them were the worse for the trip.</p>
  <p>During the six years of Bourke&rsquo;s beneficent rule&mdash;he governed constitutionally  without a constitution&mdash;much of importance took place connected with the growth  of our city, both physically and politically. The Cove was still, at low tide,  little better than a mud flat, littered by boatbuilders&rsquo; ricketty sheds, and  temporarily and rudely constructed little wharves. It is said that the water  then flowed right up to where the Custom House now stands, and that on the site  of the Paragon Hotel a small vessel had been built and launched; and another  one several hundred yards up Pitt-street. Also, that the Tank Stream was still  navigable for small boats as far as Bridge-street. The Stream, respecting which  so many arguments have been held, is now said to have had its source somewhere  about the spot in Hyde Park where there is still to be seen a pond or two&mdash;one  is near the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets&mdash;little noticed by the  general public; thence, according to the best authorities, it followed a course  between George and Pitt streets through Martin Place to Hunter-street thence by  Hamilton-lane, crossing Bridge-street to Pitt-street, and so into the harbor  close to the present North Shore Ferry Co.&rsquo;s premises. But at the best, its  true course is a matter of more or less surmise. The brightest of old memories  vary.</p>
  <p>Be this as it may, the Legislative Council, in 1834 began to think of  resuming and reclaiming the foreshores around the Cove, and the construction of  Circular Quay was mooted. It was suggested that a civil engineer should be imported  on a five years&rsquo; engagement, at a salary of &pound;800 per annum. But the plan seems to  have lapsed, and we hear nothing more of it just then. However, a good deal was  done towards improving Darling Harbor. Bathing in its waters would appear to  have been strictly prohibited, for we read that a certain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lieutenant Finch, of the 17th  Regiment, was fined 5s for indulging in such a luxury. Most people, at the  present time, would not take a dip in it if paid that sum to do so.</p>
  <p>Here, by the way, is a curious advertisement from a London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; of  1834; &ldquo;Any lieutenants in the Royal Navy under the age of 45, and with large  families, may obtain free passages to Sydney, New South Wales. Application  should be made to &lsquo;C.T.,&rsquo; R.N., Post Office, Hythe, Kent.&rdquo; Certain of the  sumptuary laws of the city in these years of the middle thirties and early  forties were decidedly curious. Yet are we not slowly drifting back in  legislation to those benighted times? For instance, on Sunday, shops, excepting  those of butchers, bakers, fishmongers, and greengrocers, were to be closed;  these only kept open till 10 a.m.; bakers might trade only on that day between  1 and 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon; apothecaries at any hour. Constables might  apprehend anybody who could not give a satisfactory account of themselves  between sundown and 8 o&rsquo;clock the next morning. The Surveyor-General (Sir  Thomas Mitchell) was directed to align and set out the carriage and footways,  and mark them by posts; also to place the names of streets on house walls, and  fix numbers on the doors, which the tenant was bound to paint in at the end of  a fortnight, or else pay a fine of 10s weekly. Footways were also to be  levelled, and steps taken away from the path. The town surveyor, too, was  adjured to be on the alert to prevent people accumulating gravel or earth  before their houses &ldquo;without giving notice,&rdquo; in which case he was to remove it  as rubbish.</p>
  <p>At this date there were two posts a day. Every letter or &ldquo;packet,&rdquo;  weighing less than half an ounce was charged for transit from one post office  to the other, in distance not exceding 15 miles, the sum of 4d; over 15 miles,  5d; above 170 miles, 10d; for 300 miles, 1s. Letters sent by ship around the  costal ports cost 4d; American letters cost 3d each. The mails, it may be  remarked, were anything but regular, being forwarded when coach, vessel, or  steam packet pleased to arrive or depart. Society, too, or rather the different  parts of it, was being gradually merged into a more component whole, although  the terms &ldquo;Stirling&rdquo; and &ldquo;Currency&rdquo;&mdash;to distinguish between the English and the  Colonial born&mdash;were yet in use, and the &ldquo;Pure Merinos&rdquo; still prided themselves  on being able to trace a stainless descent, and gave themselves airs on that  account. Recently arrived convicts were still known as &ldquo;Canaries,&rdquo; because of  their yellow uniforms, and people used any other colour for decoration than  yellow. Yellow paint, indeed, was unsaleable. But the word &ldquo;convict&rdquo; was dying  out, and giving place to &ldquo;Government men.&rdquo; Some years before this an emancipist  had even obtained a verdict for libel, with &pound;50 damages against a person who  had called him &ldquo;A d&mdash;d convict.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In 1828-9 there were sailing out of the port four vessels, constantly  employed in the whale fishery; six others in sealing. There were two regular &ldquo;packets&rdquo;  between Sydney and Newcastle; one between Sydney and Hobart Town; others to  Port Dalrymple; and a number of small craft trading to the Hawkesbury, Illawarra  and other places.</p>
  <p>But about the end of Governor Bourke&rsquo;s term of office there were no  less than 60 square-rigged whalers claiming Sydney as their port; 12 steamers  sailed up and down the coast. Fifty-six vessels arrived from Great Britian, 94  from British colonies, 17 foreign, and 5 from American, giving altogether an  aggregate of 67,360 tons. Decidedly, matters were looking up. Emigration, too,  was ever on the increase, as may be judged from the fact that, in 1838, more  than &pound;12,000 was realised by the sales of stores from the emigrant ships. We  drank chiefly rum&mdash;and plenty of it. The revenue from its importations totalled  &pound;189,450; and the amount of drink to 8 gallons per head per annum. But pew  rents in the churches brought in only &pound;6 15s 9d. In the same year, as showing  how well the Government managed to make both ends meet, they had in hand  &pound;364,545 2s 7d, against an outlay of &pound;240,673 11s 8&frac12;d&mdash;they don&rsquo;t bother about  odd halfpennies now a days. But the old-fashioned bookkeeping was nothing if  not exact.</p>
  <p>In &lsquo;36-&rsquo;37 the population of Sydney was 19,729 people, made up by 6794  free men, 2205 boys, 4744 free women, and 2209 girls; 2932 male convicts and  586 female ones. In the city there were five banks, seven or eight churches or  chapels, a couple of insurance companies, three breweries, and two  distilleries. And still the blacks, in puris naturalibus, camped in the streets  and on open pieces of ground. In this connection a schoolmaster makes an  amusingly equivocal report upon an aboriginal pupil who had been sent to him.  Says the padagogue: &ldquo;He shows as much sign of intellect as many of his  school-fellows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Police and gaols&rdquo; was a big item in the budget, totalling no less  than &pound;52,344. &ldquo;Miscellanies,&rdquo; put shortly, came to &pound;77,585. People were not  nearly so inquisitive then as they are now. Fancy a Treasurer calmly presenting  such a statement to the tender mercies of &ldquo;the House&rdquo; in this year of grace!  Luckily, perhaps, for some folk who figured in &ldquo;Miscellanies,&rdquo; there was no &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;&mdash;at  least, no legislative &ldquo;Opposition;&rdquo; and no matter what Wentworth, et ces autres  known as the Patriotic Association, might think or say, the power to act was as  yet denied them.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page041.jpg" width="800" height="441"></p>
  <p>The year 1837 was rendered memorable among other matters by the  establishment of a new party, consisting entirely of the native-born; and this  party it was that took in hand the celebration of the 49th anniversary. They  called themselves the &ldquo;United Australians.&rdquo; Their representative was one  Richard Driver, who, at the time, kept a public house&mdash;the &ldquo;Three Tuns&rdquo;&mdash;at the  corner of King and Elizabeth streets. He was, too, the father of a smart lad,  who became later on pretty widely known, both as a lawyer and in the world of  politics, eventually entering Parliament, and joining Parkes&rsquo;s Cabinet, in  1877. Driver&rsquo;s house was the meeting-place of the new party, who determined to  celebrate the anniversary by a &ldquo;National Dinner&rdquo; at the Royal Hotel. William  Charles Wentworth was to take the chair, and their fellow-countrymen from all  parts of the colony were invited to attend. The festival duly came off, as did  the usual speeches and toasts; although the new association does not appear to  have introduced any particularly fresh features, except perhaps in the way of a  little less harmony&mdash;for folk at these gatherings were not any more wont to  think alike on all political subjects than they are now.</p>
  <p>On October 27, 1837, great news arrived in Sydney. This was nothing  less than the death of William IV., and the accession of Queen Victoria to the  throne of the United Kingdom. A &ldquo;Gazette Extraordinary,&rdquo; with a deep mourning  border, was at once published announcing the fact, and excitement ran high throughout  the city. By public notice the next day Sir Richard Bourke directed that 72  minute guns should be fired from the Dawes Point battery at noon; that the  Royal Standard and the Union Jack should be hoisted half-mast high at the same  hour; also, all the ships in harbor were to observe similar signs of mourning  with their flags, whilst the bells of St. James&rsquo;s and St. Phillip&rsquo;s were to be  tolled for one hour at sunset that day and an hour at sunrise on the next. All  civil officers were to put on mourning, together with everybody else whose  situation and circumstances would enable them to do so.</p>
  <p>Another notice proclaimed that &ldquo;the High and Mighty Princess  Alexandrina Victoria had become &ldquo;our only lawful and rightful Liege Lady  Victoria, by the grace of God, etc.&rdquo; To assist in the Declaration of Allegiance  all the high officials of the colony, the clergy, magistrates, military and  naval officers, and the principal inhabitants, repaired to Government House at  midday.</p>
  <p>Towards the appointed time Sydney, dressed in its darkest raiment,  wended its way towards the old two-storeyed irregular mansion, with its wide  verandah, and &ldquo;one good room.&rdquo; There the 50th Regiment, with detachments of the  4th and 80th, was already drawn up. Followed by all the notabilities, the  Governor, in the full uniform of a Major-General, led the way to a table on  which was lying the proclamation of her Majesty&rsquo;s accession, waiting for signature.  Sir Richard was the first to sign, followed by the others in their turn. The fourteenth  was &ldquo;Thomas X Tomra,&rdquo; aboriginal native chief, who thus attached his mark on  the part of the Australian native race. In all there were 126 names, and when  the signing was over the Governor, standing on the front door-step, called for  three cheers for the Queen, himself giving the time.</p>
  <p>Then the troops fired a general salute, the Royal Standard was  mast-headed and saluted with 24 guns; more volleys from the troops; more  cheering and playing by bands of &ldquo;God Save the Queen&rdquo; ended not the least of the  memorable events that old Government House had witnessed since Johnson and his  drunken soldiers routed Bligh out of his hiding-place in one of its rooms.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page042a.jpg" width="800" height="484"></p>
  <p>Presently the High Sheriff (Thomas Macquoid), who had, ere this, read  the Proclamation to the crowd, marshalled a procession that was to pass from  Government House down Bridge-street and up George-street to the police  office&mdash;the first ceremony of the kind in Sydney that there is any record of.</p>
  <p>As in our day is the general rule, so now the procession was headed by  a detachment of mounted police; then came the band and a division of the 50th  Regiment, together &ldquo;with a number of the inhabitants of Sydney.&rdquo; Members of the  bar, the magistrates of the colony, commissariat officers, the clergy, the  judges, followed in order named. Then came Thomas Thomra, A.N.C., the members  of the Legislative and Executive Councils, and detachments of the three  regiments. Bands played, flags waved everywhere as the procession marched gaily  along towards the dingy old &ldquo;Central,&rdquo; where the Proclamation was again to be  read by the High Sheriff. And where, one wonders, is that most historical  document? Sold for waste paper, or still preserved in some cellar for bubonic  rats to nest in? Somebody might do worse than hunt it up, and have  reproductions made for the benefit of those of our generation curious in such  matters. It runs: &mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">PROCLAMATION</p>
  <p class="intro">&ldquo;Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call to His mercy our late  Sovereign Lord King William the Fourth, of blessed and glorious memory, by whose  decease the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,  and all other His late Majesty&rsquo;s dominions, is solely and rightfully come to  the high and Mighty Princess Alexandrina Victoria, saving the rights of any  Issue of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, which may be born of His  late Majesty&rsquo;s Consort:</p>

  <p>Sydney in these days was, at the most, only a squalid town; neither  trams nor trains; no corporation, no gas lamps, no drainage, no suburbs worth  mentioning; stumps in the streets, and convicts in chains grubbing them;  Circular Quay a mud flat; and bullock teams camped alongside the old burial  ground, the site of the present Town Hall. Everything in embryo. And little the  few people who listened to those high-sounding words, with their quaint  turnings, guessed how fully in the long years to come, God would grant the  request made in that most hearty and loyal prayer delivered in the rude capital  of an almost unknown land.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter  IX.<br>
    The Early Forties.</b></h2>
  <p>As far back as 1826, the lighting of Sydney with gas, had been under  consideration, but nothing came of the matter, although the then Colonial Civil  Engineer (Mr. C. Kinghorne) had prepared a report and estimate of the cost, and  probable returns of such a scheme. Ten years later, the subject was taken up  successfully by the Rev. Ralph Mansfield&mdash;already referred to as one-time editor  of the &ldquo;Sydney Gazette&rdquo;&mdash;who eventually became the founder of the present  company, which, in September, 1837, obtained its charter for incorporation. But  it was four years later ere the new illuminant came even into partial use. At  25s per cubic foot it was a luxury only accessible to the rich. Now, at 4s per  cubic foot, it is within the reach of most people.</p>
  <p>In 1838, Sir George Gipps appeared on the scene in place of one of the  most open-minded, liberal, and popular of all the early Governors of this  colony. And what Sydney thought of the new arrival may be gathered from two  lines out of a song greatly in vogue during his regime:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he eats an orange, he&rsquo;ll hand you the pips,<br>
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll grow if you plant &lsquo;em,&rsquo; says Governor Gipps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In 1838 Sydney had its first land boom&mdash;nothing very great, but of  interest as a precursor of later, and far more disastrous, ones. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page042b.jpg" width="800" height="485"></p>
  <p>Wool had gone up to over 1s per lb, and money was so plentiful that  land, stock, and produce reached unprecedented prices, and speculation,  especially in land, grew rampant. The beautiful &ldquo;estate of Hunter&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo;  originally a grant of a thousand acres; also that of Burwood, the story of  which has already been told, were put on the market. Then Abraham Polack, the  auctioneer of his day, advertised for sale 94 allotments, &ldquo;a portion of that  splendid and unequalled marine estate known as &lsquo;Vaucluse,&rsquo; the property of W.  C. Wentworth, Esq.&rdquo; The northern portion, adjoining &ldquo;the Government village of  Watson&rsquo;s Bay,&rdquo; was marked out as &ldquo;a marine village,&rdquo; which, adhering to the  Government plan, was named &ldquo;the Village of Vaucluse,&rdquo; consisting of fifty-four  allotments of half an acre each, with frontages to correspond, and any amount  of streets. A thoroughfare named the &ldquo;Village-road,&rdquo; leading to the South Head  road, was also surveyed. Thirteen of these areas were bounded on the west by  Rose Bay, &ldquo;immediately opposite the marine villa of Point Piper, the residence  of Colonel Gibbes,&rdquo; and so on, and so on, the auctioneer, expatiating, as does  his prototype of to-day, with all the eloquence at his command on the wonderful  qualities of the property. &ldquo;Various spots on this estate, had been for a series  of years past considered by the citizens favourite ones for picnic parties.  Ship and boat-building can here too be carried on at a vast advantage, as a  bold shore and deep water bound a great portion of it, in some places  sufficient for a 74-gun ship to float alongside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this scheme, and dozens of others, were years before their time;  and ended in such disaster as to ruin many once wealthy citizens; and cripple  others to such an extent as to compel them to sell their plate and carriages;  some of the latter recognisable, later on, as comprising part of the first &ldquo;cab  stand in Sydney.&rdquo; The site of this was on the south side of Market-street,  opposite the once well-known &ldquo;Waterloo Warehouse.&rdquo; But it was not until some  years afterwards that a genuine hansom appeared on the streets; and this was  imported via Melbourne.</p>
  <p>To emphasise the downfall of the boom, and force people to still  further economise, there presently came the drought of 1838-39, when flour rose  to over &pound;90 per ton.</p>
  <p>But the colony was too firmly founded, and its growth of both trade and  production already too great, for these happenings to do more than momentarily check  its prosperity. Says a visitor about this time: &ldquo;There is a fine palace in  process of building for his Excellency just behind Fort Macquarie. The  inhabitants of Sydney have access to the Government Domains, and the splendour  of carriages and gaiety of promenading parties to be met with here are equal to  anything I have seen in Phoenix Park, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, or even  the Tuilleries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Our enthusiastic visitor, like so many others who arrived, expecting to  find &ldquo;Botany Bay&rdquo; a mere miserable convict settlement, was evidently so  astonished at the contrast between the actual picture and the one that had been  present in his imagination, that he gave rather too much rein to his fancy. At  the time of his visit, Hyde Park was the fashionable rendezvous for carriage  people, as well as the favourite cricket ground. It was then of course, treeless,  or very nearly so; the grass &ldquo;tussocky&rdquo; and untended, intersected by pathways,  and rudely fenced. The Roman Catholic Cathedral had been sixteen years in  building, and was not finished even then. Behind the old police court,  offenders still sat in the stocks, &ldquo;taking out in timber what they couldn&rsquo;t pay  in cash.&rdquo; St. James&rsquo; was, as it is now, the Government House church, only then  the right hand gallery was filled with convicts.</p>
  <p>The new &ldquo;palace&rdquo; for the Governor had been begun some time before this.  The plan was designed in London, by Mr. E. Blore, and its erection entrusted  here to Mr. W. Lewis, the Colonial Architect; colonial builders contracted for  the different portions of the work, and, to a great extent the materials for it  were produced within the colony.</p>
  <p>In the beginning of &lsquo;38 was opened the Victoria theatre, in Pitt  street, the foundation stone of which had been laid two years previously. It  held some 2000 people and one of the proprietors, a Mr. Wyatt, on March 17,  (the day of its completion), gave its use gratuitously for a public ball &ldquo;in  commemoration of the patron saint of Ireland.&rdquo; A few days afterwards regular  performances commenced with a good company, whose efforts were attended by  signal success. The prices of admission were becoming very moderate&mdash;dress  circle 4s, upper boxes 2s 6d, pit 1s, and gallery 6d. It will be seen that our  theatrical caterers have slightly improved on those rates, to say nothing of  the &ldquo;early door&rdquo; temptation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The character of the performances,&rdquo; remarks an early historian, &ldquo;is  generally respectable. Although we can seldom attempt the higher walks of  tragedy, we have yet made successful hits with domestic dramas, comedies, and  farces.&rdquo; This is the kind of thing they used to go in for: &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brutus,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Luke the Labourer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Irish Labourer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hibernian  Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love, Law, and Physic,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pilot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guy Mannering,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Waterman,&rdquo;  etc. Judging from which selection makes one fancy, somehow, that, even in these  comparatively enlightened days, there was an individual fulfilling as rigid  duties of censorship as in those dark ones when Governor Hunter crushed the  drama into nothingness with an iron hand.</p>
  <p>The story of the old Royal Hotel is of interest, and may here be  briefly told. We have already seen how, in the early thirties, under Barnett  Levy, the hotel became a &ldquo;temple of Thespis;&rdquo; but when the new theatre was  finished, the actors removed, and the Royal took up once more the even tenor of  its way as the best house of accommodation in the city. It was managed then by  a Mr. Sparkes, and &ldquo;received the chief share of the patronage of our settlers  and squatters, who, on business or pleasure bent; paid their welcome periodical  visits to our metropolis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, one 17th of March, a drunken carter, who had been celebrating the  saint&rsquo;s day by drinking and smoking in an adjoining stable, set fire to some  straw, which, spreading to the hotel, in a few hours destroyed the big stack of  buildings comprising it. A grand ball was taking place at Government House that  night, and many officers rushed out in their gay attire, and helped to  extinguish the flames. The damage done by the fire was estimated at &pound;20,000.</p>
  <p>Presently the site passed from Mr. Wyatt&rsquo;s hands into those of Mr. John  Terry Hughes, who upon it built a &ldquo;huge wilderness of stone and wood.&rdquo; Alderman  Fowles (once drawing master at Fort-street School) is very severe on the  architect: &ldquo;With Mr. Hughes&rsquo; system of building we are not acquainted; but we  presume that he never could have placed upon paper a plan of the immense mass  of cumbersomeness which he has piled in George-street. One half of the money  wasted thereupon would have sufficed for a building worthy of the finest street  in Europe.&rdquo; Nevertheless, for many years the &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; continued to be the  favorite resort of &ldquo;our settlers and squatters&rdquo; on their visits to Sydney; and  even at the present day it well holds its own with more pretentious and modern  competitors.</p>
  <p>Emigrants from the United Kingdom had for the past few years been pouring  into the colony, and some of the statements sworn to by applicants, or their  agents, to secure a free passage bear a curious similarity to those made, when  at odd times one of our present Governments sees fit to import a shipload or so  of &ldquo;people who will be an acquisition to the colony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus, one man, stated in his certificate to be a blacksmith, turned out  nothing less than a ladies&rsquo; shoemaker; whilst another lot, invoiced by the  agent as an &ldquo;agricultural family,&rdquo; proved to be very much otherwise. Said the  brother: &ldquo;I never was an agricultural labourer; I was a clerk in a shipping  office; my brother is a draper; my sister never was in service; she left school  to come out here as a bounty immigrant.&rdquo; Women of the worst character were  encouraged to emigrate under the bounty system. One woman, for instance, was  induced to pass herself off as her son&rsquo;s wife, and one berth had been set aside  for them on board ship. Fraud, forgery, impersonation, and breach of contract  were, in short the characteristics of a system that poured into Sydney and the  colony a most useless and undesirable class of settlers. Out of 21,126 who  arrived in such fashion, no less than 1395 were found ineligible, and the  bounty, &pound;19 per head, refused for them. It will thus be seen that by a most  unfortunate miscarriage of a well-meant system of settlement, the original  heavy handicap of convict-transportation, now almost at an end, was succeeded  by a second invasion of worthless and mischievous, if not actually criminal  characters.</p>
  <p>In the second year of Gipps&rsquo;s reign, Sydney folk received a surprise,  when on rising one morning they perceived two American men-of-war lying snugly  among the shipping. These turned out to be a portion of the United States  exploring expedition, under the command of Captain Wilkes. He had, it seems,  made the Heads at sunset on the previous evening, and although the night was  dark, and he had no pilot, the wind being fair, he, in the Vincennes, of 780  tons, accompanied by the Peacock, of 650 tons, stood boldly in under a press of  sail. It seemed a risky thing to do; but he says he knew that he could place  absolute reliance on his charts. The &ldquo;Sow and Pigs&rdquo; seems to have bothered him  for a short time, but he soon fixed the position of the reef; and at 10.30 p.m.  dropped anchor in the Cove without anyone having the least idea of his arrival.  This really was a very fine piece of work&mdash;much finer than the look-out kept by  those responsible.</p>
  <p>Next day arrived the Porpoise and the Flying Fish, thus making the full  strength of the expedition, with whose officers and men the streets of the  capital was presently crowded. Later on, Wilkes waited on the Governor, and  apologised for entering the harbor so unceremoniously and without the customary  salutes. Reading between the lines, it would almost seem as if the Americans,  having heard of the defences of the harbor, and the difficulties of its  channels, had determined to show the colonists how small a reliance could be  placed on such obstacles when United States ships were in question. One can  hardly imagine such a thing happening at the present time.</p>
  <p>However, the Governor was all hospitality, and lent Wilkes Fort  Macquarie for the purposes of an observatory. &ldquo;I may in this place,&rdquo; says our  American writer gratefully, &ldquo;acknowledge the open-hearted welcome we met with  from all the Government officers, military and civil, as well as from the  citizens. The Australian Club was thrown open to us by its committee, and  parties, balls, etc., were given in our honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The American commander seems to have been much struck with the  prevalence of drunkenness, &ldquo;which here stalks abroad at noonday. It is not rare  at any time, but on holidays its prevalence surpasses everything I have ever  witnessed. Even persons of the fair sex (if they may be called so) were there  to be seen to be staggering along the most public streets, brawling in the  houses, or borne off in charge of the police&hellip; The police officers themselves  are among the vendors of the intoxicating liquor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course he alludes to rum; and it is to be feared that in those days  we did indulge rather heavily in our then favorite beverage, judging from the  eight gallons per head consumed by the population per annum.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page044.jpg" width="800" height="650"></p>
  <p>In July, 1851, the Hunter River Steam Navigation Company, with a  capital of &pound;40,000, founded by Mr. John Eales of Duckenfield in July, 1839,  became merged into the A. S. N. Company, with a capital of &pound;320,000. Early next  year there arrived their first steamer, the Rose, creating quite a sensation in  Sydney, although of only 172 tons. Then, presently, came the Thistle; and,  later on, the Shamrock completed the trinity.</p>
  <p>Very soon the company began to extend its operations; and the Shamrock  was put into the Moreton Bay trade. The fares were &pound;8, &pound;6, and &pound;4: freight, 20s  per ton; and wool, 20s per bale. The business, however did not pay, and in a  few months&rsquo; time was abandoned. The shareholders, it seemed, objected strongly  to the directorate allowing their boats to travel to such a dangerous place as  Moreton Bay. A steamer was a steamer m those days&mdash;a valuable rara avis, and to be  taken care of accordingly. We are not quite so particular now, and occasionally  send them on far more dangerous adventures than to Moreton Bay, eg., ramming  lighthouses, and expeditions inland A curious controversy arose respecting this  pioneer trade of the Shamrock. It seems that the articles of association only  provided for voyages to the Hunter River and ports adjacent. And the question  was argued as to whether Moreton Bay was or was not &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; to the Hunter. Mr.  Broadhurst, Q. C., and several nautical experts, were set to work on the  question, and the latter, at any rate, gave it as their opinion that Brisbane  and Newcastle were adjacent. This clenched the matter, and determined the  directors to persevere. Accordingly, we, later, find the Sovereign trading to  Moreton Bay. and the Shamrock to Melbourne. The first-named vessel was  afterwards wrecked, with the loss of forty-four lives. These developments of  our present great coasting service are too intimately bound up with the rise  and progress of Sydney to be passed over without, at least, brief mention.</p>
  <p>Before leaving the last of our thirties for good, a word must be said  respecting the first jubilee, as well as the fiftieth anniversary&mdash;both  happening in that year&mdash;and the native born determined to &ldquo;keep-them up&rdquo; in  right good fashion. In the first place, they made up their minds that the day  should be a public holiday, which it had never been before. Then that there  should be a regatta for the masses, as well as a dinner for the classes. They  had their way in both instances. There was a regatta, and the committee hired a  steamer, and sold tickets to their friends to see the races from it. Also, in  the evening, they had a dinner at the Pulteney Hotel, in Bent-street  (afterwards the Australian Club House, and now &ldquo;Richmond House,&rdquo; used as a  boarding establishment). The guests sat down at 7. Tickets were &pound;2 2s, and we  may be quite certain that the celebration was worthy of the, for the times,  rather high figure.</p>
  <p>During &lsquo;37-38, a Parliamentary Committee had given in a strong report,  thoroughly adverse to transportation, and the appalling evidence collected by  it, respecting the system, had completely swayed English opinion against its  continuance; so far, at least, as New South Wales was concerned. In that  colony, however, it was feared at first by the large landholders that, having  to do without convict labor, spelled ruin. But they had to decide; and were  given their choice between assigned servants and self-government. It was  preposterous that a convict colony should be permitted to rule itself. That was  self-evident. So the choice was soon made; and, in 1840, a British  Order-in-Council established Tasmania and Norfolk Island as the only two  convict settlements in Australasia. And thus it happened that, in October,  1840, the last convict ship but one, the Eden, let go her anchor in Port  Jackson, and though for many years the system left broad traces across the  social features of the colony, it practically received its death-blow when the  cables of the Eden rushed through her hawse-pipes into the waters of Sydney  Harbor. In 1841, we had our first recorded embezzlement by a high official; and  it was such a barefaced and impudent robbery and created such a tremendous  scandal, that it is worth noticing.</p>
  <p>The first Registrar of the Supreme Court had been a certain Colonel  Galway Mills, described as a &ldquo;decayed gentleman, with no knowledge of business.&rdquo;  To make up for this, however, his successor proved to have rather too much.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page045.jpg" width="483" height="650"></p>
  <p>After becoming a bankrupt, in England, and taking advantage of the  Insolvent Act, this gentleman had, in 1828, been appointed Chief Justice of  Nova Scotia. This billet he was permitted to exchange for the position of  Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, with the duty of collecting  the effects of intestates, and, according to his own story, the privilege of  investing the money for his benefit, pending distribution. Then, whilst he  entirely neglected all other parts of his work, he, &ldquo;in defiance of son,  brother, father, or other near relatives of the deceased, grasped the whole estate,  invested it in his own name, for his own interest, and for ten years kept  neither day book, cash book, nor ledger; kept only one account at his bank,  rendered no statement for audit to anyone, and paid what balances he pleased to  next of kin.&rdquo; So notorious did this business at last become, that he was asked  to pass his accounts, and generally clear up matters. But at this he waxed  indignant, and protested that the judges were reacting on his honor by calling  for any such statements, &ldquo;and thus depriving him of the legitimate profits to  be derived from the employment of other men&rsquo;s money, which had induced him to  settle in the colony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even now, for a piece of cool effrontery, the above would be hard to  beat. Eventually, finding the judges firm in their demand for an audit, he  resorted to open fraud, and in two years appropriated &pound;9000. Then he became bankrupt;  took the benefit of the act for the second time, and, after a while, paid a  dividend of 6d in the &pound;. His victims petitioned the Home Government for  compensation, but, without success. It should have been mentioned that, at the  audit, he reported himself to be in possession only of &pound;1989 17s 0&frac12;d; but the court  found that &pound;3085 18s 2d was the amount he ought really to have had in hand. And  this, in spite of a violent resistance, they compelled him to disgorge.  However, as we have seen, he lost no time in recouping himself. The incident is  of interest, as showing how in those years it as not difficult for an English  official, even with a shady reputation, to procure a position of high trust out  here, and shake the Australian pagoda tree, to such good purpose as did our  haughty second registrar. Such instances of peculation, on a large scale,  however, must have been rare, or this one would not have attracted the  attention it did. A few such gentry would have soon caused a vacuum in the  Colonial Treasury.</p>
  <p>Our Treasury, by the way, was, in those days, an unpretentious building,  the last but one or two of those old-fashioned houses on the left-hand side of  Church Hill, going towards York-street, and now the office of the &ldquo;Freeman&rsquo;s  Journal.&rdquo; Quiet as it is now, that neighborhood saw stirring times, when the  four-horse coach carrying gold came in from the Turon, Abercrombie, or Araluen,  and dashed up in fine style with its armed escort of troopers cantering  along-side, and others sitting on the box, and in the body of the vehicle. In  the early fifties the arrival of a &ldquo;gold escort,&rdquo; judging from old pictures,  was one of the sights of the capital.</p>
  <p>In this year (1841) a census was taken, and with rather surprising  results, for it was found that the population of the colony amounted to no less  than 130,700&mdash;males, 87,200; females, 43,500. Of this number Sydney is credited  with between forty and fifty thousand. But the year appears to have been a bad  one. Governor Gipps took to juggling with the land, alternately raising and  depressing the price per acre; indeed, he at one stroke raised the upset price  from 5s to 12s. After a while, he lowered it again, thus causing much  uncertainty and financial distress on the part of the holders. Thus many became  insolvent, and things generally, with most settlers, were at sixes and sevens.  City lands, however, was steadily increasing in value. In 1834 a corner  allotment in George-street had been sold at the rate of &pound;18,150 per acre, and  another at the rate of &pound;27,928 per acre. Ten years or so earlier they might  have been purchased for a few hundred gallons of rum. In 1840 one small lot  brought at the rate of &pound;40,000 per acre. It will thus be seen that speculation  had not been quite crushed by the disasters of the recent land boom and the  drought, and that investors had full faith in the future of the city, both as  regarded it and its suburbs, especially choice spots, such as Rushcutter&rsquo;s and  Elizabeth Bays, which were becoming favorite residential sites. Listen to Mr.  Stubbs (the auctioneer of the day), as he descants on the beauty of these  places&mdash;Polack isn&rsquo;t in it with him:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of all the cherished objects of an amateur&rsquo;s delight those most  preferred beyond all others of our beautiful harbor, are Elizabeth and  Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay. It is proverbial that every fresh visit to these beautiful  spots only increases the desire of seeing them again. Hence it is that hardly  an individual moves out of town but he goes for the enjoyment of his health to  one of them. To live there is at once judgment and good taste&mdash;not to be there  is a continually increasing want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later on, speaking of Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay, he eulogises it as &ldquo;really and  truly the tout ensemble of good society.&rdquo; The worthy auctioneer might have  added that the society was limited as well, for, save private residences  about Darling Point, Double Bay, and Point Piper, there was scarcely a house  all the way to the Heads. Not unmindful of thoroughly sound business ethics,  Mr. Stubbs announces, on a more than usually important occasion, &ldquo;a champagne  lunch will be provided on the day of sale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter  X.<br>
    In The Forties.</b></h2>
  <p>In 1842 Sydney was formed into a municipality, and the first election  of councillors, aldermen, etc., took place on November 1 in that year. The  house used for the meetings of the new Town Council was one built by Mr.  Commissary Broughton, about the year 1813, on the site of a row of soldiers&rsquo;  huts known by the expressive name of the &ldquo;Rookery.&rdquo; The building, often  referred to in these papers, was afterwards the residence of the first Colonial  Secretary, Major Goulburn; then it was occupied by Mr. Sydney Stephen; then it  became a hotel, was called the &ldquo;Pulteney,&rdquo; and was kept by a Mr. Levien. It is  now known as &ldquo;Richmond House,&rdquo; already mentioned as a boarding establishment,  and as being the first quarters of the Australian Club. But the Town Council in  those days was of an eminently migratory character. At one time it held its  meetings in York-street, near where the old Masonic Hall now stands; thence it  wandered to the Oxford Hotel, in King street; then we find it in a house on the  site of the Imperial Hotel, in Wynyard Square, resting, finally, in a building  on the opposite side, whence in, 1879, it removed to its present quarters.  Alderman John Hoskins was the first Mayor, and Mr. John Rae the first Town  Clerk, appointed in 1843. This gentleman afterwards became well known as  Under-Secretary for Public Works and Commissioner for Railways. The Corporation  managed to scrape along in some sort of fashion for eleven years; but, in 1854,  it got into an even worse muddle than our late City Fathers did, and the  Government found it necessary to place the affairs of the city in the hands of  commissioners, who levied rates, and paid off the overdraft. They were three in  number. Mr. Rae was the junior, his colleagues being Messrs. Gilbert Eliott,  and Frederick Orme Darnall. In 1857 the council again became an institution,  with what measure of success was well disclosed by the happenings of 1901.</p>
  <p>In the latter forties a visitor to Sydney remarks: &ldquo;The town  councillors will do well to follow the more decorous example set by their  seniors in the mother country, and it is to be hoped that, hereafter, they will  not be quite so personal in their observations to each other as some of them  were last year; such were then the proceedings that people actually compared  the Town Hall to a bear garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So we see that even over half a century ago our City Council was doing  its best to live up to the reputation it has until quite recently done its very  best to maintain.</p>
  <p>Although Governor Gipps had not as yet taken full possession of his  grand new house, still, in May 24, 1843, he opened a portion of it, including  the ball-room, and gave a fine entertainment in that apartment in honor of her  Majesty&rsquo;s Birthday. Says an old writer enthusiastically of the new structure:&mdash;&ldquo;May  the solidity, the splendor, and elegance of this Vice-royal mansion be an  emblem of Australia&rsquo;s future history&hellip; Separated as we are by continents and  oceans from our fatherland we have yet the pride of the British-born to rear in  their land such buildings as their sons may be proud to contemplate; structures  so firm and enduring that the storm may shake, but cannot destroy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cost, when completed, was, it is said, well into &pound;50,000, although  the first estimate was only for half that sum. The stables are ornate to a  degree, and have time and again been mistaken for the residential portion of  the house&mdash;indeed, an English magazine once illustrated them as &ldquo;a view of the  seat of Government in New South Wales.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this first ball, just mentioned, it rained in torrents during the  evening and night, and, as at that period the sheltering porch in front of the  house had not been built, the approach became a regular bog; the ladies got  their dresses soiled, and in the morning dozens of boots and shoes were seen  sticking in the mud. Not until 1845 was the building finally occupied as a home  by the Governor.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page046.jpg" width="800" height="560"></p>
  <p>Just a few words about the often debated matter of these different  Government Houses and their sites. We have long ago described Phillip&rsquo;s  portable canvas house, originally built in England by one Smith, of St. George&rsquo;s  Fields, under the personal direction of the Governor, and at a cost of &pound;125.  Supposing that it counted as the first Government House, temporary though it  was, its position, judging from Hunter&rsquo;s well-known picture, must have been  somewhere close to the place where the copper plate was recently found embedded  in old foundation-stones at a depth of 3ft 6in., under the pavement at the  corner of Phillip and Bridge streets. And where the discovery was made is undoubtedly  the exact site of the second and permanently built Government House, and  probably the first building in Australia to be made of bricks and stones. Says  Collins: &ldquo;There having been found among the convicts a person qualified to  conduct the business of a brickmaker, a gang of labourers was put under his  direction&hellip; Another gang of labourers was put under the direction of a  stonemason, and on the 15th (May, 1788) the first stone of a building intended  for the residence of the Governor until the Government House could be erected  was laid on the east side of the Cove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The projected building spoken of above was to have been on Church Hill,  and, as nearly as can be gathered, on the ground where Petty&rsquo;s Hotel now stands.</p>
  <p>To return to the Bridge-street Government House, or number two, if we  count it the next. It first contained only three rooms, but was subsequently  enlarged to six. It was of one storey, and, although mention is made of a set  of stairs, it is uncertain where they led to&mdash;perhaps to a loft or an attic.  Contemporary pictures of the place show a wretched looking sort of a hut, with  a &ldquo;hip&rdquo; roof, a door flanked by two windows of unequal size and a chimney at  one end. And yet they called it &ldquo;elegant,&rdquo; which, perhaps, compared with its  surroundings, it really was. However, it only lasted ten years, and then,  finding his home threatened at any moment to fall and bury him in its ruins,  Governor Hunter, in 1799, pulled it down and rebuilt it a little further along  Bridge-street. This, number three, contained a drawing-room 50ft by 18ft, a  dining-room 30ft by 18ft 6in, and a parlor 20ft by 16ft 6in. The rooms were  9ft, 11ft, and 7ft in height. And this edifice, transformed by Macquarie into a  comfortable sort of country house with deep verandahs, serviced Vice-royalty as  a home until the present building in the Domain was occupied by Governor Gipps.  Thus it may be fairly said that there were, in all, four Government Houses; and  it is thought that in the preceding brief account several vexed questions as to  their sites, etc., have been correctly settled.</p>
  <p>Some details of our city in these early forties will be of interest to  the present generation as well as to the gradually dwindling remnant who can  let their recollections carry back to the days of their youth and reconstruct  the scenes among which those days were spent</p>
  <p>Around the Cove itself the changes have been slighter since we last  took a glance at it than in other parts of the town, and the new Government  House dominates the landscape, standing out big and white above the surrounding  trees; the Commissariat Stores still usurp the site of the Sailor&rsquo;s Home and  the Mariner&rsquo;s Church; ships still lie off from the shore, and are approached by  heavy stages forty or fifty in length. Circular Quay being yet in embryo, and  all the work of reclamation only just thought of again. At the foot of  George-street is a flight of steps where watermen ply for hire. Looking across  to North Shore, scarcely anything but a dense mass of thick forest met the  eye&mdash;eucalypti and banksia&mdash;practically unchanged since that day in 1789 when  poor Francis Hill, the midshipman of the Sirius, landed at Milson&rsquo;s Point, and  was lost in trying to get through the scrub to his ship, then hove down in  Careening Cove. Nor, despite many days of search, was he ever heard of again.</p>
  <p>From the Cove &ldquo;up town&rdquo; there were still plenty of open spaces. A Mr.  James Underwood owned a big slice of land extending from the &ldquo;Herald&rdquo; office  right to the water&rsquo;s edge. And on this grant he built not only houses known as &ldquo;Underwood&rsquo;s  Buildings,&rdquo; but also, in 1801, that first Australian ship, the &ldquo;King George,&rdquo;  before referred to in the course of this book. Probably she was put together  somewhere about the site of the present Paragon Hotel. The gaol was still in  George-street, and the gallows stood on a hill at the back of it, where now is  Princes-street.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page047a.jpg" width="800" height="519"></p>
  <p>The military barracks filled Wynyard Square, in the very heart of the  town. The main building faced the east, and extended along York-street, from  Margaret-street to Barrack-street. The officers&rsquo; quarters were in separate  houses at each end. For some hundreds of yards a high wall shut off the  barracks from George-street. Out on a sandhill, where Paddington is now, new  barracks were in course of erection, having for outlook a dreary expanse of  swamp and tea-tree scrub.</p>
  <p>Between Hamilton and Pitt-streets there were no buildings at all, and  standing on the banks of the Tank Stream you could see across to the back  premises of the houses in George-street. In Bridge-street, on the site of the  premises until lately occupied by the Union Steamship Company, was a big  lumber-yard, and in one of these detached houses, which stood rather back from  the street, once resided the Chief Justice, Sir Francis Forbes; and then for  many years it gave accommodation for business matters connected with the Survey  Department. Fine trees grew in front of the houses, which, with the buildings  they beautified, have long since disappeared&mdash;the former before the axe of the  Vandals who in turn have ruled our city; the latter to make room for some  modern edifices.</p>
  <p>The Government Printing Office consisted of some old wooden buildings  in Bent-street; and close to these, too, were the structures used as an  Emigration Depot. The emigrants, however, when the prisoners were shifted from  Hyde Park Barracks, took possession of that place. In those days the building  so well-known to us as Fort-street Model School was the Military Hospital.  Opposite the main entrance to the Military Barracks in George-street was an  old-fashioned massive stone house, &ldquo;standing at a distance from the public  road, and contained within railings.&rdquo; This was the second bank of New South  Wales, and its garden bordered the Tank Stream. Then, a little further to the  south, stood the old General Post Office.</p>
  <p>George-street was, of course, the great main artery, as it is to-day,  and it extended from Dawes Point, the northern extremity of the city, to the  old toll-bar, opposite the Benevolent Asylum, at the southern end, a distance  of about two miles. Then for another mile it went under the name of Parramatta-street,  connecting &ldquo;the extensive and popular suburbs of Chippendale and Redfern with  the city, and forming a grand approach from the southern and western districts.&rdquo;  Says good old Fowles, writing later on: &ldquo;The newcomer cannot fail to be  surprised with the bustle and animation that pervades this street (George)  &mdash;numberless omnibusses in constant motion, hackney carriages, coaches, gigs,  waggons, and every description of vehicle, from the humble &lsquo;shay-cart&rsquo; to the  regular four-in hand, passing and re-passing; with now and then a big bullock  dray laden with wool or other produce, and drawn by eight or ten immense  bullocks, wending its devious way to the merchants&rsquo; stores, gives character to  the scene, and stamps it colonial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page047b.jpg" width="800" height="539"></p>
  <p>Hyde Park was still more generally known as the Racecourse, and was  simply &ldquo;a healthy, open common, fenced off in four different departments.&rdquo; Lyon&rsquo;s  Terrace stood on the south side of the Park, and was considered the residential  &ldquo;plum&rdquo; of the city. There were six houses in it; and among the early occupants  at different intervals were General Wynyard, the Colonial Treasurer, C. D.  Riddle, J. Thacker, W. H. Hart (manager of the Bank of Australia), Chief  Justice Stephen, and A. W. Young (the Sheriff of the colony). The rent of these  select and fashionable residences was from &pound;280 to &pound;400 per annum. At the  corner of Elizabeth Street was a large house occupied by Mr. Prosper de Mestre,  part owner of a whaler, the Cape Packet, and mentioned by Lang as &ldquo;a highly  respectable merchant of American origin, who has long settled in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the east side of the park stood the Sydney College, nearly alone and  now flourishing under its first head master, Mr. T. Cape. Near Governor Bourke&rsquo;s  statue stood the ugly School of Industry, and at the corner of King-street, the  now vanished St. James parsonage. Crown-street boasted of some four or five  houses only. Redfern was practically unknown till some years later, as a  residential suburb, when Fowles speaks of it as &ldquo;extensive and populous.&rdquo;  Macdonaldtown and the present &ldquo;up the line&rdquo; suburbs were, of course, undreamt  of, although a Mr. Chisholm had a house in the neighbourhood of the former  place, standing on land long since resumed by the Government for railway  purposes; afterwards, it was occupied as a school by Dr. Sly. Oxford-street,  more generally known as New South Head road, was still the favorite drive with  many of the citizens, but there were no houses along it. The new court house at  Darlinghurst was still unfinished, although one wing was utilised as a Museum,  with Mr. Wall as curator; and in this most unsuitable place a gradually  increasing collection of fine and valuable specimens remained until 1849, when  they were removed to the present building, designed by the Colonial Architect  (Mr. M. W. Lewis). But from beginning to end the contract appears to have been  muddled, money wasted, and such a scandal incurred as caused the retirement of  the Colonial Architect from his office.</p>
  <p>And at Waverley there was only one house&mdash;a lofty, conspicuous  building&mdash;but by whom occupied contemporary history is silent; although in  recent years it did duty as a Roman Catholic school. Messrs. R. Cooper, T.  Cape, F. Hely, and several other prominent citizens lived in the neighbourhood  of the Glenmore-road. Paddington, Woollahra, Waverley, and Randwick were still  in &ldquo;the womb of futurity.&rdquo; The Edgecliffe-road and its fellows of the present  were so many rude and scarcely defined tracks, nameless, and formed by cattle and  by wood-carters among the scrubby areas, interspersed with patches of rock and  sand&mdash;worthless then, almost invaluable now. At Double Bay a solitary fisherman  had built himself a hut; whilst under a projecting shelf of flat rock on the  eastern side two old soldiers had taken up their quarters. They were known  simply by the nicknames of &ldquo;Albuera&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waterloo.&rdquo; William-street was a sandy  dray-track; and a little creek where the Asylum for the Blind now stands was  spanned by a couple of decayed rails, off which unwary foot passengers now and  again plumped into the water. Dr. Polding, the R.C. bishop, lived in a large  house standing alone on the open stretch of ground between William-street and  the head of Woolloomooloo Bay. But, gradually, as we have seen, the rich city  folk were being enticed to make their homes around the foreshores of these  bays, and already many fine mansions standing in extensive grounds dotted the  high lands of this portion of the harbour. But so dense was the scrub,  particularly about Elizabeth and Rushcutter&rsquo;s, that much clearing was necessary  before one of these old-time homes and its surroundings was completed.</p>
  <p>Returning to the neighbourhood of the Cove, it may be of interest to  some of the people who daily pass the Obelisk in Macquarie Place to reproduce  the inscription it bears as it stands there forlorn and solitary in that most  squalid and dirty patch of old Sydney, surrounded by rags, torn newspapers,  decaying leaves, garbage, and refuse of all descriptions; an ancient but none the  less eloquent protest against the ineptitude of these under whose care the  historic space should by rights flourish in turf and blossom.</p>
  <p>The inscription runs:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Reference has, in the course of these papers, been often made to the  site of what is commonly accepted as the original Bank of New South Wales&mdash;the  one in front of the Barracks in George-street, and close to the General Post  Office. But few people, even among the earlier historians, appear to know quite  where the first bank stood, long before its quarters were removed to the  old-fashioned George-street cottage, with its curious arched windows, garden,  and orchard, and hut for the night-watchman, who with slug-loaded blunderbuss  lay in wait for illegal exploiters of the bank&rsquo;s treasure.</p>
  <p>Through the kindness of the Hon. Reginald Black, M.L.C., the writer has  been enabled to identify the house in which, on April 8, 1817, the young  institution began its long and successful career. At the corner of Pitt-street  and Macquarie Place stand the offices of the North Queensland Insurance  Company, and next to them, partly hidden by a fruiterer&rsquo;s shop and a  tobacconist&rsquo;s, rises an old weatherworn building, and in this, known afterwards  as the Star Hotel, the present great corporation began its operations. Unless  one knows just where to look for it, the house is hardly distinguishable, so  hemmed in is it by others.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page048.jpg" width="800" height="594"></p>
  <p>In those days there was a well in Macquarie Place where when, as it  often did in a dry season, the Tank Stream failed, the bank officials had to go  for their water. &ldquo;Busby&rsquo;s Bore&rdquo; was not yet in existence; but, later on, it for  many years was, as already mentioned, the sole water supply of the city. The &ldquo;bore&rdquo;  was, in reality, an aqueduct of over two miles in length, cut from the Lachlan  swamp, near Botany. The channel was 5ft deep and 5ft wide, having its terminus  in Hyde Park, whither folks used to go and fetch the water in tubs, buckets,  carts,&mdash;any thing; and the supply was intermittent, giving out when least  expected. In course of time water was laid on through pipes to many houses; but  it came through very slowly, and to fill a bath often took three hours&mdash;when  people indulged in a home luxury of the kind. Throughout the city there were,  at this time, wells of varying depth. The one in particular in Macquarie Place  was declared to be &ldquo;very sweet;&rdquo; and there was another just opposite the old  Club House in Bent-street, the water of which was held in high repute.</p>
  <p>In this particular chapter, dealing, as it does, so largely with the  old topography of our city, it must be remembered that although every possible  effort has been made to confirm and verify the statements contained therein,  such a question as the absolute position of a long-departed landmark must, in  many cases, be a matter far from reducible to the dimensions of an exact  science and, therefore, a certain amount of approximate correctness must be  allowed in such matters And it is curious how, in this respect, the old  chronicles and records do themselves differ, in some instances even no two  being agreed upon matters of position, custom, or fashion, that we who are  interested in such things deem of much moment. Nor, when one comes to think of  it is this so very surprising. Take, for instance, our ever changing city of to-day,  and it will not be difficult to find three average men who will in nowise be able  to agree as to the shape, use, and exact position of a building which they had  passed every day of their lives for many years, then had as it were suddenly  missed, and found its place taken by a stranger. And so with many other matters  that will be of interest to our dependents but which no man among us considers  worthy of note at the present.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter  XI.<br>
    In The Forties.&mdash;(Continued.)</b></h2>
  <p>It was on the 24th of January, 1843, that Sir George Gipps, acting then  as President of the Council, addressed the members to the effect that their  existence as a Council was almost at an end, seeing that the British Parliament  had at last passed an Act which made that body elective. Thus the year of  grace, 1843, saw the partial death of the nominee system, and the birth of one  based on the will of the people. Partial, because the nominee leaven still  obtained to the extent that six of the members were to be Goverment officials,  and six others appointed directly by the Governor himself. The people were  allowed twenty-four representatives, whose qualifications were either the  possession of freehold valued at &pound;200 per annum, or a fixed, income of &pound;20 per  annum, derived from a residential source. Of these, six were to represent Port  Phillip, and eighteen New South Wales. The voting was, of course, open; and the  state of the poll was declared every hour, as nearly as might be. The first  election in our city is worthy of rather more than a general notice.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page049.jpg" width="747" height="650"></p>
  <p>Somewhere as nearly as possible on the site of Thomas Mort&rsquo;s statue in  Macquarie Place&mdash;the witness of so many historic scenes&mdash;was the spot chosen for  the first nomination for the city electorate, which resulted in the return of  Messrs. Wentworth and Bland; and here the former made that unequivocal  declaration that probably placed him at the top of the poll, to the effect that  &ldquo;either William Charles Wentworth was unworthy to represent Sydney, or Sydney  was unworthy of being represented by William Charles Wentworth. To posterity he  left the deciding the question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Between the partisans of these two men and those of the other  candidates, of whom the principal were Robert Cowper, Captain O&rsquo;Connell, and  William Hustler, feeling was rather strained, and encounters were consequently  more or less serious throughout the day; which gave Captain Innes, the then  police magistrate, and his men all they knew to suppress. The crowd started  from Miller&rsquo;s Point, and travelled along Kent-street, via Charlotte Place, to &ldquo;Smith&rsquo;s  Corner,&rdquo; in Market-street, just about the site of the present Kidman&rsquo;s  Buildings. Smith was a popular &ldquo;sport&rdquo; of the time, and kept a large butcher&rsquo;s  shop. There, so the story goes, on one of the mob attempting to pull up some  palings from the fence that then bounded a cottage garden opposite, a woman  rushed out, and cut off his fingers with a meat axe. And, curiously enough,  whether a fact or not, the writer happening to sit, quite recently, next to an  old gentleman in one of the George-street electric trams, heard him relating  the story as having been himself an actual witness of the occurrence. With the  addition, however, that next morning there appeared in one of the newspapers an  advertisement to the effect that the victim could have the missing digits  returned on personal application!</p>
  <p>When the crowd reached the Haymarket it attempted to rush the polling  place there, and, by destroying the voting papers, at least delay the election.  These roughs carried poles decked with green ribbons, and were simply spoiling  for a fight with Wentworthites or Blandites. The attempt on the papers was  frustrated by the presence of mind of a clerk who, having one of Hustler&rsquo;s  placards, shouted that if they destroyed the papers they would do as much harm  to their own side as to the opposition, whereupon they gave cheers for Hustler,  and rioted away to Hyde Park.</p>
  <p>During the afternoon there was a fight near St. James&rsquo; Church, and  Captain Innes and some of the police were chased into the adjacent barracks,  where they took refuge. But, despite all opposition, Wentworth and Bland were  easily first when the final count came. </p>
  <p>Shortly afterwards Parramatta had its turn. Mr. Charles Cowper, a son  of the Archdeacon, had been beaten for Camden, by Mr. Roger Therry, afterwards  the well-known judge. So his supporters determined to give him a show for  Cumberland. Time was short, and the opposition candidate, James Macarthur,  strong and influential The excitement was at fever heat, and although people  felt that the Sydney vote was secure for Cowper, the Macarthur connection and  influence amid the strongholds of the family was too strong to allow very much  hope.</p>
  <p>Towards evening people began to muster around the committee rooms,  situated in a new building where Lassetter&rsquo;s ironmongery department stands now,  for it was known that Cowper would ride in from Parramatta with the final  pollings from that town and the neighbourhood. Crowds filled the Haymarket, and  George-street was impassable, so that when, very late, distant cheering was  heard, his committee could not get out to discover the cause. However, they  presently saw Cowper borne aloft on six men&rsquo;s shoulders, and after a time, he  was landed safely among them, having beaten Macarthur by 132 votes. And thus  was the future Sir Charles Cowper introduced to Australian political life,  after a struggle, the keenness and bitterness of which we, at this latter day,  find it rather hard to realise, pretty certain, as we are, that by no efforts  of our own can we change the dreary level of mediocrity that has for years  distinguished each legislative see-saw in the representative Chamber.</p>
  <p>As going to show the insecurity of life and property in Sydney in 1844,  two instances may here be given of the cool brutality and heartlessness that  characterised the criminal class that still made up the great part of the  population of the city. In the early part of the year a ticket-of-leave-man  from Norfolk Island went into the shop of a poor old widow woman at the corner  of Kent and Margaret streets, and asked to be served with some trifling  article. Whilst Mrs. Jamieson was serving him, the scoundrel split her head  open with a tomahawk. She lingered a few days, and then died, leaving two  orphan children. The murderer, John Knatchbull, was what was known as a &ldquo;gentleman  convict&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., well-connected at home. Indeed, his brother, Sir Edward  Knatchbull, on hearing of the occurrence, sent out a sum of money to be  invested for the benefit of the orphans. Strong efforts were also made to get  the murderer off, and he was defended by Robert Lowe, afterwards Lord  Sherbrooke, who then lived in Macquarie-street, opposite the old School of  Industry, and whose wife, it is said, eventually took charge of Mrs. Jamieson&rsquo;s  children&mdash;a girl and a boy&mdash;and had them brought up respectably. But, although  the plea of insanity was set up, the man&rsquo;s record was so bad that he was  condemned to death, and hanged in due course. The proceeds of his crime  amounted to 3s 6d. Then, in the May of the same year, there happened another,  and an equally cold-blooded murder. One Sunday evening Mr. Noble, a general  estate agent, and a well-known and respected citizen, was sitting reading the  Bible aloud to his wife and her sister, when three men entered, one of whom  snapped a pistol at Mr. Noble&rsquo;s head. That gentleman turned and grappled with  his assailant; the women screamed, and two of the fellows escaped by the back  door. But Mr. Noble, forced to release the first one he had seized, now  collared another, and held him until assistance arrived. Not till then was Noble  found to have been stabbed in the stomach. The wound proved mortal, and the  unfortunate man died in two days. The captive (Martin) turned approver, and  presently the others (Vigors and Burdett) were captured, tried, and, of course  duly hanged. But what made the citizens so excited over this affair was the  fact that the three criminals&mdash;all Norfolk Island convicts &mdash;were actually under  sentence in Hyde Park Barracks when they escaped and murdered poor Noble. It  seems that as they were entering St. Phillip&rsquo;s on that Sunday they had slipped  out of the gang, and, having plain suits concealed under their branded ones, had  soon transformed themselves into free men, and without the delay of a minute  recommenced their career of crime by a most barbarous murder. Then, of course,  people wanted to know something about the state of discipline in a gaol where  such goings on were possible; and, finally, on the motion of Dr. Nicholson, a  select Committee of the Legislative Council was appointed to inquire into the  condition both of the Sydney police and the Hyde Park Barracks; also to  consider the expediency of remonstrating against the introduction of &ldquo;Norfolk  Island expirees&rdquo; into the colony.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page050.jpg" width="800" height="557"></p>
  <p>Long ago a price list of necessaries, etc., in the early days was  quoted in this book. It will, perhaps, be of interest to contrast them with a few  figures from 1844-5.</p>
  <p>The Australasian Sugar Refining Company then had their works at  Canterbury, &ldquo;about six miles from Sydney, beyond the pleasant suburbs of New  Town;&rdquo; and for their produce they asked for &ldquo;Fine loaves, on the spot, 4&frac12;d per  lb; ditto, for exportation, 4&frac12;d per lb, free on board; crushed lump, 40s per  cwt.; fine pieces, 30s to 36s per cwt.; molasses, none;&rdquo; and the above list is  signed &ldquo;E. Knox, manager.&rdquo; Tea was still a luxury at from 4s 6d to 5s 6d per  lb. Flour of the best quality was &pound;9 per ton. Butcher&rsquo;s meat of every kind was  plentiful, and the very best description. Beef, 1&frac12;d per lb retail; mutton, 2d  to 2&frac12;d; pork, 4d to 5d; veal, 4&frac12;d to 5&frac12;d. Bread was 2&frac12;d the two-pound loaf.  Grapes of the finest kinds were 3d per lb; but bananas were looked upon as  somewhat of a luxury, though &ldquo;plentiful at 2s per dozen.&rdquo; Peaches sold at from  4d to 1s per basket&mdash;of what size is not stated; but, judging from the  description of the plenteous crop, probably a clothes basket. Walthall&rsquo;s best  colonial tobacco was 1s 6d per lb; other sorts down to 8d. House rent was  considered high, &pound;30 per annum being paid for a small cottage in an unfavorable  situation. &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; says an old writer, &ldquo;will, however, certainly remedy this  evil&rdquo; In which statement he has not been so thoroughly borne out as one might  altogether wish.</p>
  <p>Until the last few years imprisonment for debt still formed part of the  law of the land; but that was now abolished, and the debtor&rsquo;s prison, situated  close to the treadmill at the corner of Pitt and Gipps streets, was untenanted.  At one time, on payment of 5s a week, any creditor could keep his unfortunate  victim &ldquo;walking the rules&rdquo; for life if he so pleased. But that was all over  now; and by virtue of an Insolvency Act, passed in these early forties, many  hundreds of people had been released. Braim, &ldquo;walking out of town by the road  leading to the interior of the country,&rdquo; found the old building &ldquo;standing in  solitary and untenanted gloom. It appears to frown now on the barbarism which  could perpetrate this custom so long, and extend it so far; while some  beautiful roses and plants blooming in the front speak eloquently of the  blooming of brighter days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Originally the place was intended, and used as a boys&rsquo; penitentiary&mdash; something after the fashion of our Carpentarian Reformatory&mdash;where the youthful  offenders were taught useful trades, and otherwise reclaimed. Then, at a period  when public works were being rapidly erected, it was used as quarters for the  Government carters, and, from this cause, for a long time retained the name of &ldquo;Carter&rsquo;s  Barracks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Close to the site of the present &ldquo;House&rdquo; in Macquarie-street there  stood in 1843, a mean-looking little building, in which the old Council used to  meet. And here, in a stuffy, close room, the Governor, with the nominee members  around him, sat at a table and discussed matters of state and the affairs of  the colony. When, however, the new Constitution came into being, the place was  found far too small to accommodate the thirty-six representatives, to say  nothing of a stranger&rsquo;s gallery, committee rooms, etc. There was, however, no  money to spare just then for anything grand in the way of a new Chamber; also,  Governor Gipps true to his economical instinct, set his face against any decent  expenditure. So he told the colonial architect to do the job as cheaply as he  could, with the result that the present barracks were run up in six months  &mdash;looking exactly, exteriorly, as we see them today, but, of course with many  improvements inside. Macquarie would have given us a palace ugly enough,  perhaps, but, like everything else he put his hand to massive and enduring. He  was no jerry-builder, and, therefore, none of his work is contemptible, like  that ramshackle erection approved of Gipps and which has cost us almost as much  in repairs as would suffice to build another Victoria Markets.</p>
  <p>Notable among the buildings begun and completed, or nearly so during  the reign of Gipps was the R.C. Church of St. Patrick, built by subscription,  assisted by a grant of &pound;1000 from the State. The first stone was laid on August  25, 1840, by the Archbishop, Dr. Polding, in person and four years later was  dedicated by him, although the interior was not finished for some time  afterwards. The first Jewish Synagogue was also built at a cost of &pound;3600. Up till  then the Jews had no recognised place of worship&mdash;used, indeed, to meet in a  private house, that of Mr. P. J. Cohen, in Jamieson street, offered&nbsp; by him for the purpose. Later on, as their  numbers increased, they took possession of a large room on the northern side of  Bridge-street, afterwards used as a store by a Mr. Gordon. Then, towards the  end of 1841, a site in York-street was purchased at auction, a Synagogue built,  and in 1844, consecrated with all the ceremonies usual upon such an occasion.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page051a.jpg" width="800" height="616"></p>
  <p>When Dr. Polding, the first R.C. Bishop of Australia, went home in  1840, and was created an Archbishop, he ordered a peal of bells. They did not  arrive, however, for two years; then a belfry was erected for them, and they  ushered in the new year of 1843 with their music&mdash;the first of the kind that the  Currency lads and lasses had ever heard.</p>
  <p>Although churches of the established faith were plentiful enough at  this date, we had as yet only the beginnings of a cathedral to boast of. There  was, however, close to the site of the present edifice, a parish church of St.  Andrew&rsquo;s, capable of seating 520 people, with, as minister, the Rev. R. K.  Sconce. &ldquo;We should like to see,&rdquo; remarks a writer of the time, &ldquo;greater liberality  evinced by our fellow-colonists in bringing to completion the first cathedral church  in Australia. Protestants would do well in this respect to learn a lesson from  the Roman Catholic community, and emulate their zeal and liberality in  perpetuating their worship and extending their principles.&rdquo; St. James&rsquo;s was  still the fashionable Church, attended by the Governor and his family, and all  the high officials of the colony; also, perforce, by the convicts from the  neighboring barracks. Says old Braim, quaintly&mdash;he was now headmaster of Sydney  College, in succession to Cape&mdash;&rdquo;It has sometimes struck us that if anything can  touch the hearts of these unhappy men (and who should say nothing can?) it must  be when in this land of their expatriation, weekly as the Sabbath returns, they  hear all classes of the community in the great congregation joining in the  beautiful prayers of our inimitable Liturgy, &lsquo;That it may please Thee to show  Thy pity upon all prisoners and captives.&rsquo; &rdquo; Judging from the instances already  given of the way these gentry behaved when they got a little freedom, it would  have taken more than the Liturgy to convert that gloomy audience in the old St.  James&rsquo;s gallery.</p>
  <p>The attendance at St. James&rsquo;s, in 1844 are given as: Morning service,  1400; afternoon, 500; and evening, 1000.</p>
  <p>Apparently, our folk then spent the day very much as the majority of  them do now. Says a writer: &ldquo;We cannot forbear expressing our strong  disapprobation of the practice, but too prevalent in Sydney, of devoting the  latter part of the Lord&rsquo;s day to amusement and pleasure. Dinner parties, water  or land excursions, and a thousand means are devised to &lsquo;kill the time&rsquo; of this  sacred day, at least, so soon as the morning service is closed.&rdquo; To attend  Divine service three times, &ldquo;and spend the intervals in silent communion with  holy things&rdquo; was a fashion of passing Sunday no more in favour then than it is  now.</p>
  <p>Spite, however, of its irreligiousness, the city throve apace, both by  land and sea. Everywhere around the foreshores centipedal wharves thrust  themselves into the water, whilst ever more and more ships came from oversea  and rested alongside them to discharge the wares of the old land in return for  the produce of the new. Such men as &ldquo;Merchant&rdquo; Campbell and &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; Town were  the fathers of the shipping interest, and it was through them, and the like of  them, that the city was gradually being fringed with the tall spars that  spelled commerce. And we had gone on building ships, too, all the time. In 1834  we built nine, amounting in all to 376 tons; but, in 1843, we put no less than  47 into the water, aggregating 1433 tons&mdash;small coasters, of course, but fine,  handy, useful craft. Of vessels, exclusive of these registered in the port,  there were less than 92, making up 7,022 tons altogether&mdash;only a little over the  individual tonnage of some of the mail-boats of to-day, certainly; but then we  were still very young, and it takes time to develop a mercantile marine. And,  actually, we did more towards it during that first half-century than we have,  comparatively, done ever since.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page051b.jpg" width="471" height="650"></p>
  <p>Nearing the latter end of Gipps&rsquo;s governorship, an occurrence took  place at the barracks, which at one period promised serious developments. At  this time the 99th regiment were there under Lieutenant-Colonel Despard, &ldquo;Stand-off-the-grass  Despard,&rdquo; so called because he had forbidden the public to walk on the turf in  the barrack-square, and had put up a notice to that effect. In those days  soldiers had a regular allowance of grog, and, presently, Despard stopped it.  Then the troops became mutinous, and refused point-blank to obey orders. Sir  Maurice O&rsquo;Connell, at that time Commander, of the forces, went to the barracks,  accompanied by his staff, to try and dissuade the men from their foolish  action, the consequences of which he took good care to point out to them. But  he spoke in vain. Then, becoming angry, he said he would arm the Cockatoo  Island convicts, and lead them against the mutineers. This still more  aggravated the 99th, and the men seized their arms and threatened Sir Maurice  and his officers with personal violence.</p>
  <p>At this time, H.M.S. Havanna was lying in the harbor, but her commander  does not seem to have offered to help the authorities in any way whatever.  Perhaps he thought colonial quarrels were none of his business.</p>
  <p>So there seemed nothing for it but to send for troops to Hobart Town,  where was quartered the 11th Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Bloomfield. On  receipt of the news, that officer at once chartered the barque Tasmania, and  the 11th, 400 rank and file of them, set sail for Sydney. In three days, they  were off Coogee Bay, the strong westerlies came up, and it was another week  before they entered the Heads. During her beating about outside, the Havanna  passed without taking the slightest notice of them.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, the 99th, hearing of the expected arrivals, had  thought better of things, made their submission, and returned to duty.</p>
  <p>The 11th arrived on January 8, 1846, and were, as soon as possible, put  in lighters, and landed at the Commissariat Wharf. There they formed up, and  marched four deep, with fixed bayonets, towards the barracks, their band  playing, &ldquo;Paddy, Will You Now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When they arrived, they found the gates closed; but on Colonel  Bloomfield&rsquo;s command, they were at once opened, and the main-guard of the 99th  turned out, and presented arms to the 11th, as they marched in and formed up,  whilst nearly all the men, women, and children of the late mutinous regiment  joined in three hearty cheers for the newcomers. And thus happily ended an  episode that, but for the prompt action of the authorities, might have had a  very different termination.</p>
  <p>The 11th stayed in Sydney for a year, and Colonel Bloomfield, so far as  his regiments&rsquo; portion of the barrack green was concerned, gave orders that no  citizens were to be prevented from walking on it. It should be explained that,  especially when the band was playing in the rotunda, it was a favorite resort  of the city folk. There is still a rotunda in the square, but no band ever  plays there, and &ldquo;dead beats&rdquo; sprawl over the grass at their own sweet will and  pleasure. In the following January, the 11th returned to Van Diemen&rsquo;s land, and  were quartered at Launceston. But such a favorite had the regiment become in  Sydney, that the townspeople petitioned the General to allow them to return,  and take the place of the 99th&mdash;a noted lot of &ldquo;hard cases&rdquo;&mdash;and actually offered  to bear the cost of the regiments&rsquo; transit both ways. This was acceded to. And,  in August, 1848, the 11th returned, and were the first troops to occupy the new  Victoria Barracks. As for the 99th, they were ordered from Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land to  India. Both colonies, apparently, being very glad indeed to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned, as showing the hold that fine soldier, Colonel  Bloomfield, had over his men, that, although during the stay of the 11th in New  South Wales, the gold discoveries took place, with all their ensuing excitement  and feverish unrest, scarcely a soldier deserted from his regiment. Says a new  arrival, writing in 1846, and staying at &ldquo;Petty&rsquo;s Hotel, a respectable, quiet  establishment&rdquo; Passing through Barrack Square to mine inn, shortly before 9 o&rsquo;clock,  I found tattoo going on, and drums and fifes of the 99th regiment rattling away  at Mrs. Waylett&rsquo;s the pretty old song of &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be a Butterfly,&rsquo; in the most  spirited style, just as if we were not 16,000 miles away from the Horse Guards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With two regiments established in the heart of the city, the military  element in those days was evidently an important factor in the social life of  the place. And doubtless, conflicts between the soldiers and the &ldquo;pushes&rdquo;&mdash;then  known as the Cabbage-Tree mob&mdash;were so common as to be hardly worth chronicling.  The Cabbage-Trees are described as &ldquo;an unruly set of young fellows,  native-born, generally, who hung about the doors of the Sydney theatres, and,  not being able to perhaps muster coin enough to enter the house, amuse  themselves by molesting those who can afford that luxury. Dressed in a suit of  fustian or colonial tweed, and the emblem of their order&mdash;the low-crowned  cabbage-palm hat&mdash;the main object of their enmity seems to be the ordinary black  headpiece worn by respectable persons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, we have improved somewhat on that sort of business, so far, at  least, as the theatres are concerned; but although one of the favorite haunts  of the up-to-date evolution of the cabbage-tree mob&mdash;the straw hat brigade&mdash;is a  church porch, whence they can insult the worshippers at their exits and  entrances, the change of venue has not improved their behaviour in any very  great measure.</p>

    Sporting In The Forties.</b></h2>
  <p>From time to time during the course of this chronicle a glance has been  taken at the sports of the people, and the progress of horse-racing, yachting,  etc., among them noted. Early cricket was also touched upon, as seen then, in a  rather crude and incomplete condition; but during the forties more interest was  taken in cricket than at any prior period. It may, indeed, from that time be  said to become the Australian game par excellence. Some years ago Mr. Harry  Hilliard says: &ldquo;There were perhaps, in this year (1843) 100 cricketers in  Sydney. Messrs. W. and R. still were both fine bats, as was also a gentleman  named Palmer, connected with banking. I myself was also accounted an excellent  bat. Rowley, a cabinetmaker, was the crack bowler, underhand, of course. His  bowling had a natural break of five or six inches from leg. Oh! I can tell you  that Rowley would have puzzled a lot of our modern bats&mdash;for a while, anyhow.&rdquo;  Of course, in these days there was no foot ball; horseracing seem to have gone  much out of favour, and yachting was not very popular. Therefore, cricket  throve amain, and clubs sprung up everywhere. There was the Currency, composed  entirely of colonials, and to which Mr. Hilliard belonged; the Union,  Victorian, Albert, and Australian.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page053a.jpg" width="800" height="505"></p>
  <p>The matches of importance were played in Hyde Park The city teams, too,  then, as now, went inland to Parramatta, Liverpool and Windsor. And about one  of these country matches Hilliard used to tell a curious little story:</p>
  <p>The Australian Club, it appears, went to Windsor to play the locals for  whom Hilliard stood umpire, whilst Mr. Saddler performed the same office for  the visitors. Among the Windsor players were two brothers named Bushell; and  Saddler gave one of them out &ldquo;leg before.&rdquo; The batsman, however, stoutly  contested this decision, backed up by his brother, who exclamed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee go  out, Bill and if t&rsquo; umpire tries to put &lsquo;ee out, knock him down with &lsquo;ee bat.&rdquo;  And, finally to avoid a free fight, another innings had to be given to Bushell.  Evidently country cricket was a thing to be taken very seriously in the forties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We used&rdquo; says Hilliard, &ldquo;to have great trouble to keep the wickets  anything like decent. You see there was no supervision of the ground and even the  clubs would fight among themselves for the possession of a choice pitch.  Sometimes we would send up boys to hold a pitch for us from daybreak on the  morning of the match. A device we had to keep the people off the grass was to  tar the underside of the top rail of the fences. The tar hung down in drips,  and as intruders came through it would smear their clothes.&rdquo; None of the  Governors except Sir William Denison, according to Mr. Hilliard, took any  interest in cricket, although some of the young aides, and others of the staff,  used occasionally to have a game. Sir James Martin, as a youngster, played a great  deal, but never attained much, proficiency. In Mr. Hilliard&rsquo;s opinion the real  father of New South Wales cricket was Mr. Tunks. &ldquo;It was he and I who put the  first spade into the present Domain ground. He kept a publichouse in those days,  but always encouraged the cricketers to drink tea. Whenever we had a match, we  had tea with good old Mrs. Tunks. Also, Mr. Driver, a solicitor, and an M.P.,  and the son of the proprietor of an hotel called the Three Tuns, which stood at  the corner of King and Elizabeth streets, just where Temple Court now stands,  was another great patron of the game, but he was never much of a player, though  he was always ready to help us with his money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hilliard was one of six Currency lads, who played in the first  intercolonial match with Victoria, and he says most of the team fielded  barefoot. This was in 1856, and was won by New South Wales by three wickets.  Then, in 1857, the Melbourne men came to Sydney, and met in the Outer Domain,  being again beaten. The excitement was intense, the Governor and all sorts and  conditions of people being present, to the number of 10,000. The match lasted  two days and a half. Scores: New South Wales, 80 and 86; Victoria, 63 and 38.  Slow bats and cautious in those days, with a top score (Gilbert) of 31. His  batting, said the newspapers, &ldquo;was the theme of universal admiration.&rdquo; Well,  truly times have changed since that stonewalling era, and the papers of to-day  would doubtless comment on such a performance somewhat differently&mdash;unless the  31 were made in as many minutes.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page053b.jpg" width="800" height="584"></p>
  <p>The group portrait of New South Wales Rifle champions marks an  interesting stage in the Australian volunteer movement, and particularly in  that branch of it which has for its object the making of marksmen. The picture  illustrates an account of the first intercolonial rifle match held in  Australia, and, appropriately enough, the contestants were New South Wales and  Victoria, whose representatives since then have met in many friendly shootings,  with varying fortune. The mother colony proved victorious at the first trial of  skill at the targets, and there is no doubt that the wider field of fame opened  up to riflemen by this intercolonial meeting did much towards establishing the  present satisfactory state of affairs. From beating the men of his own colony  the champion began to covert honors further afield, and ultimately the pinnacle  was reached when he was sent home to meet the best shots in Great Britain. The  idea of the first match originated with the members of the Victorian Rifle  Association, and, although all the colonies were invited to take part, none of  them could see their way clear to accept the invitation. The conditions  governing the match were that each colony should contribute &pound;50 per annum for  three years, for the purpose of purchasing a challenge shield which had to be  won three times in succession before passing into the possession of any colony.  In consideration of the first meeting being held in Melbourne, the Victorian  Association donated a further sum of &pound;50 to the successful competitors in the  first year. Bona-fide volunteers alone were eligible, and the use of any rifle  with a trigger pull of 3lb was allowed. Each competitor had ten shots at each  of the respective distances of 200, 300, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 yards,  making seventy shots in all, Hythe position, and Wimbledon system of scoring.  Ten of the best shots in New South Wales were selected by the association, and  a like number was chosen by the Victorian Association, from their shooting in  four special practices. The two teams met at the Melbourne butt on November 3,  1862, when, after a keenly contested match, especially up to 700 yards, the men  from the parent colony won with 64 points to spare. Their superiority over the  Victorians was principally apparent at the long ranges. In these days of  shooting with uniform weapons, it is almost impossible to compare with any  degree of fairness present scores with those of the match of 1862. Still, the  scores made in that contest were undoubtedly good, for shooting had not been  reduced to the fine art it is now. The scores on the New South Wales side were:  Corporal Lynch 182, Trooper Sharp 177, Private Rayner 168, Sergeant Webb 152,  Private Wyndham 150, Lieutenant Campbell 144, Sergeant Strong 140,  Sergeant-Major Hellyer 134, Private Dickson 125, Captain Windeyer 125; total,  1497. On the Victorian side the total was 1432 points, made up as under:  Private M&rsquo;Naughton 175, Sergeant Wright 154, Sergeant Douglas 154, Sergeant  Sleep 152, Private Cole 151, Captain Radcliffe 141, Sergeant Templeton 140,  Private Peterson 132, Private M&rsquo;Ewan 124, Private Frost 109. A banquet in the  evening wound up the event, and on the following day the Sydney men embarked  for home on the City of Sydney. On the way up the coast she was wrecked near  Green Cape (November 5, 1862). Fortunately, all lives were saved, but uniforms,  private effects, and valuable small-bore rifles were lost.</p>
  <p>A Mr. Davis, of Bourke- street, Melbourne, photographed the victorious  ten, of whom six belonged to the Sydney Battalion Volunteer Rifles, one to the  suburban battalion, and one to the country corps (West Maitland). The Mounted  Rifles furnished the other two&mdash;Sergeant-major Hellyer and Trooper Sharp.  Captain Harbottle, S.B.V.R., accompanied the team as captain, and  Sergeant-major Lees, of the Staff, acted as marker.</p>
  <p>If ever there was a nondescript sort of a city in these forties it was  Sydney. And, yet, as every visitor allowed, it bore a pre-eminently English  aspect Writes one in particular: &ldquo;Sydney is, I think, more exclusively English  in its population than either Liverpool or London. Were it not for an  occasional orange tree in full bloom or fruit in the backyard of some of the  older cottages, or a flock of little green parrots whistling as they alight for  a moment on a house top, one might fancy himself at Brighton or Plymouth.&rdquo; This  would require a rather fervid imagination, one fancies; and our author gets  nearer the mark when he says, &ldquo;it might be Waterford or Wapping, with a dash of  Nova Scotian Halifax.&rdquo; Indeed, he and many others like him, seem to have been  very considerably puzzled to find comparisons. But old pictures will thoroughly  bear out his remark, that the &ldquo;construction of the buildings is blameably  ill-suited to a semi-tropical climate&mdash;barefaced, smug-looking tenements,  without verandahs or even broad eaves.&rdquo; Nor, indeed, is it necessary to consult  contemporary views to see the justice of this criticism, inasmuch as, at the  present day, you can see, in places, the same &ldquo;smug, barefaced,&rdquo; old houses  still standing, forlorn, disreputable, blistered by the sun and rain of many years.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page054a.jpg" width="800" height="574"></p>
  <p>Goats were still a conspicuous feature of our streets. &ldquo;Nearly every  cottage has its goat or family of goats. They ramble about the highways and  by-ways, picking up a haphazard livelihood during the day, and going home  willingly or compulsorily to be milked at night. Woe betide the suburban garden  whose gate is left for a moment unclosed&hellip; In an instant the bearded tribes rush  in, and, in a few seconds roses, sweet peas, carnations, stocks, etc., are as  closely nibbled down as though a flock of locusts had bivouacked for a week on  the spot; and the neat flower-beds are dotted over with little clover feet, as  if ten thousand infantine devils had been dancing there&mdash;a juvenile sabbat.&rdquo; The  man who wrote that wrote feelingly, and one can see that more than once his  garden-gate had been left open, even as they still are, and with the same  results. Like the poor and the unemployed, the goats we seem fated to have  always with us.</p>
  <p>Pitt-street, even half a century ago or more, appears to have been  noted for its linen drapers&rsquo; shops: &ldquo;Whether we regard the excellence of their  arrangements, the sterling value of the commodities, the costliness of their  large and showy windows, and at night, the glistening splendor of their lamps,  sometimes most tastefully ornamented, we cannot but feel proud of our city; and  even the stranger must acknowledge that those houses of business would not  disgrace any of our older towns in the mother country.&rdquo; Evidently, the predecessors  of our Horderns, Ways, Farmers, etc., kept as well up-to-date as do their  descendants.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page054b.jpg" width="800" height="598"></p>
  <p>A picture of O&rsquo;Connell-street towards the end of the forties is worth  re-producing. Referring to the similarity of the name with that of the  celebrated Irish agitator the old writer says: &ldquo;Start not, gentle reader, at  the name; the place bearing this designation is calm and peaceful as you can  desire. We have no &lsquo;agitation&rsquo; here, save the calm agitation of shrubs and  flowers, which adorn the little gardens smiling on either side, fanned as they  are by soft zephyrs, gaily playing around. Whatever opinion may be entertained  of the name, but one can be held regarding the street. It is one of the most &ldquo;tasty&rdquo;  in Sydney. The houses, as we have already hinted, have gardens before them,  some of which are kept with much neatness by their careful owners. Here may be  seen our native and English plants, vying which shall outshine the other, which  shall more adorn the garden plot, which more adorn the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course, as the writer remarks later on, the street was named &ldquo;in  honor of our worthy Commander of the Forces, Sir Maurice O&rsquo;Connell.&rdquo; But, alas,  the only zephyrs there to-day are formed of sand and dust, and the perfume is  mostly chemical in its nature; whilst the &ldquo;tastiness&rdquo; of those bygone days has  fled for ever. </p>
  <p>And they thought a lot of their streets in those times. The running of  Pitt-street right through to the Quay was then under discussion; &ldquo;it will thus  be rendered the main street of the town; and, when completed, the line of road  for traffic, nearly two miles in length, will, besides its vast accommodation,  be no small ornament to our fair city. We may remark of the streets of Sydney  generally that they are very regular and well-formed.&mdash;Pitt and Castlereagh  streets are almost in straight lines, though each extends about a mile and a  half.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By all visitors the palm was almost unanimously awarded to the  Congregational Church in Pitt-street as the handsomest building in the city. It  was designed by Mr. John Bibb, and erected under his supervision, the  foundation-stone having been laid by Dr. Ross, on Anniversary Day, 1841. Then,  by reason of the embarrassed state of affairs in the colony, it was soon  afterwards thought prudent to discontinue building. In 1844 a fresh start was  made; and in January, 1846, the church was first opened for public worship. The  first ornamental iron columns cast in Sydney were made for this edifice by Mr.  Dawson. They were fourteen in number, of the Ionic order, fluted, and finished  an imitation bronze. The organ was also of colonial manufacture, and was built  specially for the church by Mr. W. J. Johnson, also of this city. In the same  year, under the direction of the same architect, the Union Bank of Australia,  at the corner of Pitt and Hunter streets, was added to and enlarged, until it  was regarded as one of the greatest ornaments of Sydney.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page055.jpg" width="800" height="620"></p>
  <p>In King-street, in a shop on the left-hand side, going towards Queen&rsquo;s  Square, which, perhaps some old residents can still identify, lived and  flourished the notorious Quaker, John Tawell, transported for forgery. This  remarkable man reached Sydney in 1814, and his knowledge of drugs procured his  retention as assistant in the convict hospital, instead of being assigned as a  servant up country. In this situation he continued some three years, when he  received his ticket-of-leave, and, shortly afterwards, one of emancipation. Then,  in 1832, he set up as a chemist&mdash;the first regular business of the kind in the  colony&mdash;and at once began to thrive. He also embarked in the shipping trade,  engaged in oil speculation, bought up all the whalebone that came to the port  and was the first person in the colony to convert it into an article of  profitable export. Piety and good works seem in those days to have been the keynote of his  life. He became a shining light among the Society of Friends, and built them a  meeting-house in Macquarie-street. Judge Therry knew him well, and says that  his whole aspect and demeanour proclaimed him a very saintly personage indeed.  He it was who, having ordered a large consignment of spirits from England, and  having, in the meantime, changed his views respecting &ldquo;the liquor traffic,&rdquo;  caused the whole lot to be emptied into the harbor. And Backhouse, the  travelling Quaker, must have witnessed the occurrence, for he says, although  not mentioning Tawell by name:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had the satisfaction of seeing the destruction of five puncheons of  rum, containing four hundred and ninety-two gallons, and two hogsheads of  Geneva, containing one hundred and sixteen gallons. They were the property of  one of our friends, whose agent in England had not been apprised of a change in  the views of his correspondent with respect to the use and sale of spirits, in  which he cannot now be conscientiously concerned. He, therefore, represented  the case to the Governor, who allowed them to be taken out of bond free of  duty, and under charge of an officer of Customs placed on board a staged boat,  which took them out into the Cove, where the heads of the casks were removed,  and the contents poured into the sea&hellip; We were much pleased with the hearty  manner in which the Custom house officers superintended the sacrifice of  property to principle.&rdquo; Something like an advertisement for Tawell, too, this  curious business!</p>
  <p>After absence of sixteen years Tawell returned to England a rich man,  or at least fairly so, although the troubles of 1843 affected him considerably.  There he married a second wife (the first had followed him to Sydney, and died  in the colony). Then becoming involved in a liason with a woman named Sarah  Hart, be eventually killed her by poisoning; and was tried and executed, thus  ending a life of most consummate hypocrisy, intermingled with adventurous and  romantic incidents that would fill a volume to relate in detail</p>
  <p>It was on the occasion of this murder that the electric telegraph began  its long existence as a factor in the detection of crime. And Tawell was its  first capture. From the Slough Railway Station there flashed along the line to  Paddington the message: &ldquo;An elderly man, between 50 and 60; short; in the garb  of a Quaker, with broad-brimmed hat and white cravat. Left here 7.42 train;  watch his movements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So much for John Tawell, forger and murderer, but, above all, arch-hypocrite  of his time.</p>
  <p>Mention must be made of the 54th anniversary, on which day there was a  big demonstration on the harbor, no less than seven steamers puffing about,  laden with people to view the regatta; whilst the band of the 28th Regiment  aboard the flagship (the Royal Sovereign) played various patriotic airs.  Lieutenant-Colonel Barney, of the Royal Engineers gave a sort of garden party  on the Fort Macquarie green, at which were present Sir George and Lady Gipps,  and most of the official notabilities.</p>
  <p>The dinner took place at the Royal Hotel at 7 o&rsquo;clock that evening, and  Captain O&rsquo;Connell, the native-born son of Sir Maurice, and, in due time, Sir  Maurice in his turn, took the chair, with Robert Nichols as vice. There were  170 guests present, and James Martin, then a youngster of 22, and articled  clerk to Nichols, was called upon to reply to the toast of &ldquo;Civil and Religious  Liberty,&rdquo; a sentiment which gives a very broad hint of what some folks were  striving after, even as late as that.</p>
  <p>In &lsquo;46 there took place the last of these meetings, which had then lost  all political significance. But on the very same evening there was a public  dinner, at which there was some very strong speaking indeed. Robert Lowe, for  instance, made a speech on &ldquo;Reform of the Colonial Policy,&rdquo; in which he hit  hard at the Government, and concluded by telling his audience that &ldquo;If you  would be free, yourselves must strike the blow&mdash;not at the men, but at the  system that enslaves you.&rdquo; James Martin was present as the champion of the  press, with which he was then connected, writing weekly articles for the &ldquo;Atlas,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;making things hum&rdquo; with the bold versatility of youth.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page056.jpg" width="800" height="519"></p>
  <p>Whatever visitors may have thought of our city, they invariably went  into ecstacies over our Botanic Gardens, which, under the fostering care of the  noted botanist, Allan Cunningham, had long been noted far and wide as &ldquo;the Eden  of the East.&rdquo; Poor Cunningham was lost, in 1835, whilst with Major Mitchell,  upon one of the latter&rsquo;s exploring trips in the neighbourhood of the Bogan  River, and was never more heard of. But in one of the ponds of the lower  portion of the gardens he loved so well, and did so much for, there is a stone  obelisk erected to his memory, and surrounded by clumps of aquatic plants. Both  explorer and botanist deserve well of their fellow-colonists, inasmuch as one  gave us the water-bag and the other our Gardens. Certainly, Mitchell&rsquo;s first  bag was a primitive affair, being merely sacking smeared over with mutton fat;  but it was the fore-runner of its canvas evolution, which has not only proved a  source of immeasurable comfort to bushmen throughout Australasia, but, into the  bargain, saved many hundreds of lives. No statue of Mitchell should be complete  without the presentment of one.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page057a.jpg" width="800" height="585"></p>
  <p>In those days the Gardens were divided into two sections, known as the  Upper and the Lower, the first of which was laid out in trim walks, partrerres,  and flower beds; whilst the other was left more in its natural condition,  diversified by lawns, rockeries, ponds, and clumps of shrubs. Both gardens were  enclosed by walls and high paling fences, and between these ran a carriage  drive, giving access to the Domain from Fort Macquarie. Of late years the drive  has been closed, and the whole space practically thrown into one. Under the  able management of Mr. Charles Moore, who for many years was the curator,  extensive additions and alterations were made, much ground reclaimed from the  sea, and now the gardens cover a space of some 150 acres. A familiar feature of  the grounds is the noble Norfolk Island pine, towering to a height of 107ft,  with a trunk measuring 30ft at the base. Nearly thirty years ago there appeared  a picture of this fine tree in the &ldquo;Illustrated Sydney News.&rdquo; With the accompanying  letterpress was a statement that it was not known when the great pine was  planted. This brought the following interesting letter, which speaks for itself:&mdash;</p>
  <p>Redburnburg, Singleton,<br>
    March 23, 1872.<br>
    Sir,&mdash;My attention having been drawn to an article in your paper relative to the  large Norfolk Island pine in the Botanic Gardens, in which you state that it is  not known when the said tree was planted, I beg to inform you that I planted it  in the year 1818, at which time I was employed in the Gardens. It had  previously been planted in the lower garden, near the watercourse, and had been  washed out during some heavy rains that occurred about that time. It was lying  half-buried in sand for almost six months, when, it was removed and planted by  me in its present situation, in the year above stated. Mrs. Macquarie was  present on the occasion, and handed me the tree to place in the ground; it was  then about two feet six inches in height.&mdash;Your obedient servant, John  Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page057b.jpg" width="800" height="601"></p>
  <p>Some time in 1847 improvements were started at the General Post Office,  and a handsome portico was erected. &ldquo;Six Doric columns support an elaborate  entablature and pediment, with the Royal arms (executed by Mr. Abraham, an able  sculptor resident in the colony) in the centre of the tympanum. The whole  effect is chaste and severe, and much more befitting the aspect of a place of  business than a mere ornamental and gaudy design would be. When the Barracks  are removed the portico will afford a noble termination to the street which  will be opened, forming a vista in front of the building.</p>
  <p>What, one wonders, would old Fowles have thought of our present Post  Office palace could he have lived to see it! And, by the way, it may be  mentioned that at least three of those doric columns are still in existence.  One is erected at Bradley&rsquo;s Head to serve the purpose of a beacon, at that end of  the measured mile between it and Fort Denison; the other two are, or were,  until quite lately, serving as gate posts at the corner of Oxford and Queen-streets.  Sic transit!</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page058a.jpg" width="800" height="585"></p>
  <p>An old landmark that has recently disappeared, is the building once  known as Hancock&rsquo;s Tower, for over half a century a familiar object in the eyes  of Sydney folk. Hancock, it seems, was a wheelwright, whose shop stood near the  site of the present Roberts&rsquo;s Hotel, at the corner of George and Market  streets. Here he flourished, made much money, and eventually retiring from  business, built himself the residence of which the curious tower formed a  portion. Constructed of large squared stones, with battlemented walls, from  whose lofty embrasures protruded dummy guns, or &ldquo;Quakers,&rdquo; it looked more like  some mediaeval fortress than aught else; whilst, to heighten the effect, at  each corner was the carved effigy of a knight in armour, and the low Norman  roof was surmounted by a large weathercock.</p>
  <p>All sorts of &ldquo;fairy stories&rdquo; clustered around this building, the  favorite one being that Hancock had erected it for the purpose of therein  immuring his wife, Bluebeard fashion, in some dim and gloomy chamber; and  children used to look up half scared, half expectant, at the high windows, to  catch a glimpse of the unfortunate lady peering from her prison.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page058b.jpg" width="800" height="574"></p>
  <p>Between the Tower and the old inn adjoining it, also once a prominent  feature of the neighbourhood, Hancock had laid out a court yard with  flower-beds and trellises. And here, too, he placed a statue, life-sized, and  carved out of stone. This, Hancock left orders, so it is said, in his will, was  to be erected over his grave. His wish was carried into effect, and the statue  may still be seen by the curious at Rookwood.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter  XIII.<br>
    Some Early Suburbs &amp; Islands.</b></h2>
  <p>No history of Sydney would be complete without some reference to its  early suburbs and the appearance they presented in those days. Gradually the  shores of the sequestered bays and inlets were being built upon; and Potts&rsquo;  Point, Woolloomooloo, Rushcutter, and Elizabeth Bays, the North Shore, Balmain,  Pyrmont, and others were becoming favorite residential resorts, of the  wealthier citizens who built what were then considered fine mansions &mdash;as indeed  most of them were&mdash;laid out grounds, and made themselves generally very  comfortable. On Potts&rsquo; Point, at the end of the forties, there may have been  half a dozen or so of houses all told. Equally with the old &ldquo;Fig Tree,&rdquo; it was  then a favorite&nbsp; resort of swimmers who  used to go out in parties and race from one point to the other, often paying  for their temerity with their lives, by reason either of cramp or sharks. Mundy  mentions that, in December, 1849, a man swimming near the Fig Tree, was seized  by a very large shark; so close in shore was this, that some of the bathers  present beat off the brute with their boathooks. But the poor fellow died from  loss of blood in a few minutes.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page059a.jpg" width="800" height="599"></p>
  <p>For a great number of years Robinson&rsquo;s Baths&mdash;a large hulk&mdash;moored and  used as a public bathing place&mdash;lay in Woolloomooloo Bay, and was then the only  place of the kind in the colony. Higher up towards the head of the bay,  somewhere about the site of the present Art Gallery, was a peculiar pile of  rocks known as the &ldquo;Steps,&rdquo; because somebody had once gone to the trouble of  cutting a number of stairs in the cliff. But the &ldquo;steps&rdquo; and the surrounding  ridges have long ago been quarried and filled up, and now form part of the  reclamation upon which is Cowper&rsquo;s Wharf. High water mark, then, extended to  beyond Plunket-street of the present, some thirteen or fourteen hundred feet  inland from the edge of the present wharf. There was also an arm of the harbor  that ran up in the south-west corner of the bay nearly to Woolloomooloo-street.  And although from the shallowness of the bay, there was a great expanse of sand  and mud flats at low tide, yet at high tide it was possible to fish from some  of the verandahs or windows of a few houses along the shore line.</p>
  <p>Much diversity of opinion obtains respecting the name of this old  suburb. Colonel Mundy writing forty years ago, says that it is merely a  corruption of Wala Mala&mdash;the aboriginal term for &ldquo;the Place of Tombs,&rdquo; and that  it was an old burial place of the blacks. Other authorities give the correct  spelling as Wallahmulla, and say that it is derived from the fashion after  which the natives tried to pronounce the word &ldquo;windmill.&rdquo; Mundy&rsquo;s theory, or  rather that of whoever gave him the information, seems the most feasible. However  this may be, Woolloomooloo was originally a grant to Mr. Commissary Palmer, who  formed upon it a sort of model farm. The boundaries of the estate reached from  the water to the Old South Head road, now Oxford-street, and were defined by  ditches and high stone walls. Mr. Palmer himself lived in a house near the  junction of Palmer and William streets, which was later on occupied by  Archbishop Polding. Afterwards, about a hundred acres of the grant were  acquired by a Mr. Riley, and for long afterwards was known as the Riley estate.</p>
  <p>Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay&mdash;so called from the fact that there, in 1788, two men,  convicts employed in cutting rushes, were set upon by natives and speared to  death&mdash;was in especial favor for residing in at this time. It must not be forgotten  that the bay, or rather its foreshores, was the spot where was established what  might be called the first Australian market garden. To the south, at the head  of the bay, there spread a big flat enriched by alluvial washed down from the  adjoining high lands and added to by silt from the shores. When the New South  Head road was made, this valley above it was drained and formed into a big  series of vegetable beds, which supplied the city for many years. Through the  centre of the valley ran a creek, spanned by a strong bridge with a single arch  just where it was crossed by the Lower South Head road. At a short distance  from this Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay bridge, on the left-hand side, stood a house of call  known as the &ldquo;White Conduit House,&rdquo; Early settlers in the colonies were prone  to call places in the new land after other and well-known ones at home. And, in  this instance, the &ldquo;White Conduit&rdquo; perpetrated its English namesake far away in  Pentonville, noted for its arbors, fish ponds, and shady walks, also as a resort  on Sundays of citizens, their apprentices and wives; where they could get hot loaves  and butter, tea and fresh milk. And, in some sort, such were the inducements  held out to visitors from the city by its Antipodean prototype at Rushcutter&rsquo;s  Bay. To reach it one took a pleasant stroll across the paddocks adjoining Hyde  Park, through Woolloomoolloo Valley, and up to the eastern heights via the  present William-street&mdash;then a pretty country lane, fringed at intervals with  gardens; then past the great stone windmills on Darlinghurst, through some  scrubby gullies, and to the White Conduit for a &ldquo;long sleever&rdquo; of Cooper&rsquo;s XXX,  or, perhaps, something stronger hailing from Underwood&rsquo;s distillery not very  far distant.</p>
  <p>The old house, although a good deal altered, still stands, and is  easily recognised by old residents.</p>
  <p>As for Darling Point, to which, just past the &ldquo;Conduit,&rdquo; the road turned  off, it was considered in those days rather too remote for a suburban residence.  But, later on, T. S. Mort &ldquo;took hold&rdquo; on the point, and showed, in beautiful &ldquo;Greenoakes,&rdquo;  what could be done by judiciously assisting nature with art. Those who remember  &ldquo;Greenoakes&rdquo; in its palmiest days will endorse the success of his undertaking,  and his taste in landscape gardening of a high order.</p>
  <p>In 1849, was laid the foundation of the pretty church of St. Mark&rsquo;s;  the work went on until 1851, when the gold fever broke out in Australia; labour  prices rose sky high, and the building was perforce stopped. It was, however,  resumed in 1852, with the result of producing one of the prettiest churches in  the colony. For a very long time Potts&rsquo;s Point remained one of the most  secluded of all Sydney&rsquo;s suburbs. Its rocky foreshores, and rude, steep cliffs,  clothed with thickets of lantana, and bunches of prickly pear and &ldquo;pig-face,&rdquo;  formed indeed, an ideal spot for picnics; and it was easily got at by a short  cut across the sands of Woolloomooloo Bay, But for many years there were only a  few scattered dwellings.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page059b.jpg" width="800" height="650"></p>
  <p>Turning our attention to the North Shore, we find that so long ago as  1824 or 1825 Sir Thomas Brisbane made a grant to Mr. James Milson, sen., of 50  acres of land situated between Careening Cove and Lavender Bay. He might have  had more, but as cultivation was the purpose he had in view, and the ground was  decidedly unsuitable, he went further afield, and in the neighbourhood of  Hornsby selected a large tract of the fertile soil there. Mr. Milson was one of  the first residents on North Shore.</p>
  <p>Another grant was made by Macquarie to William Blue of some 90 acres,  now known as Blue&rsquo;s Point, extending in an easterly direction towards Milson&rsquo;s  Point. Mr. (better known as &ldquo;Billy&rdquo;) Blue, was a native of the West Indies, and  one of his daughters married Mr. Lavender, to whom was given by his  father-in-law that part of the original grant now known as Lavender Bay. Prior  to this it was known as Hulk Bay; and Mr. George Lavender was in charge of the  hulks, on board of which the convicts were kept waiting transference to the  Swan River settlement in Western Australia. A writer, to whose researches, made  with great care and trouble, much of the information respecting North Shore  here set forth is due, says he was informed by Mr. J. S. Abraham that the  native name of Lavender Bay was Quilby. During the first fifty years of the  colony&rsquo;s existence the thickly growing timber of the North Shore forests was  much made use of for building and other purposes. It seems to have been mostly  big gum, and was felled and dressed by gangs of convicts. But there were fig  trees, too, of great size. One specimen was, until recently, still standing at  Milson&rsquo;s Point, The roots and the earth about them were surrounded by a solid  casing of cement. Notwithstanding this, however, some months ago a heavy gale  smote the old warrior, and cast him to the ground.</p>
  <p>So far as can be determined, the first house on Milson&rsquo;s Point belonged  to a Mr. H. T. Green, who lived not very far from where the tree stood. About  1850 his father, Mr. George Green, leased the house and an acre of ground that  went with it from Mr. Robert Campbell; and for long afterwards the thoroughfare  leading to the horse ferry was known as Green&rsquo;s lane. A coloured plan, framed  and glazed, attached to the tree, and which showed the ferry company&rsquo;s land and  its boundaries, often excited the curiosity of passers by who were not near  enough to read it. The original landing-place, as shown in a contemporary  picture, was a low stone wall, and this remained so until the erection of a  wharf, upon which, however, was no shelter of any kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Point&rdquo; appears to have been a favorite camping-place of the  blacks, notably the Cammeray tribe, then the most powerful on the northern side  of the harbor. The first hotel opened on the Point was that known as the  Figtree, at Blue&rsquo;s Point road, kept by Mr. Thomas Redgrave. This was in 1841.  In 1843, Mr. Burns opened the Union Inn, near the Crow&rsquo;s Nest, on Lane Cove  road, and in 1845 Mr. Whitford started business in the Lily of St. Leonard&rsquo;s,  still to be seen, modernised, on nearly the same site in Alfred-street. In  explanation of the rather curious name of this last hostelry, the late Hon.  Geo. Thornton told the writer already referred to, that, in the time of Mr. Dind,  one of the landlords, the sign was the figure of an aboriginal woman; and that  probably the title of the house was merely intended as an early day witticism.</p>
  <p>The Milson family is, of course, intimately associated with the history  of the point bearing its name. Mr. Milson, sen., was one of the earliest  settlers upon it, and his son (Mr. James Milson) was among the first to  establish a steam ferry across to the city. Deputy-Commissioners Miller and  Walker, after whom two of the principal North Sydney streets are named, were  also associated with Mr. Milson in this undertaking.</p>
  <p>The first steam ferryboat to ply from the point was named the Princess,  and was built at Balmain by Mr. Budevent to run as a punt transit of horses and  vehicles. She, however, does not seem to have been a success financially. Some  time afterwards Captains Joseph and Thomas Gerrard ran a steamer built by Mr.  Chowne, of Pyrmont, and called the Fairy Queen.</p>
  <p>In the early fifties a company was formed, which imported a steamer in  sections from England. It was put together in Sydney, named the Herald, and ran  between Blue&rsquo;s and Miller&rsquo;s Points. The Gerrards then changed their route to  Milson&rsquo;s Point. Messrs. J. Milson, jun&bdquo; F. Lord, W. Tucker, C. Firth, and  others were the founders of a steam ferry company trading between Sydney and  the North Shore. They owned three boats&mdash;the Alexandra and the Kirribilli for  passengers, and the Transit for vehicles. After much keen competition the fares  were reduced from a shilling each way to sixpence, and ultimately to  threepence. In 1878 this company sold out to the North Shore Ferry Company, and  the late Captain Summerbell was appointed manager. The fare was then reduced to  twopence, and, then, some years ago to one penny each way.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page060.jpg" width="758" height="650"></p>
  <p>Thirty odd years ago there was a steam ferry from Circular Quay to  Milson&rsquo;s Point, running boats every quarter of an hour; and at the same periods  from Pottinger-street (Macnamara&rsquo;s Wharf), near Windmill-street, to Blue&rsquo;s  Point all at threepenny fares each way. Total daily traffic, about 150  passengers. Settlement, it will thus be seen, was then scarce enough in our  present big suburb of North Sydney. This was due in part to the expense of  clearing the heavy timber, also to the fact that holders of land preferred to  keep it unimproved in the certain hope of an ever-increasing value. Land in the  early days of the Shore was leased for &pound;3 per annum per acre; &pound;50 per acre per  annum would be nearer the present average rate in many spots there.</p>
  <p>Manifestly, a history of the harbor would be out of place here. But a  glance at the early aspect and history of two of its islands, inseparably bound  up as they are with the story of our city, will be of interest.</p>
  <p>Of Garden Island, where Phillip tried with but a small measure of  success to grow vegetables for his infant colony, mention has already been  made.</p>
  <p>As to quite how many times the island we now know as Fort Denison has  changed its name seems uncertain. When Phillip arrived it was a picturesque  rock, called by the natives Mal-te-wan-ye. The Govenor altered that to Rock, or  Rocky, Island. Then, at the first &ldquo;criminal court assembled on February 11,  1788 (says one account), a convict found guilty of robbing another of some  biscuit, was sentenced to be confined on this island for a week, and to be fed  on bread and water alone. The other convicts promptly dubbed the spot &ldquo;Pinchgut,&rdquo;  a name that may be said to have stuck to it until the present day. Another  early historian says, speaking of the harbor islands: &ldquo;The most noted being one  fronting the Cove, bearing the unpoetical name of &lsquo;Pinchgut&rsquo; on account of its  having been the primitive prison of the colony, and the spot whereon  malefactors were in olden times hung in chains!&rdquo; Again one of the oldest  writers, referring to this island, says: &ldquo;On the 29th of November, 1796, eight  men had sentence of death passed upon them, Francis Morgan, for murder, was  executed and his body hung in chains on the island of Mal-te-wan-ye. This  spectacle shocking to the refined mind, served as an object of ridicule to the  convicts and terror to the natives, who, though hitherto particularly partial  to that spot, now totaly abandoned it lest the malefactor should descend and  seize them in the same way as their superstition prompted them to imagine  spirits did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Respecting this island Lang writes: &ldquo;There was a remarkable rock or  islet which from time immemorial had occupied a prominent position in the  harbor in the approach to the city, and which formed a striking object in the  field view from the surrounding heights consisting as it did, of a vast mass of  grey, weather-beaten rock rising perpendicularly in a slender column to an  elevation of 75ft from the deep water&hellip; This natural ornament of the harbor,  however, which no art could have equalled&mdash;this remarkable work of God, which  had stood like a sentinel keeping watch upon the harbor for thousands of years&mdash;was  at length destroyed by the folly of man; some official Goth or Hun, who must  surely have had the organ of destructiveness largely developed, persuaded the  local Government of the day to quarry down the rock very nearly to the water&rsquo;s  edge, with a view of being converted into a battery, forsooth, for the  protection of the harbor! The work of destruction accordingly commenced, and  proceeded apace till this fine object in the field of vision for miles and  miles around in every direction was forever destroyed, and the romantic islet  at length replaced for ten or twelve years thereafter by the unsightliness of  an abandoned quarry. For, as usually happened with Government works under the  beautiful colonial system of the past, the idea of having a fort on Pinchgut  Island was given up after a large expenditure had been incurred in the work of  destruction&mdash;perhaps from feelings of compunction on the part of its authors, if  not in consequence of some unfavorable opinion respecting the proposed erection  from the Ordnance Department in London; and huge piles of rough stones, heaped  up in all possible forms of irregularity and confusion, were, for many years  thereafter the befitting monument of this precious piece of official vandalism.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page061.jpg" width="800" height="597"></p>
  <p>Sir William Denison seems to have, in some sort, made a hobby of the  place; and he it was who had the existing &ldquo;fortification&rdquo; constructed, an  abnormal sort of martello&mdash;tower&mdash;cum&mdash;bastion business. A very nightmare of a  fort, even as says &ldquo;Peter Possum,&rdquo; &ldquo;decorated with a tower like a gigantic hat,  a monstrously magnified drab &lsquo;mountcastle&rsquo;, which doth not add greatly to the  harbor&rsquo;s picturesqueness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the crown of bathos was set on the whole affair by the discovery,  presently, that, owing probably to the porous nature of the sandstone upon which  it was built, it was not possible to fire a gun as a time signal, without  shaking the island to its foundations! The most it can do, indeed, seems to be  to display a red beacon light o&rsquo; nights.</p>
  <p>Respecting Cockatoo Island, a writer in the forties says: &ldquo;This natural  hulk is situated about two miles above Sydney, just where Port Jackson narrows  into a creek called the Parramatta River, and about a quarter of a mile from  either shore. Here is all that remains of that stupendous machinery, which,  from first to last, has introduced into and diffused through these colonies not  less than 60,000 of Great Britain&rsquo;s offenders, and by whose agency it may be  said this great fifth portion of the globe has been redeemed from the savage  and appropriated to the European family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The isle is a triangle in form, about 400 yards long by 280 in width.  It contains at present about 300 prisoners under conviction for offences  committed in the colony, or expirees from Norfolk Island. Many of these are  regular incurables, doubly and trebly convicted. The prisoners are employed in  quarrying stone, in laying down a clear and spacious wharf around this rugged  isle, so that a few sentries can command the entire circumference. They are,  moreover, engaged in the useful work of excavating a dry dock&mdash;a convenience  that does not at present exist in these colonies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The establishment is admirably adapted, both by nature and art, to its  purpose. Nevertheless, many desperate attempts to escape were made in my time.  One wretched man flung himself into the water, loaded with chains, and, being a  powerful swimmer, had got nearly a hundred yards from the pier before the  sentry perceived him. Disregarding the soldier&rsquo;s shouts and threats, the man  swam steadily onwards, upon which the sentry fired and the wretch instantly  sank; nor was his body ever found. Sharks in search of offal from the  slaughter-houses haunt this part of the harbor, and act as an efficient &lsquo;cordon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The great curiosity of Cockatoo Island is the siloes&mdash;excavations in  the solid rock, shaped like a huge bottle, 15 or 20 feet deep by 10 feet wide,  with a narrow neck, closed by a stone capsule luted with plaster. About a dozen  and a half of these siloes, filled in time of plenty with grain, were intended  as a reserve of food for seasons of famine, which have more than once befallen  the colony. It was a monopoly for the public benefit; but the plan was  discountenanced and disallowed by the Home authorities&mdash;I suppose because it  might interfere with the agricultural interests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These excavations were afterwards used to conserve a supply of fresh  water for the island. Some of them are still in existence, and their sites may  be readily traced.</p>
  <p>Such was Cockatoo Island in the later forties, when Fitzroy ruled the  land, and gave his name to the dock mentioned above, and since eclipsed by its  big neighbor, the Sutherland. There is still a penal establishment there, known  to us as Biloela. But the prisoners are only weak phantoms of their fierce and  unruly prototypes&mdash;&ldquo;drunk and disorderlies,&rdquo; &ldquo;no visible means,&rdquo; etc., with a  sprinkling of short time thieves, larrikins, and such-like gentry; many of them  old, decrepit folk of both sexes, who hail the gaol more as a refuge than a  place of punishment; an asylum where regular meals, enforced cleanliness, and a  fair amount of work enable them to regain in part their shattered health before  once more appearing in society.</p>
  <p>There are, perhaps, other islands in our harbor whose stories are worth  writing. But other chroniclers will doubtless be found to discourse upon Goat,  Spectacle, Shark, and the rest of them that may have any tradition attached to  their names, ancient or modern. The three strictly historical islands,  however&mdash;Garden, Pinchgut, and Cockatoo&mdash;seem to be the only ones that by their  early connection with the history of our city call for special mention in this  work</p>

    Sydney In The Fifties.</b></h2>
  <p>Is June, 1849, the ship Hashemy arrived in Sydney with 212 convicts,  and immediately the capital was thrown into a state of the greatest excitement,  it being looked upon as an attempt of Earl Grey&rsquo;s to revive transportation. &ldquo;Public  meetings were held in the open air,&rdquo; says one writer, &ldquo;close to the gates of  the present Government House, and on the very site of the old Government House  where Governor Macquarie, whose policy it was to create an upper class from  among a population nearly exclusively convict, entertained at his table guests  from this order. Under the splendid old Scotch firs planted by Captain Phillip,  the first importer of convicts to these shores&mdash;on the very spot where the first  convict camp was pitched&mdash;their descendents, their compeers, and a few of the  free class who had grown rich upon the system, now assembled to launch and  listen to anathemas against it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page062a.jpg" width="800" height="464"></p>
  <p>Contemporary newspapers of even date, i.e., June 18, 1849, however,  without fixing the spot so exactly as does our author, are content with simply  saying that the meeting took place at Circular Quay. There were at this  particular one some 7000 people present, with Mr. R. Campbell in the chair. The  purpose of the meeting was not only to petition the Queen that Earl Grey should  be removed from the head of the Colonial Department, but also to ask that  responsible government should be granted to the colony; also to pass a vote of  censure on the Governor himself.</p>
  <p>Let us see how vice-royalty in those days could receive, if it so  pleased, a deputation of the lieges. Mr. Aaron said that the committee did not  charge the Governor with actual discourtesy, &ldquo;but it was of the cold repulsive  chilling feeling with which he had received them, that he had acted  discourteously,&rdquo; they complained&mdash;two statements that, although somewhat at  variance, seem to imply that Sir Charles Fitzroy was rude. The speaker,  continuing, said, &ldquo;He (the Governor) had first affronted the deputation by  refusing to see the whole of them, and he had afterwards kept up the affront by  the increasing chilliness of his manner and the deeper sinking of his brows, as  he gradually retreated from them, although he stood strongly entrenched behind  a table, where he had stationed himself to receive them. For the truth of this  description he, Mr. A., could vouch, and he would ask the meeting if this was  such a reception as should have been given by a Governor to the delegates of  those from the produce of whose labours he was paid, fed, and clothed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the same time, it must be remembered that the deputation came to Sir  Charles with rather a large order, including in it the removal from office of  his (Sir Charles&rsquo;s) own chief. Earl Grey had promised to send out emigrants and  convicts in a certain proportion; but he had only sent the last, and thus was &ldquo;guilty  of faithless and arbitrary conduct;&rdquo; and this same speaker, already quoted,  demanded at the meeting &ldquo;that Earl Grey should be at once dismissed her Majesty&rsquo;s  service, and without a character, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was much talk, also, about the squatters, and much abuse of them;  and someone suggested the formation of a colonial nobility, and proposed that &ldquo;William  Charles Wentworth should be raised to the first rank, under the title of &lsquo;Duke  of the Lash and Triangle.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Parkes also addressed the meeting. Said he, among other things: &ldquo;All  they now sought to do, however, was so to reform and remodel the Government of  the colony that it should live in the affections of the people &mdash;a game at  which, as we all know, the speaker subsequently took many a hand himself, and  with no small measure of success.</p>
  <p>Mr. Lowe (afterwards Lord Sherbrooke) at this same gathering made a  long and violent speech: &ldquo;Was the Governor afraid of his spoons,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;or  did he fear that some of them (the delegates) might sneak into his cellar and  drink his claret; or did he dread them lest they should take Government House  by storm; or did he think that six pairs of dirty shoes were quite sufficient  at one time to soil the Vice-regal carpet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page062b.jpg" width="800" height="581"></p>
  <p>And Sir Charles really seems to have been afraid of a general rising, &ldquo;for  the kitchen was garrisoned with infantry, the stables were filled with cavalry,  all ready prepared at the first signal to dash out upon the people; and this  because the colonists had come humbly and quietly to remonstrate against an act  of injustice.&rdquo; All of which reads very curiously to-day. Nothing, however,  could have been more decorous or orderly than the conduct of the great meeting  we have been speaking of, which finally separated with three cheers for the  Queen, three cheers for Mr. Lowe, a groan for Mr. Wentworth, and a groan for  the Governor. Strange how that name of Wentworth, once synonymous with all that  represented freedom and progress, should now have so lost its former power, and  be held up to obloquy and contempt!</p>
  <p>And, after all, the Hashemy&rsquo;s crowd was simply rushed. Reports the  Principal Superintendent of Convicts on June 24, 1849:&mdash;&rdquo;After the completion of  the muster of the prisoners&hellip; the men were permitted to make engagements with those  persons who were allowed to go on board for the purpose by an order from me;  and it seems worthy of remark that, although at the time of the Hashemy&rsquo;s  arrival there were four emigrant ships in the harbor, containing about a thousand  souls, all these men, with the exception of 59, who were removed to Moreton Bay  and Clarence River, where labour was urgently required, were hired to  respectable householders and sheep farmers within six days of their being ready  to engage, at wages varying from &pound;12 to &pound;16 a year, and some mechanics at &pound;28  per annum, the boys receiving from &pound;8 to &pound;11 per annum. Besides which there are  at my office applications from private individuals and others in different  parts of the colony, for a larger number of this class of labourers than can be  supplied by the arrival of several convict ships.&rdquo; Which statement placed side  by side with those made by the speakers at the representative meetings on  Circular Quay, seems, to say the least of it, anomalous.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page063.jpg" width="513" height="650"></p>
  <p>Among the applicants for ticket-of-leave labour, it was alleged that  the Bathurst Bench of Magistrates alone applied for no less than 350 of them!  Yet, it is said that fifteen out of the nineteen magistrates composing it signed  the petition against the arrival of transportation!</p>
  <p>A poet of the day, respecting the burning question, sings:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo;Turn to the Spot. An infant nation pleads;<br>
    Pleads for its Rights and injuries unredressed;<br>
    Beware, stern parent, lest Oppression&rsquo;s deeds,<br>
    The arm of retribution should arrest;<br>
    Rouse all the alien in its gentle breast,<br>
    Till freedom&rsquo;s spirit spurns its chains of clay&mdash;<br>
    Shade of departed Graecia here attest,<br>
    How in thy rugged straits, Thermopylae!<br>
The Spartan Patriots bled and died for liberty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Many of these patriots, evidently, were more prepared to foster  transportation than to do any bleeding or dying for the suppression of the  system,</p>
  <p>And thus ended, for a time, the excitement caused by the advent of the  Hashemy.</p>
  <p>Speaking of Parkes, and addressing the meeting, reminds one that in the  &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo; of 1849, appears the following advertisement:</p>
  <p align="center">&ldquo;PARASOL AND UMBRELLA REPAIRS.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Subscriber having Received a Complete assortment of parasol and  umbrella furniture from the first house in London, begs to state, that in all  repairs entrusted to him, only new articles will in future be used. Handles,  hooks, pen-rules, eta, in ivory, coquilla, pearl, horn, and bone, to match any  kind of furniture, fitted at ten minutes&rsquo; notice. Henry Parkes, Ivory Turning  Manufactory and Toy Warehouse, No. 20 Hunter-street.&rdquo; &ldquo;No. 20&rdquo; is the shop now  occupied by Mr. M&rsquo;Carthy, the well-know chemist.</p>
  <p>But Parkes never seems to have been much of a business man, although he  certainly advertised very freely in the newspapers of the period. Politics and  shopkeeping, in a small way, as a rule, do not thrive in company, especially  when represented in the guise of such an ardent, impatient, turbulent,  ambitious soul as that of our own &ldquo;Sir Henry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Auction sales seem to have been a feature, even as is the case now, of  those times in Sydney. And some of the announcements are amusing. For instance:  &ldquo;Messrs. Brown and Jones, at their mart, at 11 o&rsquo;clock, 150 dozen kangaroo  skins, a second-hand gig, ship-biscuit, baby-linen, damaged ironmongery,  bottled fruits, castor oil, canary birds, Bohemian glass, accordians, and the  effects of a deceased clergyman, comprising robes, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Robinson will have the honor to offer to public competition on  Monday, the 4th instant, the Crow&rsquo;s Nest Station, in the district of Moreton  Bay, with 10,000 sheep; after which arrowroot, blacking, lime-juice, lozenges,  ladies&rsquo; companions, jams, bathbricks, damaged gunny-bags, Turkey figs,  toothbrushes, 12,000ft of prime cedar plank, a four-roomed house, an anchor and  chain, a mare, a horse, and twenty pigs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One more:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At 3 p.m. precisely, the newly-rigged, copper-bottomed clipper Mary  Anne, well known in the trade: One gross of egg spoons, a bass, viol, a  superior Europe feather-bed, two lots of land, two bales of super-calico, Old  Tom, soup and bouilli, toys, cutlery, and a cottage piano.&rdquo; If the framer of  these advertisements had purposely tried his hardest to do so, he could  scarcely have got together a more incongruous selection of articles.</p>
  <p>During these later years we get glimpses of the social life of the city  lacking in the earlier ones. For instance, one visitor, writing of the theatre,  says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In decency of demeanor the audience of the Sydney Theatre Royal is a  prodigy compared with that of similar establishments in the seaport towns of  the old country. The &lsquo;gods&rsquo; are particularly well-behaved The dress-boxes are  always unpeopled unless an impulse be given by a bespeak or by the benefit of a  favorite. These appeals act as a sort of mental gadfly in society. The herd  rushes together with one consent, and disports itself with crowded discomfort;  and, once more for a month, perhaps, the playgoer, whom a love of drama only  attracts, has the house to himself. In the pit of the Sydney theatre one misses  the numerous bald heads of an European parterre, for the people of New South  Wales have not yet had time to grow old. On the other hand the eyes of the  stranger wander with surprise over the vast numbers of new-born babies&mdash;three or  four dozen little sucklings taking their natural refection&mdash;whilst their mothers  seem absorbed in the interest of the piece; their great long-legged daddies  meanwhile sprawling over the benches in the simplest of costumes&mdash;a check shirt,  for instance, wide open at the breast, moleskins, and a cabbage-tree hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, could the writer revisit Sydney now, and enter one of the  theatres he would see enough bald heads, in all conscience; indeed,  well-thatched ones are the exception. We are growing old ever so much too  quickly. Nor would he be troubled by the presence of &ldquo;children in arms,&rdquo; or by  &ldquo;moleskin trousers and cabbage tree hats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As a specimen of the entertainment provided for theatrical patrons in  the late forties at the Royal Victoria Theatre, one taken at random from an old  paper will give the reader some idea of what used to amuse our citizens and  country visitors of half a century ago. It was on the occasion of a benefit to  Mr. J. Thomson, and, by the kind permission of Colonel Despard, &ldquo;the excellent  band of H.M. 99th Regiment will be in attendance, and perform several of their  most favourite pieces.&rdquo; The first item on the programme was &ldquo;the celebrated and  much-admired classical delineation of Ancient Sculpture, the Death of Abel, and  the Roman Gladiators, by Masters F. and W. Thomson.&rdquo; Then came the solid part  of the performance, in the shape of Luder&rsquo;s much-admired opera in three parts,  entitled &ldquo;The Night Dancers.&rdquo; A farce called &ldquo;No Followers&rdquo; concluded the  entertainment. No prices were mentioned; but tickets were to be had at many  shops, and &ldquo;boxes may be secured at the Victoria Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bushranging was still rife throughout the colony, and in a Sydney paper  of 1850 a writer, commenting on the fact, states that the nursery for such  desperadoes may possibly exist in the capital itself. The young idlers of the  city, it seemed, formed themselves into gangs, and took up positions on the  roads leading to the interior. A favourite haunt of theirs, by the way, was the  bridge, already mentioned in a previous article as crossing the creek running  into Rushcutter&rsquo;s Bay. And here these youngsters used to he in wait and &ldquo;stick  up&rdquo; smaller boys who had been out in the bush gathering &ldquo;five corners,&rdquo; a wild  berry of the scrub. Says a writer who had personal experience of one of these &ldquo;pushes:&rdquo;  &ldquo;A knife is held out, and under threats and oaths that would disgrace Norfolk  Island the juniors were compelled to &lsquo;dub up,&rsquo; or are seized and robbed by  force. I myself witnessed and enacted Quixote in an act of puerile bushranging  of the above nature&mdash;a case of robbery with violence.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hurrah for the road!&rdquo;  was the motto of these promising youngsters. &ldquo;Spicers&rdquo; was the name they were  known by, but the origin of the word appears to be doubtful.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page064.jpg" width="684" height="650"></p>
  <p>On May 15, 1851, the papers make an announcement of most vital  importance to the future of the colony and the city. This was nothing less than  the discovery by Mr. Hargraves of payable gold in the Bathurst district. The  story has too often been told to need dilating on here;</p>
  <p>But a short description of how Sydney took the news may not be out of  place. Says one who was on the spot:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The shops put on entirely new faces. Wares suited to the wants and  tastes of general purchasers were thrust ignominiously out of sight, and  articles of outfit for gold hunting only were displayed. Blue and red serge  shirts, Californian hats, leather belts, &ldquo;real gold-digging gloves,&rdquo; mining  boots, blankets, white and scarlet, became the show goods in the fashionable  streets. The pavements were lumbered with picks, pans, and pots; and the gold-washing  machine or Virginian &ldquo;cradle,&rdquo; hitherto a stranger to our eyes, became in two  days a familiar household utensil, for scores of them were paraded for purchase  &ldquo;from 25s to 40s&rdquo; in front of stores and stalls, so that a stranger or an absent-minded  person who had not yet heard the gathering cry of &ldquo;Gold, gold!&rdquo; might have  imagined that a sudden and miraculous influx&mdash;a plague, in short&mdash;of babies had  been poured upon the devoted city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Many folk for some time refused to believe the news, and persisted in  calling it a hoax, and a &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; one at that. But when from Summer Hill Creek  (Ophir), Turon, and other places, the virgin ore began to flow into Sydney,  then indeed, the most incredulous were forced to give in and join in the  excitement that literally seethed throughout the city.</p>
  <p>The newspapers teemed with advertisements and notices with the  description: &ldquo;Waterproof tents for the El Dorado;&rdquo; &ldquo;Quicksilver for  amalgamating gold-soil&rdquo; &ldquo;Superfine biscuits, packed in tins;&rdquo; &ldquo;Wines, ales, and  spirits, ready for carriage;&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring-carts for the diggings;&rdquo; &ldquo;Single and  (double guns and pistols for self-defence;&rdquo; &ldquo;Conveyance to Ophir, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nostrums and quack medicines took unto themselves a local habitation  and a name. Thus we read that: &ldquo;No one who values his health or comfort should  proceed to the goldfields without a supply of Laver and Company&rsquo;s Ophir  cordial,&rdquo; Also: &ldquo;As the colony is now advancing to a state of unprecedented  richness, and the Empire of Australia will yet rival the age called the golden,  Leopold Morgan and Company offer their recently-compounded cordial, the Elixir  of Life, which will expand the benumbed veins of the gold washers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Parties innumerable were made up to journey to the new finds, and such  advertisements as the following studded the newspapers:&mdash;&rdquo;Two strong, able young  gentlemen are desirious of joining some respectable parties in making up a  proper number for the gold fields. They are prepared to contribute a reasonable  sum. Address, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently a nugget was found, and we read under the heading of &ldquo;The  Great Goliath of the Australian Diggings&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;This magnificent specimen of virgin  gold, just arrived from the Ophir mines, near Bathurst, weighing about four  pounds troy, will be on view this day in the window of Messrs. Brush and  Macdonald, jewellers, George-street, prior to its shipment for London, for the  great Exhibition of All Nations.&rdquo; But this was only a baby nugget compared with  other finds later on. As might be expected, Sydney, during the first feverish  weeks, talked of nothing but gold, and of the curious effects upon society that  its discovery had given rise to. And everywhere there fell upon the ear bits of  conversation that ran: &ldquo;Are you going to the diggings? I&rsquo;m off to-morrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have  you seen the big nugget? They say you can pick &lsquo;em up all over the place out  yonder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Servants? No; I haven&rsquo;t got one left. Coachman cleared out last  night,&rdquo; etc.</p>
  <p>In a week the streets of the city showed a very perceptible thinning,  as people literally stampeded across the Blue Mountains into the land of  Promise beyond. The Government, taken by surprise, at such a rapid development,  had made no provision to meet it in the way, among others, of police  protection, in the big mining camps. To make matters worse, the 150 mounted  police had recently been disbanded, and the greatest difficulty was experienced  in getting a score or two of them together again for service on the gold  fields.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of May, Mr. Hudson, of Sydney, merchant, returned from  the diggings with about &pound;1000 worth of gold including a 46oz nugget. This was  afterwards exhibited at the Crystal Palace, London, and did much, we may be  sure, towards advertising the colony and its new and valuable product. New,  however, only in the sense, of its being publicly worked, inasmuch as it was  well known to many people that for some years past gold in its virgin state had  been finding its way into the hands of the city jewellers, who, however, could  never be brought to believe that it was indigenous. And so far back as 1823, it  is said that a member of a chain-gang, working on the roads near Bathurst, was  mercilessly flogged because he was found in possession of a piece of rough  gold, which the overseer felt certain was obtained from melted jewellery.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page065.jpg" width="732" height="650"></p>
  <p>Here is the description of a scene on the road to Homebush, where the  writer was going to attend the races, during the early days of the rush:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Driving on those two days to Homebush&mdash;the Epsom of Sydney&mdash;I counted  nearly sixty drays and carts heavily laden, proceeding westward, with tents,  rockers, flour, tea, sugar, mining tools, etc&mdash;each accompanied by from four to  eight men, half of whom bore firearms. Some looked eager and impatient, some  half ashamed of their errand others sad and thoughtful&hellip; They must have thrown  all they possessed into the adventure, for most of their equipments were quite  new&mdash;good stout horses, harness fresh from the saddler&rsquo;s hands, gay-coloured  woollen shirts and comforters, and Californian sombreros of every hue and  shape. It was a strange sight&mdash;a strange jumble of images. The mind could hardly  reconcile a thoroughly English high-road, with toll-bars and  public-houses&mdash;thoroughly English figures travelling on it to a country  racecourse&mdash;stage-coaches and four, omnibuses, tandems, scores of neat, private  equipages and hack-carriages; sporting butchers and publicans, in &ldquo;spicy  Whitechapels,&rdquo; Sydney cockneys on square-tailed hacks; &ldquo;happles and horanges,&rdquo; &ldquo;cards  of the horses,&rdquo; etc., with the concurrent stream of oddly-loaded drays, and  other slow-moving vehicles piled with business-like stores and unfamiliar  utensils, and escorted by parties, no less Englishmen, armed to the teeth, clad  in a newly-adopted dress, utterly indifferent to, and apart from the merry  scene of the racecourse&hellip; One&rsquo;s mental obfuscation was hardly cleared up by the  reflection that these British men, on this British-looking turnpike road were  simply journeying some 150 miles&mdash;the distance from London to Manchester&mdash;for the  purpose of digging gold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As may be imagined, this sudden and wholesale emigration of all sorts  and conditions of men from the capital, affected almost every industry more or  less adversely. And none, perhaps, more so than the building trade; indeed,  works of this description, both public and private, almost all came to a standstill  for lack of skilled and other labour; and, in some cases, their completion was  delayed for years. Thus, architecturally speaking, the gold outbreak at first  benefited Sydney in very small measure. But later on she reaped the full  benefit of it.</p>

    The Fifties And Sixties.</b></h2>
  <p>August 3, 1852, was a day remarkable in the history of Sydney as that  upon which the first mail steamer arrived in port. Her name was the Chusan, an  iron screw-steamer, of 720 tons, barque-rigged&mdash;a beautiful model, and with more  the look of a man-of-war than a merchant vessel. She was rather heavily armed,  too, carrying a long 32-pounder aft, an 18-pounder forward, and a 12-pounder  amidships. Even under canvas alone, the Chusan had often done her 14 knots.  Melbourne was her first port of call, and off Cape Otway a seaman was lost  overboard and drowned, notwithstanding a plucky attempt at rescue by two  passengers, Lieutenant Pasco, R.N., and Mr. Bencraft, who, with four of the  crew, got into one of the quarter-boats, and put off in a very heavy sea. But  their efforts were in vain; indeed, it was with much difficulty and not until  two hours had elapsed, that the steamer was able to pick them up. The Chusan  brought a heavy mail and &pound;70,000 in sovereigns. In Melbourne&mdash;then all excitement  with the gold fever&mdash;a special armed guard was placed on the steamer in order to  prevent the crew deserting, as so many others had done. Before the Chusan  sailed for Sydney the Governor and some other officials visited her, together  with the leading merchants of the city, when champagne was opened, speeches made,  and the commander, Captain Henry Down, heartily congratulated on being the  pioneer of steam communication between Australia and the old country.</p>

  <p>Vessels of the British Navy were, of course, frequent visitors to  Sydney; in 1851 there arrived a crack frigate called the Calliope, of 26 guns,  besides the Pandora and the Fantome. In 1853 came H.M.S. Herald, 22 guns, with,  among her officers, Mr. F. Hixson, afterwards so well known as president of our  late Marine Board The fifties, too, were the years of many of the celebrated  clippers whose names are historical, and will live as long as those of the  colony whose wool they bore so swiftly to the little island standing far away  in northern seas. Precursor of these was the barque Phoenician, which, in 1849,  came out in 91 days, followed by the Walter Hood; and, later on, by a whole  fleet of fast and noble clippers&mdash;the Centurion, Omar Pasha, Harlaw, Star of  Peace, Maid of Judah, and others whose tall spars lined the sides of Circular Quay,  now growing into something worthy of its name. But, though to George Thompson&rsquo;s  White Star line must be given pride of place in the work of developing our  early commerce, there were vessels besides the Aberdeen clippers who traded  regularly between Sydney and other Australian ports to and from British ones.  There were, for instance, the Kate, Eliza, and George Marshall, belonging to  the firm of Marshall and Eldridge; the Dunbar, wrecked in the later fifties  near the Gap; the Duncan Dunbar, Dunbar Castle, and Phoebe Dunbar; together  with the numerous family of Duthies&mdash;all vessels of note in their day, and all  in time to give way before such flyers as the Thermopylae, the Salamis, Samuel  Plimsoll, and the Patriarch&mdash;all Aberdeen clippers; and the last named, of which  made the trip from Sydney to London in 68 days.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page066b.jpg" width="746" height="650"></p>
  <p>The inception of our steam fleet has already been referred to; and by  now the vessels of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company were rapidly  increasing in number. Still, in 1845, freight to Melbourne was &pound;3 per ton; and  passengers for saloon &pound;10 10s., intermediate &pound;7, and steerage &pound;4 10s. In 1857,  the A.S.N. vessels consisted of the City of Sydney, Wonga Wonga, Telegraph,  Governor-General, Boomerang, Yarra Yarra, Waratah, Shamrock, Illalong,  Collaroy, Thistle, Tamar, Ballarat, Samson, Eagle, Rose, Ben Bolt, Brisbane,  and the City of Melbourne. Some of these are still keeping the sea, old and  dirty and rusty, and smothered fore and aft in coal dust, it is true, but, still  to all appearance, fit to last for many more years. When people built ships in  those times, they put work into them that was meant to last, and disdained the  jerry business that later became so common in-the trade.</p>
  <p>By this time the whale and seal fisheries were becoming diverted from  Sydney control into the hands of the Americans. But what with our land products  fast increasing in value and quantity, we could well afford to let the somewhat  precarious fisheries go.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page067a.jpg" width="800" height="615"></p>
  <p>Intimately bound up with the shipping and produce trade of the city,  there is one street that more especially demands a brief notice. At the time of  the Queen&rsquo;s Accession, Sussex-street was a long rambling thoroughfare full of  gaps. In 1853 nearly all the produce came there from the Hunter River. Dealers  in wheat, poultry, potatoes, etc., secured premises as convenient as possible  to the wharves, and thus gradually the street grew in size and importance as a  market centre. In the fifties, there were still but a few houses in it; but it  was noted for several big flour mills. Even then, butter came in large  quantities from the South Coast. Mr. John Pemell at that time was the principal  miller. He used to buy for cash, kept no books, and the receipts were torn up  and thrown away. Bullock drays thronged &ldquo;the Street.&rdquo; even as horse teams do  now. Butter and flour were sent in large parcels to Melbourne and the north;  and, ever as trade increased, new business-men arrived, and set up in the  centre of it, until today the commission and produce houses number considerably  over a hundred. And the members of them have always prided themselves on the  establishment of an honorable code in their dealings, in which each one&rsquo;s word  is his bond. In the making of a bargain between themselves neither sale-note  nor witness to the transaction is considered necessary. They also pride  themselves on having fewer law actions than any other branch of trade in the  southern hemisphere.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page067b.jpg" width="800" height="602"></p>
  <p>In 1846 the first movement had been made with respect to railway  communication inland. At a meeting in Sydney it was decided to survey a line  from Sydney to Goulburn. Not for two years, however, did the scheme take  practical shape by the formation of the Sydney Railroad and Tramway Company,  capital &pound;10,000. The object of the company as expressed in its circular, was  to, at the present, construct railways to Parramatta and Liverpool, with, later  on, extensions to Bathurst and Goulburn. Mr. Charles Cowper, afterwards several  times Premier of New South Wales, was the first manager. On July 3, 1850, the  first sod of the new enterprise, was cut by the Hon. Mrs. Keith Stewart,  daughter of Governor Sir Charles Fitzroy. The spade with which this ceremony  was performed was made in Sydney, out of Australian iron and is said to be  still in possession of the Government.</p>
  <p>But for some time little or no progress was made. Public opinion did  not seem particularly stirred by the notion, for one thing, and for another,  money did not come in as it had been expected to do. Later on, however, the  Government took the business in hand. In August, 1852, a start had been made by  the contractor, Mr. W. Randle, who afterwards completed the line. He began  operations in Cleveland paddock, close to where Mrs. Keith Stewart had  performed with the Australian spade nearly two years before. The first gang  consisted of only five men; but presently more were put on, and the company  imagined they were beginning to make headway. Then, as mentioned above, the  Government stepped in, and pushed on the work quite vigorously, compared with  the moribund S.R, and T. Company.</p>
  <p>In May, 1854, the first cargo of iron rails came to hand, and the work  progressed rapidly, because, hitherto, only wooden ones, which required  renewing every two months, had been used. But at last the Parramatta portion of  the line, or, more correctly speaking, the portion as far as the spot where the  Southern line now branches off, was finished. This was, much to the disgust of  the inhabitants, at the junction of the Dogtrap and Liverpool roads, fully a  mile from the centre of the town.</p>
  <p>And now that the work was actually completed, people seemed doubtful  about travelling on the railway, and nervous fears were expressed as to the  security of the bridges, rolling stock, etc., etc. A board was then appointed  to report upon the work; and, accordingly, five gentlemen tested the line with  two first-class carriages, and twelve waggons loaded with sand&mdash;the whole  outfit, with engine and tender, weighing 130 tons. Then the five duly certified  that things were safe, and invited the public to roll up. To make assurance  doubly sure, Sir William Denison and his wife and family took a trip to and  fro, and finally the opening day was fixed for September 26, 1855.</p>
  <p>On that date, proclaimed a public holiday, the largest crowd yet seen  in the colony assembled at the railway station to witness the starting of the  train; volunteers and Friendly Societies escorted the Governor; and to the  sound of a salute of 21 guns and the waving of flags and handkerchiefs was  inaugurated the beginning of our present railway system of some 3000 miles.  Parramatta, much to the surprise of many people, was reached without any  accident; and here the Governor lunched and congratulatory speeches were made.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page068.jpg" width="800" height="619"></p>
  <p>During the day 2000 passengers travelled to and fro by the novel means  of locomotion. Six trains a day were run, with fares in three classes, for the  single journey, 4s, 3s, and 2s respectively. Said a contemporary newspaper:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The event of yesterday was the triumph of science, not only over  natural difficulties, but of the spirit of enlightenment and civilisation&mdash;over  prejudice and worldly-mindedness. The great agent of civilisation, the best and  most effective servant of progress, has been retained by the antipodean  colonies of Australia within the same quarter of a century to which it became  the liveried vassal of civilised Europe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The plant was moderate enough consisting, as it did, of only four engines;  eight first-class, twelve second, and twelve third-class carriages; with six  brake vans and sixty waggons.</p>
  <p>At the present date, or rather at the last returns, the rolling stock  of the colony&rsquo;s railways included 494 engines, 419 tenders, 1050 passenger  carriages, 9429 goods vehicles, and 1041 stock trucks.</p>
  <p>It is noteworthy that by the failure of private individuals in the  first attempt at railway construction in the colony any private ownership of  such undertakings seems to have received its deathblow, and thus, with very few  exceptions, all railways in these colonies, are owned by the State. Possibly  the original pioneers might have been more fortunate in their adventure but for  the gold discoveries, which, as already shown, simply paralysed almost every  description of industrial enterprise. An interesting fact in connection with  the first attempt is that Sir Alfred Stephen was the first citizen to take  shares in the company, an example followed by other leading men, including  Messrs. Charles Kemp and John Lamb&mdash;the last named the president of the board of  directors.</p>
  <p>What with the gold discoveries, the bringing of railway communication,  and ocean mails; the finishing for all time of transportation to New South  Wales; the granting in full of representative Government, well these years be  called the &ldquo;Fruitful Fifties!&rdquo; Literature and art, too, flourished mildly. A  curious incident in connection with the former was the publication, in 1854, in  Sydney, of a book entitled &ldquo;The Diary of a Visit to England.&rdquo; Dr. Campbell the author,  was an Irish clergyman of some note in his day as a writer on the history and  the Church of his country, who visited England at various times during the years  1775-92. &ldquo;He made,&rdquo; says Mowbray Morris, in his introduction to Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life  of Johnson&rdquo; (Globe edition), &ldquo;what may be called the provincials &lsquo;grand tour&rsquo;  of London; visited the theatres, coffee houses and auction rooms, heard all the  popular preachers, and was introduced to the studios of Reynolds and  Gainsborough; he met Johnson at the Thrales&rsquo;s and elsewhere, besides visiting  him at his own house, and, though they seem to have been good friends enough,  his portrait of the doctor is certainly not flattering. In directness and vivacity  he sometimes even runs Boswell close, and his diary often supplies an interesting  commentary on the biography.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The story of how such a work came to be published in an Australian city  is interesting. Its existence even, it would appear was not generally known in  England until the publication of an article in the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review,&rdquo; and  which was written in 1859, at the instance of and partly from materials supplied  by Macaulay &ldquo;The manuscript&rdquo; says Morris, &ldquo;had been discovered in one of the  offices of the Supreme Court at Sydney, behind an old press which had not been  moved for years. Its authenticity has fortunately been placed beyond suspicion,  and its strange hiding place has been explained by the fact that one of its  author&rsquo;s nephews was Sheriff and Provost-Marshal of the capital of New South  Wales.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page069a.jpg" width="800" height="589"></p>
  <p>The stage flourished freely in the fifties. In 1854 Miss Catherine  Hayes took the city by storm with her voice, as two years later did G.V. Brooke  by his acting. At the close of the great tragedian&rsquo;s first engagement he was  presented at Petty&rsquo;s Hotel with a testimonial in the shape of a solid silver  candelabrum and plateau, with 220 gs; whilst Miss Fanny Cathcart, the &ldquo;principal  lady&rdquo; who supported him, came in for a diamond bracelet, valued at 70gs. To  those who succeeded in pleasing them, the citizens of those years were nothing  if not liberal.</p>
  <p>In the fifties, too, Sydney had a patriotic fund. The Crimean War was  raging, and money flowed freely in for the relief of the British soldiers  fighting in the east. On two successive nights at the Victoria Theatre during  July, 1855, the proceeds of the performances were devoted to the patriotic  fund, and towards the erection of a monument to Captain Cook.</p>
  <p>A but-little-heard-of contemporary of the Victoria Theatre in these  days was the City, which stood in market-street, exactly opposite the office of  the &ldquo;Town and Country Journal.&rdquo; Melodrama of the strongest type used to be  played there, and the &ldquo;leading man&rdquo; was an actor who bore the illustrious name  of Kemble. Other theatres, too, notably the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s, were now in  existence; and what with such vocalists as Catherine Hayes, Mme. Anna Bishop,  and Sara Flower, and June Mathews, and such actors as G. V. Brooke, Nesbitt,  Coppin, and Rogers, it will be seen that Sydney was far from being badly  catered for in respect of amusements.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page069b.jpg" width="800" height="612"></p>
  <p>On the night of August 20, 1857, the passenger ship Dunbar was wrecked  at the foot of the cliffs near the South Head Signal Station. The occurrence  has so often been described as to render more than a passing reference to it  needless. One curious incident, connected however, with the sad affair may not  be generally known, Among the Dunbar&rsquo;s passengers were a Mrs. Egan, her son,  and daughter. Mr. Egan was a well-known citizen of Sydney, a member of the  Legislative Assembly, and an ex-Postmaster-General. His wife and children had  been &ldquo;home&rdquo; for a pleasure trip; meanwhile, he had built a fine house for their  reception at Watson&rsquo;s Bay, and not far from the fatal Gap itself. And there  they perished, almost within sight of their new home. Then, as if that were not  enough, thirteen years later, Mr. Egan, apparently in his usual good health, drove  out to the Gap on a Saturday afternoon, put up at a hotel there, was found during  the night in a comatose condition, and died the next day, nearly, one might  say, on the site of the loss of his family so many years before. Besides the  Egans, many well-known colonists were lost in the Dunbar, she being a favorite  trader, and full of passengers. In all 120 souls perished, and, as will be  recollected, only one man, Johnson, a member of the crew, escaped. He was for  many years, and until quite lately, keeper of the Nobbys Lighthouse, at  Newcastle.</p>
  <p>In 1857 municipal government was re-established. It will be remembered  that, although so far back as 1843 a municipal council, headed by a mayor, had  been formed, so badly did the plan work, that, after something of like an  eleven years&rsquo; failure, they had been superseded by three commissioners,  appointed to look after the interests of the citizens of Sydney. They held  office for three years, and it was during this period that the city waterworks  were established at Botany, in place of Busby&rsquo;s Bore and the old Hyde  Park-Lachlan Swamp scheme; a system of underground sewerage was also began by  the commissioners; the outlet was to be at Fort Macquarie, through a great  valve of gun-metal. The late Hon. George Thornton was the first Mayor of the  re-constructed council, which at that time sat in what is now the Oxford Hotel;  and a memento of his term of office may still be seen in the big ventilator to  the sewers in Hyde Park&mdash;Thornton&rsquo;s Smelling Bottle. This upcast shaft was  fitted with a furnace for establishing a draught; it is, however, doubtful  whether, after it was handed over by the contractors to the council, a fire was  ever lit in it.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page070a.jpg" width="800" height="620"></p>
  <p>Of all the stirring events of these well-named &ldquo;Fruitful Fifties&rdquo; the  discovery of gold was, of course, the most important as affecting Sydney; it  created a demand for all sorts of wares whose uses were undreamt of hitherto,  or regarded as unnecessary; it introduced capital and immigrants into the  colony; it opened up the interior, and encouraged the making of roads and  railways; and, above all, it increased to a wonderful extent the value of  property. Indeed, the accumulation of wealth in these years became so real,  industrial development, both in city and country, so extensive, and the  transformation of the social conditions of the people so amazing and complete,  that the phases of life as witnessed in the colony during the fifties resembled  more the imaginary scenes of Eastern fable than the prosaic realities of  everyday existence.</p>
  <p>Among other matters closely connected with the story of the now rapid  growth of our city in these times were the inauguration and endowment of the  University, with its affiliated colleges; the laying the first stone of the  Fitzroy Dock, and the establishment of the Sydney branch of the Royal Mint.</p>
  <p>Mention has already been made of the &ldquo;Constitution of &lsquo;56. And the  efforts made by Parkes, Wentworth, Deas-Thompson, and others to guard against  any undesirable amendments whilst passing through the English Houses were so  practical and energetic that the two last named politicians actually travelled  to England for that purpose. They were, however, unsuccessful. Lord John  Russell had returned to the Colonial Office, and he, unlike Mr. Chamberlain and  our Federation Bill, simply riddled the measure with amendments. The most  important of these was one enabling a bare majority of members in both Houses,  instead of a two-thirds majority, to alter the Constitution as they might  please. Such a provision, of course, was more than likely to operate as a  standing invitation to alter it; and subsequent events very soon showed the  truth of this. Strangely enough, the one feature in the Constitution which  provoked the greatest opposition&mdash;that of a nominee House&mdash;has never since been  touched; although, as we are well aware, much discontent has often been  expressed with it, right up to date, and in very strong terms, too.</p>
  <p>The Draft Bill, however, passed through both Houses in &lsquo;55, and became  law in that year as a schedule to an Imperial Act. It was sent on to Governor  Young, with a dispatch, in which Lord John Russell mentions, among other  matters, that he had considered the expediency of inserting clauses to provide  for a federal union of the Australian colonies; but had not been able to  satisfy himself that the time had come for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, the time has arrived now&mdash;nearly half a century later! Also the  fact! But it seems remarkable that, even then, when the younger Colonies were  still in the throes of their new birth, the federal idea should have crossed  the mind of the great British statesman. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter  XVI.<br>
    The Sixties And Seventies&mdash;(Conclusion).</b></h2>
  <p>In the early sixties occurred the largest and most disastrous fire that  had ever taken place in Sydney, and which resulted in the total destruction of  St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral. Says a newspaper of the day: &ldquo;The intelligence of this  deplorable catastrophe will cause a thrill of sorrow in the hearts of the Roman  Catholic population throughout the country, and must excite feelings of the  deepest regret in the minds of the community in general The cost of the  building, it is thought, could not be less than &pound;50,000; but from its hallowed  associations and sacred memories it was of priceless value to thousands of  Worshippers of the Roman Catholic communion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page070b.jpg" width="800" height="510"></p>
  <p>Besides the building itself, there appears to have been an immense  amount of valuable property destroyed, not only in the shape of paintings in  the church&mdash;one picture representing the death of St. Benedict was alone valued  at &pound;1000&mdash;but in the beautiful furniture of the Archbishop&rsquo;s and other  residences belonging to the high dignitaries of the cathedral. &ldquo;Myriads of  sparks ascended high into the air, and fell in showers in the direction of  Woolloomooloo Bay, whither, for a considerable distances they were driven by the  wind. From the top of the cathedral cloud, of yellow flame and smoke issued,  which shed a lurid lustre on all around; and, at times, so bright was the  glare, that the minutest objects in the remotest parts of Hyde Park, could be  seen almost as distinctly as by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As showing the magnitude of the illumination, it may be mentioned that  Captain Hesselton, now residing in Balmain, but then in command of the steamer  You Yangs, saw the reflection of the fire when off Port Hacking, and is of  opinion that the glare must have been visible over twenty miles out at sea. A  noteworthy incident of the fire was the fortunate escape from a horrible death  of an old man named Anthony Brady. Brady was, it is said, 108 years of age, and  stone blind. He slept under the sacristy, but was rescued just in time to save  him perishing in the flames.</p>
  <p>That the Roman Catholics were, if dismayed, still not disheartened by  their losses can be shown in no better way than by the noble pile that now  stands on the site of the destroyed church, of which Father Therry laid the  foundation-stone in 1829.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page071a.jpg" width="800" height="565"></p>
  <p>Three years after the destruction of the Roman Catholic place of  worship, the slow-moving church of England gathered in thousands to witness the  consecration of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Cathedral, of which, as far back as 1819, Governor  Macquarie had laid the foundation-stone. But, and it is important that this  should be remembered when the story of our city comes to be written more in  detail, during the long time the project remained in abeyance, a change of site  was for some reason or other decided upon, which, many years afterwards,  necessitated a relaying of the stone.This ceremony fell to Sir Richard Bourke  on May 6, 1837, on which date the old foundation stone was removed and placed  in its present position. But, even then, not until January, 1856, was the grant  from the Crown finally procured. Nor, stranger still, did the church  authorities take it up until 1865. The structure seems to have made a little  progress after the re-inception of the undertaking in 1837. But for years the  building remained a mere unsightly shell, unroofed and devoid of any  architectural beauty. But, at last, after all these tedious years, the end came,  and assisted by a large body of bishops and clergy, the Metropolitan (the Right  Rev. Dr. Frederick Barker), opened the building for the performance of Divine  service. This was in December 1868, and it seems to have been a very solemn and  impressive ceremony indeed, although, even then, the building was not nearly  completed. But, as at the &ldquo;sumptuous luncheon&rdquo; which took place afterwards at  the Masonic Hall, and which was attended by all the most eminent, both of the  laity and the clergy in these colonies, the Earl of Belmore said: &ldquo;It was now  an edifice of noble proportions, and it had progressed at least so far as to be  available for the worship of God. A great deal remains to be done to finish the  exterior, but he had no doubt that ere another generation passed away the  topmost stone would be laid.&rdquo; A hope that we have seen happily fulfilled.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page071b.jpg" width="800" height="618"></p>
  <p>In these later sixties, and in the beginning of the seventies, we had  the Duke of Edinburgh with us, and we made much use of him in laying foundation  stones and opening public buildings before the unfortunate occurrence at  Clontarf. Among other ceremonies of the kind in which H.R.H. took a prominent  part was that of the inauguration of the long-deferred statue to Captain Cook.  The papers of the day were, of course, full of the ceremony, which seems to  have been attended by all in Sydney. In the cavity of the stone was placed a  bottle containing copies of the &ldquo;Sydney Morning Herald&rdquo; and &ldquo;Empire,&rdquo; together  with the cards of the officers of the Australian Patriotic Association. With  these, was also a facsimile of Captain Cook&rsquo;s handwriting, being a lithographed  transcription of his log, containing the great navigator&rsquo;s observations on the  transit of Venus in 1769.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page072a.jpg" width="629" height="650"></p>
  <p>Referring to the occasion, a newspaper of the same date as the ceremony  says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a curious fact that, although the landing place of Captain Cook  in Botany Bay is not more than six or seven miles from Sydney, but very few  persons have ever visited that secluded spot, or have even a definite idea  where it is. This probably arises from the fact that it lies on the southern  shores of Botany Bay; at the head of which great inlet from the ocean are two  large rivers, terminating in a wild and almost impassable country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, as we are aware, up till within a year or two, what was thus  written over thirty years ago might have still stood good. But most people now  know all about Kurnell, and the dedication of a public park there to the memory  of the discoverer&mdash;even if they seldom visit it.</p>
  <p>In these sixties and seventies, Sydney was progressing at such a rate  that to keep in touch with a tithe of the buildings of importance, both public  and private, that sprung up almost as if by magic, would reduce this chapter to  a mere record of architectural dates and details; moreover, most of these  improvements are well within the memory of thousands of citizens still among  us. Nor did the social characteristics of our city apparently differ much from  those of the present. It is most edifying and instructive, for instance, to  note the fashion in which the story of our city Council was reproduced in one  essential particular three generations ago. And the following description might  have been written to-day. Indeed, during the existence of the Citizens&rsquo;  Vigilance Committee, at the time of the plague, such reports were common enough:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A butcher&rsquo;s shop was visited in William-street last week by the  Inspector of Nuisances and the Acting-Health Officer conjointly. The time was  half an hour past noon, The back premises were found in a filthy condition. The  dung-heap contained a quantity of hair, etc., and was alive with maggots. There  were also a quantity of bones and meat in a state of putrefaction in the shed.  The shed itself was filthy, and the premises generally dirty. The duty of the  two officers was obviously to proceed, according to the law, against a person, who,  by his uncleanliness, was perilling the lives of his fellow-citizens; and it  was the duty of all aldermen, whose servants in the interests of the public  these officers were, to support them in the execution of their duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page072b.jpg" width="800" height="565"></p>
  <p>But, then, no more than nowadays, were things managed in that style.  The butcher cleaned his premises, knowing that an information was sworn against  him. Then, quite according to our best modern traditions, he got two aldermen  to inspect his premises, and one of them to write to the magistrates at the  Water Police Court, saying that he had found the place perfectly clean, while  the other alderman attended at the court to depose to the same fact. And the  testimony of the aldermen carried the day against the public officials. Mr.  Dansey was the Health Officer of the period, and the newspaper calls upon him  to do his duty in such instances without fear of aldermen who may prefer to &ldquo;patronise  stinks.&rdquo; Of what effect the remonstrance was, so far as that particular City  Council was concerned, as well as its immediate successors, may be judged from  the plague revelations of 1900, and the accumulated masses of filth to which it  was principally due.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="1600981h-images/page073large.jpg"><img src="1600981h-images/page073.jpg" width="433" height="650" border="0"></a></p>
  <p>In 1788, there were landed in Sydney some 200 marines; in 1790 the  first detachment of soldiers arrived; and in 1870, Sydney saw the permanent  departure of British soldiers from Australian territory. Although the crowd  that witnessed their embarkation on the Silver Eagle was a large one, it  watched the proceedings in silence, and with an entire absence of enthusiasm. The  troops comprised only two companies of the 18th Line Regiment, and about 70  rank and file of the Royal Artillery, who had been hitherto stationed at Dawes  Point. They boarded the Silver Eagle at Circular Quay, to the music of the band  of the Naval Brigade, stationed in the Ordnance Yard. But though the crowd had  increased to vast dimensions there was not the slightest demonstration. Perhaps  the people felt that in some way the departure of these soldiers of the Queen  typified an approaching severance from the mother country. And yet, of those  silent, and perhaps doubtful, spectators, the majority must have lived to see  native-born Australians in their thousands embarking to fight oversea for that  same Queen.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page074a.jpg" width="800" height="589"></p>
  <p>In these days&mdash;the early seventies&mdash;our present post office had been  begun; and the Town Hall, of which Prince Alfred had laid the foundation-stone,  was in course of erection; Circular Quay was a quay in reality, although not,  of course, equalling its present condition, susceptible of much bettering as  that is. Endless improvements were going on everywhere. Prince Alfred and  Belmore Parks had been formed, and were being beautified. Moore Park was under  process of reclamation. Hyde Park, so long known to us as the Racecourse, bare  and uninviting, now possessed an avenue of well-grown trees half a mile long,  and was dotted with plantations; the Domain had been landscape-gardened out of  all knowledge. We had newspapers by the dozen, churches by the hundred, banks  and other financial institutions by the score; and over 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
  <p>Besides constant steam communication with England and the sister colonies,  Sydney steamers traded regularly to California, New Caledonia, and the Fijis;  whilst &ldquo;sailers &rdquo; hailing out of the port dotted every sea from the North  Pacific to the Indian Ocean.</p>
  <p>At Miller&rsquo;s point there was a yard capable of turning, out ships of 500  tons burden; and many steamers, both screw and paddle, Gunboats, and dredges,  had been built there. The native timber used was, for beams, the iron-bark,  blackbutt, and the flooded, blue, red, and spotted gums; and for fittings, the  tea-tree, iron-bark, blackbutt, and bungally. And as showing the wonderful  excellence of some of these colonial timbers, may be instanced the case of the  Fanny Fisher, built on the Manning River in 1847, and by turns whaler,  passenger-packet and mail-carrier; and now, after her fifty-three years of  service, still afloat as a collier, and in better preservation than many a  comparatively new boat. She should be preserved intact when her time comes, and  the surveyors shake their heads over her, as a specimen not only of what  Australian hardwood is capable of, but as the oldest Australian-built vessel.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page074b.jpg" width="800" height="553"></p>
  <p>As to education in these years, it flourished mightily, and spread all  over the colony, in the shape of 807 schools and 600,000 pupils with 1093  teachers&mdash;an eloquent commentary on the success of the public school system  controlled by the Council of Education. Writing of the Sydney University, a  visitor said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The glory of Sydney, in the way of education, is its University, and  certainly a great deal of spirit has been shown by the colony in the creation  of the institution and in the erection of the building. As regards the  building, I think no one will dispute the assertion when I say that the college  hall&mdash;or public room, for it is put to none of the comfortable festive uses for  which college halls have been built at our universities&mdash;is the finest chamber  in the colonies. If I were to say that no college either at Oxford or Cambridge  possesses so fine a one, I might possibly be contradicted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In these days, however, from a financial point of view, the University  was not a success. The people seemed satisfied with a primary education for  their children, and did not yearn after a university one. Thus, in 1870, the  total cost of the establishment, consisting chiefly of professional salaries,  was &pound;5938, of which &pound;5000 was paid out of the taxes of the colony. There were  41 scholars, paying a little over &pound;22 per annum each. As for the resident  pupils at the affiliated colleges, there was one, and only one, at St. John&rsquo;s,  and but two or three at St. Paul&rsquo;s. With as yet a very sparse population, we  went in for such a scholastic luxury rather too soon. All young communities are  apt to do the same, although not necessarily in the shape of a University. To  quote Anthony Trollope: &ldquo;There is no institution in the colonies which excites  and deserves the sympathies of an English traveller more completely than does  the Sydney University&rdquo;&mdash;this, of course, applying to the time in which he wrote.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page075.jpg" width="800" height="708"></p>
  <p>But of all our educational establishments, the celebrated novelist appears  to have been most impressed with the Fort-street school, where for his  edification some of the pupils were &ldquo;put through their facings&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And certainly one little girl whom I questioned myself must have  understood what she was saying (Anthony had just been astounded by a small boy&rsquo;s  feat in mental arithmetic, and jokingly professes a doubt as to whether there  might not be collusion with the teacher). A passage in Shakespeare had been  read, in which the word &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; is used in its secondary, and not in its  technical, sense. I asked the meaning of the word, and the little girl said  that strategy was the art of military manoeuvering. She was a very nice little  girl, and I hope she may live to be the wife of the first Commander-in-Chief of  the forces of New South Wales.&rdquo; In which case, by the way, the &ldquo;nice little  girl&rdquo; would have had to marry the Right Hon. Sir Augustus William Frederick  Spencer Loftus, PC:, G.C.B., who was the first to assume the title. Let us  hope, that Trollope&rsquo;s little girl is still flourishing and happy, although  probably in a less exalted position. But to return: &ldquo;The girls,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in  some of these public schools are more wonderful even than the boys. They read  better, and seem to have a clearer perception of things in general. I remember  at such an exhibition in New York, hearing a roomful of girls questioned by the  mistress. She asked why the Romans ran away with the Sabine matrons. One girl  suggested that it was because the Sabine matrons were pretty; but she was soon  taken down by a clearer-headed maiden, who told us that it was done for the  sake of the population. The young girls at Sydney were perhaps not quite so far  advanced as this; but, nevertheless, their condition amazed me. Putting aside  all joking, I profess that the excellence of the teaching in the Fort-street  school, at Sydney, was very high.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Could our good-natured visitor leave his appointed place and return to  us once more, and inspect the old school, he would probably be more astonished  than ever at the advance that has been made there, both &nbsp;in the number of pupils, and in the quality of  the teaching, during his absence.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page076a.jpg" width="605" height="750"></p>
  <p>It will be of interest to see what we could do in these years towards  raising money for Imperial charitable purposes. There was then a &ldquo;Patriotic  Fund for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of soldiers and Sailors who fell in  the Crimean War.&rdquo; To that fund New South Wales gave &pound;64,916 6s 6d; Tasmania,  &pound;28,375 5s 7d; Victoria, &pound;47,711 10s 3d; and South Australia, &pound;6297. But while  the whole of our contributions was voluntary, &pound;40,000 of the Victorian amount  was voted by the Legislature.</p>
  <p>In the Indian Mutiny Fund, Victoria comes first, with a level &pound;25,000;  New South Wales, &pound;5821; and South Australia, &pound;2803. Then comes the Cotton  Famine Fund, with New South Wales to the front again with &pound;21,311; Victoria,  &pound;5000; and West Australia, &pound;603 11s 5d. In addition &ldquo;Australia&rdquo; is credited with  a lump sum of &pound;15,739 12s 1d, which amount was forwarded to the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s  Relief Fund. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;It will thus be seen that this  colony, to the extent of &pound;92,048, had, up to the last months of 1870, responded  with splendid liberality to all appeals for help from Great Britain&mdash;and has  been doing so, at intervals, ever since then. Still, alongside the Cotton  Famine figures just quoted, those of the late Indian Famine Fund look poor  enough. We have now, however, more calls on our purse. It is doubtful whether  to-day, backed even by the aegis of a Royal Prince, we could, in a very short  time, gather &pound;28,000, as was done to commemorate the visit of the Duke of  Edinburgh by building a new hospital.</p>
  <p>Trollope came to us in the early seventies, and fell desperately in  love with the city, its people, and its surroundings. Unlike some of the latter  day &ldquo;trotters,&rdquo; who have said nice things whilst partaking of our too-ready  hospitality, and then gone away and mercilessly abused us. Anthony, although at  times he poked a little mild fun at certain of our peculiarities, was, on the  whole, very fair and impartial in his comments upon what he saw. In the light  of recent events, one in particular of his utterances sounds curiously  prophetic. He had been viewing the defences of the harbor, and was impressed,  not only with the different batteries, but with the evident readiness of their  defenders to use them in case of need:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that New South Wales may never have to fight for  England, and certainly that she may not have to fight America. But the feeling  of loyalty in the colony is so strong that were there a fight on hand, she  would be unhappy not to be allowed to take some share in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A remarkable saying, when we consider it as made so many years before  the spirit of Imperialism had been fostered and worked up to its present high  pitch; when the sentiment was even discouraged by the British powers that were.  It is a pity that Trollope did not live to see how completely his forecast had  been justified by the sight of not only New South Wales, but Australasia,  raising and equipping an army of 20,000 men to fight for the Empire oversea.  Moreover, he appears to have visited us with the hope of being pleased, and not  with the hope of cavilling at and picking holes in us and our institutions.  Speaking about the city buildings, he mentions the Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s  Church: &ldquo;The hospital, I was assured, is quite antiquated. It seemed to be airy,  easy, and as pleasant as is compatible with the nature of such an institution.  St. James&rsquo;s Church is pewed all round with high, dark panels, and is as much  like an English comfortless church of the last century as though it stood in an  English town in an eastern county. I went there once, and found it impossible  to hear a word from the gentleman who read the lessons, or from him who  preached. But it is a fashionable church, and is supposed to be that at which  the Governor and his family should say their prayers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page076b.jpg" width="800" height="553"></p>
  <p>Well, if our visitor could return, he would find something worthier of  the name in place of the old hospital; and though the church still stands  externally much as it did what time it dominated the Sydney landscape,  internally the old things have given way to much that is new.</p>
  <p>One more remark of Trollope&rsquo;s must be quoted, because, although uttered  so many years ago, it stands as good to-day as it did then. Speaking of the  Legislative Assembly, he compares it to a pudding. Says he: &ldquo;In the house of  Assembly, at Sydney, there was a sufficiency of farinaceous matter to prevent  the plums from clogging the appetite and hurting the digestion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In drawing this series of articles to a close at this particular epoch  in the history of the city, it may be thought necessary to explain that such a  fact is not due to want of material respecting the newer Sydney; but because  old Sydney and its story having been fairly well exploited, that of the more  recent capital would be lacking in interest for the general reader. Besides,  during the last couple of decades or so, there is nothing doubtful, nothing  that cannot be verified by a few minutes&rsquo; search, whether as to the acts of an  individual, the age and position of a building, or the site of a celebration.  On the other hand, some of the best authorities differ widely regarding the  happenings of those old dark days of storm and stress, through which the infant  settlement passed, only to emerge triumphant&mdash;the great capital city that we see  it to-day. And if in this little book any new light, no matter how small, has  been let in on the doings of those far off times, if any disputed point, no  matter how apparently trivial, has been advanced towards assurance, then it  will not have been written in vain.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>(The  End.)</b></h2>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Rocks"></a>The  Rocks Resumptions.</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;One of the oldest and most  picturesque portions of Sydney will soon be a thing of the past; and before  such is the case a visit to &ldquo;The Rocks&rdquo; would well repay many of our citizens  who, except by name, know nothing of the neighborhood, and would care to see  how our ancestors, both rich and poor, builded in those far-off days. Hence it  is thought the locality calls for more than the passing notice given to it in  the foregoing pages. They still stand those wonderful old houses; the mansion of  the merchant with massive walls, four square, staring out of shadeless windows  over the little cottages perched in all manner of nooks and corners, weather  worn and scarred, their sandstone steps hollowed by the feet of three  generations, but, nevertheless, crouching, sturdy and grimly defiant of the  modern city, scarce a stone&rsquo;s throw away. Reminiscent, these old mansions, of  the time when Dawes Point and its neighborhood was accounted one of the best  residential quarters of the city; the cottages, higher up on the ridge, of the  earliest settlement, when, as a writer remarks: &ldquo;The Rocks was a term  synonymous with St. Giles and Wapping in one.&rdquo; In those days the place seems to  have been a mixture of Sailor Town and Alsatia, studded thickly with the most  nefarious dens and low pot-houses boasting such expressive names as the &ldquo;Black  Dog,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sheer Hulk&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Whaler&rsquo;s Arms,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Struggler,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evening Gun,&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;Sailor&rsquo;s Return&rdquo;&mdash;this last one still in Cumberland-street.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page077a.jpg" width="800" height="502"></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page077b.jpg" width="800" height="508"></p>
  <p>Describing Gloucester-street in the early fifties, a visitor says: &ldquo;It  struck two as we crossed the high bare green by the windmill above St Phillip&rsquo;s  and walked, or rather tumbled and climbed, along Gloucester-street to our  destination. At this time there could hardly be said to be a street; it was  merely the space between two straggling lines of houses ranged along the side  of a very rough, rocky declivity, and these were turning their backs or their  sides or their faces to each other.&rdquo; A description that, even at the present  day, fits aptly enough more than one street on the Rocks, if the ground vacant  then be filled in with hovels of a later growth; with a maze of blind allies,  lanes, courts and passages, squalid backyards; children by the legion and goats  by the score. But, presently, there will be no more Gloucester-street, no more  Cambridge-street either. Light and air will be let into spots where they have  been long strangers, and one of the finest portions of the city redeemed from  insignificance and decay. Traversing the whole of the resumed area will be  three main thoroughfares. New Harrington-street, 80ft wide, Princes-street  130ft in width, and New Cumberland-street 80ft wide, whilst George-street north  will be broadened from its present 40ft to 100. The extra space given to Princes  street is to allow for an elevated railroad connected with the North Shore  extension scheme, as also for the proposed bridge over the harbor. Essex-street  is to be widened to 70ft, and half way between it and Argyle-street a new one  is to be formed.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1600981h-images/page077c.jpg" width="800" height="468"></p>
  <p>All these streets will be wood-blocked; and under them it is proposed  to construct tunnels to accommodate the sewers, water, gas, electric wires,  etc., etc. Argyle Cut will also probably be widened; several bridges built here  and there at intersecting streets in order to make the ascent easy for traffic,  and practically the whole of the ridge from the Observatory downwards will be  cut away to a gentle slope. At least one gathers so much from the official  plan. But, of course, this will be subjected to many changes, so much so  indeed, that it would take a seer to forecast with certainty the appearance of  the big contract at its finish, years hence.</p>
  <p><img src="1600981h-images/page078a.jpg" width="416" height="577" hspace="20" vspace="20" align="left">No mention of the resumed area would be complete without some allusion  to the notable scheme propounded by the Advisory Board for the housing of the  men who work along the wharves, and who reside mainly on or around &ldquo;The Rocks,&rdquo;  in buildings five stories in height, and containing between them some  five-hundred families, or, say, between three and four thousand souls. One will  have frontages to Kent, Windmill, and Argyle streets. The other will be in  Kent-street, somewhere at the foot of the Observatory Reserve. Each &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;  will consist of from two to five rooms, lit by electricity, reached by lifts;  and as sanitarily perfect as science can make them. In the great basement there  will be a library, baths, and probably shops. The square will enclose a  courtyard common to the use of all. Such, taken as a whole, is the gist of the  plans put forward. Whether the Australian working-man himself will approve of  the scheme has yet to be discovered. In London, tenement houses are common  enough, and are thoroughly appreciated by the classes for whose benefit they  were built.</p>
  <p>Within the Rocks area are two historical churches St. Phillips and St.  Andrews (the &ldquo;Scot&rsquo;s Church,&rdquo;) besides Trinity Church, the fine Roman Catholic  one of St. Patrick&rsquo;s, and many large and important buildings, such as  warehouses, hotels, etc., etc., that the path of improvement will most likely  be conducted so as to spare. Probably, owing to the proximity of wharves along  the foreshores of the resumed area, it will always be in great measure a  workingman&rsquo;s quarter, so far, at least, as residence is concerned, although,  certainly, an ideal one, and possessed of some of the finest views in Sydney. A  great commercial quarter it is sure to become, when the energetic Minister for  Works has transformed the place from the mere congerie of rookeries that it now  mostly consists of into one of broad streets and open spaces, whereon will  presently rise piles of warehouses, offices, handsome shops, and either neat  terraces of houses for the working men of the district or the tenement  buildings already spoken of. The public, it is considered, owe a considerable  debt of gratitude to Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan for his courage and patient persistence in  promoting a scheme by which one of the finest parts of our city, hitherto  hidden in squalid seclusion, will be thrown open and utilised for the lasting  benefit of the community at large, and the commercial prosperity of Sydney in  particular. Like all men, the Minister is liable at times to err; but in this  particular instance he has made no mistake, and his wide grasp of affairs, his  uncompromising energy and determination, together with the no small amount of  business ability and enterprise he has brought to bear upon this resumption  scheme, should ensure the success of an undertaking which, perhaps, in a  greater measure than any other he has put his hand to, must appeal not only to  the general public of the present but to posterity.</p>
