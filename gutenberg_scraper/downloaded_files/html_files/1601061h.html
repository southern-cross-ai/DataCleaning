    Miss Lucy Carrington</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Garden Steps&rdquo; was one of the show-places of  Merivale Park, Long Island. In summer it was an enchanting spot, and the  dazzling white marble steps which led to the sunken gardens justified their  right to give the place its name. Other stone steps gave on terraces and flower  banks, others still led to the Italian landscape gardens, and a few rustic  steps of a wooden stile transported one to an old-fashioned garden, whose  larkspur and Canterbury bells were the finest of their sort.</p>
  <p>The house seemed an integral part of this  setting. Its wide verandahs, or more often loggias, were so lavishly furnished  with flowering plants, its windows so boxed with them, that the whole effect  was that of a marvellously well-planned horticultural exhibition.</p>
  <p>But all this was of the summer. In winter&mdash;for it  was an all-round-the-year home&mdash;only the varied and extraordinary collection of evergreens  shared with the steps the honor of making picturesque and beautiful the view  from the house windows.</p>
  <p>And now, in January, one of the all too seldom  enjoyed white snow storms had glorified the whole estate. Wind-swept drifts  half hid, half disclosed the curving marble balustrades, and turned the steps  to snowy fairyland flights.</p>
  <p>And, for it was night, a cold, dear, perfect  winter night, a supercilious moon looked down, a little haughtily and  condescended to illumine the scene in stunning, if a bit theatric, fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ripping picture, eh?&rdquo; said Gray Haviland, as he  held back the heavy curtain for the golden-haired young woman at his side to  look out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful sight!&rdquo; And as Anita  Frayne took a step forward, toward the casement, Haviland let the curtain fall  behind him and the two were alone in the deep embrasure of the wide bay-window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not nearly such a wonderful sight as you are!&rdquo;  Haviland swung her round to face him, and stood gazing at the pretty, doll-like  face that half laughed, half frowned into his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me! I&rsquo;m not like a moonlit landscape!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re just a golden morsel of summer  sunshine&mdash;&rdquo; Haviland&rsquo;s eulogy was interrupted by a petulant voice calling  shrilly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you two? I hear you talking; come on.  I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord! come on,&rdquo; and, holding the curtain  aside, he let Anita pass and then followed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here we are, Cousin Lucy, all ready for the  fray. Good evening, Count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier bowed Frenchily, and Anita gave  him the bright, flashing smile that she kept on hand for mankind in general,  and which was quite different from that she used on special occasions or for  special friends.</p>
  <p>Annoyed at the duration of this delaying smile,  Miss Lucy Carrington tapped impatiently on the bridge table, and looked her  impatience most unmistakably.</p>
  <p>Mistress of Garden Steps, wealthy, well-born, of  assured social position, capable and efficient, Miss Carrington lacked the one  gift of Fate for which she would have bartered all else. She was not beautiful,  and had not even enough pretension to good looks to think herself beautiful. Plain  features, graying hair&mdash;dyed red&mdash;big, prominent light-blue eyes, and a pasty,  pudgy complexion left no hope for the miracles worked by beauty doctors to  avail in her case. Her figure was short and dumpy, the despair of her  staymakers, and her taste in dress ran to the extremes in coloring and fashion.</p>
  <p>Passionately fond of all beauty, Miss Carrington  felt keenly her own lack of it, and to this lack she attributed the fact that  she was a spinster. Those who knew her felt there might be other reasons why  her suitors had been few, but, as a matter of fact, the acidity of her  disposition was a direct result of her disappointed, loveless life, and even  yet, though nearing fifty, Miss Lucy Carrington had by no means laid aside all thoughts  of matrimonial adventure.</p>
  <p>Heiress to immense wealth, there had been  fortune-seekers who asked her hand, but Lucy Carrington would none of these.  Aristocratic and high-minded, she had unerring perception of motives, and the  men who had been willing to marry her face as well as her fortune had been of such  unworth that the lady scorned them.</p>
  <p>But now, looming on her hopes&rsquo; horizon was a  welcome possibility. Count Henri Charlier, a visitor of a neighbor, seemingly  admired the mistress of Garden Steps and had fallen into the habit of frequent  calling. Courteous and polished of manner, he flattered Miss Carrington in such  wise that his attitude was acceptable if not indubitably sincere. Her closest  scrutiny and most challenging provocation failed to surprise any admission of  her lack of perfection in his eyes, and his splendid physique and brilliant  mind commanded her complete approval and admiration. There had been hints that  his title could not be read entirely clear, but this was not sufficient to  condemn him in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>To be sure, the Count had as yet said no word  that could be construed as of definite intention, but there had been certain  signs, deemed portentous by the willing mind of the lady in question.</p>
  <p>Bridge was Miss Carrington&rsquo;s favorite diversion,  and, as the Count also enjoyed it, frequent evenings were devoted to the game.</p>
  <p>It was, perhaps, a mistake that Miss Carrington  should have allowed this, for her temper, always uncertain, lost all restraint  when she suffered ill-luck at cards. A poor hand always brought down violent  objurgation on the head of her partner and sarcastic comment or criticism on  her adversaries. These exhibitions of wrath were not good policy if she wished  to charm the French visitor, but, as he invariably kept his own temper, his  irate hostess made little effort to curb hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Anita?&rdquo; cried Miss  Carrington, petulantly, as they settled themselves at the table. &ldquo;You know I  always play with the blue cards, and you are dealing them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure enough! Pardon me, Lady Lucy, I will take  the red ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, pray, wait till I make them up. There.  No, let the Count cut them! Have you no notion of bridge rules? You are quite  the most inattentive player! Will you kindly concentrate on the game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; and Anita Frayne smiled as she  deftly dealt the red cards. &ldquo;I hope you have a good hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hope I have a good hand! A strange idea for  an adversary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I know you like to win,&rdquo; and Miss Frayne  hastily gathered up her own cards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not like to have you want me to win! That&rsquo;s  babyish. I like to win by superior skill, not merely by lucky cards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was an awful whopper, and all at the table  knew it, but it was ignored and the game began.</p>
  <p>Miss Carrington&mdash;Lady Lucy, as she liked to be  called&mdash;did not hold good hands. On the contrary, she had a run of bad luck that  made her more and more irate with each hand dealt. Miss Frayne, who was her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e </i>and social secretary, watched  with growing apprehension the red spots that appeared in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  cheeks, infallible danger signals of an impending outbreak.</p>
  <p>It came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another handful of blanks!&rdquo; Miss Carrington  exclaimed, angrily, and flung the offending thirteen cards across the wide  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There now, Cousin Lucy,&rdquo; said Gray Haviland,  determined to keep the peace if possible, &ldquo;that was a clever idea! It will  certainly change your luck! I&rsquo;ll collect the pasteboards, and we&rsquo;ll start  fresh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Easily, the big, good-looking young chap  sauntered across the room and gathered up the cards, chatting meanwhile. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t lose your deal, you know; so try again, Cousin Lucy, and good luck to  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In angry silence Miss Carrington dealt again,  and examined her hand. &ldquo;Nothing above a nine spot!&rdquo; she declared, throwing  them, backs up, on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; murmured Miss Frayne, carelessly  picking up the hand. &ldquo;Why, you didn&rsquo;t look closely! Here&rsquo;s an ace and two  queens and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nothing! How dare you dispute my word?  I say the hand is worthless!&rdquo; She fairly snatched the cards from the girl and  turned them face down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But mad&rsquo;moiselle,&rdquo; began the Count, &ldquo;if you  have an ace and two queens, I could have played a no-trump hand grand,&mdash;ah,  splendid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>you</i> could have played it! You want to play all the open hands! You want me to sit  here a dummy, a figure-head, every time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, now, Lady Lucy&mdash;&rdquo; and Anita Frayne laughed  pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be quiet! You&rsquo;re worse yet! You want to deal me  good hands to humor me! I believe you would cheat to do it! I don&rsquo;t want good  cards that way!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; begged the Count, seeing Anita flush, &ldquo;do  not tell the young lady she cheats! Do not do that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her what I choose! Gray, say  something! You sit there like a mummy, while these people are insulting me  right and left! Tell Anita that I am right in not wishing her to deal me good  cards purposely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Haviland; &ldquo;you know  she didn&rsquo;t. Why, she couldn&rsquo;t, even if she wanted to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she could!&rdquo; and Miss Carrington gave a  disagreeable sneer. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite clever enough for any deceit or treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Cousin Lucy! I can&rsquo;t let you talk so  about Miss Frayne in my presence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t you? And, pray, what right  have you to defend her? Go away, both of you! I&rsquo;ll play with you no longer. Go  away and send Pauline and Mr. Illsley in here. They, at least, will play fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita Frayne rose without a word. Haviland rose  too, but talking volubly. &ldquo;Let up, Cousin Lucy,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no  right to treat Miss Frayne so. You ought to apologize to her for such rudeness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apologize!&rdquo; Miss Carrington fairly shrieked; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll  do the apologizing, and you, too, my foolish young cousin. You little know what&rsquo;s  going to happen to me! To-morrow you may sing another song!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haviland looked at her in astonishment; the  Count, thoughtfully. The same idea was in both their minds. Could she mean that  she was expecting the Count to propose to her that evening?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing nice can happen to you unless you learn  to control that temper of yours,&rdquo; and Haviland swung away after Anita.</p>
  <p>He found her in the next room, nestled in the  corner of a big davenport, weeping into a sympathetic sofa-cushion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and find the others,&rdquo; she whispered, as he  came near her. &ldquo;Make them go and play with her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obediently, Haviland went. In the glassed  sun-parlor he found Pauline Stuart, Miss Carrington&rsquo;s niece, and Stephen  Illsley, one of the most favored of Pauline&rsquo;s many suitors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, people,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;do go  and play bridge with the Lady of the Manor! She&rsquo;s in a peach of a fury, and you&rsquo;ll  have to take your life in your hands, but <i>go!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Pauline, bluntly; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Anita&rsquo;s  turn to-night. She said she&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did! But she came off second best, and she&rsquo;s  weeping buckets on the best Empire embroidery sofa-cushions! I&rsquo;m going to  comfort her, but you must go and keep the gentle Lucy from pulling the house  down about our ears! She&rsquo;s sure queering herself with his nibs! He can&rsquo;t admire  her sweet, flower-like soul after this night&rsquo;s exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go a bit, but I suppose we&rsquo;ll  have to,&rdquo; and Pauline smiled at her guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, go on,&rdquo; said Haviland, as he turned to  leave them; &ldquo;and, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, give her all the good cards. Can you  manage that, Illsley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid not. Her eyes are too sharp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if her luck stays bad, get her to play  mumble-peg or something, instead of bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haviland disappeared and Pauline rose  unwillingly. &ldquo;I do so hate to play with Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it must be  done. Are you willing to sacrifice yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For you? Always!&rdquo; And the two went to the  cardroom.</p>
  <p>Pauline Stuart, tall, dark, graceful, was a  striking-looking girl. Only twenty-four, she carried herself with the dignity  and poise of a duchess, and her heavy, dark brows gave her face an expression  of strength and will-power that contrasted forcibly with the delicate Dresden  china beauty of Anita Frayne. The two girls were not especially friendly, though  never definitely at odds. Anita was envious of the more fortunate Pauline. The  latter, Miss Carrington&rsquo;s niece, would inherit a goodly part of her aunt&rsquo;s  large fortune, while the humble position of the secretary commanded only a  liberal, not munificent, salary.</p>
  <p>The girls, however, were at one in their dread  of Miss Lucy&rsquo;s ebullitions of temper and their resentment of the biting  sarcasms and angry diatribes she flung at them in her frequent spasms of fury.</p>
  <p>Illsley, a well-set-up chap of good address,  followed Pauline into her aunt&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You waited long enough,&rdquo; grumbled Miss  Carrington. &ldquo;Sit down. It&rsquo;s your deal now, Pauline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Matters went well for a time. Miss Lucy held  good cards, and once or twice she triumphed through a mistake of her  adversaries, which she fortunately did not discover was made on purpose.</p>
  <p>Count Charlier&rsquo;s little bright black eyes darted  inquiringly from aunt to niece, but he made no comment. All four played well,  and when at last Miss Carrington made a grand slam her joy was effervescent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good play,&rdquo; she flattered herself. &ldquo;You must  admit, Count, that it was clever of me to take that difficult <i>finesse</i> just at that critical point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever indeed, mademoiselle. You have the  analytical mind; you should have been a diplomat. Also, Fortune favors you. You  are beloved of the fickle goddess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; and for a moment Miss  Carrington looked grave.</p>
  <p>And then, with the perversity of that same  goddess, the card luck changed. Pauline and Illsley held all the high cards,  Miss Lucy and the Count only the low ones.</p>
  <p>Storm signals showed. Whiter grew the stern, set  face; tighter drew the thin, wide lips; and rigid muscles set themselves in the  angry, swelling throat. Then, as she scanned a hand of cards, all below the  ten, again they went in a shower across the room, and she cried, angrily: &ldquo;A Yarborough!&rdquo;  reverting to the old-fashioned term.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; and Pauline tried to  laugh it off; &ldquo;this is not your lucky night. Let&rsquo;s give up bridge for to-night.  Let&rsquo;s have some music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! because you love music and hate bridge! It  makes no difference what <i>I</i> want. My  wishes are never considered. You and Anita are just alike! Selfish, ungrateful,  caring for nothing but your own pleasure. Mr. Illsley, don&rsquo;t you think young  girls should pay some slight attention to the wishes of one who does everything  for them? Where would either of them be but for me? Are you not sorry for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I&mdash;you must excuse me, I am not sure I  understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you understand, perfectly well. You know  the girls slight me and snub me every chance they get. But it will not always  be thus. To-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; pleaded Pauline, &ldquo;let us have  some music. You know there are some new records, just arrived to-day. Let us  hear them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are there new records? Did you get the ones I  wanted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of them. We couldn&rsquo;t get them all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not! But if <i>you</i> had wanted certain records they would  have been found!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Auntie Lucy, we couldn&rsquo;t get them if they  aren&rsquo;t made, could we? Gray tried his best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, tried his best! He forgot to ask for them,  so he says he &lsquo;tried his best,&rsquo; to excuse his carelessness. If Anita had wanted  them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The starting of the music drowned further flow  of the lady&rsquo;s grievances.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>II<br>
    A Clash Of Tongues</b></h2>
  <p>True to its reputation for calming the impulses  of the turbulent spirit, the music soothed Miss Carrington&rsquo;s ruffled temper,  and she waxed amiable and even gay. Enthroned on her favorite red velvet chair,  resplendent in an elaborately decorated gown of sapphire blue satin, with her  bright auburn locks piled high and topped by an enormous comb of carved tortoise-shell,  she dominated the little group and gave orders that must be obeyed.</p>
  <p>She wore, among other jewels, a magnificent rope  of pearls. So remarkable were these, that the Count, who had never seen them  before, ventured to refer to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Miss Carrington, &ldquo;they are  wonderful. Practically priceless, I assure you. It took my agent years to  collect them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you grace an informal home evening with  these regal gems?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not usually, no. But you know, Count Charlier,  pearls must be worn frequently to preserve their lustre. Laid away a long time,  they grow dead and dull-looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You keep them here? Is it safe, think you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keep them here all the time. Indeed, I  got these from the Safe Deposit only this morning. I shall return them there in  a few days. While here, I shall wear them all I can to liven them up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You brought a lot of your other jewels, didn&rsquo;t  you, Aunt Lucy?&rdquo; said Pauline, casually; &ldquo;why did you? Are you going to a ball?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No: I wish to&mdash;to look them over and plan to  have some reset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But are they safe?&rdquo; inquired the Count again; &ldquo;do  you not fear thieves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, we never have such things as robbery in Merivale  Park. It is a quiet, well-behaved neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you have a safe?&rdquo; went on the Count; &ldquo;you  take at least that precaution?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have a safe in my boudoir. There is  really no danger. Count Charlier, would you like to hear me sing? Find one of  my records, Gray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Carrington&rsquo;s singing voice had been a fine  one and was still fair. She sometimes amused herself by making records for her  phonograph, and Gray Haviland managed the mechanical part of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which one, Lady Lucy?&rdquo; he asked, as he rummaged  in the record cabinet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any of those pretty love songs,&rdquo; and Miss  Carrington glanced coyly at the Count.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine one,&rdquo; and Haviland placed a disk  in the machine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, smiling; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t miss the  introduction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The needle touched the record, and Miss Lucy&rsquo;s  laugh rang out, so clear and true, it was difficult to believe it was a  recorded laugh and not a sound from the lady herself. Then the recorded voice  said: &ldquo;This song is one of Carr&rsquo;s favorites, I&rsquo;ll sing it for him.&rdquo; And then,  with only a few seconds&rsquo; interval, Miss Carrington&rsquo;s voice sang, &ldquo;Believe me,  if all those endearing young charms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was well sung, and a perfect record, so that  the incident of the singer listening to her own voice was interesting in  itself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; applauded the Count, as it was  finished. &ldquo;It is indeed pleasant to preserve one&rsquo;s songs thus. May I not some  time record my own amateur attempt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted to have you, Count,&rdquo; said Haviland,  cordially. &ldquo;Come over some morning, and we&rsquo;ll do up a lot of records.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since when have you been master here, Gray?&rdquo;  said Miss Lucy, with fine scorn. &ldquo;I will give the invitations to my own house,  if you please! Count Charlier, if you will come to-morrow afternoon I will  instruct Mr. Haviland to make the records.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not so much the words as the manner of  their utterance that was offensive, and Haviland set his lips in stifled anger.  It was not at all unusual, this sort of rebuff, but he could not endure it as  patiently as the two girls did. Haviland was a second cousin of Miss  Carrington, and, while he lived with her in the capacity of a business  secretary and general man of affairs, the post was a sinecure, for the services  of her lawyer and of her social secretary left little for Haviland to do. His salary  was a generous one and he was substantially remembered in her will, but he  sometimes thought the annoying and irritating fleers he had to accept  smilingly, were worth more than he was receiving. He was continually made to  feel himself a dependent and an inferior.</p>
  <p>These trials also fell to the lot of the two  girls. Pauline, although her aunt&rsquo;s heiress to the extent of half the fortune,  the other half to go to an absent cousin, was by no means treated as an equal  of Miss Carrington herself. It seemed to give the elder lady delight to  domineer over her niece and in every possible way make her life uneasy and  uncomfortable. As to the social secretary, Miss Frayne, she was scolded for  everything she did, right or wrong.</p>
  <p>Often had the three young people declared intentions  of leaving Garden Steps, but so far none of them had made good the threat.</p>
  <p>Vanity was the key-note of Lucy Carrington&rsquo;s  nature, and, knowing this, they could, if they chose, keep her fairly  sweet-tempered by inordinate flattery often administered. This proceeding hurt  their self-respect, jarred their tempers, and galled their very souls, but it  was that or dismissal, and thus far they had stayed. Matters were nearing a  crisis, however, and Haviland&rsquo;s patience was so sorely strained that he was secretly  looking for another position. Anita Frayne, whose pretty blonde doll-face  belied a very fiery disposition, was on the verge of a serious break with her  employer, and Pauline Stuart continually assured herself that she could not go  on this way.</p>
  <p>Pauline was the orphaned daughter of Lucy&rsquo;s  sister, and had lived with her aunt for many years. Carrington Loria, the son  of another sister, was engaged in antiquarian research in Egypt, where he had  been since his graduation as an engineer. He, too, was an orphan and had lived  with Lucy in his younger days, and he and Pauline were equal heirs to their  aunt&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
  <p>The father of the three Carrington sisters,  having become angered at his two daughters who married against his wishes, had  left his entire fortune to Lucy, his only remaining child. Thus her niece and  nephew were her only direct heirs, and, save for some comparatively small  bequests, the Carrington estate would eventually be theirs.</p>
  <p>Pauline well knew that if she left her aunt&rsquo;s  roof it meant complete disinheritance, for Lucy Carrington was proud of her  beautiful niece, and, too, was fond of her in her own way. But the ungovernable  temper of the lady made her home an almost unbearable abiding-place.</p>
  <p>Since childhood years Carrington Loria had lived  there only during his college vacations; but had been back occasionally for  short visits from his now permanent Egyptian occupation. He had always come  laden with gifts of Oriental products, and the rooms at Garden Steps showed  many rare specimens of cunning handiwork and rich fabrics and embroideries.</p>
  <p>To break the awkward pause that followed Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s rude speech to Gray Haviland, Pauline picked up an antique scarab  from a side table and drew the Count&rsquo;s attention to its inscription.</p>
  <p>He expressed a polite interest, but cast furtive  glances at his hostess, as if afraid of a further outbreak.</p>
  <p>Nor were his fears unjustified. Miss Carrington  administered a scathing reproach to Pauline for intruding herself upon the  Count&rsquo;s attention, and bade her put aside the scarab and hold her tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me like that, Aunt Lucy; I am  not a child!&rdquo; And Pauline, unable to control herself longer, faced her angry  aunt with an air of righteous wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to you as I choose, miss! It is for  you to mend your tone in addressing me! If you don&rsquo;t, you may have cause to  regret it. Count Charlier came here to see me, and I refuse to countenance your  clumsy attempts to engage his interest in your silly babble!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I insist&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the greatly  embarrassed Count, &ldquo;allow me, madame, let me say, I call on you all&mdash;all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; declared Miss Lucy; &ldquo;you  came, Count, to play bridge with us. Our opponents behaved so rudely and played  so badly it was impossible for us to continue the game. Nor can we enjoy music  in this inharmonious atmosphere. Let us stroll in the conservatory, you and I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose, trailing her heavy silks and flashing  her sparkling jewels, and the Count, a little hesitatingly, followed her. They  crossed the great hall, and, going through a reception room and the delightful  sun-parlor, came to the warm, heavily-scented conservatory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor old Charlier!&rdquo; said Haviland, as the pair  disappeared; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in for it now! Do you suppose the palms and orchids will  bring him up to the scratch? &lsquo;Nita, I&rsquo;ll bet you a box of gloves against a box  of simple little cigarettes that he doesn&rsquo;t propose to the lady to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Miss Frayne, who was sparkling  again, now that the dread presence was removed. &ldquo;I doubt he can help himself.  She has him at her mercy. And he&rsquo;s too good-mannered to disappoint her wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll propose,&rdquo; said Pauline, with an air of  conviction. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a typical fortune-hunter, that man. Indeed, I am not sure he&rsquo;s  a Count at all. Do you know, Mr. Illsley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know almost nothing of the man, save that he&rsquo;s  a guest of the Frothinghams. That&rsquo;s not entirely in his favor, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; agreed Haviland. &ldquo;Those people  are,&mdash;well, they&rsquo;re to be queried. But I say, Polly, if the two do hit it off,  it&rsquo;s grinding poverty for us, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be a blessed relief, Gray. She&rsquo;ll give  us something, of course, and send us away from here. I, for one, shouldn&rsquo;t be  sorry to go. She is getting too impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; put in Anita; &ldquo;every day she pounds us  worse! I&rsquo;d like to kill her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fierce words and would-be menacing glance of  the little blonde beauty were about as convincing as a kitten declaring himself  a war lord, and even the stately Pauline smiled at the picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She ought to be killed,&rdquo; declared Haviland, &ldquo;and  I say this dispassionately. I wouldn&rsquo;t do it, because killing is not in my  line, but the eternal fitness of things requires her removal to another sphere  of usefulness. She makes life a burden to three perfectly good people, and some  several servants. Not one would mourn her, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, stop, Gray!&rdquo; cried Pauline; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk in  that strain! Don&rsquo;t listen to him, Mr. Illsley. He often says such things, but  he doesn&rsquo;t mean them. Mr. Haviland loves to talk at random, to make a  sensational hearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort, Polly. I do mean it. Lucy  Carrington is a misery dispenser, and such are not wanted in this nice little  old world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; Pauline looked thoughtful, &ldquo;the  fault is in us. We don&rsquo;t like her, and so we see nothing good in what she does.  Now, Carrington Loria adores her. She had a letter from him to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Loria adores her!&rdquo; interrupted Haviland, &ldquo;because  he doesn&rsquo;t live with her! She sends him love-letters and money, and he doesn&rsquo;t  know the everlasting torture of living under her roof, year in and year out!  But he caught on a little the last time he was here. He said,&mdash;well, in his quaint  Oriental fashion, he said, &lsquo;Gee! she&rsquo;s the limit!&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what he said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she is,&rdquo; pouted Anita. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do a  thing to suit her. To-day I wrote a letter over six times before she was  satisfied. And every change she wanted made was so foolish she wanted it  changed back again. She nearly drove me crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I have to put up with her morning, noon,  and night,&rdquo; sighed Pauline. &ldquo;You have your hours off, Anita, but I never do.  She even wakens me in the night to read to her, or to help her plan her new  gowns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is awfully hard for you,&rdquo; began Mr. Illsley,  and then all stopped short, for the object of their discussion returned to the  room.</p>
  <p>It was plain to be seen Miss Carrington was in a  state of suppressed excitement. She giggled almost hysterically, and tapped the  Count playfully on the arm with her fan, as she bade him say good-night and go.</p>
  <p>The interested ones watching her could not learn  whether the Count had declared himself or not. The presumption was negative,  for, had he done so, surely Miss Carrington would have told the good news.</p>
  <p>Charlier himself was distinctly non-committal.  Debonair as always, he made his adieux, no more demonstrative to his hostess  than to the others, and went away. Illsley followed, and the household  dispersed. The clock struck midnight as the ladies went upstairs.</p>
  <p>Following custom, they all three went to Miss  Lucy&rsquo;s boudoir. It was by way of reporting for to-morrow&rsquo;s orders, and was a  duty never neglected.</p>
  <p>The exquisite apartment, from which opened the  bedroom and bath, was softly lighted and fragrant with flowers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you like Count Henri Charlier?&rdquo; Miss  Carrington quickly demanded of her satellites.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charming,&rdquo; said the voluble Anita. &ldquo;Just a  typical French nobleman, isn&rsquo;t he? And how he adores our Lady Lucy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The whole speech rang false, but the vanity of  the lady addressed swallowed it as truest sincerity. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;he  is infatuated, I have reason to think. But&mdash;we shall see what we shall see! Curb  your impatience, girls! You shall know all in due time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you, Auntie, to-night or  to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Pauline, and, though she tried to speak with enthusiasm, her  tone did sound perfunctory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if you offer in that manner,&rdquo; and Miss  Carrington looked at her niece coldly. &ldquo;One would think, Pauline, that it must  be an irksome task to do the smallest favor for your aunt and benefactor! Do  you feel no pleasure in doing what trifles you can for one who does everything  for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would feel a pleasure, Aunt Lucy, if you were  kinder to me. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kinder!&rdquo; shrieked her aunt; &ldquo;kinder! Girl, have  you taken leave of your senses? I give you a home, fine dresses, money,  everything you can want, and you ask me to be kinder to you! Go! never let me  see you again, after that speech!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie, don&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean to exasperate me beyond  endurance? No, of course you meant to stop short of that! But you have done it.  I mean this, Pauline: to-morrow you go elsewhere to live. No longer will I give  a home to such a monster of ingratitude!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Miss Carrington&rdquo;&mdash;and Anita Frayne&rsquo;s soft  voice implored gently&mdash;&rdquo;don&rsquo;t be hasty. Pauline didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; and Lucy Carrington turned on her, &ldquo;you  take her part? Then you go, too! I want no ingrates here. Leave me, both of  you. This night is your last beneath this roof! You are two unworthy girls, to  scorn and slight the hand that has fed and clothed you and given you luxury and  comfort such as you will never see again! Go, I&rsquo;ve done with you! Send me Estelle.  She, at least, has some small affection for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two girls left the room. The scene was not  without precedent. Before this they had been ordered to leave the house  forever, but always forgiveness and reinstatement had followed. This time,  however, the Lady Lucy had been rather more in earnest, and the girls looked at  each other uncertainly as they turned toward their rooms.</p>
  <p>Anita summoned Estelle, the French maid, and  then told her to hasten immediately to Miss Carrington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t undress me,&rdquo; said the mistress as the  maid appeared; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not retiring at once. Get me out of this gown and give me a  neglig&eacute;e and slippers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; and Estelle deftly obeyed  orders and brought a white boudoir gown edged with swans-down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that!&rdquo; cried Miss Carrington. &ldquo;Bring the  gold-embroidered one,&mdash;the Oriental.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, the green one, from Monsieur Loria?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the one my nephew sent me at Christmas  time. My, but it&rsquo;s handsome, isn&rsquo;t it, Estelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gorgeous!&rdquo; declared the maid, and she spoke  truly. Young Loria knew his aunt&rsquo;s taste, and he had sent her a typical  Egyptian robe, of pale green silk, heavy with gold embroideries. In it Miss  Carrington looked like one attired for a masquerade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I take down mademoiselle&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo; asked  Estelle, lingering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I want to be alone. I will read awhile. You  need not return. I will do for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is your glass of milk, ma&rsquo;mzelle, on the  bed-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly! I suppose I can see it for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. And you will have your tea at eight  in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, my tea at eight. As always. You  might remember that much yourself. But nobody remembers things for <i>my</i> comfort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon, but sometimes it is eight, and, again,  it must be half-past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight! Now, will you go? You are most  exasperating! Why do you stand there like a gibbering idiot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The jewels, mademoiselle; the pearls? Shall I  not put them in safety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I will put them in the safe myself. Where  is the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, mademoiselle, on your dresser. But if I  might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t do anything except to get out and  stay out! Do you hear? Shall I never be obeyed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle; good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The soft tone was fully belied by the evil glare  of the French girl&rsquo;s eyes, but that was not seen by Miss Lucy Carrington.</p>

    The Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>The house faced the east, and, built on an  English model, was far wider than deep. A broad hall ran through the centre  from front to back, and on either side there were successive rooms whose  windows looked out on equally beautiful scenes, both front and back. On the  right of the hall, as one entered, was the long living room, and beyond it, the  library and music room. The other side of the hall was a reception room,  opening into the sun parlor, and on to the conservatory, and back of these, the  dining room and smaller breakfast room.</p>
  <p>Breakfast was served at nine, and the members of  the family were usually all present. Miss Carrington, herself, made a point of  being on time partly from habit, and also because it gave her opportunity to  chide those who were late.</p>
  <p>When she was not in her place, on the morning  after the stormy bridge game, Pauline expressed surprise, and Haviland echoed  her words.</p>
  <p>But Anita said scornfully, &ldquo;She went to bed in  an awful tantrum and probably didn&rsquo;t sleep well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Frayne was looking her prettiest, and her  roseleaf face with its fluffy golden halo, was like a Greuze picture. She wore  a frivolous little house gown of blue cr&ecirc;pe de chine that just matched her forget-me-not  eyes. Not especially appropriate garb for a secretary, but Miss Carrington  preferred her household to be well-dressed, and really commanded pretty tints  and fabrics for the two girls. Pauline was in white serge, of rather severe  cut, but which suited her as no frills and flounces could. Her black hair was  smoothly parted and coiled low over her ears, and her clear ivory-tinted skin  was flushed faintly pink from the glow of the big, crackling wood fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most unusual,&rdquo; went on Pauline, after a  few moments more had passed, and the Lady Lucy had not appeared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up  to see if she is ill,&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or merely in a tantrum extraordinary!&rdquo; said  Anita, her blue eyes full of laughing disrespect for her employer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nita,&rdquo; said Haviland, as Pauline disappeared, &ldquo;hold  your breakfast napkin up in front of your face, quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said the girl, wonderingly, as she did  his bidding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, if you hadn&rsquo;t, I should have flown at  you and kissed you! And I mustn&rsquo;t now, for Haskins is approaching with muffins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down came the shielding napkin and only the  arrival of the muffin-laden Haskins saved the lovely laughing face from  Haviland&rsquo;s impetuous caress.</p>
  <p>The old butler fussed about, and several minutes  passed, when Pauline called from above stairs, &ldquo;Gray! Come here, at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Desperate case!&rdquo; and Haviland rose, and  unhurriedly left the room, pinching Anita&rsquo;s little ear as he passed her.</p>
  <p>Another moment and Miss Frayne heard an  exclamation from Haviland that made her rise from the table and go flying  upstairs herself.</p>
  <p>The door of Miss Lucy&rsquo;s boudoir was open, and  entering, she saw Pauline and Haviland with horror-stricken faces, gazing at a  terrible sight.</p>
  <p>Miss Lucy Carrington, seated before her  dressing-table, her face white and ghastly, her large eyes staring wide&mdash;staring  horribly,&mdash;but, without doubt, unseeing. Nor was this all of the strangeness of  the sight. She was robed in an embroidered Oriental-looking gown, and wore many  jewels. Her red-dyed hair, dressed elaborately, as she had worn it the night before,  was still crowned with the enormous comb of carved tortoise-shell, but the comb  was broken to bits. One portion, still standing upright, rose above the  disordered coiffure, but the rest, in broken scraps, lay scattered over the  puffs of hair,&mdash;over the white hands clasped in her lap,&mdash;and on the floor at her  feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; whispered Anita,  shuddering, &ldquo;is she&mdash;is she dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Haviland, briefly. He stood,  hands in pockets, gazing at the startling figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&mdash;What?&mdash;&rdquo; Anita&rsquo;s eyes riveted themselves on  something else.</p>
  <p>Around the neck of Miss Lucy was,&mdash;yes, it <i>was</i>&mdash;a snake!</p>
  <p>With a low scream, Anita flung herself into  Haviland&rsquo;s arms, but he put her gently away from him.</p>
  <p>Aghast at this repulse, Anita put her hand  across her eyes and turned to leave the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind where you go, &lsquo;Nita!&rdquo; called out Haviland,  and the girl stopped just in time to save herself from stepping into a mass of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s Miss Lucy&rsquo;s tray!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was. The silver tray that had held the  breakfast tea was on the floor, and near it a jumbled heap of silver and broken  china that had once been a costly Sevres set. Dainty white serviettes were  stained with the spilled tea and a huge wet spot was near the overturned silver  teapot.</p>
  <p>Hastily Anita ran from the room, but she sank  down on a couch in the hall just outside the door, utterly unable to go  further.</p>
  <p>Fascinated by the beady eyes of the green snake,  Pauline stared at it, with clenched hands. Haviland stepped nearer and lightly  touched it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it alive?&rdquo; gasped Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo; replied Haviland quietly. &ldquo;A paper  snake, a toy,&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But who put it there? Aunt Lucy is deathly  afraid of snakes! Did fright kill her? Gray, is she&mdash;murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Pauline, she has been killed. But could it  be&mdash;fright? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not for her! You don&rsquo;t know her horror of  snakes. Why, going through the Japanese department of a shop, I&rsquo;ve seen her  turn white and fairly fly from the counter where those paper things were  displayed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what else killed her? There is no wound, no  shot, no blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get the doctor, Gray! Don&rsquo;t wait a minute.  Telephone at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can do nothing, Pauline. She is dead.&rdquo;  Haviland spoke like a man in a daze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But no matter, we must call him. Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go into her bedroom,&mdash;use that telephone by her  bedside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obediently, Haviland went on to the adjoining  room, the soft rugs giving forth no sound of his footfalls.</p>
  <p>The door was ajar, and as he opened it, he  called, &ldquo;Come here, Pauline; look, the night lights are burning, and the bed  untouched. She hasn&rsquo;t been to bed at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course she hasn&rsquo;t. She has her hair as it  was last evening. But her comb is broken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Broken! It&rsquo;s smashed! It&rsquo;s in tiny bits! She  has been hit on the head,&mdash;don&rsquo;t touch her, Pauline! You mustn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll call Dr.  Stanton. You go out of the room. Go and find Anita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Pauline staid. Turning her back to the still  figure in the chair, she gazed curiously at the upset tray on the floor. She  stooped, when Haviland&rsquo;s voice came sharply from the next room. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch a  thing, Pauline!&rdquo; he cried, as he held his hand over the transmitter.</p>
  <p>She looked up, and then as she saw him turn back  to speak into the instrument, she stooped swiftly and picking up something from  the floor she hurried from the room.</p>
  <p>She found Anita on the couch in the hall, and speaking  somewhat sharply, Pauline said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Estelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy! I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s blue eyes  stared coldly. &ldquo;How should I know anything about Estelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she must have brought that tray an hour  ago. Did she upset it, or who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pauline, why do you act as if I knew anything  about this matter. Is it because <i>you</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blue eyes, cold like steel, and the dark  ones, flashing fire from their shadows, looked steadily at each other.</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland came hurriedly out to the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The doctor will be here at once,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and  he will call the coroner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coroner!&rdquo; screamed Anita; and ran away to her  own room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo; said Pauline, contemptuously; &ldquo;but  Gray, we must nerve ourselves up to this thing. Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to&mdash;to  put away the jewels? It&rsquo;s wrong to let any one come into a room where a fortune  in jewels is displayed like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Doctor Stanton said to touch nothing,&mdash;nothing  at all. You see, Pauline, in a murder case,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know; &lsquo;nothing disturbed till the Coroner  comes,&rsquo; and all that. But this is different, Gray. Doctor Stanton didn&rsquo;t know  there are two hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of jewelry on that&mdash;that&mdash;on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know so exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exact, but she has told me times enough  that the rope of pearls cost one hundred thousand, and that corsage ornament  she is wearing and her rings and ear-rings are easily worth the same sum. I  tell you there will be policemen here, and it isn&rsquo;t right to throw temptation  in their way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s voice spoke again as she  reappeared in the doorway, &ldquo;besides, Pauline, they are all yours now, and you  should be careful of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tone more than the words conveyed a veiled  insolence, and Pauline accepted it for such. With a sudden determined movement,  she went swiftly to her aunt&rsquo;s side, and unfastened the long rope of pearls,  the wonderful glittering sunburst, and a large diamond and emerald crescent  that held together the glistening silk folds. The rings and ear-rings she could  not bring herself to touch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is only <i>right</i>,&rdquo;  she contended, as if trying to persuade herself, &ldquo;these are too valuable to  risk; no one could fail to be tempted by them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish your task?&rdquo; said Anita,  smiling unpleasantly, &ldquo;why leave so much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one would attempt to take the rings or  ear-rings,&rdquo; said Pauline, steadily, &ldquo;and that scarab bracelet is not of great  value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought that was a most valuable antique that  her nephew sent her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She thought so, too,&rdquo; said Pauline, carelessly,  &ldquo;but Carr told me it was an imitation. Not one expert in a hundred can tell the  difference, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Pauline placed the mass of gems in the safe,  the doctor came. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; cried the bewildered man, coming into the  room. &ldquo;Miss Carrington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Words failed him as he saw the astounding sight.  For surely, no one had ever before seen a murdered woman, sitting before her  dressing-table, staring but smiling, and garbed as for a fancy-dress ball!</p>
  <p>Doctor Stanton touched the icy-cold hand, felt  for the silent heart, and then turned his attention to the disheveled hair and  broken comb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fractured skull,&rdquo; he said, as his skilled  fingers thridded the auburn tresses. &ldquo;Killed by a sudden, swift blow on the  head with a heavy, blunt,&mdash;no, with a soft weapon; a black-jack or sandbag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A burglar!&rdquo; exclaimed Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course; who else would deal such a blow? It  was powerful,&mdash;dealt by a strong arm&mdash;it has driven bits of this broken shell  stuff into the brain. But it was the force of the concussion that killed her.  Here is a deep dent,&mdash;and yet.&mdash;Tell me the circumstances. Why is she rigged out  like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea,&rdquo; answered Pauline, taking the  initiative. &ldquo;When I left her last night, she had on an evening gown. But this  neglig&eacute;e is not unusual; it is one of her favorites. Though why she has on that  spangled scarf, I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She seems to have been posing before the  mirror, rather than engaged in making a toilette.&rdquo; Dr. Stanton was a pompous  middle-aged man of fussy manner. He did not again touch the body, but he  stepped about, noting the strange conditions and commenting on them. &ldquo;This  paper snake,&mdash;tight round her neck! What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What <i>can</i> it mean?&rdquo; returned Pauline. &ldquo;She had an intense hatred,&mdash;even <i>fear</i> of snakes; I&rsquo;ve never seen it  before. Could it have been placed there to frighten her to death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she didn&rsquo;t die of fright. See, her  expression is placid,&mdash;even smiling. But the shattered comb and dented skull  have but one explanation,&mdash;a stunning blow. Did she have on the comb last  evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a favorite one with her. An heirloom,  from a Colonial ancestor. It encircled the entire back of her head, when whole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time was she killed?&rdquo; asked Gray  Haviland. He had stood, till now, a silent listener to the conversation between  Pauline and the Doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, many hours ago,&rdquo; returned Stanton; &ldquo;six or  eight at least. Evidently she was preparing for bed, and trying the effect of  some new finery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those things are not new,&rdquo; put in Anita; &ldquo;she  has had them all a long time. But she must have been admiring herself, for when  we found her she had on all her finest jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Dr. Stanton; &ldquo;where are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I took most of them off,&rdquo; replied Pauline,  quietly, &ldquo;and put them in the safe. If the police people must come, I am not  willing to have a fortune in jewels here to tempt their cupidity. And I have a  right. It is no secret that my cousin Carrington and I are her heirs. But that  snake perplexes me beyond all else. If you knew her aversion to them,&mdash;even pictured  ones&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do know it,&rdquo; returned the doctor; &ldquo;I have  often heard her say so. Ah,&rdquo; as he stepped carefully about, &ldquo;she <i>was</i> adorning herself; see, here is powder  scattered on the floor. She used this powder-puff, shaking it over the rug and  floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw that the first thing!&rdquo; cried Pauline,  excitedly; &ldquo;and there was a&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, looking in amazement at the white  dust on the floor. For where she had seen a distinct footprint, as of a  stockinged foot, there was now merely a blurred whirl! Some one had obliterated  that footprint!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; asked the doctor, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. A&mdash;a lot of powder spilled,&mdash;I was going  to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland looked at her. &ldquo;Tell the truth,  Pauline,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she replied, with a calm quite  equalling his own. &ldquo;Must we have the Coroner, Dr. Stanton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course; I will telephone at once.  There will be police and detectives,&mdash;oh, it is a terrible case! Nothing must be  touched, nothing! If there is <i>any</i> clue to this mystery, do not let it be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you say it was without doubt a burglar who  did it,&rdquo; said Anita, her wide eyes gleaming blue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why were none of her jewels stolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; and Dr. Stanton looked as if a  bomb had exploded at his feet. &ldquo;Sure enough! It cannot have been a burglar!  Who, then? What other motive than robbery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a burglar,&rdquo; declared Pauline, &ldquo;and he was&mdash;he was frightened away by&mdash;by a noise&mdash;or  something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely!&rdquo; said Anita, &ldquo;with all those gems  in easy reach!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Coroner and the police must get here at  once!&rdquo; and the doctor wiped his perspiring brow. &ldquo;Never have I seen such an  inexplicable state of affairs! Was&mdash;was Miss Carrington indisposed at all last  evening? Did she say or do anything unusual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; began Pauline, but Anita  interrupted; &ldquo;Yes, she did! She said, &lsquo;You little know what&rsquo;s going to happen  to me! To-morrow you may sing another tune!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. Could it mean suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered the doctor; &ldquo;her skull was  fractured by some one bent on wilful murder! As there is no robbery, we must  look for a deeper motive and a cleverer villain than any professional burglar!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>IV<br>
    A Paper Snake</b></h2>
  <p>On the third floor was the bedroom of the maid,  Estelle, and before its locked door stood Pauline and Anita, demanding  admittance. There was no response from inside, until Pauline said sternly, &ldquo;Unless  you open this door at once, Estelle, the police will force it open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The key turned, the door moved slowly ajar, and  Estelle&rsquo;s face appeared, wearing an expression of amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it you say, Miss Pauline? The police?  Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The maid was making a very evident effort to  appear composed, and was succeeding wonderfully well. Her eyes were reddened  with weeping,&mdash;a condition which a hasty dabbing of powder had not concealed.  She was nervously trembling, but her air of injured innocence, if assumed, was admirable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Estelle,&rdquo; and Pauline loomed tall and  magnificent as an accusing angel, &ldquo;what do you know of your mistress&rsquo; death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Estelle gave a shriek and threw herself on her  bed in apparent hysterics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin that!&rdquo; ordered Pauline, &ldquo;sit up  here and tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; and the maid sat up, sobbing, &ldquo;I know  nothing. How can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You took the tea-tray to her at eight  o&rsquo;clock. What did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Estelle shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I saw Miss  Carrington sitting before her mirror. She, I assumed, was engrossed in reverie,  so I set down the tray on a tabouret and departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You noticed nothing amiss?&rdquo; said Anita, staring  at the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I scarce looked at the lady. She reproved  me harshly last night, and I had no wish to annoy her. I set down the tray with  haste and silently departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You set it down? Who, then, overturned it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Overturned? Is it then upset?&rdquo; Estelle&rsquo;s manner  was the impersonal one of the trained servant, who must show surprise at  nothing, but it was a trifle overdone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Estelle, stop posing. Wake up to realities.  Miss Carrington is dead! Do you hear? Dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! <i>Mon  Dieu!</i> Did it then kill her?&rdquo; and Estelle&rsquo;s calm gave way and she screamed  and moaned in wild hysterics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can we do with her?&rdquo; asked Anita,  helplessly; &ldquo;she must know all about the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The murder,&rdquo; said Pauline calmly. &ldquo;But she will  tell us nothing. It is useless to question her. The Coroner will attend to it,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Coroner,&rdquo; and Anita looked frightened. &ldquo;Will  he question all of us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he will. And, Anita,&rdquo; Pauline whirled  on her suddenly, &ldquo;what are you going to say was the errand that took you to  Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s room after one o&rsquo;clock last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I! Nothing of the sort! I was not in her room  after we left it together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw you. Don&rsquo;t trouble to deny it,&rdquo; and  Pauline dropped her eyelids as one bored by a conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s flower face turned rosy  pink and her blue eyes blazed with an intensity that Pauline&rsquo;s dark ones could  never match. &ldquo;Be careful, Pauline Stuart, or I shall tell what <i>I</i> know! You <i>dare</i> to make up such a story! It was <i>I</i> who saw <i>you</i> come from  your aunt&rsquo;s room at a late hour! What have you to say now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;to you,&rdquo; and Pauline swept from the  room and returned slowly down the stairway to the second floor.</p>
  <p>The sight of two police officers in the hall  gave her a sudden start. How had they appeared, so soon? And how dreadful to  see them in the palatial home that had heretofore housed only gentle-mannered  aristocrats and obsequious liveried servants! The men looked ill at ease as  they stood against the rich background of tapestry hangings and tropical palms,  but their faces showed a stern appreciation of their duty, and they looked at Pauline  with deferential but acute scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Not noticing them in any way, the girl, her head  held high, went straight to her aunt&rsquo;s room. Sergeant Flake was in charge, and  he refused her admission.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coroner&rsquo;s orders, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be  here himself shortly, and then you can see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come away, Pauline,&rdquo; and Haviland appeared and  took her by the arm; &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Anita?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left her in Estelle&rsquo;s room. Oh Gray, that  girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and gripping her firmly, Haviland led  her to a small sitting room and shut the door. &ldquo;Now listen, Pauline; mind what  I say. Don&rsquo;t give the least bit of information or express the slightest notion  of opinion except to the chief authorities. And not to them until they ask you.  This is a terrible affair, and a mighty strange one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did it, Gray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never you mind. Don&rsquo;t even ask questions. The  very walls have ears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who upset that breakfast tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Estelle, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She says she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She lies. Everybody will lie; why, Pauline, you  must lie yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it! I have no reason to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may find that you have. But, at least,  Pauline, I beg of you, that you will keep your mouth shut. There will be  developments soon,&mdash;there must be,&mdash;and then we will know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two returned to the boudoir. At first glance  it seemed to be full of men. The beautiful room, with its ornate but harmonious  furnishings and appointments of the Marie Antoinette period, was occupied with  eager representatives of the law and justice hunting for any indication of the ruthless  hand that had felled the owner of all that elegance.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was receiving the report of  Doctor Moore, who had arrived with him.</p>
  <p>Dr. Moore agreed with Dr. Stanton that the  deceased had been struck with a heavy weapon that had fractured the skull, but  he admitted the wounds showed some strange conditions which could only be  explained by further investigation.</p>
  <p>The Coroner was deep in thought as he studied  the face of the dead woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is most mysterious,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;that face  is almost smiling! it is the face of a happy woman. Clearly, she did not know  of her approaching fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The blow was struck from behind,&rdquo; informed Dr.  Moore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so, why didn&rsquo;t she see the approach of the  assailant in the mirror? She is looking straight into the large glass,&mdash;must  have been looking in it at the moment of her death. <i>Why</i> receive that death blow without a tremor of fear or even a  glance of startled inquiry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt stood by, gravely, and for the  most part silently, watching and listening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That might imply,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;that if  she did see the assailant, it was some one she knew, and of whom she had no  fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland looked up suddenly. A deep red  spread over his face and then, seeing himself narrowly watched by the  detectives present, he set his lips firmly together and said no word.</p>
  <p>Pauline turned white and trembled, but she too  said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why is she sitting in this large easy chair?&rdquo;  went on the Coroner; &ldquo;Is it not customary for ladies at their dressing tables  to use a light side-chair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This showed decidedly astute perception, and the  Inspector looked interestedly at the chair in question, which he had not  especially noticed before.</p>
  <p>Being tacitly appealed to by the Coroner&rsquo;s  inquiring eyes, Pauline replied: &ldquo;It is true that my aunt usually sat at her  dressing-table in a small chair,&mdash;that one, in fact,&rdquo; and she pointed to a  dainty chair of gilded cane. &ldquo;I have no idea why she should choose the heavy,  cushioned one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would seem,&rdquo; the Coroner mused, &ldquo;as if she  might have sat down there to admire the effect of her belongings rather than to  arrange her hair or toilette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Absorbedly, all present watched Coroner Scofield&rsquo;s  movements.</p>
  <p>It was true, the quietly reposeful attitude of  the still figure leaning back against the brocaded upholstery, and so evidently  looking in the great gold-framed mirror, was that of one admiring or  criticising her own appearance. Added to this, the fact of her bizarre costume  and strange adornments, it seemed certain that Miss Carrington had come to her  death while innocently happy in the feminine employment of dressing up in the elaborate  finery that she loved.</p>
  <p>But the snake!</p>
  <p>Carefully Coroner Scofield removed the  inexplicable thing. He held it up that all might see. A Japanese paper snake, a  cheap toy, such as is found together with fans and lanterns in the Oriental department  of large shops.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could this have been placed round her neck  after death?&rdquo; Scofield inquired of the doctors.</p>
  <p>The two physicians agreed, that though that was  possible, yet the appearance of the flesh beneath it seemed to indicate its  having encircled the throat during life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Pauline, excitedly. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have sat there and <i>smiled</i>, with a snake anywhere near her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would seem so,&rdquo; and Dr. Stanton nodded his  head. &ldquo;I well know of my late patient&rsquo;s aversion to snakes. It amounted almost  to a mania! It is not an uncommon one, many women feel the same, though seldom  to so great an extent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That deepens the mystery,&rdquo; said Coroner  Scofield; &ldquo;unless, indeed, the snake was put on after the crime. But that is  even more mysterious. I shall now remove these valuable jewels, and give them  to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked inquiringly at Haviland and Pauline,  and the latter immediately responded: &ldquo;Give them to me, Mr. Scofield. I am now  mistress here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haviland said nothing, but he looked at Pauline  as if in disapproval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this of great worth?&rdquo; inquired Scofield, as  he carefully removed the scarf from the shoulders it surrounded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only moderately so,&rdquo; returned Pauline. &ldquo;It is a  Syrian scarf and was sent to her by her nephew who lives in Egypt. It is not new,  he sent several to us about a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took the long, heavy, white and silver  drapery, and laid it in a nearby wardrobe. Then the Coroner unfastened the  large pearls from their place as eardrops, and taking up one lifeless hand  removed its rings. All these he handed to Pauline without a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly; and  opening the curled-up fingers of the other hand he drew forth a crumpled gray  object. It was a glove, of soft su&eacute;de, and so tightly had it been held that it  was deeply creased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s glove!&rdquo; said the Coroner, smoothing it  out. &ldquo;Will the wonders of this case never cease?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He scrutinized it, but remarking only that it  was of medium size and superior quality, he laid it carefully aside for the  time.</p>
  <p>From the same arm he removed the scarab  bracelet, also handing that to Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The lady was fond of Oriental jewelry,&rdquo; he  observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Haviland, before Pauline could  speak. &ldquo;Her nephew sent or brought home much of it. But, as we informed you,  Miss Carrington was also wearing pearls and diamonds of enormous value,  compared to which these trinkets are as nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But scarabs, I am told, are of great price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some are,&rdquo; returned Haviland. &ldquo;That bracelet,  however, is not genuine, nor of great value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the Coroner, with delicate touch, removed  the bits of broken tortoise-shell from the puffs of hair, and carefully laid  them together on a small silver tray he appropriated from the dressing-table  litter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Inspector Brunt, in his grave,  slow way, &ldquo;that it will be wise to photograph the whole picture from several  points of view before the autopsy is performed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Arrangements had been made for this, and  Detective Hardy, a young man from Headquarters, stepped forward with his  camera.</p>
  <p>As those who were asked to left the room,  Pauline and Gray went out together, and met Anita just outside in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me, Gray! Who did it? What does it all  mean?&rdquo; she cried, and grasped him by the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell her about it, Gray,&rdquo; said Pauline, and  leaving the two together, she went swiftly along the hall to her own room.</p>
  <p>The alert eyes of the guarding policemen  followed her, but also they followed the movements of every one else, and if  they had, as yet, any suspicions, no one knew of them.</p>
  <p>Meantime, the gruesome work of photography went  on.</p>
  <p>Surely never was such a strange subject for the  camera! Denuded of her jewels, but still robed in her gorgeous dressing-gown,  and still leaning back in her luxurious arm-chair, with that strange smile of  happy expectancy, Miss Lucy Carrington presented the same air of regal authority  she had always worn in life. Her eyes were widely staring, but there was no  trace or hint of fear in her peaceful attitude of repose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no solution!&rdquo; said Inspector Brunt,  deeply thoughtful. &ldquo;No one could or would crack a skull like that, but an  experienced and professional burglar and housebreaker. And such a one could  have but one motive, robbery, and the jewels were not stolen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inside job,&rdquo; observed Scofield, briefly, his  eyes on his work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe the burglar was frightened away at the  critical moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Whatever frightened him would be known to  some member of the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey? Have you a theory?&rdquo; and the Coroner looked  up suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything but! There&rsquo;s no <i>possible</i> theory that will fit the facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, except the truth. But it will be long  before we find that, I&rsquo;m afraid. It strikes me it&rsquo;s at the bottom of an  unusually deep well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d <i>better</i> find it. It&rsquo;d be a nice how d&rsquo;y&rsquo; do for you to fall down on <i>this</i> case!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no falling down been done yet. And it  may well be that the very fact of there being such strange and irreconcilable  conditions shall prove a help rather than a hindrance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, all being in readiness, the lifeless  form of Miss Carrington, once the proud domineering autocrat, now laid low, was  borne to a distant room, for the autopsy that might cast a further light on the  mystery of her tragic death.</p>

    A Man&rsquo;s Glove</b></h2>
  <p>Inspector Brunt and the young detective, Hardy,  were interviewing the members of the household in the library, and the task was  not an easy one. The two girls were distinctly at odds, and Gray Haviland,  whether authoritatively or not, persisted in assuming a major r&ocirc;le.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Haviland said, &ldquo;that it is the  most remarkable mystery that has ever occurred in the experience of you police  people. Now, I think the wisest plan is to call in a big detective,&mdash;no offence,  Mr. Hardy,&mdash;but I mean a noted fellow, like Stone, say, and let him get at the  root of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think, Gray,&rdquo; and Pauline looked very  haughty, &ldquo;that any such suggestion would come better from me. I am now mistress  of the place, and it is for me to say what we shall do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; and Haviland looked no whit  abashed, &ldquo;but you know Carr Loria is equally in authority, even if he isn&rsquo;t  here, and you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that Carr&rsquo;s absence gives <i>you</i> any authority!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it does, in a way. As Miss Lucy&rsquo;s man of  affairs, I ought to look out for the interests of her heirs, at least, for the  absent one. I&rsquo;m sure Loria would want to do everything possible to find the  murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has this nephew been notified yet?&rdquo; asked  Inspector Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Pauline; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve telephoned a  cablegram to the city to be sent to him in Egypt. But I don&rsquo;t know when he will  get it, nor when we&rsquo;ll get a response.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His permanent address is Cairo, but he is off  in the desert, or somewhere, so much that sometimes he is away from  communication for weeks at a time. Still I&rsquo;ve sent it, that&rsquo;s all I can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I made it rather long and circumstantial. I  told him of Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s death, and that she was killed by a blow on the head by  a burglar, which fractured her skull. I asked him if he would come home or if  we should go there. You see, we were intending to sail for Egypt in February.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who were?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myself, my aunt, Miss Frayne and Mr. Haviland.  Carrington Loria has been begging us to make the trip, and at last Aunt Lucy  decided to go. Our passage is engaged, and all plans made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I do not know. Everything is uncertain.  But if the burglar can be found, and punished, I see no reason why I, at least,  shouldn&rsquo;t go on and make the trip. The others must please themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at Anita and at Haviland with a  detached air, as if now they were no longer members of the household, and their  plans did not concern her.</p>
  <p>Not so Haviland. &ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I  fancy Carr will be mighty glad to keep me on in the same capacity I served Miss  Carrington. He&rsquo;ll need a representative in this country. I doubt he&rsquo;ll come  over,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need, if I look after all business matters for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does he do in Egypt?&rdquo; asked the Inspector,  who was half engrossed looking over his memoranda, and really took slight  interest in the absent heir.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s excavating wonderful temples and things,&rdquo;  volunteered Anita, for Pauline and Gray were looking, amazed, at a man who came  into the room. He was the detective who had been left in charge of the boudoir,  and he carried a strange-looking object.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> it?&rdquo; cried Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a black-jack.&rdquo; replied the detective. &ldquo;I  found it, Inspector, just under the edge of the tassel trimmin&rsquo; of the lounge.  The fellow slung it away, and it hid under the fringe, out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gravely, Inspector Brunt took the weapon. It was  rudely made, of black cloth, a mere bag, long and narrow, and filled with bird  shot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the weapon!&rdquo; declared Brunt. &ldquo;A man  could hit a blow with that thing that would break the skull without cutting the  skin. Yes, there is no further doubt that Miss Carrington was murdered by a  burglar. This is a burglar&rsquo;s weapon; this it was that crushed the shell comb to  fragments, and fractured the skull, leaving the body sitting upright, and unmutilated.  Death was, of course, instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the jewels!&rdquo; said Detective Hardy,  wonderingly; &ldquo;why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know </i>why!&rdquo; said Brunt, a little testily; &ldquo;that is for you detectives to find  out. I have to go by what evidence I find. Can I find a broken skull and a  black-jack in the same room and not deduce a burglarious assault that proved  fatal? The thief may have been scared off or decided he didn&rsquo;t want the loot,  but that doesn&rsquo;t affect the certainty that we have the weapon and therefore the  case is a simple one. That burglar can be found, without a doubt. Then we shall  learn <i>why</i> he didn&rsquo;t steal the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the snake?&rdquo; said Pauline, looking  wonderingly at the Inspector; &ldquo;the burglar must have been a maniac or an  eccentric to put that snake round my aunt&rsquo;s neck after he killed her,&mdash;and nothing  will ever make me believe that she allowed it there while alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; put in Haviland; &ldquo;the whole  affair is so inexplicable,&mdash;excuse me, Mr. Brunt, but I can&rsquo;t think it such a  simple case as you do,&mdash;that I think we should engage expert skill to solve the mysteries  of it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That must come later,&rdquo; and Inspector Brunt  resumed his usual gravity of manner which had been disturbed by the discovery  of the black-jack. &ldquo;Will you now please give me some detailed information as to  the circumstances? Is the house always securely locked at night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very much so,&rdquo; answered Haviland; &ldquo;Miss  Carrington was not overly timid, but she always insisted on careful precautions  against burglary. She had a house full of valuable furniture, curios, and art  works besides her personal belongings. Yes, the house was always supposed to be  carefully locked and bolted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose duty is it to look after it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The butler Haskins, and his wife, who is the  cook, had all such matters in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will interview them later. Now please tell  me, any of you, why Miss Carrington was arrayed in such peculiar fashion, last  evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;My aunt was  not a vain woman. I have never known her to sit before a mirror, except when  necessary, to have her hair dressed. It is almost unbelievable that she should  deliberately don those jewels and scarf and sit down there as if to admire the  effect. Yet it had that appearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she wore the jewels during the evening, did  she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all of them. She wore her pearls, because,  as she told us, and as I have often heard her say, pearls must be worn  occasionally to keep them in condition. But she added a large number of  valuable gems&mdash;or, some one did,&mdash;after we left her last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean by we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne and myself. We were in her room, to  say good-night to her, and we left at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About quarter past twelve, I should think, wasn&rsquo;t  it, Anita? We went upstairs about midnight, and were with my aunt ten or  fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were your good-nights amicable?&rdquo; asked the  Inspector, and Pauline looked up in surprise. Then, recollecting the last words  of her aunt, she shut her lips obstinately and made no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, they were not!&rdquo; declared Miss Frayne; &ldquo;Miss  Carrington told both Miss Stuart and myself that it would be our last night  beneath this roof! That to-day we must seek some other home, for she would  harbor us no longer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! And why did she thus treat you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no especial reason,&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s  lovely blue eyes looked straight at the Inspector with a pathetic gaze, &ldquo;she  was in a tantrum, as she frequently was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; put in Pauline, hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo; asseverated Anita; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard her  threaten to send us away before, but never so earnestly. She meant it last  night, I am sure. And, too, she knew something would happen to her last night,&mdash;she  said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do hush, Anita!&rdquo; said Pauline; &ldquo;those foolish  words meant nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed, Miss Frayne,&rdquo; and the Inspector spoke  sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; went on Anita. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the  exact words, but she said I little knew what was going to happen to her, and  she said &lsquo;to-morrow you may sing another song!&rsquo; Surely such words meant  something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If they did,&rdquo; said Pauline, angrily, &ldquo;they  merely meant that she was going to dismiss you to-day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; and Anita glanced at her, &ldquo;she  distinctly said something would happen to her,&mdash;not to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">&ldquo;You know better than to  take things she said in a temper, seriously! If we are to repeat idle conversations,  suppose I say that I heard you say last evening that you&rsquo;d like to kill her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shrieked Anita.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; declared Pauline, calmly; &ldquo;and Gray  said she ought to be killed, too. I know you didn&rsquo;t mean to kill her, but I&rsquo;ve  just as much right to quote your foolish words as you have to quote hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Haviland; &ldquo;let up, Polly! You  two are always at each other! As there is no question as to who killed poor  Miss Lucy, why rake up our foolish words spoken under the intense provocation  of her exhibition of temper,&mdash;which was specially trying last night. Inspector, can  we tell you anything more of importance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far the Inspector had been almost silent, and  appeared to be learning some points from the conversation not addressed to him.  Now, he changed his manner, and began briskly to ask questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This glove,&rdquo; he said, holding it out, &ldquo;was, as  you know, found clasped in her hand. Is it yours, Mr. Haviland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man, as, after a close  examination of the glove he handed it back; &ldquo;no, it is a size smaller than I  wear, and it is of a different make from mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you any idea whose it can be? It is highly  improbable the burglar left it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea,&rdquo; and Haviland shrugged his  shoulders. &ldquo;But if it was not left by the intruder, where could it possibly  have come from? It is a man&rsquo;s glove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could it be one of Cousin Carr&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said  Pauline. &ldquo;Aunt Lucy was awfully fond of anything of his. She kept one of his  caps in her drawer for months, after he left the last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Haviland; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t Loria&rsquo;s. He  wears larger gloves than I do. My theory points to a sort of gentleman burglar,  a &lsquo;Raffles,&rsquo; you know, and I think he talked with Miss Lucy, before he struck  that blow, and disarmed her mind of fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary idea!&rdquo; and Pauline looked  thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how else explain the glove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the snake? Did your gentleman burglar  persuade her to wear that paper thing? Never! Gray, you&rsquo;re absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; went on Inspector Brunt,  returning the glove to his roomy pocket-book; &ldquo;In the bedroom we noticed a  glass of milk and beside it an empty plate. Was it the lady&rsquo;s habit to have a  night lunch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anita; &ldquo;but she rarely ate it. In  case of insomnia, she had ready a light repast, but she almost never touched  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The glass of milk is still untouched,&rdquo; said  Brunt, &ldquo;but the plate is empty. What did it contain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A sandwich, I think,&rdquo; said Anita. &ldquo;That is what  Estelle usually prepared for her. She will know,&mdash;Estelle, the maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Carrington&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; though not hers exclusively. She was  expected to act as maid for Miss Stuart and myself also, at such times as Miss  Carrington didn&rsquo;t require her services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she, then, brought the breakfast tray, that  is upset on the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; Miss Lucy always had an early cup of tea,  before she dressed for breakfast with the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the maid took it to her this morning? Did  she not then discover the&mdash;the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She says not!&rdquo; cried Pauline; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure she  did! She says she saw Miss Lucy at the mirror, and thinking her engrossed,  merely left the tray on the tabouret and went away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; exclaimed Haviland; &ldquo;What does  Estelle mean by such lies? Of course she saw Miss Carrington&rsquo;s strange  appearance, of course she was frightened out of her wits, and of course she  dropped the tray and ran. But why not say so? And why not give an immediate  alarm? She took that tray, probably, about eight. Pauline went up at nine. What  was Estelle doing all that time? Why didn&rsquo;t she go in to dress Miss Carrington?  I tell you, Mr. Inspector, there&rsquo;s a lot of queer work to be explained, and with  all due respect to the force, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;ll need expert service if you&rsquo;re  going to get anywhere. And I&rsquo;m sure, too, that if we can get word to Carrington  Loria and back, he&rsquo;ll say spare no trouble or expense to avenge his aunt&rsquo;s  murder. He is equally heir with you, Pauline, and he ought to be consulted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The will hasn&rsquo;t been read yet,&rdquo; said Miss  Stuart; &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t assume anything until that is done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw! you know perfectly well half of the bulk  of the estate is yours and half Carr&rsquo;s. I have a small slice and Miss Frayne a  bit. The older servants have small legacies, and there are a few charities.  That, Mr. Brunt, is the gist of the will. Do you not agree with me, that as I  was the man of business for the late Miss Carrington, I am justified, in the absence  of Mr. Loria, in continuing my services, at least, until we can get definite  directions from him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those matters are outside my province, Mr. Haviland.  Miss Carrington&rsquo;s legal advisers will doubtless come here soon, and such things  will be decided by them. Now, here&rsquo;s another point. I noted in the course of  our investigation in the boudoir a quantity of powder fallen on the floor near  the dressing table, in such relation to it that it would seem Miss Carrington  was using the face powder as she sat there. Was this her habit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her habit? Yes;&rdquo; said Anita, &ldquo;Miss Carrington  was in the habit of using face powder,&mdash;even cosmetics. It is not strange then, that  such a proceeding was part of her night toilette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Brunt. &ldquo;But where  the powder was thickest, on the hard floor, near the rug, was a muddled spot,  as if some one had wiped out or swept up a mark or print. Can any of you explain  this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one spoke, and the stern voice went on. &ldquo;I  remember, Miss Stuart, that you began to say something bearing on this while we  were in that room, and you suddenly stopped, appearing confused. I ask you why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated, bit her lip, looked at Gray  and then at Anita, and finally said, &ldquo;I may as well tell. It is nothing. When I  went to my aunt&rsquo;s room, and found what I did find,&mdash;I was so excited and nervous  I scarce knew what I did. But I remember seeing a footprint in that powder, and  in obedience to an impulsive instinct I&mdash;I obliterated it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With my handkerchief. I merely slapped at it,  and the light powder flew about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did you do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I had no real reason. I was not  thinking of what I was doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you did not have a desire to shield some  one from possible suspicion?&rdquo; The words were shot at her so swiftly that  Pauline gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspicion! What do you mean? Was it not the  work of a burglar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was the impression of a foot that you saw, the  foot of a man or a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I tell? It was large, but as it was a  bare or stockinged foot I could not judge. Might not the burglar have removed  his boots, before entering the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He might, indeed, and that is just what he did  do. For more prints of that stockinged foot have been discovered on the stairs,  and there is no doubt that the tracks are those of the assailant of Miss  Carrington. With your permission, Miss Stuart, I will now go to interview the  servants. May I ask you to await me here, all of you? I shall not be very long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the Inspector and the detectives left the  room, Haskins appeared to announce Mrs. Frothingham and Count Henri Charlier.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>VI <br>
    A Neighbor&rsquo;s Call</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, is it not terrible? What <i>can</i> I say to comfort you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham&rsquo;s distressed tones and her air  of eager, intense sympathy met with little response from Pauline.</p>
  <p>Haviland had been called from the room on an  errand and Anita&rsquo;s willingness to receive the neighbor&rsquo;s condolences did not  seem acceptable. The overdressed, forward-mannered widow continued to direct her  attention entirely to Pauline, and that young woman merely surveyed her visitor  coolly and replied in monosyllables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said, and her icy air would have  deterred a less determined intruder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t help running over as soon as  I heard the dreadful news. For we are neighbors after all, though not so very  well acquainted; and neighbors have a camaraderie of their own, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Pauline, and her eyelids fell  slightly, with an expression of boredness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Mrs. Frothingham rattled on; &ldquo;and  I said to our dear Count, we must run over at once, there may be something we  can do for the saddened ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you;&rdquo; and had a marble statue been given  vocal powers the effect would have been much the same.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; continued the unabashed visitor, &ldquo;I  know how overcome you must be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not overcome at all,&rdquo; said Pauline,  rising, and determined to hear no more; &ldquo;and I must beg to be excused, Mrs.  Frothingham, as I have many matters to attend to this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course, you have. We will not  detain you. The Count and I merely called for a moment to inquire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I quite understand. Miss Frayne will be  pleased to answer your inquiries. Thank you both, and&mdash;good-morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a polite but distant bow, Pauline left the  room, and as Count Charlier sprang to hold the door open for her, he, after a  moment&rsquo;s hesitation, followed her out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A moment, I beg, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; he said as they  reached the hall; &ldquo;You are offended at Mrs. Frothingham&rsquo;s intrusion, but have I  not a right to call? Was I not such a friend of Miss Carrington as to justify  this tribute of respect to her memory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, Count,&rdquo; and Pauline grew a shade  kinder, &ldquo;but I am not sufficiently acquainted with your friend to receive her  visits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, no. That is conceded. But, I pray you, tell  me of the sad affair. I have heard no details,&mdash;that is, unless you would rather  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I am not unwilling. You were a good friend  of Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s&mdash;she was fond of you, and I am glad to talk to some one. Let us  sit here.&rdquo; Pauline indicated a recessed seat in the hall and the pair sat  there. She recounted briefly the story of the tragedy and the Count was duly sympathetic.  Pauline watched him closely, and discerned great interest but little grief or  sorrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A burglar, of course,&rdquo; said the Count hearing  of the cruel weapon. &ldquo;How <i>could</i> any  one attack the charming lady! And the marvelous jewels she wore! They were, of  course, stolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s the strange part. They were not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, how splendid!&rdquo; and his absorbed air of  satisfaction gave Pauline a thrill of disgust at his cold-bloodedness. &ldquo;And now  they are all yours? Those magnificent gems?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The property, most of it, is divided between my  cousin and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your cousin? Mr. Haviland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; he is but a distant connection. I mean my  first cousin, Mr. Loria, now in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I have heard Miss Carrington refer to  him. He will come home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. We have cabled of course. Count  Charlier, do you remember hearing my aunt say, last evening, that she expected  something to happen to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember, Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you any idea what she meant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I? But how could I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Answer my question, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Count&rsquo;s eyes fell, and he shifted his feet  about uneasily. At last he said: &ldquo;It is not pleasant to say such things, but  since you ask, I may be permitted to assume that the late Miss Carrington had a  regard for my humble self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she expected, she&mdash;hoped that her regard  might be returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that last night you might tell her so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You honor me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you tell her so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not, Miss Stuart. What might have  happened had she lived I cannot say, but I did not, last evening, say any word  to Miss Carrington of my aspiration to her hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you say anything that could have been taken  as a hint that some time, say, in the near future, you might express such an  aspiration?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Count Charlier. I had perhaps no  right to ask, but you have answered my rather impertinent questions  straightforwardly, and I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline rose, as if to end the interview. In the  doorway appeared Anita. &ldquo;Pauline,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wish you would come back and  listen to Mrs. Frothingham&rsquo;s story. It seems to me of decided importance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have something to tell me?&rdquo; asked Pauline,  returning to the library and looking at the unwelcome neighbor with patient  tolerance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Stuart. Now, it may be nothing,&mdash;nothing,  I mean, of consequence, that is, you may not think so, but I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose you let me hear it and judge for  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, it&rsquo;s only this. I was wakeful last  night, or rather early this morning, and looking from my bedroom window, which  faces this house, I saw a man climb out of a window on the first floor and  skulk away among the shrubbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time was this?&rdquo; and Pauline looked  interested at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About four o&rsquo;clock. He was to all appearances a  burglar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could you tell? Was it not dark at that  hour in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the moon is past full, you know, and it  shone brightly in the western sky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough for you to discern the man clearly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I took a field-glass to assist my vision. He  stealthily climbed out and skirting the bushes made his way swiftly toward the  great gates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is indeed an important bit of information,  Mrs. Frothingham; I dare say you ought to tell it to the police who are here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m so timid about such things!  But,&mdash;if you would go with me, Miss Stuart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne will go with you,&rdquo; said Pauline,  coolly; &ldquo;You will find a policeman in the hall who will direct you where to  find the Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without another word Pauline bowed in a way to  include the lady and the Count also, and went away to her own room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stuck-up thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Frothingham,  and Anita nodded her golden head in agreement.</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt instructed Hardy to hear the  story of Mrs. Frothingham, and he devoted his own attention to Count Charlier,  of whom he had heard as being a friend of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>He quizzed the Frenchman rather pointedly as to  his friendship with the unfortunate lady and the Count became decidedly ill at  ease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me so much?&rdquo; he objected; &ldquo;I was  a friend, yes; I may have aspired to a nearer relation, yes? That is no crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all, Count,&rdquo; said Mr. Brunt; &ldquo;I only  want to find out if Miss Carrington&rsquo;s strange reference to something about to  happen to her could have had any reference to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It might be so; I cannot say. But all that has  no bearing on the poor lady&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. At what time did you go away from here,  Count Charlier?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At about midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You went directly home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Mrs. Frothingham&rsquo;s, where I am a house  guest, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you retired?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And remained in your bed till morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But of a certainty, yes! What are you implying?  That I had a hand in this affair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no; be calm, my dear sir. I ask you but one  question. Is this your glove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Inspector took the glove from his pocket and  offered it to the Count.</p>
  <p>The Frenchman took it, examined it minutely and  without haste.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, returning it; &ldquo;that is not  my property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, that is all,&rdquo; and the Inspector put  the glove back in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no doubt as to the main facts,&rdquo; said  the Inspector, a half hour later, as, with the members of the family he summed  up what had been found out from all known sources. &ldquo;The assailant was most  certainly a burglarious intruder; the weapon, this &lsquo;black-jack&rsquo;; the motive,  robbery. Why the robbery was not achieved and what is the meaning of the unexplained  circumstances of the whole affair, we do not yet know. They are matters to be  investigated, but they cannot greatly affect the principal conditions. You may  be thankful, Miss Stuart, that the sad death of your aunt was undoubtedly  painless; and also that the thief did not succeed in his attempt to purloin the  valuable gems.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Inspector&rsquo;s speech might seem cold-hearted,  but Brunt was a practical man, and he was truly glad for himself that in addition  to finding the murderer he did not also have to recover a fortune of rare  jewels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;as to the maid, Estelle. I  have talked with her, but she is so hysterical and her stories so  contradictory, that I am inclined to the opinion that she has some sort of  guilty knowledge or at least suspicion of the intruder. The man was  stocking-footed, and it is a pity, Miss Stuart, that you erased that footprint  on the floor! But it would have been of doubtful use, I dare say. We have found  faint tracks of the powder on the steps of the staircase, and though the last  ones are almost indiscernible they seem to lead through the butler&rsquo;s pantry,  and to an exit by that window. But the window was found fastened this morning,  so, if it was used as a means for the burglar&rsquo;s getaway, it must have been fastened  afterward by some person inside. Could this person have been the maid, Estelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure it could!&rdquo; exclaimed Haviland, who was an  interested listener. &ldquo;That girl is a sly one! I caught her this morning, trying  to take away that glass of milk. I told her to let it alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Inspector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I thought if she wanted to get it away,  there must be some reason for her to want it! What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; and Anita looked scornfully at Gray;  &ldquo;naturally, Estelle would do up the rooms, and would, of course, remove the  remains of Miss Lucy&rsquo;s night luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; said Haviland,  triumphantly: &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t take the plate that had had sandwiches on it! If she  had, I should have thought nothing of it. But she took the glass of milk, in a  furtive, stealthy way, that made me look at her. She turned red, and trembled,  and I told her to set the glass down. She pretended not to hear, so I told her again.  Then she obeyed. But she glared at me like a tigress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, rubbish!&rdquo; said Anita. &ldquo;She was annoyed at  being interfered with in her work, and perhaps fearful of being censured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Haviland, &ldquo;then there&rsquo;s no  harm done. If that girl is entirely innocent, what I said won&rsquo;t hurt her. But  she looked to me as if on a secret errand and a desperate one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What puzzles me is,&rdquo; mused the Inspector, &ldquo;why  she persists in saying that she left the tray in good order in the room,&mdash;though  it was discovered an hour later, upset,&mdash;when we know that Miss Carrington had been  dead since, at least, two or three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Inspector,&rdquo; and Haviland frowned, &ldquo;if  the murder was committed at two or three o&rsquo;clock, how is it that Mrs.  Frothingham saw the intruder escaping at four or later?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a discrepancy there,&rdquo; admitted Brunt, &ldquo;but  it may be explained away. The doctors cannot be sure until the autopsy is  completed of the exact hour of death, and, too, the lady next door may have  made an error in time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll inform you that Estelle did upset  that tray herself,&rdquo; said Pauline with an air of finality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; and Inspector Brunt peered at  her over his glasses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was while Gray was telephoning for the  doctor,&rdquo; said Pauline, reminiscently, &ldquo;that I looked carefully at that overturned  tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Haviland, &ldquo;I told you not to  touch anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, but I did. I picked up from the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, this;&rdquo; and Pauline held up to  view a tiny hairpin of the sort called &lsquo;invisible.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Estelle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;see, it is the  glistening bronze color of her hair. Anita has gold-colored ones, and I do not  use these fine wire ones. I use only shell. Moreover, I know this is Estelle&rsquo;s,&mdash;don&rsquo;t  you, Anita?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is. And its presence there, on the tray,  proves that she let the tray fall in her surprise at seeing Aunt Lucy, and in  her trembling excitement loosened and dropped this hairpin. Doubtless, she  flung her hand up to her head&mdash;a not unusual gesture of hers&mdash;and so dislodged  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brunt looked closely at the speaker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got  it all fixed up, haven&rsquo;t you, Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline flushed slightly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;fix it up,&rsquo;  as you call it, but I did gather, from what I saw, that the truth must be as I  have stated; and in my anxiety to learn anything possible as to the mystery of  this crime, I secured what may or may not be a bit of evidence. As Mr. Haviland  has said, if Estelle is entirely innocent of any complicity in the matter, these  things can&rsquo;t hurt her. But it would scarcely be possible for her to have been  so careless as to drop a hairpin on the tray without noticing it, if she were  not startled and flurried by something that took her mind and eyes entirely  away from her duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you are purposely making a great deal  out of nothing,&rdquo; remarked Anita; &ldquo;it seems unfair, to say the least, to condemn  the poor girl on such trifling evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The talk was interrupted by the entrance of the  Coroner and the two doctors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is found,&rdquo; said Coroner Scofield, &ldquo;that the  cause of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s death was not the blow on the head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Inspector looked his amazement, and the  others sat with receptively blank countenances waiting further disclosures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; went on Scofield, &ldquo;we find in the stomach  unmistakable traces of poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; It was Anita&rsquo;s frightened whisper; &ldquo;who  would poison her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What kind of poison?&rdquo; asked Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aconitine; deadly and sure. It leaves little  trace, but certain tests reveal it beyond all doubt. That is why we have been  so long. The tests are difficult of performance. But, it is over, and we report  that Miss Lucy Carrington was poisoned by aconitine, administered either by her  own hand or another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she never would poison herself!&rdquo; cried  Anita; &ldquo;who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the blow on the head?&rdquo; said Inspector  Brunt, looking deeply perplexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her death, from poison, occurred at or near two  o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; asserted the Coroner; &ldquo;the blow on the head was given after life had  departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo; said Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, indeed, Inspector. But those are the  facts. The heavy blow fractured the skull, but left no bruise or mark, nor was  there any blood from the cut scalp. In addition we have the poison found in the  system, and the death symptoms of quiet, placid dissolution which are  consequent always on that particular poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could it have been self-administered?&rdquo; asked  Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not by Miss Carrington,&rdquo; said Doctor Stanton,  decidedly. &ldquo;The lady has been my patient for years, and she had an absolute  abhorrence of all sorts of drugs or medicines. She made more fuss over taking a  simple powder than a spoiled child. I have often prescribed for her, knowing full  well she would not take my prescriptions because of her detestation of taking  medicine. When remedies have been really necessary, I have had to administer  them while with her, and a difficult task it was. Moreover, my patient was not  of the temperament or disposition to seek death for herself, nor had she any  reason to do so. No; the case is murder; the poison was administered by some  one who wished for her death and deliberately set out to accomplish it,&mdash;and  succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is the action of this poison instantaneous?&rdquo;  asked Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; death ensues about a half hour to an hour  after the dose is taken into the system.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, we gather that the poison was taken in  the neighborhood of one o&rsquo;clock, last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the Coroner, &ldquo;about one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About one o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; whispered Anita, in an  awe-struck, gasping way, and her great blue eyes stared dazedly into the dark  ones of Pauline.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>VII<br>
    The Inquest</b></h2>
  <p>Next morning the inquest was proceeding. The  great living-room at Garden Steps was crowded with listeners, drawn hither by  sympathy, interest or curiosity. And each class found ample to satisfy its  motive. The mere fact of being within that exclusive home, within those  heretofore inaccessible doors, was enough to thrill and delight many, and observation  and scrutiny were as well repaid as was the listening to the astounding  revelations that were poured into their ears.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield&rsquo;s jury was composed of  intelligent men, who were eagerly receptive to the appalling facts narrated to  them and the curiously bizarre bits of evidence that became known as the  witnesses were questioned.</p>
  <p>Dr. Stanton told of his being called to the  house, and his discoveries and conclusions. He admitted that he assumed death  was caused by the blow on the head, but claimed that it was a pardonable error  in view of the fact that such a blow had been given. He affirmed, and Dr. Moore  corroborated it, that the autopsy showed that death was caused by aconitine  poison, administered, either by the deceased or another, at an hour not earlier  than one o&rsquo;clock, and probably soon thereafter. The terrible blow that had  fractured the skull had been given after life had been for some time extinct.</p>
  <p>Dr. Stanton asserted emphatically his late  patient&rsquo;s detestation of drugs or medicines of any sort, adducing thereby the  extreme improbability of the poison having been self-administered. Moreover,  the temperament and disposition of the late Miss Carrington entirely evinced a  love of life and desire to prolong it by means of any device or assistance the  doctor might give.</p>
  <p>Pauline was called next, and a little flutter of  excitement in the audience greeted her appearance.</p>
  <p>Exceedingly dignified, but of a sweet, gracious  mien, she at once received the silent approval of the crowd. Her black gown,  its collar of sheer white organdy slightly open at the throat, well suited her  pale, beautiful face and her dark hair and eyes. To-day, her eyes seemed fathomless.  At times, gazing intently at the Coroner until they almost disconcerted him;  and then, hidden by veiling lids, whose long lashes fell suddenly, as if to  conceal further disclosures.</p>
  <p>On the whole, Pauline was not a satisfactory  witness. She told, in most straightforward way, of leaving the breakfast table  to go to her aunt&rsquo;s room and of finding there the dead body. She told clearly  all the circumstances of the upset tray, the spilled powder and the eccentric garb  of Miss Carrington herself. But questions as to her opinion of these facts  brought little response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You left Miss Carrington at half-past twelve?&rdquo;  asked Coroner Scofield.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so late, I think,&rdquo; returned Pauline; &ldquo;probably  at quarter or twenty minutes past twelve,&mdash;I am not sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How was she then dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the gown she had worn during the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And her jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I left my aunt, she was wearing her pearls  and the other jewelry she had worn with her evening dress. Some brooches and  rings and bracelets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not so much as she had on when you  discovered her in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not nearly so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you account for this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t account for it. To me it is exceedingly  mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the paper snake round her neck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no idea by whom such a thing could have  been brought to my aunt. But I am positive she never put it on herself. Nor can  I think she would allow it to come near her if she were alive,&mdash;or conscious,&mdash;or,  had power to scream for help. Any one knowing my aunt&rsquo;s fear and horror of anything  reptilian will agree to this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems evident,&rdquo; said the Coroner,  thoughtfully, &ldquo;that some intruder entered Miss Carrington&rsquo;s room, at or near  one o&rsquo;clock. That this intruder in some manner induced Miss Carrington to  swallow the poison, whether conscious of her act or not. That the intruder  subsequently, and for some reason, placed the snake round the neck of the  victim, and, later still, brutally gave her a stunning blow with the black-jack  which was found, and thereby fractured her skull. Granting these assumptions, can  you, Miss Stuart, give us any information that would lead to discovery of the  hand that wrought this havoc?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not any,&rdquo; and Pauline raised her great eyes a  moment to Scofield&rsquo;s face and slowly dropped them again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then can you not express an opinion or suggest  a theory that might account for such strange happenings, at least, in part?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pauline, slowly; &ldquo;I have no idea, nor  can I imagine why my aunt should be so elaborately arrayed and seated in an  easy chair in front of her mirror. It is contrary to all her customs or habits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could she have been killed first and could the  jewels and adornments have been added afterward?&rdquo; asked the Coroner of the  doctors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dr. Moore; &ldquo;the whole condition of  the body and clothing make such a theory practically impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; added Dr. Stanton; &ldquo;and,  too, what would be the sense of such a proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are establishing the facts of the  proceedings, not the sense of them,&rdquo; returned the Coroner, a little testily,  for he was at his wits&rsquo; end even to make a beginning in this strange case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we have the facts and  the approximate time of the crime; have you, Miss Stuart, any suspicion of who  the murderer can be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The question was shot out suddenly. If its  intent was to startle the witness, it certainly succeeded. Pauline Stuart  turned even whiter than she had been, and she caught her breath quickly and  audibly as she flashed a frightened glance at Gray Haviland. It was by no means  an accusing glance, though many who saw it, eager for a direction in which to  cast their suspicions, took it for such.</p>
  <p>But Pauline controlled herself immediately. &ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;That is, I can have no suspicion of the murderer&rsquo;s  identity. It was, of course, a midnight intruder, of the criminal class. I have  no individual acquaintances who use or possess the weapon that was employed in  this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The black-jack is an auxiliary only. The poison  may have been administered by one not versed in the ways of professional  criminals. You admit that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is no doubt true,&rdquo; said Pauline, icily, &ldquo;that  poison may be given by a person not belonging to the criminal classes. I fail  to see, however, how that fact affects the matter in hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may well affect it. Since Miss Carrington  was killed by a deadly poison, we must conclude that the black-jack assault was  made with the intention of concealing the poisoning and making it appear that  the blow caused the death. There seems to me no other way to account for the conditions  that confront us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A silence followed this. Its truth was patent to  everybody. Clearly, the poisoner had delivered the blow, for no one else would  attack a victim already dead. And a plausible reason would be the hope that the  poisoning would pass unnoticed in view of the other apparent cause of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it points to the work of an amateur,&rdquo; went  on Scofield; &ldquo;a professional criminal would know that the autopsy would  disclose the earlier crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline lost her nerve. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything  about it!&rdquo; she cried, and sank back into her seat, her face buried in her  hands.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was a man of tact. &ldquo;It is  entirely natural, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this thought should overcome  you. But we must realize the fact that the theory of a professional burglar is  practically untenable, because nothing was stolen. A burglar&rsquo;s motive could be  only robbery, and this did not take place. Nor can we think that a burglar was frightened  away, before he could appropriate the jewels. For, after giving the poison, and  before the blow was given, sufficient time elapsed for a successful getaway to  be made. Nor would the burglar have been at pains to cover up his poisoning  work, for having achieved his end, he would have secured his booty and made  escape. So, it is evident that the motive, not being robbery, is as yet  unknown, and may be obscure and complicated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What could it have been?&rdquo; asked Pauline, her  composure regained, her voice low and even.</p>
  <p>Scofield looked at her. &ldquo;It is said, Miss  Stuart, that the only motives for murder are love, revenge or gain. Can you  imagine any one of these directed toward your aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline replied tranquilly. Evidently she had  fully recovered her poise. &ldquo;I can think of no one who could have killed my aunt  for love; it is improbable that she has ever done any one such wrong as to call  for such a deed in revenge; as to gain, if you mean pecuniary gain, all the legatees  mentioned in her will may be said to have that motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline&rsquo;s manner and tones were so impersonal,  so scathingly ironic as to amount to a disclaimer for all the legatees. Her way  of suggesting it made it seem so far removed from possibility that it was far  more emphatic than any denial could have been.</p>
  <p>But Coroner Scofield was as unmoved as his  witness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he said coolly; &ldquo;and therefore  inquiries must be made. Did you, Miss Stuart, after leaving your aunt soon  after midnight see or hear anything unusual or suspicious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by unusual or suspicious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean did you see or hear anything, anything  at all, that you could not explain to yourself as being in any way connected  with the tragedy we are investigating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before answering, Pauline looked in turn at all  the members of the household. Haviland slowly turned his head as if to look at  something across the room, and as slowly brought it back to its previous position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Pauline, looking straight at  the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Scofield, briefly, and the  next witness was called.</p>
  <p>This was the maid, Estelle. Her eyes were red  with weeping, but she was not hysterical now, or incoherent. She answered  tersely questions as to Miss Carrington&rsquo;s habits and as to her words and  actions during the maid&rsquo;s last interview with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left her at about quarter of one,&rdquo; the  witness deposed; &ldquo;I had given her the Oriental neglig&eacute;e, of which she is fond.  I offered to take down her hair and put away her jewels, but she declined those  services, and bade me leave her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was wearing, when you left her, only the  jewels she had worn during the evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only those, sir. When I changed her evening  gown for the boudoir robe, she bade me replace such jewels as I had already  taken off her. She kept on her rings, bracelets and her long rope of pearls  while I changed her costume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then she dismissed you for the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was she then? Sitting before the mirror?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. She stood in the middle of the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was she in an amiable mood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was not. Because I offered to assist her  further, she ordered me from the room in anger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, in anger! Was Miss Carrington often angry  with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes; as she was with everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confine your answers to your own experience.  You prepared a night luncheon for your mistress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and now Estelle&rsquo;s voice trembled and  her eyes rolled apprehensively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two small sandwiches and a glass of milk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sort of sandwiches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caviare, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. And why did you put a large dose of  bromide in the glass of milk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did it kill her?&rdquo; and Estelle screamed out her  query. Pauline and Anita looked at one another. It was the same question Estelle  had asked of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An overdose of bromide may be fatal,&rdquo; parried  the Coroner, not answering the question directly. &ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; and the French girl shrugged  her shoulders; &ldquo;why should I poison my mistress? She was quick-tempered, but I  was used to that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid,&rdquo; said the Coroner; &ldquo;the  bromide didn&rsquo;t poison Miss Carrington, for, in the first place, she didn&rsquo;t take  it. The glass of milk was found next morning untouched, though the sandwiches  were gone. Therefore, the bromide in the milk was found. Why did you put it in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; reiterated the maid. &ldquo;Look higher up for that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mention no names, but somebody must have done  it, if bromide was found in that milk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you tried to get the glass away next  morning, without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who says I did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that; you were seen. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, if I thought anybody was going to  get into trouble because of it, I was only too glad to help, if I could, by  removing it before it was noticed.&rdquo; Estelle spoke slowly, as if weighing her  words, and her furtive glances at Pauline bore only one significance. It was  palpably apparent that she suspected Miss Stuart of the deed, and out of  kindness had tried to remove the incriminating evidence.</p>
  <p>Pauline stared at her with a glance that went  through her or over her or around her, but gave not the slightest attention to  the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you put bromide in your aunt&rsquo;s glass of  milk, Miss Stuart?&rdquo; asked the Coroner, and Pauline said, calmly, &ldquo;Certainly  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Scofield sighed. It was a difficult matter  to get at the truth when the witnesses were clever women, in whose veracity he  had not complete confidence.</p>
  <p>He gave up Estelle for the moment, and called  Gray Haviland.</p>
  <p>The young man&rsquo;s appearance gave every promise of  frankness and sincerity. He detailed the circumstances precisely as Pauline had  told them. He denied having heard or seen anything suspicious during the night.  He referred to the Coroner&rsquo;s list of motives for crime, and added that he agreed  with Miss Stuart that the present case could scarcely be ascribed to love or  revenge. If the murder was committed for gain, it was, of course, a formal  necessity to question all the beneficiaries of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s will, but he  was sure that all such inheritors were quite willing to be questioned. For his  part, he believed that the criminal was some enemy of Miss Carrington, unknown  to her immediate household, and he suggested that such a one be searched for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that glove,&rdquo; he reminded, &ldquo;that was  found clasped in the hand of the murdered woman. Why not trace that; or  endeavor to learn in some way the reason for the many peculiar circumstances;  or discover, at least, a way to look for further evidence; rather than to  vaguely suspect those who lived under Miss Carrington&rsquo;s roof?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not asking your assistance in conducting  this inquiry, Mr. Haviland,&rdquo; and the Coroner spoke shortly; &ldquo;but pursuing my  own plan of obtaining evidence in my own way. Will you kindly answer questions without  comment on them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right; fire away. Only remember, that  we relatives and friends are just as much interested in clearing up this  mystery as you are, and we want to help, if we can be allowed to do so  intelligently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Asked again if he saw or heard anything unusual  in the night, Haviland replied, &ldquo;You said &lsquo;suspicious&rsquo; the other time. I did  see something <i>unusual</i>. I saw Estelle  go stealthily downstairs at three A.M. That&rsquo;s unusual, but I don&rsquo;t go so far as  to call it suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>VIII<br>
    Anita&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>Instead of showing surprise at this statement,  the Coroner broke the breathless silence that followed it, by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you please explain what you mean by &lsquo;stealthily?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; returned Haviland, bluntly. &ldquo;She  went slowly, now and then pausing to listen, twice drawing back around a corner  and peeping out, and then coming forth again; she wore no shoes and carried no  light; she went down the big staircase in the manner I have described, and  after about ten minutes, returned in the same fashion. That&rsquo;s what I mean by stealthily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was your errand?&rdquo; asked Scofield of  Estelle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. I didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she replied, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She tells an untruth,&rdquo; said Gray, calmly. &ldquo;She  did go, just as I have described. But it was doubtless on an innocent errand. I  have no idea she was implicated in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s death. I am sure it is of  casual explanation,&mdash;or, I was sure, until Estelle denied it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How was it you chanced to see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was wakeful, and I was prowling around to  find something to read. I went out in the hall and got a magazine from the  table, and had returned to my room and was just closing the door, when I saw a  white figure glide across the hall. She passed through a moonlit space or I  could not have seen her. She was wrapped in a light or white kimono thing, and  I should never have thought of it again if it were not for what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew it to be this Estelle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; her red hair was hanging in a braid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t red!&rdquo; snapped Estelle, but Mr. Scofield  silenced her with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, auburn, then,&rdquo; said Haviland, easily. &ldquo;You  may as well own up, Estelle; what did you go down for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; repeated the maid, obstinately,  and no cross-questioning could prevail on her to admit otherwise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Haviland shrugged his shoulders;  &ldquo;I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter, as the crime was committed about one o&rsquo;clock. It&rsquo;s  up to you, Mr. Coroner, to find some person who acted suspiciously nearer that  time. And, by the way, as man of business of this estate, unless some worthwhile  evidence is forthcoming pretty soon, I&rsquo;m going to round up a detective or two  who will get somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give us a little more time, Mr. Haviland,&rdquo; said  Scofield, suavely, &ldquo;this inquest is only begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, get it over with, and then, if the truth  hasn&rsquo;t come to light, I&rsquo;ll take a hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Frayne was called next, and Anita, with a  look of importance on her pretty face, came forward.</p>
  <p>Her evidence, at first, was merely a repetition  of that already heard, and she corroborated Pauline&rsquo;s recital of the scene as  the two girls bade Miss Carrington good-night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; prompted the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I went to my room, but I didn&rsquo;t retire. I  sat thinking over what Miss Carrington had said to me. And as I thought about  it, I concluded that this time I was really dismissed from her secretaryship.  And that made me feel very sorry, for it is a good position and I&rsquo;ve no wish to  lose it. So,&mdash;after a time, I began to think I would go to Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  room and if she were still up, I would beg her forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgiveness for what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For any fancied grievance she might have  against me. I have always tried to please her, but she was, er,&mdash;difficult, and  it was not easy to do the right thing at all times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you go to her room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went to the door&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soon after one o&rsquo;clock. Not more than five or  ten minutes after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a rustle of excitement. The poison was  said to be administered at about one! Did this fair doll-like girl know the  secret of the tragedy?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed, Miss Frayne; tell the story of  anything you saw at that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw nothing. But I heard a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The door of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s room was closed,  and I was about to tap at it, when I heard talking inside. I paused, and I  listened, in order to discover if her maid was still with her, or some one  else. If it had been Estelle, I should have tapped for admittance. But it was  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say. The voice I heard distinctly was  that of Miss Carrington herself. Her voice was high-pitched, and of what is  called a carrying sort. The things she said were so strange, I lingered,  listening, for I was so surprised I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First, I heard her say, quite plainly, &lsquo;Your  face is the most beautiful I have ever seen! I wish mine were as beautiful.&rsquo; I  assumed, then, she must be talking to Miss Stuart, for surely she would not say  that to her maid. Then she said, &lsquo;But, to-morrow, I shall be forever freed from  this homely face of mine.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne, this is very singular! Are you  sure you heard correctly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure. But there is more. She next said, &lsquo;To-morrow  you will be glad!&mdash;<i>glad!&rsquo;</i> It was  almost a scream, that. And she went on, &lsquo;To-morrow all these jewels will be  yours,&mdash;if you&mdash;ah, but <i>will</i> you?&rsquo; and  then her voice trailed off faintly, and I could hear no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard nothing more at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I waited,&mdash;oh, I admit I was eavesdropping,  but it was so strange I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&mdash;there was silence. It may well be  some one else was replying to her, but I could not make out any other person&rsquo;s  words. A low voice would not be audible like a high-pitched one. But after a  moment, Miss Carrington resumed; she said, &lsquo;I shall change my will. Not Carr&rsquo;s half,  that must stand. But the other half shall never go to a niece who has no  affection for me!&rsquo; Again I heard nothing, for the responses were inaudible.  Then Miss Carrington said, in a musing tone: &lsquo;I have already willed you ten  thousand dollars of those United States bonds, but&mdash;&rsquo; And then, after quite a  long pause, Miss Carrington cried out, not loudly, but tensely, &lsquo;Henri, Henri! <i>you</i> are the mark I aim at!&rsquo; That frightened  me so, I ran swiftly back to my room, and locked the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You assumed Henri to be Count Charlier?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had no other construction to put upon the  words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You thought the gentleman was in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think that! And yet, it sounded as  if she were speaking to him, not of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a very strange story, Miss Frayne. Have  you mentioned these things you overheard to any one before this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I have thought them over, and concluded it  was best to tell the story first to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And quite right. It is, then, your opinion that  there was another person in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s room, to whom she was speaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seemed so to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you did not hear this other person&rsquo;s voice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita paused a moment and then said: &ldquo;Not  distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear it at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say. When I did not hear Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s voice clearly, there were sounds that might have been another  person or her own voice speaking more inaudibly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might it not be that she was merely talking to  herself,&mdash;soliloquizing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It could not have been that. She spoke  definitely and decidedly <i>to</i> some one  when she said &lsquo;Your face is beautiful,&rsquo; and when she said, &lsquo;I have willed you  ten thousand dollars,&rsquo; indeed, every thing she said was as if spoken to some  hearer; not as one who talks to herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After you regained your room, did you leave it  again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Now, are you positive, Miss Frayne, that  all these speeches were said just as you have repeated them? It is a great  strain on the memory to repeat accurately a conversation as long as the one you  have just rehearsed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The speeches I heard are burned into my brain.  I could not forget them if I would. I may have erred in some minor or  unimportant words, but the most of what I heard is precisely as I have repeated  it. Indeed, so thoroughly was I amazed at it all, I wrote it down as soon as I  reached my room. I had then no thought of&mdash;of what was going to happen, but Miss  Carrington had made peculiar remarks during the evening about something happening  to her, and in connection with that the words I heard seemed so remarkable,&mdash;not  to say uncanny,&mdash;that I made a note of them. This is not an unusual habit with  me. I often make notes of conversations, as it has been useful in my services  as secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If a caller in a social or business way had  conversation with Miss Carrington, and I was present, I often made a record, in  case she asked me later just what had been said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. And how do you interpret the words, &lsquo;Henri,  you are the mark I aim at?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can only think that Miss Carrington was in  favor of considering a marriage between herself and the Count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You made use of the word &lsquo;uncanny.&rsquo; Do you  imagine that Miss Carrington had any foreboding of her approaching doom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I heard her say, &lsquo;To-morrow I will be  forever freed from this homely face of mine,&rsquo; and &lsquo;to-morrow all these jewels  will be yours,&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking,&mdash;after the discovery of her death,&mdash;that  she must have anticipated it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did her voice sound like the despairing one of  a person about to die?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, it sounded full of life and  animation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she seem angry with the person to whom she  was speaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At times, yes. And, again, no. Her voice showed  varying emotions as she talked on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her speech was not continuous, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. It was broken, and in snatches.  But, remember, I could not hear all of what she said, and the other person or  persons not at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you not catch a word from the other voice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say. Much, in a low tone, that I could  not hear clearly, might have been Miss Carrington&rsquo;s voice or another&rsquo;s. The  door was closed, and as soon as I realized there was some one there, not  Estelle, I had no thought of knocking, and I soon went away. I ought to have  gone away sooner, and would have done so, but I was so amazed and puzzled I  stayed on involuntarily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your story, Miss Frayne, is very extraordinary.  Can you suggest, from what you heard, who might have been in the room with Miss  Carrington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can not, nor do I wish to. I have told you  what I heard, it is for you to make deductions or discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish to say a word, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; and Pauline  Stuart, with her dark eyes blazing, rose to her feet. &ldquo;I am sorry to say this,  but I must ask you to hesitate before you put too much faith in the amazing  tale you have just listened to. I am sure Miss Frayne could not have heard all that  nonsense! It is impossible, on the face of it, that my aunt should have  received any one in her room after her maid left her. It is incredible that she  should have made all those ridiculous and meaningless remarks! And it is  despicable for any woman to imply or hint that Miss Carrington was receiving a  gentleman caller! I am surprised that you even listened to what must be the  ravings of a disordered mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at Anita like an avenging  goddess. But the darts of scorn from her dark eyes were met and returned in  kind from the big blue ones of the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I resent your tone and your words,&rdquo; said Anita,  deliberately; &ldquo;but since you choose to adopt that attitude, I will go on to say  what I had intended not to reveal, that I saw you coming from your aunt&rsquo;s room,  after the conversation I have told of took place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said the Coroner; &ldquo;you said that  immediately after hearing the alleged conversation you went at once to your  room, and did not leave it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor did I. But a few minutes later, unable to  restrain my curiosity, I opened my door, and looked out. My position then  commanded a full view of the hall, and I saw Miss Stuart go from her aunt&rsquo;s  room to her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked at the speaker. Coldly her glance  swept back to the Coroner, and she said: &ldquo;I deny that I was in my aunt&rsquo;s room  after leaving it at midnight in company with Miss Frayne. But she forces me to  tell that <i>I</i> saw <i>her</i> going away from it at exactly quarter past one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you fix the time so accurately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was sitting in the upper hall,&mdash;it is really a  sitting-room, at the bay-windowed end,&mdash;looking at the moon. I, too, had been  disturbed at my aunt&rsquo;s attitude, and her threats to send me away to-day, and I  had gone to the hall window-seat, a favorite haunt of mine, and had sat there  for a half hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could any one going through the hall see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably not, as the draperies are heavy, and I  was in the deep window-seat. I was thinking I would go to my room, and then I  saw Miss Frayne come from my aunt&rsquo;s room and go to her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure she came from the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was closing the door, her hand was on the  knob. She did not see me, I am sure, for I drew back in the window and watched  her. And just then I heard the hall clock chime the quarter after one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see Miss Frayne when she went to  Miss Carrington&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I suppose I was then looking out of the  deep window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor did you hear her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, the rugs are thick and a light foot-fall  makes no sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you next do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went&mdash;I went straight to my own room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The slight hesitation told against Pauline. All  through her testimony, all through her arraignment of Anita,&mdash;for it amounted to  that,&mdash;she had been cool, calm and imperturbable. But now a momentary hesitation  of speech, added perhaps, to the circumstantial story of Anita Frayne, caused a  wave of doubt,&mdash;not enough to call suspicion,&mdash;but a questioning attitude to form  in the minds of many of the audience.</p>
  <p>To whom, if not Miss Stuart, could Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s remarks about beauty have been addressed? It was well known that  Miss Lucy adored beauty and had all her life lamented her own lack of it. This  was no secret woe of the poor lady&rsquo;s. To any one who would listen, she would  complain of her hard lot in having all the gifts of the gods except good looks.  To whom else would she say &lsquo;To-morrow all these jewels will be yours,&mdash;if you&mdash;ah,  but <i>will</i> you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And yet, after all, it did not make sense. Was  it not far more likely to be a figment of Miss Frayne&rsquo;s clever mind, for what  purpose who might say?</p>
  <p>At any rate, their stories were contradictory  and moreover were garbled.</p>
  <p>The jurymen sighed. The case had been mysterious  enough before, now it was becoming inexplicable.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>IX<br>
    Further Testimony</b></h2>
  <p>Count Henri Charlier was being questioned, and  he was distinctly ill at ease. His French <i>savoir  faire</i> was not proof against definite inquiries as to his intentions regarding  the late Miss Carrington, and indefinite allusions concerning his movements on  the night of her death.</p>
  <p>He had related, straightforwardly enough, his  visit at Garden Steps that evening and his departure at or about midnight. He  denied his engagement of marriage, but admitted that he had paid Miss  Carrington such attentions as might lead her to suspect an attachment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not return to this house after leaving  on Tuesday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most assuredly not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were not in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s boudoir at one  o&rsquo;clock or thereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier&rsquo;s black eyes snapped. But by a  successful effort he controlled his indignation, and said, simply, &ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she was heard to address you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, as I was not there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She distinctly declared that you were the mark  she aimed at. What construction do you put upon those words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not for me to boast of my attraction for  a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Charlier simpered a little, and Gray  Haviland looked at him with a frown of undisguised scorn. Haviland had never liked  the Count, indeed, he even doubted his right to the title, and especially had  he feared a marriage between him and Miss Lucy. And, granting that this feeling  was partly due to a consideration of his own interests, Haviland also distrusted  the Frenchman and doubted Miss Lucy&rsquo;s happiness as his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Miss Carrington leave you a bequest of ten  thousand dollars in United States bonds?&rdquo; went on the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and the Count stammered in an  embarrassed way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do know!&rdquo; shouted Haviland; &ldquo;the will has  been read, and you know perfectly well that such a bequest was left to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did you deny the knowledge?&rdquo; asked  Scofield, sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are sure!&rdquo; stormed Gray. &ldquo;Now where were  you when Miss Carrington spoke those words to you? If not in her boudoir, then  on the balcony outside the window, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd,&rdquo; said the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Gray; &ldquo;that window opens on a  balcony enclosed by glass. It is easily reached from outside by a small  staircase, mostly used in summer, but always available. How could Miss  Carrington speak to the Count concerning the bonds and concerning her  infatuation for himself, which is no secret, unless he were there before her?  And how could he be in the room&mdash;in her boudoir&mdash;unknown to the servants? Moreover,  Mr. Coroner, I believe the glove found in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s hand to be the  property of Count Charlier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; cried the witness, excitedly; &ldquo;I have  repeatedly disclaimed that glove. It is not mine, I know not whose it is. I  know nothing of this sad affair, whatever. If the money is left to me, as I  have been told, it is a&mdash;a surprise to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surprise nothing!&rdquo; murmured Haviland, but he  said no more to the Count.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If my story might be told now,&mdash;&rdquo; ventured Mrs.  Frothingham.</p>
  <p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Coroner Scofield  decided to let her tell it, as having a possible bearing on Count Charlier&rsquo;s  testimony.</p>
  <p>The rather stunning-looking widow was  fashionably dressed, and she fluttered with an air of importance as she took  the stand. She related again the story she had told of the supposed burglar,  whom she saw leaving the living-room by way of a window, at four o&rsquo;clock on  Wednesday morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you be so sure it was a burglar?&rdquo; asked  Scofield.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he looked like one. All huddled up, you  know, and his face buried between a high coat collar and a drawn-down cap. And  he walked slyly,&mdash;sort of glided among the shrubs and trees, as if avoiding  notice. No man on legitimate business would skulk like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might it not have been Count Charlier?&rdquo; asked  the Coroner, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; and Mrs. Frothingham gave a  little shriek. &ldquo;The Count is a slim and elegant figure; this was a stocky,  burly man; a marauder, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said the Coroner, wearily. &ldquo;It may  be that a burglar was concealed in the house, or let in by a servant, and that  he attacked Miss Carrington as she was seated at her dressing table. It seems  impossible that he should have administered poison to her, however, and the conjoined  circumstances may indicate collusion between&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between whom?&rdquo; asked Inspector Brunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; confessed Scofield. &ldquo;Every way I  try to think it out, I ran up against an impassable barrier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; began Haviland; &ldquo;it is a  most involved case. I shall cable Carrington Loria for authority to employ an  expert detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why cable him?&rdquo; asked Pauline; &ldquo;I am equally in  authority now. Carr and myself each receive half the residuary estate of Aunt  Lucy, and, of course, I am as anxious to find the&mdash;the murderer, as Carr can  possibly be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, somebody will have to authorize it who is  willing to pay for it. As man of business in this home, I am willing to attend  to all such matters, but I must have authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to me a little premature, Mr.  Haviland,&rdquo; commented the Inspector. &ldquo;Perhaps when the inquest is concluded, it  may not be necessary to call on any other detective than our own Mr. Hardy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; agreed Haviland; &ldquo;but unless you  people all wake up, you&rsquo;re not going to get anywhere. I admit the getting is  difficult, but that&rsquo;s just the reason a wise sleuth should be called in before  the trails grow cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then the Coroner returned to his task of  questioning Mrs. Frothingham.</p>
  <p>The widow was not definitely helpful. Her  statements were often contradictory in minor details, and when she corrected  them they seemed to lose in weight. She stuck to the main points, however, that  by the help of a strong field-glass she had discerned, in the bright moonlight,  a man leave by way of the French window, at four o&rsquo;clock, and had seen him make  his way stealthily out by the great entrance gates of the place.</p>
  <p>Cross-questioning on this brought no variations,  and the jurymen wagged their heads in belief of her story.</p>
  <p>But her accounts of her own doings on Tuesday  evening were vague and indefinite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in my own home all the evening,&rdquo; she said  at one time; and again, &ldquo;I went out for a short walk at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; This  last in refutation of Haskins, the Carrington butler, who deposed to having  seen the lady walk across the lawns of Garden Steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you walk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, just around my own place; and for a moment  I strolled over here because the Steps looked so beautiful in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was. I have no house guests at present, save  the Count; and as my brother, who lives with me, is on a Western trip, I was  alone, and I walked about to kill time until Count Charlier should return after  his bridge game over here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you walk near the house, while on the  Garden Steps&rsquo; estate?&rdquo; asked Scofield, scenting a possible espionage of her  titled visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; and the witness bristled with  indignation; &ldquo;why should I! I was not really an acquaintance of Miss  Carrington, merely a neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, ma&rsquo;am, but I saw you on the  conservatory verandah,&rdquo; said Haskins, in a deprecatory way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is not true, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; said the lady,  glancing scornfully at the butler. &ldquo;I beg you will not accept a servant&rsquo;s  statement in preference to mine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are sure of this, Haskins?&rdquo; said the  Inspector gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Sure, sir.&rdquo; and the man looked  doggedly certain, though a little scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you deny it?&rdquo; went on Scofield to Mrs.  Frothingham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I most certainly do! How absurd for me to be  over here, and how more than absurd for me to deny it if I were!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This seemed sensible. Why should she deny it?  And mightn&rsquo;t the butler be mistaken? Or deliberately falsifying?</p>
  <p>If there were collusion or criminal assistance  by any of the servants, surely the word of all of them must be mistrusted  unless proven.</p>
  <p>And, too, what could have brought Mrs.  Frothingham to the verandah of a home where she was not an accepted guest? Or,  could she have been spying on the Count?</p>
  <p>For it had slowly entered the Coroner&rsquo;s not very  alert mind that perhaps the volatile widow had her own plans for the Count&rsquo;s  future, and Miss Carrington did not figure in them. The manner of the witness  bore out this theory. She was self-conscious and at times confused. She  frequently looked at the Count and then quickly averted her gaze. She blushed  and stammered when speaking his name or referring to him. In a word, she acted  as a woman might act in regard to a man of whom she was jealous. And the  situation bore it out. If Mrs. Frothingham had matrimonial designs on her  distinguished guest, would she not naturally resent his visits to a rich  neighbor? Mrs. Frothingham was not rich, and she may well have been afraid of  Miss Carrington&rsquo;s charm of gold, which could cause many a man to overlook  anything else that might be lacking.</p>
  <p>Coroner Scofield was getting more and more tangled  in the mazes of this extraordinary case. He was practically at his wits&rsquo; end.  At last he blurted out: &ldquo;It is impossible, it seems, to get a coherent, or even  plausible story from a woman! Is there any man present, who knows any of the  details of the happenings of Tuesday evening and night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence at this rather  petulant speech, and then Stephen Illsley rose, and speaking very gravely,  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems to be my unpleasant duty to tell what  little I know of these matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The relieved Coroner heard this with  satisfaction. Accepting his good fortune, he prepared to listen to Illsley&rsquo;s  testimony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was spending the evening here,&rdquo; the witness  began, &ldquo;and during my visit I was in the various rooms. At a late hour, perhaps  something after eleven,&mdash;I was crossing the hall, and I saw Mrs. Frothingham on  the stairway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the stairway!&rdquo; exclaimed the Coroner, in  amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Illsley, his grave eyes resting  on the face of the widow, who stared at him as if stricken dumb. &ldquo;Yes, I saw  her distinctly. She was evidently coming downstairs, one hand rested on the  banister, and she was looking upward at the ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think not. If so, she made no sign. But she  was not looking my way, and I went on into the reception room, where I was  going in search of a scarf Miss Stuart had left there. When I recrossed the  hall, the lady had disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did not this seem to you a strange  circumstance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had no right to any opinion on the subject.  It was not my affair what guests were at the house I was visiting, or what they  might be doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Frothingham asserts she was not an  acquaintance of Miss Carrington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not know that, then; and even so, it gave  me no right to speculate concerning the lady&rsquo;s presence there. Nor should I  refer to it now, except that in view of the subsequent tragedy it is due to  every principle of right and justice that all truths be known as to that evening.  Mrs. Frothingham will, of course, recall the episode and can doubtless explain  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should like to hear the explanation!&rdquo; said  Pauline, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;As mistress here now, I am interested to know why  a stranger should wander about this house at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham sat silent. Her face showed not  so much consternation or dismay as a cold, calculating expression, as if  debating just what explanation she should offer.</p>
  <p>At last she spoke. &ldquo;I may as well own up,&rdquo; she  said, and laughed nervously. &ldquo;I <i>was</i> on the verandah, as the vigilant butler noticed. I did step inside the hall, as  I had so often heard of the rare tapestries and paintings, and, in my <i>ennui</i>, I thought it no harm to take a  peep. The great door was ajar, and I was a little chilled by my walk across the  lawns. I said to myself, if I meet any one I will merely beg a few moments&rsquo;  grace and then run away. Yes, I did take a step or two up the stair, to look at  a picture on the landing. It was all innocent enough, perhaps not in the best  of taste, but I was lonely, and the light and warmth lured me. In a moment I  had slipped out and run away home, laughing over my escapade like a foolish  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her light laugh rippled out as she concluded her  story. She looked ingenuous and truthful, but the Coroner distrusted feminine  fairy-tales, and this was a little too fanciful to be true.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Mrs. Frothingham was looking at him  sharply from the corner of her eye. Clearly, she was watching him to see how he  took it.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t take it very well. The acknowledged  presence of an outsider in the house, for a not very plausible reason, was  illuminating in his estimation. She had been on the stairway. Had she been to  Miss Carrington&rsquo;s room? True, she said she went only to the landing,&mdash;but pshaw,  women had no regard for the truth! Had she and Count Charlier planned between  them to&mdash;bah, <i>why</i> did this woman want  to kill her neighbor? Even if she were jealous of the Count&rsquo;s attention, would  she go so far as crime? No, of course not! He must question her further. And yet,  what good would that do, if she would not tell the truth?</p>
  <p>Well, she was in the house at half-past eleven,  that much was certain, for Stephen Illsley&rsquo;s story and her own and also the  butler&rsquo;s testimony all coincided as to that.</p>
  <p>And then, Detective Hardy, who had just returned  from a short errand, made a startling statement. He declared that the glove  which had been found clasped tightly in the dead fingers of the late Miss  Carrington did belong to Count Henri Charlier.</p>
  <p>Mr. Hardy had been searching the Count&rsquo;s  wardrobe, and though he did not find the mate to that particular glove, he  found many others, some worn and some entirely unused, but all of the same size  and made by the same firm as the one now in the Coroner&rsquo;s possession!</p>
  <p>Thus cornered Count Charlier reluctantly  admitted that it was his glove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I denied it,&rdquo; he thus excused himself, &ldquo;because  I have no idea how it came into Miss Carrington&rsquo;s possession, and I did not  wish to implicate her in an affair with my unworthy self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; thought Gray Haviland, fixing his  attention on the Count and on the flustered Mrs. Frothingham; &ldquo;a precious pair  of adventurers! I expect Scofield is right, we won&rsquo;t need an expert detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was more of the inquest. But its  continuance brought out no developments not already here transcribed. There was  much cross-questioning and probing; there was much rather futile effort to make  all the strange details fit any one theory; there was variance of opinion; and  there was more or less dissension.</p>
  <p>But as a final result, the Coroner&rsquo;s jury  brought in a verdict that Miss Lucy Carrington met her death by poison  administered by a person or persons unknown, who thereafter, probably for the  purpose of diverting attention from the poison, struck her a blow on the head.  The jury in their deliberation felt that Count Henri Charlier was implicated.  But not having sufficient evidence to make a charge, suggested to the detective  force that he be kept under surveillance.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>X<br>
    Bizarre Clues</b></h2>
  <p>It was Saturday. The funeral of Miss Carrington  had been held the day before and the imposing obsequies had been entirely in  keeping with her love of elaborate display in life. The casket was of the  richest, the flowers piled mountain high, the music, the most expensive  available; for the young people in charge had felt it incumbent on them to  arrange everything as Miss Lucy would have desired it.</p>
  <p>It was a pathetic commentary on the character of  the dead woman that while all who mourned her felt the shock and horror of her  death, they were not deeply bowed with sorrow. Pauline, as nearest relative,  would naturally grieve most, but for the moment her affections were lost sight of  in the paralyzing effects of the sudden tragedy.</p>
  <p>Anita Frayne had practically &ldquo;gone to pieces.&rdquo;  She was nervous, and jumped twitchingly if any one spoke to her.</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland was reticent, an unusual thing for  him, and devoted most of his time to matters of business connected with the  estate.</p>
  <p>Estelle, the maid, had succumbed to a nervous  break-down, and had been taken to a nearby sanatorium, where she indulged in  frequent and violent hysterics.</p>
  <p>The household was in a continual excitement.  Lawyers and detectives were coming and going, neighbors were calling, and  reporters simply infested the place.</p>
  <p>Pauline and Anita, though outwardly polite, were  not on good terms, and rarely talked together.</p>
  <p>But this morning the two girls and Haviland were  called to a confab by Hardy, the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve arrested the Count,&rdquo; Hardy began, and  Anita screamed an interruption:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arrested Count Charlier! Put him in jail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the detective. &ldquo;I found the  other one of that pair of gloves, the mate to the one in the lady&rsquo;s hands,&mdash;where,  do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rolled up in a pair of socks, in the Count&rsquo;s  chiffonnier drawer; of course, to hide it, as it is not at all easy to destroy  a thing like that while visiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Pauline, earnestly; &ldquo;it is  hard. I&rsquo;ve often noticed that, when I&rsquo;ve wanted to burn a letter or anything.  You can&rsquo;t do it, unknown to the servants or somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Anita, &ldquo;It would have been easy  for the Count to dispose of a glove if he had wanted to. But he didn&rsquo;t. He  never committed that crime! If a glove was found, as you say, somebody else put  it there to incriminate an innocent man. It&rsquo;s too absurd to fasten the thing on  Count Charlier! Do you suppose he went to the boudoir and gave Miss Carrington poison,  and then shook hands good-evening, and left his glove in her grasp? Nonsense!  The glove in her dead hand was put there by the criminal to implicate the  Count, and the glove in the rolled-up socks for the same purpose and by the  same person!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove, Miss Frayne! You may be right!&rdquo; cried  Hardy. &ldquo;Somehow I can&rsquo;t see the Count&rsquo;s hand in this thing, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet, he did it!&rdquo; put in Haviland. &ldquo;Have  they really jailed him? I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Pauline, and her face was  white; &ldquo;Did he&mdash;did he&mdash;c-confess?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice trembled, and she could  scarcely pronounce the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Hardy; &ldquo;he seemed dazed, and  declared his innocence,&mdash;but he was not convincing. He takes it very hard and  talks wildly and at random. But you know what Frenchmen are; liable to go off  their heads at any time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look at it,&rdquo; reasoned Anita; &ldquo;<i>why</i> would the Count kill Miss Carrington?  Why, he thought of marrying her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Hardy smiled a little.  &ldquo;I size it up this way. Matters had gone so far that he had to propose to the  lady or clear out. He didn&rsquo;t want to clear out for then she would take back the  little matter of ten thousand dollars already marked for him in her will. Moreover,  he couldn&rsquo;t realize that tidy little sum, which he very much wants, so long as  she lived. To be sure, he would have had far more, had he married her, but that  was not in &lsquo;his nibs&rsquo;&rsquo; plans. So he resorted to desperate measures. He&rsquo;s a  thorough villain, that man! Outwardly, most correct and honorable, but really,  an adventurer, as is also his friend, the dashing young widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Hardy,&rdquo; and Pauline spoke calmly, now, &ldquo;do  you <i>know</i> these things to be true of  Count Charlier, or are you assuming them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Stuart, I know human nature pretty  well, especially male human nature, and if I&rsquo;m mistaken in this chap, I&rsquo;ll be  surprised. But also, I&rsquo;ve set afoot an investigation, and we&rsquo;ll soon learn his  record, antecedents and all that. At present, no one knows much about him; and what  Mrs. Frothingham knows she won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very strange for Aunt Lucy to give him  that money&mdash;&rdquo; began Pauline musingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; broke in Gray, &ldquo;I know all about  that. Miss Carrington had a certain bunch of bonds that amounted to just fifty  thousand dollars. In one of her sudden bursts of generosity, and she often had  such, she decided to give those bonds to five people. I mean, to devise them in  her will, not to give them now. Well, four were Miss Stuart and Carr Loria, Miss  Frayne and myself. And then, she hesitated for some time, but finally announced  that the fifth portion should be named for the Count. I was there when the  lawyer fixed it up, and Miss Carrington turned to me and said, laughingly, &lsquo;I  may change that before it comes due!&rsquo; Oh, she was always messing with her will.  I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s a tidy bit in it for me, as it is. Her demise <i>might</i> have taken place when I was for  the moment cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was there ever such a time?&rdquo; asked Hardy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There sure was! Only last month, she got firing  mad with me, and crossed me off without a shilling. Then she got over her mad  and restored me to favor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You and Miss Frayne have other bequests than  those particular bonds you mentioned?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we have each ten thou&rsquo; beside, which was  all right of the old lady, eh, Anita?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None too much, considering what I have stood  from her capricious temper and eccentric ways,&rdquo; returned the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your own temper is none too even,&rdquo; said  Pauline, quietly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&rsquo;t speak ill of my aunt, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What might have been a passage at arms was  averted by the appearance of a footman with a cablegram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Carr!&rdquo; exclaimed Pauline, as she tore  it open, and read:</p>
  <p>Awful news just received. Shall I come home or  will you come here? Let Haviland attend all business. Love and sympathy.</p>
  <p>Carrington Loria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Cairo,&rdquo; commented Haviland, looking at  the paper; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s lucky. If he had been off up the Nile on one of his  excavating tours, we mightn&rsquo;t have had communication for weeks. Well, he  practically retains me as business manager, at least for the present. And Lord  knows there&rsquo;s a lot to be done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, Gray, why you look upon  Carr as more in authority than I am,&rdquo; said Pauline, almost petulantly; &ldquo;I am an  equal heir, and, too, I am here, and Carr is the other side of the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Polly. I don&rsquo;t know why, myself. I  suppose because he is the man of the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference. I think from  now on, Gray, it will be proper for you to consider me the head of the house as  far as business matters are concerned. You can pay Carr his half of the  residuary in whatever form he wants it. I shall keep the place, at least for  the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Mr. Loria come back to America?&rdquo; asked  Hardy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I scarcely think so,&rdquo; replied Pauline. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  really no use of his doing so, unless he chooses. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure he won&rsquo;t  choose, as he&rsquo;s so wrapped up in his work over there, that he&rsquo;d hate to leave  unless necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t he feel a necessity to help  investigate the murder?&rdquo; urged Hardy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Pauline looked thoughtful. &ldquo;You  see what he says; when he asks if he shall come home, he means do I want him  to. If I don&rsquo;t request it, I&rsquo;m fairly sure he won&rsquo;t come. Of course, when he  learns all the details, he will be as anxious as we that the murderer should be  found. But if I know Carr, he will far rather pay for the most expensive detective  service than come over himself. And, too, what could he do, more than we can?  We shall, of course, use every effort and every means to solve the mysteries of  the case, and he could advise us no better than the lawyers already in our  counsel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all true,&rdquo; said Haviland; &ldquo;and I think  Loria means that when he puts me in charge of it all. But after a week or so we&rsquo;ll  get a letter from him, and he&rsquo;ll tell us what he intends to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall cable him,&rdquo; said Pauline, thoughtfully,  &ldquo;not to come over unless he wants to. Then he can do as he likes. But he needn&rsquo;t  come for my benefit. The property must be divided and all that, but we can  settle any uncertainties by mail or cable. And, I think I shall go on the trip  as we had planned it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; said Gray, in amazement. &ldquo;Go to Egypt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t see why not. I&rsquo;d like the trip,  and it would take my mind off these horrors. Our passage is booked for a  February sailing. If necessary I will postpone it a few weeks, but I see no  reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t go. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Haviland, slowly.</p>
  <p>Hardy seemed about to speak and then thought  better of it, and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I shall not go,&rdquo; began Anita, and  Pauline interrupted her with:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go! I should say not! Why should you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I, if I choose?&rdquo; returned Anita,  and her pink cheeks burned rosy. &ldquo;I am my own mistress, I have my own money. I  am as free to go as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; said Pauline, coldly. &ldquo;Only  please advise me on what steamer you are sailing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you may take another,&rdquo; and Anita laughed  shortly. &ldquo;But I may prefer to go on the one you do. Aren&rsquo;t you rather suddenly  anxious to leave this country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline faced her. &ldquo;Anita Frayne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if  you suspect me of crime, I would rather you said so definitely, than to fling  out these continual innuendoes. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say that Pauline. But there are,&mdash;there  certainly are some things to be explained regarding your interview with your  aunt on Tuesday night. You know, I heard you in her room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your speech, Anita, is that of a guilty  conscience. As you well know, I saw you come from her room at the hour you  accuse me of being there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let up, girls,&rdquo; said Haviland; &ldquo;you only make  trouble by that sort of talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But when an innocent man is arrested, Pauline  ought to tell what she knows!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told, and it seems to implicate you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The impending scene was averted by Haviland, who  insisted on knowing what word should be sent to Loria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May as well get it off,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it takes  long enough to get word back and forth to him, anyway. What shall I say for  you, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell him to come over or not, just as he  prefers, but that I shall be quite content if he does not care to come; and  that I shall go to Egypt as soon as I can arrange to do so. Put it into shape  yourself,&mdash;you know more about cabling than I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haviland went away to the library, and Hardy  followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Haviland,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;what  do these ladies mean by accusing each other of all sorts of things? Did either  of them have any hand in this murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in a thousand years!&rdquo; declared Gray,  emphatically. &ldquo;The girls never loved each other, but lately, even before the  death of Miss Lucy, they have been at daggers drawn. I don&rsquo;t know why, I&rsquo;m  sure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what do you make of this story of Miss  Frayne&rsquo;s about hearing Miss Stuart in her aunt&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t hear her. I mean she didn&rsquo;t hear  Miss Stuart; what she heard was Miss Carrington talking to herself. The old  lady was erratic in lots of ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you all say the old lady? She wasn&rsquo;t  really old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About fifty. But she tried so hard to appear  young, that it made her seem older.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was in love with the Count, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; as she was in love with any man she could  attach. No, that&rsquo;s not quite true. Miss Lucy cared only for interesting men,  but if she could corral one of those, she used every effort to snare him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is the illustrious Count interesting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She found him so. And, yes, he always  entertained us. She made that bequest to attract his attention and lure him on.  And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then he couldn&rsquo;t withstand the temptation  and he shuffled her off, to make sure of the money now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think he killed her, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who else? Those girls never used a black-jack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the poison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had it been poison alone, there might be a  question. But that stunning blow has to be remembered. And neither Miss Stuart  nor Miss Frayne can be thought of for a moment in connection with that piece of  brutality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the snake? The queer costume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The costume wasn&rsquo;t so queer&mdash;for a boudoir garb.  The snake <i>is</i> inexplicable,&mdash;unless the  man has a disordered mind, and used insane methods to cover his tracks. Then  there&rsquo;s the glove, you can&rsquo;t get around that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That glove might have been put in her hand by  anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! By a professional burglar, say! I  really believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, let up on that professional burglar  business! No burglar is going off without his loot, when he has uninterrupted  time enough to kill a person twice, with poison and then, to hide that, with a  fractured skull! How do you explain, even in theory, those two murderous  attacks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord, man, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know! It&rsquo;s all the most inexplicable muddle. I don&rsquo;t see  how any of the things could happen, but they <i>did</i> happen! You&rsquo;re the detective, not I! Aren&rsquo;t you ever going to  discover anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may as well own up, Mr. Haviland, I am beyond  my depth. There is a belief among detectives that the more bizarre and amazing  the clues are, the easier the deduction therefrom. But I don&rsquo;t believe that.  This case is bizarre enough, in all conscience, yet what can one deduce from  that paper snake and that squeezed-up glove? It was all up in a little wad, you  know, not at all as if it were carelessly drawn from a man&rsquo;s hand, or pulled  off in a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no struggle. The features were  composed, even almost smiling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it. That proves it was no burglar. Well,  I&rsquo;m up a tree. I wish you felt inclined to call in Fleming Stone. He&rsquo;s the only  man on this continent who could unravel it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to get him, but Miss Stuart won&rsquo;t hear  of it. I&rsquo;d have to have either her authority or Loria&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Loria gave you full swing, in that  cable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, for ordinary business matters. But this is  different. I&rsquo;d have to have assurance that he&rsquo;d pay the bills before I engaged  Stone. I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s some expensive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that, too. But, by Jove, I&rsquo;d like to  work with him! Or under him. I say, I wish you could bring it about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might cable Loria on my own, and not mention  it to Miss Stuart until I get the permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do. For as you say, the two ladies cannot  possibly be involved, and I, for one, don&rsquo;t believe that nincompoop Count ever  pulled off such a complicated affair all by himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about the widow he&rsquo;s visiting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, there you have it! Those two are in it, but  there&rsquo;s more mystery yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have it straightened out,&rdquo; said  Haviland, thoughtfully. &ldquo;In a way, I feel responsible to Loria, since he has  put me in charge. And if he wants me to get Stone, I&rsquo;ll be glad to do so. As  you say, it can&rsquo;t affect the girls,&mdash;that stuff Anita made up was only to bother  Pauline. You see, Pauline came back at her with a counter accusation. They&rsquo;re  both unstrung and upset, and they scarcely know what they&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s that French maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Estelle. She&rsquo;s a negligible quantity. She&rsquo;s  hysterical from sheer nervousness, and she lies so fast she can hardly keep up  with herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, think it over, and if you see your way  clear to call in Stone, I&rsquo;ll be mighty glad. If the Frenchman <i>is</i> the guilty party, Stone will nail him  and prove it beyond all doubt. And if not, we surely don&rsquo;t want an innocent man  to swing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Haviland.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>XI<br>
    Fleming Stone</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have often heard the idea expressed that  the more bizarre the clues appear, the easier the solution of the mystery. And  this is frequently true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone looked from one to another of the  interested group of listeners. They sat in the library,&mdash;Pauline, Anita, Gray  Haviland and the young detective, Hardy.</p>
  <p>Haviland had carried out his plan of cabling  Carrington Loria for authority to employ Mr. Stone, and had received a reply to  use his own judgment in all such matters and charge the expense to Loria&rsquo;s  account.</p>
  <p>Pauline had been opposed to the idea of calling  Fleming Stone to the case, but as she seemed unable to put forth any valid  objections, Haviland had insisted until she gave her consent. So arrangements  had been quickly made, and the great Detective had reached Garden Steps on Wednesday  afternoon, just a week after the discovery of the murder.</p>
  <p>Previously unacquainted with Stone, the whole  household was interested in his personality, and this preliminary conversation  was by way of introduction.</p>
  <p>A man of nearly fifty, Fleming Stone was tall  and well proportioned, with a carriage and bearing that gave an impression of  strength. His clear-cut face and firm jaw gave the same character indications  as are seen in portraits of Lincoln, but his features were far more harmonious  than those of our rugged-faced president.</p>
  <p>Stone&rsquo;s hair, thick and dark, was slightly  grayed at the temples, and his deep-set eyes were now lustrous, and again,  shadowed, like the water of a dark pool. His lean jaw and forceful mouth made  his face in repose somewhat stern, but this effect was often banished by his  delightful smile, which softened his whole countenance and gave him a distinct  air of friendliness.</p>
  <p>His manner was full of charm, and even Pauline  became fascinated as she watched him and listened to his talk.</p>
  <p>Fully at ease and skilfully directing the  conversation, while he seemed merely sharing it, Stone was studying and  classifying the new elements with which he had to deal. Not yet had he inquired  as to the details of the case in hand, he was discussing detective work in  general, much to the gratification of Tom Hardy, who listened as a pupil at the  feet of Gamaliel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Stone, settling back sociably in  his easy chair, while the others unconsciously fell into more informal  postures, &ldquo;Yes, bizarre effects do often point the way to a successful quest.  Why, once, a man was found dead, with his feet in a tub of cold water. It was  discovered that his feet had been immersed after death had taken place.  Obviously the tub of water had been used as a blind, to fog up the case. But  the very character of the clue led at once to a man who was known as a &lsquo;cold water  fiend,&rsquo; and a fiend indeed he was. He was the murderer. You see, he was clever,  but not clever enough. He had wit enough to think of the queer circumstance of  the tub of water, but not enough to realize that the clue would lead directly  to his own undoing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everybody looked thoughtful, but it was Hardy  who spoke; &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that clue was put there on purpose.  Do you think these strange effects connected with Miss Carrington&rsquo;s murder were  deliberately arranged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell now, Mr. Hardy. In fact, I  have not heard a connected and circumstantial account of the discoveries, as  yet. Suppose we go over the case, leisurely, and let me get a complete account  by means of a general conversation. I will ask questions, or you may volunteer information,  as seems most enlightening. Tell me first of the character and characteristics  of Miss Carrington. Was she timid, or fearful of burglars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Haviland. &ldquo;She was careful to  have the house locked up at night by the servants, but she had no burglar  alarms or anything of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If a marauder had appeared, would she have been  likely to scream out in affright?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; volunteered Anita. &ldquo;She  would more likely demand to know what he wanted and order him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet the black-jack clearly indicates a burglar,&rdquo;  went on Stone; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine an ordinary citizen, of any calling, owning or  using such a weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you examined the thing?&rdquo; asked Haviland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I should like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hardy at once produced it, having brought it  with him from Police Headquarters for the purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, as he fingered the  not very alarming-looking affair. In fact, it was merely a long, narrow bag,  made of dark cloth and filled with shot. The bag was tied tightly at one end  with a bit of twine to prevent the escape of the contents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home-made affair,&rdquo; Stone went on. &ldquo;Made  probably by a professional burglar, but an amateur murderer. See, it is merely  a bit of heavy cloth, out from an old coat sleeve or trouser leg, sewed up in a  bungling manner to make a bag. It is stitched with coarse black thread and the  stitches are drawn hard and firm, evidently pulled through by a strong hand.  Then, filled with shot, it is tied with a bit of old fish-line, which also is pulled  and knotted by muscular fingers. And&mdash;&rdquo; Stone paused abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; prompted Anita, breathlessly, her eyes  fixed on the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; and Stone smiled; &ldquo;only I should  say the burglar lived in a house recently remodeled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy nodded in satisfaction. This was the sort  of deduction he was looking for. Next he hoped for the color of the man&rsquo;s hair,  and the sort of cigar he smoked. But he was doomed to disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We seem to have drifted from the subject of  Miss Carrington,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;The evening before her death was she in her  usual spirits? Evidently no premonition of her fate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Gray, &ldquo;she remarked  during the evening that something would happen to her that night which would  surprise and astound us all. She said distinctly that &lsquo;to-morrow everything  would be different.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you understand her to mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all. It was most  mysterious. Nor do we yet know what she meant. For surely she had no thought of  dying. She spent the evening playing cards and listening to music, and  conversation with the family and guests, quite as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In amiable mood?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Pauline, taking up the talk; &ldquo;on  the contrary she was exceedingly irritable and ill-tempered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You saw her after she went to her room for the  night?&rdquo; and Stone turned his whole attention to Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; Miss Frayne and I always went to her room  with her, to say good-night and to receive possible orders or suggestions for  the next day&rsquo;s occupations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you say she was unamiable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a mild word,&rdquo; and Pauline smiled a  little. &ldquo;She was in a high temper, and she told us both that we were to leave  this house the next day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You both left her in that mood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we were obliged to do so. She dismissed us  peremptorily and ordered us from the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you saw her next, Miss Stuart, when?&rdquo; asked  Fleming Stone gently.</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated for a perceptible instant,  then she said, with a slight air of bravado, &ldquo;next morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been told the main facts,&rdquo; went on  Stone, &ldquo;but I want to learn certain details. Please tell me, Miss Stuart,  exactly how she then appeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Pauline flung her face into  her hands with a short, sharp cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should think you <i>couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</i> exclaimed Anita, and her voice was distinctly accusing.</p>
  <p>This seemed to rouse Pauline, and she looked up  haughtily at the speaker. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder <i>you</i> think so!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But since you ask, Mr. Stone, I will do the best I can.  My aunt was seated at her dressing-table, but not in her usual chair,&mdash;or  indeed, as if she were in any way attending to her toilette,&mdash;but in an easy  chair, more as if she were sitting there in contemplation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was she given to such indications of vanity?&rdquo;  asked Stone, in a gentle way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. My aunt was not a beautiful woman,  and she had no illusions about her personal appearance. I have never known her  to look at herself in a mirror more than was necessary for her dressing. Her  maid will tell you this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, please, Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I saw my aunt, she was sitting placidly,  even smilingly,&mdash;and I did not, for a moment, imagine she was not alive. Then I  noticed her large tortoise-shell comb was broken to bits, and I noticed, too,  her rigid, staring face. The next few moments are a confused memory to me, but  I know I touched her hand and felt it cold, then I called to Mr. Haviland and  he came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me of your aunt&rsquo;s garb. I understand it  was most unusual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only in the accessories. The gown she had on  was a neglig&eacute;e of Oriental make and fabric, elaborate, but one of which she was  fond and which she had worn several times. Round her shoulders was a scarf, one  of those heavy Syrian ones, of net patterned with silver. Then, she had on quantities  of jewelry. Not only her pearls, and a few pins, which she had worn during the  evening, but she had added many brooches and bracelets and rings of great value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was wearing, let us say, a hundred thousand  dollars&rsquo; worth of jewelry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Far more than that. Her pearls alone are worth  that amount. Her diamond sunburst is valued at fifty thousand dollars and her  emerald brooch is equally valuable. My aunt believed in gems as an investment,  and though she usually kept them in a safe deposit vault, she had recently  taken them from there, and had them all in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A strange proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very. I have never known such a thing to occur  before unless for some especial social occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the paper snake, of which I have been told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is the strangest part of all! My aunt was  not only afraid of live snakes, but she had also a perfect horror of any  picture or artificial representation of them. She could never, in her right  mind, have placed that paper snake about her own neck, nor would she have  allowed any one else to do it, without screaming out in horror. Yet, the  doctors declare it must have been placed round her neck before death.  Therefore, it is to me entirely unexplainable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is not that a bizarre clue that should make the  case an easy one?&rdquo; asked Anita, with an inquiring glance at Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; he replied, with a thoughtful  look at her. &ldquo;Where could such a snake have come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was brought by the burglar, of course,&rdquo; said  Pauline, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that; but where could it be  bought?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, at Vantine&rsquo;s or any Japanese shop,&rdquo; said  Pauline, &ldquo;or at some of the department stores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could you, by inquiry, find out if Miss  Carrington purchased it herself at any of those places?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could inquire; but I am sure, Mr. Stone, that  Aunt Lucy never bought such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would simplify matters somewhat if you would  kindly find out,&rdquo; and Stone nodded at her, as if to stamp this suggestion a  definite request.</p>
  <p>The conversation went on, and no one noticed  that so deftly did Fleming Stone guide it that only facts were brought out. No  sooner did any one begin to formulate an opinion or theory than he skilfully  turned the subject or changed the drift of the discussion.</p>
  <p>He gathered from facial expressions and manners  much that he wanted to know, he learned the attitudes of the various members of  the household toward each other, and he came to the conclusion that as Gray  Haviland had engaged him, and as he stood as business head of the estate by authority  of Carrington Loria, to Haviland should his reports be made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more of Mr. Loria,&rdquo; Stone said, at  last, after many matters had been discussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He and I are children of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s two sisters,&rdquo;  said Pauline. &ldquo;Our parents all died when we were young children and Aunt Lucy  brought us both up. Carr, as we call him, lived with us, except for his college  terms, until four years ago. Then he had an opportunity to go to Egypt and  engage in excavation and ancient research work. He is absorbed in it, and has  been home only twice in the four years. It was planned that my aunt and I  should go to Egypt next month on a pleasure trip, and both he and we looked  forward eagerly to it. Miss Frayne was to accompany us, and Mr. Haviland also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it your intention to abandon the trip?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speaking for myself, Mr. Stone, no,&rdquo; and  Pauline looked determined. &ldquo;I cannot answer for the others, but it seems to me  that such a visit to my cousin would be not only right and proper for me, but  the only way for me to find relief and distraction from these dreadful scenes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go, I assume,&rdquo; said Stone, gently, &ldquo;until  the murderer of your aunt is apprehended with certainty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; and suddenly Pauline flushed  rosily and looked distinctly embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather not!&rdquo; declared Anita, with an unpleasant  glance, and Fleming Stone made haste to introduce a new phase of the subject.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>XII<br>
    Estelle&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>At the invitation of Haviland, Fleming Stone was  a house guest at Garden Steps. Pauline had raised objections to this, but with  Carr Loria&rsquo;s authority back of him, Gray had insisted, and Pauline unwillingly consented.</p>
  <p>Stone himself recognized the fact that Pauline  disliked him, or at any rate disliked having him on the case, but he ignored it  and showed to her the same gracious manner and pleasant attitude that he showed  to all. Anita, on the other hand, seemed charmed with Stone. She lost no opportunity  to talk with him, and she used every endeavor to attract his attention to  herself. In fact, she tried to flirt with him, and much to the surprise of the  others, Stone seemed ready to meet her advances and respond to them.</p>
  <p>The morning after his arrival, breakfast over,  Stone announced his intention of making a thorough examination of Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s rooms, and asked that he be permitted to go alone for the purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If Mr. Hardy comes, send him up,&rdquo; he ordered,  as Haviland unlocked the door to give him admittance.</p>
  <p>Stone passed through the boudoir to the bedroom  and from that to the elaborate dressing-room and bath. Quickly he noted the  obvious details. Everything had been left practically untouched, and his rapid,  trained gaze took in the bed, turned down but not slept in; the toilet accessories  laid ready in the bathroom; and the fresh, unused towels, that proved the  unfortunate victim had not prepared to retire, but had, for some reason, donned  her jewels at that unusual hour.</p>
  <p>Back to the boudoir Stone went and made there  more careful scrutiny. Carefully he examined the white dust of powder on the  floor. At Hardy&rsquo;s orders, this had not been swept away, and Stone stood, with  folded arms, looking at it. He saw the place where the powder had been smeared about,&mdash;he  had been told of this,&mdash;but he saw other places where faint footprints were to  his keen eye discernible. Not sufficiently clear to judge much of their  characteristics, but enough to show that a stockinged foot had imprinted them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you make of the tracks?&rdquo; asked  Hardy, coming in upon his meditations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their tale is a short one but clear,&rdquo; returned  Stone, smiling a greeting to the younger detective. &ldquo;As you see, they go out of  the room only, they don&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proving?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the intruder came in at the door,  accomplished his dreadful purpose, and then, stepped around here in front of  his victim,&mdash;here where the powder is spilt, and then went straight out of the  room. Why did he do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He heard something to frighten him off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He saw something that frightened him. I doubt  if he heard anything. But he dropped his black-jack and fled. Did you bring the  photographs of the scene?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, here they are.&rdquo; Hardy handed over a sheaf  of the gruesome pictures, and Stone scanned them eagerly. Yet their  gruesomeness lay largely in the idea that the subject of them was not a living  person,&mdash;for in appearance they were by no means unpleasant to look at. The face  of Miss Carrington was serene and smiling, her wide-open eyes, though staring,  were filled with a life-like wonder, not at all an expression of fright or terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; volunteered Hardy, &ldquo;she was sitting  here, admiring herself, and happily smiling, when the villain sneaked up behind  her and gave her that crack over the head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she was already dead when she was hit on  the head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So the doctors think, but I believe they&rsquo;re  mistaken. Why, there&rsquo;s no theory that would account for hitting a dead person!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet, that is what happened. No, Hardy, the  doctors are not mistaken about the hour of death, and about the poison in her  system and all that. But the most obvious and most important clue, for the  moment, is that black-jack. Just where was it found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right here, Mr. Stone, under the edge of this  couch. Hidden on purpose, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I think not. Dropped by the burglar,  rather, when he was startled by something unexpected. You see, he doubtless  stood here, where the powder is dusted about, and to drop the thing quickly, it  would fall or be flung just there where it was found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but what scared him, if he didn&rsquo;t hear  anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something that frightened him so terribly that  he fled without taking the jewels he had come for! Something that made him make  quick, straight tracks for the door and downstairs and out, by the way he had  entered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good lord! Say, Mr. Stone, you think it was  that make-believe Count, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why make-believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, somehow, I feel sure he&rsquo;s a fake. He&rsquo;s not  the real thing,&mdash;or <i>I&rsquo;m</i> greatly  mistaken!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see that glove found in her hand. Have  you it with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy had brought some of the exhibits held by  the police, and, taking the glove from his bag, he handed it to Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>Stone looked at the glove hastily, but, raising  it to his nose, smelled of it very carefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, returning it, &ldquo;no, the Count is  not the man who wielded the black-jack. I&rsquo;m fairly certain of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed if I can see how you know by  smelling! By the way, Mr. Stone, I suppose you heard all about the conversation  that Miss Frayne related as taking place in this room after one o&rsquo;clock that  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve read the full account of it. What do  you think about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it was the Count, talking to Miss  Carrington before he killed her. He has a very low voice, and speaks almost  inaudibly always. Then, you see, he is down in her will for ten thousand  dollars of those bonds, and he&rsquo;s very fond of pearls,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Who said he was fond of pearls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe you didn&rsquo;t hear about that. Why, Miss  Frayne remembered afterward, that another sentence she heard Miss Carrington  say was, &lsquo;I know how very fond you are of pearls.&rsquo; She forgot that speech in  her evidence, but found it afterward in the written account she had of what she  overheard at the door. And his Countship is fond of pearls. He talked a lot  about those the lady wore that last evening. He says himself pearls are a hobby  with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you really think the Count was in this room  that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely I do. It&rsquo;s no insult to the lady&rsquo;s  memory to say so. She had a right to receive him in her boudoir if she chose to  do so. It&rsquo;s no secret that she was trying to annex him, and he was not entirely  unwilling. You see,&mdash;the way I dope it out,&mdash;she had him up here to show off her stunning  jewels, and so tempt him on to a declaration that she couldn&rsquo;t seem to work him  up to otherwise. You know she said, &lsquo;To-morrow these may all be yours, if you  will only&mdash;&rsquo; or some words to that effect. What could all that mean, except as I&rsquo;ve  indicated? And she said, &lsquo;You are the game I&rsquo;m after,&rsquo;&mdash;those weren&rsquo;t the words,  I know, but it meant that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However, I can&rsquo;t think the Count struck that  awful blow that fractured her skull. Villain he may be, even a murderous one,  but that black-jack business, to my mind, points to a lower type of brain, a  more thick-skinned criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone spoke musingly, looking about the room as  he talked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could it be,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that she was talking  to herself? or, say, to a picture,&mdash;a photograph of somebody? I don&rsquo;t see any  photographs about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both men looked around, but there were no  portraits to be seen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; said Hardy: &ldquo;most women have photographs  of their family or relatives all over the place. Not even one of Miss Stuart or  of her nephew, Loria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, nor any of absent friends or school-mates.&rdquo;  Stone looked over all the silver paraphernalia of the dressing-table and other  tables for even a small framed photograph that might have escaped notice, but  found none. On the walls hung only gilt-framed water colors or photographs of  famous bits of art or architecture in dark wood frames. Many of these were of old  world masterpieces, Italian cathedrals or Egyptian temples. Others were a  well-known Madonna, a Venus of Milo, and one at which Hardy exclaimed, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a  sure enough peach! Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Cleopatra, starting on her Nile trip,&rdquo;  said Stone, smiling at Hardy&rsquo;s evident admiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis, eh? Then Loria brought it to her. He&rsquo;s  daffy over anything Egyptian. And he&rsquo;s mighty generous. The house is full of  the stuff he brings or sends over; and it&rsquo;s his money, Mr. Stone, that pays  your damages. Miss Stuart, now, she&rsquo;s none too free-handed, they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Fleming Stone paid little heed to this  gossip. He was studying the photographs of the dead lady as being of far more  interest than pictures on the boudoir walls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that maid?&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;the one  who brought the breakfast tray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the sanatorium,&rdquo; returned Hardy; &ldquo;we  told you that, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. But where? Can I see her?  Now, at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. It&rsquo;s right near here. A  small private affair, only a few patients. They needn&rsquo;t really have sent her,  but she carried on so, Miss Stuart wouldn&rsquo;t have her about any longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, let us go there.&rdquo; As he spoke, Fleming  Stone left the room, and without waiting for the hurrying Hardy, ran  downstairs, and was in the hall, getting into his great coat when the other joined  him.</p>
  <p>So great was Hardy&rsquo;s faith in his superior, and  so anxious was he to watch his methods, that he donned his own overcoat without  a word, and the two set forth.</p>
  <p>It was only a short walk, and on the way, Stone  looked about in every direction, asking innumerable questions about the  neighboring houses and their occupants.</p>
  <p>After passing several large and handsome  estates, they came to a district of less elaborate homes, and after that to a  section of decidedly poorer residences. At one of these, Stone stared hard, but  not till they were well past it, did he inquire who lived there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; replied Hardy; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sort of  boarding-house, I think, for the lower classes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Stone, and they went on.</p>
  <p>At the sanatorium they found Estelle. She was not  hysterical now, but was in a sort of apathetic mood, and listless of manner.</p>
  <p>Stone spoke to her with polite address, and a  manner distinctly reassuring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be much better for you, Estelle,&rdquo; he  said, pleasantly, &ldquo;if you will speak the truth. Better for you, and better for&mdash;you  know whom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His significant tone roused her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  who you mean,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do! somebody whose name begins  with H, or B, or S.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any one beginning with S,&rdquo; and  Estelle frowned defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But some one with&mdash;&rdquo; Stone leaned forward, and  in the tense pause that followed, Estelle&rsquo;s lips half formed a silent &lsquo;B&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Stone, as if he had not paused. &ldquo;If  you will tell the whole truth, it will be better for Bates in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Estelle began to tremble. &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;  she cried out, and showed signs of hysteria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know a great deal,&rdquo; said Stone, gravely, &ldquo;and,  unless assisted by what you know, my knowledge will bring trouble to your  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want me to tell you?&rdquo; and Estelle,  now on her guard, spoke slowly and clearly, but her fingers were nervously  twining themselves in and out of her crumpled handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only your own individual part in the  proceedings. The rest we will learn from Bates himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know it was Bates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have learned much since you left Garden  Steps,&rdquo; and now Stone spoke a little more sternly. Hardy looked at him in  wonder. Who was this Bates, clearly implicated in the murder, and known to  Estelle?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Haviland saw you go down to open  the window for him to come in,&rdquo; Stone went on, as casually as if he were  retailing innocent gossip. &ldquo;Did you go down again and close it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said I opened it yet,&rdquo; and Estelle  flashed an irate glance at her questioner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but you will do so when you realize how  necessary it is. I tell you truly, when I say that only your honesty now can  save your friend Bates from the electric chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Estelle shuddered and began to cry violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That only makes matters worse,&rdquo; said Stone  patiently. &ldquo;Listen to me. This is your only chance to save Bates&rsquo; life. If I go  to the police with what I know, they will convict him of the murder beyond all  doubt. If you tell me what I ask,&mdash;I think, I hope, between us, we can prove  that he did not do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; and Estelle looked up with hope  dawning in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> think not. Now there&rsquo;s no time to waste. Tell me what I ask or you will lose  your chance to do so. You opened the living-room window for Bates to come in,  at about three o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And went down and closed and fastened it at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; came in lowest tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not knowing that Miss Carrington was dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>No!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;For Bates went there only to steal the jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, when you took the breakfast tray, and found  the lady&mdash;as you did find her&mdash;you were frightened out of your wits, and dropped  the tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, to shield Bates, who you thought had  killed her, you lied right and left, even trying to incriminate Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen Bates since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And until now you have thought he killed your  mistress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another thing, Estelle; you put bromide in the  glass of milk in order that Miss Carrington might sleep soundly, and not hear  Bates come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t drink that milk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you fixed it, thinking she would?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Come on, Hardy.&rdquo; and somewhat  unceremoniously, Stone took leave, and made for the nearest telephone station.</p>
  <p>After that, matters whizzed. Stone had called  the Police Headquarters and asked that an officer be sent with a warrant for  the arrest of Bates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know where he is?&rdquo; asked Hardy,  nearly bursting with curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but at least I know where to  start looking for him,&rdquo; Stone replied, as the two went back the way they had  come.</p>
  <p>Stone stopped at the boarding-house he had  noticed on the way to the sanatorium, and rang the bell.</p>
  <p>Sure enough, Bates lived there and Bates was at  home.</p>
  <p>At Stone&rsquo;s first questions he broke down and  confessed to the assault with the black-jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t kill her!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;she was  already dead! Oh, my God! can I ever forget those terrible, staring eyes! The  saints forgive me! I was half crazy. There she was, dead, and yet smiling and  happy looking! Oh, sir, what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>XIII<br>
    Bates, The Burglar</b></h2>
  <p>Brought before the magistrate, Bates told a  coherent though amazing story.</p>
  <p>It seems he was Estelle&rsquo;s lover, and had long  ago persuaded her to let him know when Miss Carrington had a quantity of  jewelry in the house, that he might essay a robbery. The plan was simple.  Estelle had promised to slip downstairs at three o&rsquo;clock and raise a window for  his entrance, and later, but before any one else was about, she was to slip  down and lock it again. In the meantime, they assumed, the burglary would be quietly  accomplished, their supposition being that Miss Carrington would be asleep in  her bedroom, and the boudoir easy of access.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You entered by the window, then, at what time?&rdquo;  asked Stone, who was doing most of the questioning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At quarter of four in the morning,&rdquo; replied  Bates, and all noted that this was shortly before the hour when Mrs.  Frothingham saw through her field-glass a man leaving by the same window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You went directly up the stairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; Estelle had often told me the lay of the  rooms, and I went straight to the lady&rsquo;s boodore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You carried with you a &lsquo;black-jack.&rsquo; Did you  have murder in your heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I did not! I took that, thinkin&rsquo; if the  lady woke up and screamed, I&rsquo;d just give her a tap that would put her to sleep  without hurtin&rsquo; her at all, at all. I&rsquo;m no murderer, Sir, and I&rsquo;m confessin&rsquo; my  attempt at burglary, and&mdash;and assault, so I won&rsquo;t be accused of a greater crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Bates, it&rsquo;ll be better for you to  be perfectly truthful. Now, what did you see when you entered the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had stepped inside and shut the door before I  saw anything, and then, I turned to see the lady&rsquo;s face, but in the mirror. I  was behind her, and in the glass I saw her smilin&rsquo; face, and of course, I  thought she was alive, and that she saw me. I knew she&rsquo;d scream in a minute,  and the sight of all the jewels gleamin&rsquo; on her neck drove me fair crazy with greed,  I suppose, and I up with my sandbag, and hit her head, not meanin&rsquo; to hit hard  enough to kill her, but only to knock her unconscious-like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The blow smashed the big comb she was wearin&rsquo;  but she didn&rsquo;t move nor fall over. She was leanin&rsquo; back in her big chair, and  she jest sat there, and kept on smilin&rsquo;. My knees shook like the ague, for I  thought it was magic, or that my eyes was deceivin&rsquo; me. There was no sound  anywhere, and I stood starin&rsquo; at that smilin&rsquo; face and she starin&rsquo; back at me!  I nearly screamed out myself! But I bucked up, and thinkin&rsquo; that she was struck  unconscious so quick, her face didn&rsquo;t change, I made to take off some of the  jewels I was after. I touched her neck and it was cold! The lady was dead! Had  been dead some time, I was sure, &lsquo;cause she was so cold and stiff. I trembled  all over, but my only thought then was to get out. Not for a million dollars  would I touch them sparklers! There ain&rsquo;t often a burglar who is ghoul enough  to rob a corpse! Leastways, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not.  I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m a tough and a bad egg generally, but I wouldn&rsquo;t steal  from no corpse! Not I!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you left the house at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I did, as fast as my tremblin&rsquo; legs could  get me downstairs. I was clean daft. I couldn&rsquo;t make it out and I didn&rsquo;t try. I  thought it was the Devil&rsquo;s own work, somehow, but how, I didn&rsquo;t know. My mind  was full, makin&rsquo; my escape. I ran like the old boy was after me, and reachin&rsquo;  home, I hid under me bedclothes and groaned all night. Full a week went by, and  I begun to breathe easy, thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d never be suspected of a hand in it, when  up comes this gentleman, and says I done it. Well, I&rsquo;ve told the truth now, and  I&rsquo;m relieved to get it off my chest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bates heaved a deep sigh, as of a man eased of a  great burden. His whole story bore the stamp of truth, and his manner of  telling was straightforward and earnest. Nor was there reason for doubt. Though  a startling tale, it entirely explained many of the strange conditions that had  seemed so bewildering. It would never have occurred to Bates nor to any one to  make up such a yarn, and what else could have deterred him from the  contemplated robbery but the superstition that makes even the most hardened  criminals refuse to steal from a dead person? Therefore, the narrative was  accepted as probably true, and Bates was taken to the Tombs to await further  proceedings against him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder!&rdquo; said Gray Haviland, as, that  same afternoon, he discussed the matter with Fleming Stone. &ldquo;Would you mind  telling me how you went straight to the criminal and walked him off to jail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was practically a bit of luck,&rdquo; and Stone  smiled. &ldquo;It was the black-jack that gave me the clue. If the fellow hadn&rsquo;t  dropped that in his fright, we might never have traced him. Though we would  perhaps have found him eventually, through the maid, Estelle. She is not good  at keeping things secret. However, he did drop the weapon, and it led straight  to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the thing smelled strongly of creosote.  Now, it was made from a bit of old cloth that looked like a piece of some  discarded garment,&mdash;a man&rsquo;s coat, say. If the odor had been camphor or moth  balls, I should have assumed a garment laid away in storage, but creosote is  not used for that purpose. So I deduced a house recently remodeled by use of a  certain kind of shingles. I know that the odor of those shingles clings to everything  in the house for months. It is almost ineradicable. So I looked about for a  house lately reshingled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not a new house?&rdquo; asked Hardy, who was  present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A point well taken,&rdquo; said Stone, nodding  approval, &ldquo;but in a new house the odor often is dispelled before the people  move in. In a remodeled house, the furnishings stay there during the work and  so are deeply impregnated with that unmistakable smell of creosote. At any  rate, I worked on that, and when I found that a newly shingled old house was a boarding-house  of the type Bates would be likely to live in, I went there to see, and found  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but how did you know there was such a  person as Bates? Where did you get his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From your cook,&rdquo; returned Stone, simply. &ldquo;I  concluded there was no doubt that Estelle had let the man in and relocked the  window afterward. So I deduced a friend of the girl&rsquo;s so dear to her that she  would do this for him. I asked the cook, Mrs. Haskins, as to Estelle&rsquo;s admirers  and learned that there were two, Bates and Higgins. Mrs. Haskins couldn&rsquo;t say  which one Estelle more favored, so I decided to try both. Bates&mdash;the cook told me&mdash;lived  in a boarding-house near here, and Higgins over in New York. So when I asked  Estelle a few leading questions I pretended to greater knowledge than I really  had. I spoke of a name beginning with either B, H, or S. She fell into the trap  and said quickly that she knew no one initialed S. Then I said, &lsquo;but beginning  with&mdash;&rsquo; and waited; she said no name, but involuntarily her lips form a silent &lsquo;B,&rsquo;  and I knew she had Bates in mind. The rest was easy. Bates, the boarding-house  and the shingles formed a combination too indicative to be merely coincidence. And  so we found him. And I, for one, believe his story. I know the strong superstition  that imbues those people concerning a corpse, and the unexpected discovery that  he had attacked one was enough to make that man beside himself. Indeed, it&rsquo;s a  wonder that he didn&rsquo;t himself make an outcry in his terror and fright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of your prowess in these matters,&rdquo;  said Haviland, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t look for such quick work as this. Why, you hadn&rsquo;t  even interviewed Estelle when you came to your conclusions about Bates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but remember, I have seen a full account of  all the evidence, not only at the inquest, but all that has been gathered by  the police and by Mr. Hardy here. Last night I read all this carefully, and it  was enlightening on these points that led up to to-day&rsquo;s work. But, now, I don&rsquo;t  mind telling you, Mr. Haviland, that a much more difficult and complicated  problem faces us, to discover who gave to Miss Carrington the poison that  killed her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you any suspicions?&rdquo; and Gray looked the  Detective straight in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not, as yet,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone returned  the steady gaze. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gray Haviland hesitated. Then he said: &ldquo;I would  rather not answer that question, Mr. Stone. If I should have suspicions, and  they should be unjust or ill-founded, is it not better to leave them  unmentioned, even to you? You are here to discover the criminal. I can not  think my suspicions, if I have any, could help you, but they might easily  hinder you by wrong suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Haviland, just as you please.  But I assume you will tell me frankly anything you may know or learn in the way  of direct evidence bearing on the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, certainly.&rdquo; But though Haviland&rsquo;s words  were a definite promise, his tone and manner seemed hesitant, and a trifle  vague.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I to have the privilege of working with you,  Mr. Stone?&rdquo; inquired Hardy, his heart beating tumultuously lest he receive a  negative answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you care to. And if you are willing to work  in my way. I am somewhat impatient of interference or questioning. But, if you  want to assist in investigating, under my absolute orders, I shall be glad to  have you do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing was further from Hardy&rsquo;s mind than to  interfere or to show any undue curiosity concerning the work or methods of the  great Detective. He was more than content to watch silently, to run errands,  and to make himself useful in any way desired by his superior. He said this, and  Stone nodded indulgently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall begin with this matter of the arrest of  Count Charlier,&rdquo; said Stone, as he looked over his note-book. &ldquo;Either that man  is the guilty party or he is not. If not, he must be released. If so, it must  be proven. What do you know of his history, Mr. Haviland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little, Mr. Stone. In the first place, I  doubt his right to the title he assumes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do? And why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Haviland looked a little embarrassed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  sure I know why. But he doesn&rsquo;t act like a real Count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? And how do real Counts act, I mean in ways  that differ from this man&rsquo;s habits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having fun with me, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and Gray  blushed like a school-boy. &ldquo;But I mean it. It&rsquo;s this way. I&rsquo;m not a Count, but  if I wanted to pretend I was, I&rsquo;d act just as Count Charlier does. There!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s definite, at least. Now make it a  little more so by describing some of these actions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Haviland&rsquo;s brow wrinkled, &ldquo;well, to  begin with, his manners are too slick and polished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A traditional trait of Frenchmen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if real. But his seem artificially,  purposely,&mdash;oh, <i>fakely</i> polished! Have  you seen him, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you do, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. He has  shifty eyes, and he rubs his hands together, and if he&rsquo;s standing, he half bows  with every sentence he utters, and he smirks instead of smiling, and his whole  attitude is a fifty-fifty of apology and bumptiousness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo! You&rsquo;ve given a graphic picture of him at  all events. I&rsquo;ll reserve further consideration of his personality until I have  seen him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You believe implicitly all that story of Bates,  do you, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; and Haviland looked dubiously at the Detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, at present. If anything turns up to  disprove any part of it I may have to revise my ideas. But just now, it seems  to me that Bates told the simple truth. To be sure, he only told it because he  feared an accusation of murder, and he knew that to confess to the lesser crime  would go far to help him deny the greater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right. But might there not be  collusion between Friend Count and Bates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Collusion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; and Gray shook his head doggedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  a vague idea that Frenchy is mixed up in this thing somehow. Now, he couldn&rsquo;t  possibly have administered the poison, himself, personally, nor could he have struck  the blow personally, but couldn&rsquo;t he have hired the man Bates to do it for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the face of things, Mr. Haviland, does that  look plausible? Is the Count, as you describe him, a man who would engage a  burglar of the Bates type to commit a brutal crime? Again, if Bates were merely  the Count&rsquo;s tool, would he not, when caught, pass the blame on to his employer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He sure would! You are right, Mr. Stone, those  two never hooked up together! It&rsquo;s out of the question. But as Estelle and  Bates are in cahoots, why didn&rsquo;t she give Miss Carrington the poison, herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she did fix the bromide, hoping to make  her mistress sleep soundly. But the lady never took it. Now, if the maid had  given or expected to give the poison, why the bromide at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, look here,&rdquo; broke in Hardy, &ldquo;mightn&rsquo;t it  be that Estelle did do the poisoning and arranged the bromide as a blind, to  put us off the track, exactly as it has done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s small use speculating about that  poison,&rdquo; said Stone thoughtfully, &ldquo;we must go at that systematically. We must  find out where it was bought and by whom. People can&rsquo;t go round buying deadly  poison without a record being made of the sale. We must inquire of druggists, until  we find out these facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no druggist about here who would sell  aconitine,&rdquo; said Hardy, &ldquo;it doubtless was bought in New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, of course, adds to the difficulty of  tracing the sale, but it must be done. Mr. Hardy, I will ask you to do all you  can to find out about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You want to look up a French apothecary,&rdquo;  advised Haviland. &ldquo;That Count is at the bottom of this, as sure as shootin&rsquo;,  and he&rsquo;s full clever enough to hide his tracks mighty closely. Why, that man is  a fortune-hunter and an adventurer, and he wanted that ten thousand dollars,  and he poisoned Miss Lucy to get it! That&rsquo;s what he did! And he was on deck  that night, after the jewels, that&rsquo;s where he was! It was he in that room  talking, it was he who left his glove there,&mdash;of course, he didn&rsquo;t know it,&mdash;and  now you&rsquo;ve got him under lock and key, I hope you&rsquo;ll keep him there, and not  let this Bates discovery get him the slip. If the two were not working  together, then, surely they are incriminated separately, and you want to look  into the case of little old Mr. Count!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right, Mr. Haviland,&rdquo; and Fleming  Stone smiled at him, &ldquo;but I think you are assuming a lot because of your  prejudice against the Frenchman. Was he very attentive to Miss Carrington? Had  he proposed marriage to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t know. Of course, we had all been  afraid he would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t want my cousin to marry an  adventurer. Of course, he only wanted her fortune, and as her business manager,  I had a right to interfere, or at least, to look after her interests enough to  prevent that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But was she not a capable woman, who could be  supposed to know her own mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, yes. But, there&rsquo;s no use mincing  matters. Miss Carrington greatly desired to marry. However, she paid no  attention to men whom she did not consider interesting. There were several such,  and she sent them packing. The Count, though, she took to at once, partly  because of his title and partly because,&mdash;well, he has a way with him. He  flattered her, and she took the bait like a hungry fish!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>XIV<br>
    Who Gave The Poison?</b></h2>
  <p>Though Fleming Stone&rsquo;s acumen and quick  perception had led to a swift apprehension of Bates, his next steps were not  taken so rapidly. He spent much time in the boudoir of Miss Carrington, as if  striving to make the walls tell what their traditional ears had heard.</p>
  <p>The upset breakfast tray had been removed, but  nothing else disturbed. Estelle had owned up, after Bates&rsquo; arrest, that she did  drop the tray, in her fright at the sight of the dead lady, and that she  afterward denied it lest she be suspected of wrong-doing.</p>
  <p>The plate that had contained sandwiches was  still on the bedside table, but the glass of milk, with bromide in, had been  carried away.</p>
  <p>Stone looked at the empty plate, and wondered.  Had the poison been placed in the sandwiches? By Estelle? By anybody else? Who  had had opportunity? Estelle had brought the sandwiches and milk to the  bedroom, according to her usual custom, when she prepared the bed for the  night. A tiny serviette had been over the sandwiches, and was still there  beside the plate. Stone looked at it. A mere wisp of fine linen, with a  monogrammed corner. The few wrinkles in it showed clearly to Stone&rsquo;s sharp eyes  the dainty touch of fingers that had held the caviare sandwich. It undoubtedly  denoted that Miss Carrington had eaten the sandwich. Had any one merely removed  it, the napkin would have been uncreased. He had been told that she rarely ate  this night luncheon, though it was always placed for her. Why had she partaken  of it on that particular night? Had some one advised her to? Or urged it? Had  the Count really visited her in the boudoir, and having previously arranged the  poisoned sandwich, made sure that it would perform its deadly mission? Could he  have entered the room unknown to the rest of the household?</p>
  <p>Stone went to the window. Yes, that matter was  easy enough. A balcony outside the long French window was connected with the  lower verandah by a spiral staircase. Any one could run up the steps and be  admitted to the boudoir in perfect secrecy. Stone wondered for a moment why  Bates hadn&rsquo;t entered that way, and quickly realized that for a marauder to  appear at the window would have frightened Miss Carrington and caused an  outcry. The entrance of the Count, however, whether expected or not, would be easily  effected.</p>
  <p>If the Count were really guilty, the  circumstances were all explicable. Suppose Miss Carrington had made the  appointment. Would she not, in her vanity, have donned the beautiful boudoir  gown and the jewels to appear attractive in his eyes? And, supposing she had  playfully caught his glove as he removed it, and had half-unconsciously  continued to hold it. Then the conversation alleged to have been overheard by  Miss Frayne would have been addressed to him, and the remarks would be, at  least, intelligible.</p>
  <p>The snake? Ah, yes, the snake. As to that there  was no hint, no clue of any sort. But then, the thing was so inexplicable, that  the explanation <i>must </i>be easy. A clue  so strange, so bizarre, must lead somewhere. That could be left to the future.  Now, he must decide on his first steps.</p>
  <p>The decision took him to call on Doctor Stanton,  and the physician welcomed him warmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sit  down, sir, sit down. I&rsquo;ve been wanting a talk with you ever since I heard of  your arrival. So you&rsquo;ve ferreted out the burglar already! Great work, great  work indeed! And now for the real murderer. You see, sir, I&rsquo;m up to the minute  in my information regarding this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad to know it,&rdquo; returned Stone. &ldquo;Now, Doctor  Stanton, I hope you can help me. I don&rsquo;t mind admitting the thing has its  baffling aspects. The burglar was easily traced, and easily disposed of. The  real work, as you say, is just beginning. Will you, sir, tell me all you know  of the poison that killed Miss Carrington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, Mr. Stone. The autopsy showed a fatal  dose of aconitine. Aconite, as you of course know, is the herb, wolfsbane, of  the Hellebore tribe, all the species of which are poisonous. Aconitine is an  intensely poisonous alkaloid obtained from aconite. Taken in a moderate  quantity, it acts as a powerful sedative, but the dose absorbed by Miss  Carrington was undoubtedly fatal within half or three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she died at what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proving she took the poison at about quarter or  half after one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; thereabouts. It is not possible to fix  these hours precisely, but the poison was administered positively between one  and two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Administered? You do not think then, that she  took it herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most certainly not! Miss Carrington has been in  my care, professionally, for many years. I knew her very well, and I know  nobody more opposed to medicine in any form or drugs of any sort. It was a most  difficult task to persuade her to take even the simplest remedy, and then she  had to be assured over and over again that it was harmless. No, Mr. Stone,  nothing could have made her take that dose of her own accord, nor could any one  have persuaded her to take it, consciously. It was, without doubt, given to her  secretly, by the clever ruse of the murderer. Of course it could not have been an  accident. The marvelous part is, to my mind, how any one secured the poison. It  is not an easy matter to buy aconitine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then that ought to make it easier to trace. If  the public could easily procure it at will, there would be greater difficulty  in running down the purchaser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so; and yet, I think your search will  be a hard one. How shall you go about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By canvassing the drug shops of the city, and  of the small towns as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be you can trace the sale. But if it was  bought under promise of secrecy, and if that secrecy were well paid for&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, there is the difficulty. But what&rsquo;s a  detective for if not to find out secrets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite right. May your quest succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, a little more about the action of this  poison. What are the immediate effects of a fatal dose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a few moments there occurs a tingling  numbness of lip and tongue and pharynx. The numbness increases and affects all  the muscles and death ensues inside of an hour. This paralyzing effect renders  it impossible for the victim to cry out, and there are no convulsions. The body  remains calm and undisturbed, and the eyes open. A dilatation of the pupil  takes place, but the expression on the face remains as in life. This is why Miss  Carrington continued to look happy and smiling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And proves that when she took the poison she  was happy and smiling, and therefore in no way terrorized or frightened into  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly so. And that indicates that she didn&rsquo;t  know she was taking it,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or, that it was administered by some one she  knew and loved and had all confidence in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; and Doctor Stanton&rsquo;s fine  old face showed a sad apprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How was it taken,&mdash;in what medium?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we can&rsquo;t tell to a certainty. There were  traces of the sandwiches discovered at the autopsy, but, though the poison  could have been given her, concealed in a sandwich filling, it is improbable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the white granules or powder, which are  soluble in water, would be more easily discerned in solid food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, on the other hand, it could be  unostentatiously placed in a sandwich, with little fear of detection; but to  prevail on her to swallow a solution,&mdash;it is bitter, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, slightly so. I admit, I cannot imagine any  one inducing Miss Carrington to swallow such a draught. Therefore, it may well  be, it was placed in a sandwich. The filling, they tell me, was caviare, which  would disguise the bitterness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And does not all this, if true, point to some  one exceedingly familiar with all the details of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s affairs?  Some one who knew of her nightly sandwich? And, also, does it not imply the  presence of some one who could and did insure her consumption of that sandwich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would indeed seem so, Mr. Stone; but when it  comes to discussing such a question as that, I must ask to be allowed to retire  from the field. It is my duty to tell all I know, from my medical experience,  but further than that I am not obliged to express any opinions or voice any suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know, however, that Count Charlier is held  pending investigation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it. I have no opinion to express.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone rather admired this gentleman of  the old school, whose courtesy was evident, but equally so his determination to  say only what justice demanded of his profession.</p>
  <p>And then, like a flash, the reason came to him.  Doctor Stanton suspected, or at least feared to suspect some member of the  Carrington household.</p>
  <p>Of course, this was not a new idea to Fleming  Stone. He had mentally gone over the possibility of every one in the family and  all of the servants at Garden Steps, but so far he had held his mind open for  impressions rather than to formulate theories himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, to sum up, doctor,&rdquo; he said, as he rose  to go, &ldquo;you assure me that you consider it out of the question that Miss Carrington  took the aconitine herself, say, as a headache cure, or something, intending  only a small curative dose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely impossible, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed the old  gentleman, almost angrily; &ldquo;to begin with, Miss Carrington never had headaches,  and if she had she would have borne any amount of suffering from them before  she would have touched a drug or a medicinal remedy of any sort. And, aside from  all that, how could she get aconitine? It is not to be bought for the asking at  any druggist&rsquo;s! No, sir, my conscience makes me insist on that point, Miss  Carrington never took that poison knowingly,&mdash;either by accident or design. It  was given to her, without her knowledge, by a very, very clever villain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again, then, could it have been given her  innocently, by mistake? I mean, if some one, her maid, or any friend, had  wanted to give her a sedative, and meant only a light dose, but by error in  quantity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir! Not a chance! The amount given was too  great to be an error. And every one in that house knows better than ever to  have attempted to give medicine in any form or degree or for any purpose to  Miss Lucy Carrington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was crime, then,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, &ldquo;black  crime. And as such, it must be discovered and punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Doctor Stanton, but he spoke with  deep sadness and as one who feared where or toward whom such discoveries might  lead.</p>
  <p>From the doctor&rsquo;s house Stone went to see the  Count.</p>
  <p>That elegant gentleman was highly irate at being  detained against his will in such plain quarters as The Tombs furnished, but he  was not as belligerent or vindictive as Stone expected to find him.</p>
  <p>Hasty work on the part of the detectives from  the District Attorney&rsquo;s office had resulted in his imprisonment, but the later  development of Bates&rsquo; share in the matter made it extremely probable that the  Count might soon be released from custody.</p>
  <p>Pleasantly enough the two men conversed, and  Count Charlier gave the impression of one glad of help from an outside source.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is such absurdity,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;to think I  would in any way wish harm to the lady. Why, I admired her above all, and it  was my hope that she would do me the honor to accept my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honestly, Count Charlier?&rdquo; and Stone looked at  him with a man-to-man glance that caused the Count to hesitate in his protestations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I was considering the matter in my own  mind. You know, Mr. Stone, it is a great responsibility, this seeking a wife.  And Miss Carrington was not&mdash;not in her first youth. Of a fact, her years  outnumbered my own. So, I asked myself was it wise, was it altogether just to  the lady to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind all that, Count,&rdquo; said Stone, a  little impatiently, &ldquo;just give me a few details of that evening, so far as your  actions were concerned. You were at the house till midnight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Illsley and I left together. We had  spent the evening there at cards and music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had had any private conversation with Miss  Carrington during the evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we walked alone in the conservatory for a  time,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You proposed marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly that,&mdash;but I may have hinted at such  an event.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the lady seemed agreeable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely so. If I may say it, she met my  advances half-way, and I could not misunderstand her feeling toward my unworthy  self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She spoke to you of money matters? Of her will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, to my surprise, she told me she had  bequeathed to me ten thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was not this a strange bequest to a casual  acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we were more than casual acquaintances. I  have known Miss Carrington for two or three months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which? two or three?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps nearer two,&rdquo; and the Count showed a  slight embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do your friends often leave you large sums of  money on such short acquaintance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has never happened before,&rdquo; and now the  Count&rsquo;s dignity was touched and he spoke shortly and coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, of course, it struck you as peculiar,&rdquo;  and Stone&rsquo;s smile assumed an acquiescence.</p>
  <p>But the Count returned: &ldquo;Not at all. Miss  Carrington was an unusual woman, and I never expected her behavior to be  entirely conventional. When she told me of this I was simply and honestly  grateful, as I should have been to any one who showed me such a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were glad to get the money, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; the Count exclaimed, with  sparkling eyes, then realizing his slip, he hastily added: &ldquo;that is, I was glad  of the knowledge that it would come to me some day. Surely I did not want the  lady to die, that I might receive it, but I was pleased to know she thought  enough of me to make the direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she mean by saying &lsquo;To-morrow all will  be different&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I do not know. Could she have meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did say it, then? You admit she said it to  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Breathlessly, Fleming Stone waited the answer.  Miss Carrington had said this to the person who was with her behind her closed  door at one o&rsquo;clock! Could the Count be going to incriminate himself?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to me only. She said it to all who were  present. It was while we were playing bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said it again to the man who killed her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of that I know nothing,&rdquo; said Count Charlier,  politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, inaudibly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>XV<br>
    Pauline&rsquo;s Purchase</b></h2>
  <p>Alone, Fleming Stone wrestled with the problem  of the giving of that poison.</p>
  <p>The library at Garden Steps had been turned over  to him for a study and no one entered the room unless summoned. Stone sat at  the mahogany table-desk, but his eyes rested unseeingly on the beautiful  fittings of polished silver and glass. On a memorandum block he wrote down the  names of possible and probable suspects. To be sure, he thought, every one in the  house might be deemed possible, as well as some who were not in the house. But  each one must be taken into consideration.</p>
  <p>To begin with the most important, Miss Stuart.  It was possible that she poisoned her aunt, but so improbable as to make it  exceedingly unlikely. True, she was heir to half the fortune, but well-bred,  well-nurtured young women do not commit crime to inherit their money sooner.  Except for that conversation reported by Anita Frayne, there was not a shred of  evidence against Miss Stuart. And Stone did not place implicit confidence in  that story of the talk behind closed doors. He had discovered that the two  girls were not friendly and he knew Anita capable of making up or coloring a  tale to suit herself. Pauline had told him that she was in the hall-window-seat  at one o&rsquo;clock that night and had seen Anita coming from Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  room. Or, to put it more carefully, she had seen her with her hand on the  door-knob, in the act of closing the door after her. This Pauline had told to  Stone, with an air of such verity and truthfulness that he was fain to believe  her. However, in all honesty, he had to admit to himself, that Miss Stuart <i>could</i> have given the poison in some  secret way, had she so desired. The same was true, though, of Miss Frayne, of  Haviland and of the various house-servants. But where could any of them get it?</p>
  <p>Again there were the Count and Mrs. Frothingham  to be considered. In fact, there were too many suspects to decide among,  without further evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; Stone asked of Hardy, who came in to  report.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;ve raked the drug shops  thoroughly, and there&rsquo;s no trace of a sale of aconitine. It&rsquo;s practically  impossible to buy such a substance. I mean, for the ordinary customer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet somebody did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But doesn&rsquo;t it limit the field of  search to realize that it couldn&rsquo;t have been a servant or either of the young  ladies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why neither of the young ladies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how could they get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not as well as any one else? And somebody  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then somebody stole it. Nobody bought it. I&rsquo;m  positive of that, now I&rsquo;ve learned how impossible it is to make such a  purchase. And how could those girls steal it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Hardy, but my point is, why  couldn&rsquo;t they steal it if anybody could? You&rsquo;re denying their ability to steal  the poison, because you don&rsquo;t want to suspect them. And neither do I, but we  must look this thing squarely in the face. Somebody managed to get that  aconitine and administer it to Miss Carrington secretly, and it is for us to  find out who did it,&mdash;<i>who could</i> do it,  in the face of almost insuperable obstacles. But it is futile to say this one  or that one could or couldn&rsquo;t do it. Now, since you&rsquo;ve found no trace of the  poison sale, let&rsquo;s start from some other point. Surely, this case, with its  unique circumstances, offers many ways to look for evidence. What strikes me  most forcibly is the costume of the lady. Not so much the gown,&mdash;I believe she  was fond of elaborate boudoir robes,&mdash;but the array of jewelry, the glittering  scarf and the snake. Most of all, the snake. That, of itself, ought to point directly  to the true solution, and I believe it does, only we&rsquo;re too blind to see it. I&rsquo;m  going to work on that snake clue, and to help, I wish you&rsquo;d go at once to all  the possible shops where it might have been bought. It may not be traceable and  then, again, it may. And, the strange fact of her sitting idly before the  mirror when she died! Whoever gave her the poison was there on the spot, must  have been,&mdash;for it&rsquo;s sure enough that she didn&rsquo;t take it herself, according to  the doctor&rsquo;s statements. Well, if the murderer was right there with her, and  she not only made no outcry but continued to look smiling and happy, it was surely  some one she knew and in whom she had all confidence. Perhaps this person urged  her to eat the sandwich,&mdash;oh, pshaw, that&rsquo;s all plausible enough,&mdash;but, the  snake! That&rsquo;s the bizarre clue that must lead somewhere. And it shall! I&rsquo;ll  ferret out the mystery of that paper snake or my name&rsquo;s not Stone! Go to it,  Hardy! Rake the Japanese shops and department stores, but find out who bought  it. It isn&rsquo;t old. I observed it was fresh and new. Those flimsy paper things  show handling mighty quickly. Find out who bought the thing, and we&rsquo;ve a start  in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy went off on his errand and Stone went over  to have a talk with Mrs. Frothingham.</p>
  <p>The widow was amiable but non-committal. She was  highly incensed at the arrest of the Count, but felt confident he would be  liberated in a few days. She replied warily to Stone&rsquo;s questions, but admitted  her presence in the house on the fatal evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, in a confidential way, &ldquo;I  was lonely. The Count had gone so often of late to Garden Steps, and I was  never invited, that I think I was a little jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of Miss Carrington?&rdquo; asked Stone, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frothingham, frankly; &ldquo;and of  Miss Stuart, and of the Count&rsquo;s intimacy over there. I had never even been in  the house. So I went over there and looked in the windows. I saw them playing  cards and later strolling about the rooms. The great door stood a little ajar  and I cautiously stepped inside. It was vulgarly curious, but it was no crime. As  I stood in the hall I saw some one approaching, and stepped up a few steps of  the staircase. It was all so beautiful that I looked at the tapestries and  decorations. I remember thinking that if any one challenged me, I should tell  the truth, and say that I came in to look, as a neighbor ought to have a right  to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the ethics of the case, Mrs.  Frothingham, stick to facts. Did you go upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed, only up four or five steps, just to  the turn of the staircase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Illsley saw you coming down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only those few steps. He couldn&rsquo;t have seen me  coming from the top of the stair, for I didn&rsquo;t go up so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You spoke of being jealous of Miss Stuart. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because Count Charlier is in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; he was making up to Miss Carrington for  her money, but he is really in love with Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frothingham shook her head doggedly, as if  determined to tell this, even though it should redound to the Count&rsquo;s  discredit. And it did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, &ldquo;that adds motive to  the theory of the Count&rsquo;s guilt. If he is in love with Miss Stuart, might he  not have been tempted to put Miss Carrington out of the way, that Miss Stuart  should inherit the fortune, and be the bride of his choice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes, that is a possibility,&rdquo; and  Fleming Stone saw at last, that this woman either suspected the Count&rsquo;s guilt  or wished to make it appear so.</p>
  <p>Again, the sudden thought struck him, suppose  she was so jealous of the Count&rsquo;s attentions to Miss Carrington, that she went  to Garden Steps with the intent of killing the lady. Suppose she did go  upstairs, although she denied it, and put the poison in the sandwich. Surely,  she had opportunity. Surely, she would now deny it.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone sighed. He hated a case where the  principal witnesses were women. One never could tell when they were lying. A  man, now, was much more transparent and his evidence more easily weighed.</p>
  <p>However, if this woman desired to turn suspicion  toward Count Charlier, it was either because she suspected him, or was  implicated herself. In either case, her word was not worth much, and Stone soon  took his leave to hunt a more promising field.</p>
  <p>Returning to Garden Steps, he found that Pauline  had received a letter from her cousin in Egypt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said, as she handed Stone the  letter to read, &ldquo;that my cousin Carr will think we are not accomplishing much.  Read the letter, Mr. Stone, and if you say so, I will ask Mr. Loria to come  home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Glad to read the letter from this half heir to  the Carrington fortune, Stone took the sheet. It ran:</p>
  <p>Dear Polly:</p>
  <p>The awful shock of Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s death leaves me  without words to tell you what I feel for you in your dark hours. What <i>can</i> I say in the face of such a horror?  I wish I were there with you to help you bear it all. For on you comes the  brunt of the publicity and all the harrowing details that must be attended to.  If you say so, I will return to America at once. But unless I can be of definite  assistance or real comfort to you, personally, I would rather not go over just  now. I&rsquo;m just starting on a wonderful piece of work here. No less than excavating&mdash;but  I won&rsquo;t take time to tell of it now. I&rsquo;ll write you about it later, if I don&rsquo;t  go to you. This is a short note to catch the mail, and reach you as soon as  possible. Remember, as I write, I have only your first two cables, and know  nothing of details. I eagerly await your letters. Why don&rsquo;t you follow out your  plan of coming over here in February? Leave all business matters in Haviland&rsquo;s  hands, and get away from the scene of the tragedy. Of course, as I cabled Gray,  get the best possible detective experts on the case. Spare no expense, and  charge all to me. Surely, we want to find and punish the slayer of Aunt Lucy,  and I repeat, if you, for any reason, want me to, I will come over at once.  Cable, and I will take the next steamer. If you don&rsquo;t do this, do write me long  letters and tell me everything that is happening. Poor Aunt Lucy. I know your  life with her wasn&rsquo;t all a bed of roses, but I know how saddened you are now,  and my heart goes out to you. Dear Polly, command me in any way. I am entirely  at your service here or there. If you come over here, I advise Haviland to stay  there and look after things. I know the bulk of Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s fortune is divided  between you and me, and I want Gray to see to all matters connected with my  share. When he gets around to it, he can send me some money to further this  work I am engaged on here. But let me know if you want me to come to you. With  all loving sympathy and affection,</p>
  <p>Carr.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone pondered over this letter. He had  felt a certain curiosity concerning this absent cousin, who was heir to half  the great fortune, and so would have had a possible motive for a crime that  would secure his inheritance to him at once. But there was no possible way of  connecting a man in Egypt with a deed committed in the victim&rsquo;s boudoir. Vague thoughts  of Loria&rsquo;s employing somebody to do the deed for him formed themselves in Stone&rsquo;s  mind, but were soon dismissed as untenable. The man Bates could not be a tool  of anybody, and beside, he didn&rsquo;t kill the lady. The poison did that. The Count  couldn&rsquo;t be a tool of any one. He was too evidently his own master, and whether  guilty or not, was entirely on his own initiative. Oh, the whole idea was  absurd. The letter itself was sufficient exoneration for Loria. He was absorbed  in his research work and though thoughtful enough of Pauline&rsquo;s wishes, he was  apparently not anxious to have his plans over there interrupted. He wrote like  a good all round chap, and Fleming Stone could find no peg on which to hang a  suspicion in his case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good letter,&rdquo; he commented, returning it to  Pauline; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your cousin like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In looks? A little like me, but bigger and  darker. He&rsquo;s a fine-looking man, and a kind-hearted one. I shall advise him not  to come home, for I know how interested he is in his work, and he can do no  good here. Can he, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly, Miss Stuart, I don&rsquo;t see how he can. I  may as well admit to you, the case seems to me a most baffling one. The assault  with the black-jack is, of course, accounted for, but we have made no progress  in the matter of discovering the poisoner. I feel that the solution of the mystery  is closely connected with that paper snake. Can you give me any idea where the  thing could have come from? Do you think Miss Carrington bought it herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure she did not,&rdquo; returned Pauline, but  her voice and intonation were such that Stone turned quickly to look at her.  She had gone pale, and her eyes looked frightened. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she went on,  hurriedly, &ldquo;Aunt Lucy would never buy such a thing. She hated snakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, but she must have gotten it  somewhere. It is easier to think she put it round her throat herself than to  think she let some one else do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; and now Pauline looked  angry. &ldquo;It is incredible that she should have put that thing round her own  neck! What could have induced her to do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There seems to be no theory to fit the facts,&rdquo;  said Stone, wearily, &ldquo;so we must try to get some facts that may suggest a  theory. You think, Miss Stuart, that you saw Miss Frayne leaving Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s room late that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I saw her with her hand on the  door-knob,&rdquo; returned Pauline steadily, and just then Anita herself burst into  the room. &ldquo;That is a falsehood!&rdquo; she cried, and her big blue eyes flashed  angrily; &ldquo;how could you see me, when you were yourself in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was what Stone had wanted, to get these two  girls at variance; and he helped along by saying, &ldquo;Were you, Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; cried Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were!&rdquo; Anita flung back. &ldquo;Miss Carrington  was talking to you! She said she wished her face was as beautiful as yours! To  whom else could she have said that? Surely not to the Count! One doesn&rsquo;t call a  man beautiful. And we all know that Miss Carrington admired your looks and lamented  her own lack of beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All that applies equally well to yourself,&rdquo; and  Pauline gazed steadily at the blonde beauty of Anita. &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t all that  speech addressed to your own attractive face, and you repeat it to incriminate  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here was an idea. Stone wondered if it could be  that Anita was in the boudoir and to turn suspicion from herself tried to pretend  she had heard Pauline in there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she said you were fond of pearls!&rdquo; went on  Pauline. &ldquo;Your admiration for my aunt&rsquo;s pearls is an open secret!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was. Often had Anita said how much she  preferred the soft lustre of pearls to the dazzling sparkle of other gems.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she left you ten thousand dollars in her  will,&rdquo; continued Pauline, more as if thinking these things over aloud than as  if accusing Anita of crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; cried Stone; &ldquo;what are you  doing? Implying that Miss Frayne had anything to do with the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am implying nothing. I am trying to see how  far the accusations she makes against me will fit her own case. You remember  she said my aunt proposed to leave my share of the fortune to some one else,  but Carr&rsquo;s share must remain untouched. Well, to whom else could she think of  giving my share, but to this scheming girl who tried her best to get my  portion, but did not succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita struggled to reply, but words would not  come. So furious that she could not articulate, she gurgled hysterically, when  into the room came Haviland and Hardy. Both looked exceedingly grave, and Gray  went at once to Pauline and put his hand kindly on her shoulder. Then he  suddenly caught sight of Anita and her evident distress, and leaving Pauline he  went over to the other and put his arms gently round her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Anita?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has upset  you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; was all Anita could say, when she was  interrupted by Hardy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me speak first,&rdquo; he said, for he saw there  was dissension between the two girls. &ldquo;I have made a discovery. At Mr. Stone&rsquo;s  directions I have been investigating shops where the paper snake might have  been bought, and I have learned that one was bought at Vantine&rsquo;s recently by  Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone gravely, &ldquo;did you buy  one, Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline hesitated. She was white as chalk, and  her lips quivered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course she did!&rdquo; screamed Anita, greatly  excited; &ldquo;she did, and she was in there talking to Miss Carrington, just as I  said! And she put that thing round her neck to frighten her! And then she gave  her the poison, and then she came away and left her to die! All alone by  herself! The fiend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there, Anita, hush,&rdquo; and Haviland tried  to soothe the frantic exclamation of the girl.</p>
  <p>Pauline stood waiting, in silence. At last she  said, &ldquo;When you remove that ranting woman, I will answer your question, Mr.  Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll answer it now!&rdquo; cried Anita. &ldquo;In my  presence, and at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you must answer, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; said  Stone, gently. &ldquo;Did you buy a paper snake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Pauline, and added in a low tone, &ldquo;A  long time ago,&mdash;this can&rsquo;t be the same one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The date of the sale is about a week before the  death of Miss Carrington,&rdquo; went on Hardy, merciless in his statements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For what purpose did you purchase it?&rdquo; asked  Stone, a little sternly.</p>
  <p>Pauline now drew herself up, proudly. &ldquo;I bought  it,&rdquo; she said, in clear, distinct tones, &ldquo;because my aunt instructed me to get  it for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a silence; and then, &ldquo;Oh, come now,  Pauline, you can&rsquo;t expect us to swallow that!&rdquo; Gray Haviland said, with a  tolerant smile at her. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; said Pauline, but her voice  trembled, and with a half-stifled exclamation of despair, she ran out of the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Pauline, where are you going?&rdquo; cried Haviland  as he ran after her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cable  Carr to come home! He&rsquo;s the only one who can help me! You&rsquo;re so wrapped up in  Anita that you can&rsquo;t tell truth from falsehood. Carr will know what to do,&mdash;and  I shall send for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone,  gravely; &ldquo;you may cable Mr. Loria, if you choose, but for a few moments I must  claim your attention. It is, to my mind, of the greatest importance to learn  the details of the purchase of that paper snake, and I must ask you to tell us  the circumstances of your aunt&rsquo;s request for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is little to tell,&rdquo; said Pauline, in a  hesitant way. &ldquo;It was one day when I was going over to New York that Aunt Lucy  just said, casually, to get her one of those Japanese paper snakes from Vantine&rsquo;s,  and I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; cried Anita. &ldquo;Miss Carrington <i>never</i> sent for a snake! <i>never</i> in the world! You&rsquo;ll be saying  next she told you to get her some aconite to poison herself with!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>XVI<br>
    The Two Girls</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stuart,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone&rsquo;s voice, though  gentle, had a ring of decision, &ldquo;if I am to go on with this case, I must insist  on your entire confidence, and absolute,&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated over the word, &ldquo;truthfulness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two were alone. After the altercation  between Pauline and Anita, Stone had requested the others to leave them, and he  determined to get at the truth of this marvelous statement about the purchase  of the snake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand, and you are quite right,&rdquo;  murmured Pauline, her manner quiet, her tone even, but in the dark eyes raised  to his Fleming Stone saw fear,&mdash;definite, unmistakable fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then explain, for I am sure you can, why you  suppressed the fact of your own purchase of that paper snake until forced to  admit it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was afraid.&rdquo; The beautiful face was of a  creamy pallor and the scarlet lips quivered. But this evident agitation on Miss  Stuart&rsquo;s part did not deter Stone from his probing queries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why were you afraid? Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid that if you knew I bought the snake you  would think I was in some way connected with&mdash;with the crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see that to attempt to conceal  the fact of your purchase makes any such suspicion more imminent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think I would&mdash;would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to <i>think</i> anything about it, Miss Stuart. I want to <i>know</i>, and I want you to tell me all  about your aunt&rsquo;s strange request for you to buy a thing she so feared and  abhorred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it myself. But Aunt Lucy was  full of vagaries and would often ask me to buy strange or outlandish things for  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not of a <i>reptilian</i> nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she had never done such a thing before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she give no reason for the request? Make no  apology or explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I was just leaving her, when she called me  back, and said, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you stop in at some Japanese shop, and get me a paper  snake?&rsquo; and I exclaimed in surprise at the request. Then she lost her temper  and said she supposed she knew what she wanted and for me to get it without further  to-do. So I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And when you brought it to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She merely took it and laid it in a desk  drawer, without even unwrapping the parcel. I never saw it again till I saw it  round her neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you do not think she placed it there  herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure she did not. The only reason I can  ascribe for her wanting it, is that she might have thought her dread of them a  foolish whim and determined to accustom herself to the sight of them by means  of the harmless toy. That&rsquo;s all I know about that snake, Mr. Stone. But the truth,  as I have told it to you, is so strange, so almost unbelievable, that I knew it  would only serve to attract suspicion to me, so I denied it. You know Miss  Frayne is only waiting to pounce on it as complete evidence of my guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You and she are not good friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have never been really friendly, though  always polite on the surface of things. But she is jealous of me, and tried in  every possible way to undermine my aunt&rsquo;s faith and trust in me, and even  plotted to have me disinherited and my fortune bequeathed to herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An ambitious plan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is ambitious. She intends to marry Mr.  Haviland, and she intended to have my half of the Carrington money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect her of the crime!&rdquo; and  Fleming Stone looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspect is too strong a word. But to me there  seems room for grave inquiries. I was in the hall at the time she declares I  was in my aunt&rsquo;s room,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Miss Stuart, isn&rsquo;t this a sort  of deadlock? You say you were in the hall, Miss Frayne says you were in the  boudoir. Why should I believe one in preference to the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was infinite sadness in Pauline&rsquo;s eyes as  she looked at her questioner. &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; she said, slowly; &ldquo;why should you?  I have only my unsupported word. Nor has Anita any witness. But, Mr. Stone, I  thought a Detective always looked first of all for the motive. What reason  could I have for&mdash;for killing my aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You put it plainly, Miss Stuart, and I will  reply in an equally straightforward vein. The first thing we detectives think  of is, who will benefit by the crime? Naturally, money benefit is first thought  of. The greatest money benefit comes to you and your cousin in Egypt. The  nature of the crime makes it impossible that he could have committed it. There is,  however, a possibility of your own connection with it, so we must question you.  But there are others who benefit in a pecuniary way by the death of Miss  Carrington, so they too must be questioned. You surely see the justice and the  necessity of all this investigation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and it seems to me also justice that  you investigate the story of Miss Frayne. She, too, has only her own  unsupported word as to that conversation she relates. May she not have made it  all up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has a witness, Miss Stuart, a credible  witness. Mr. Haviland has told me that he saw Miss Frayne at the door of the  boudoir at about quarter past one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray saw her! He didn&rsquo;t tell me this. Mr.  Stone, I hate to speak ill of another woman, but Miss Frayne can really wind  Gray Haviland round her finger, and I have no doubt she has persuaded him to  give this evidence, whether&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether it is true or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what I meant, though I hated to  say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stuart, it is often hard to tell when a  man speaks the truth, but I have no reason to disbelieve Mr. Haviland&rsquo;s  statement. He told quite circumstantially of being up and down all night. He  was restless and wandered about in several rooms during the small hours. You  know he told of seeing the maid on the stairs. And he gives me the impression  of a truthful witness who would not lie outright, even at the behest of a woman  in whom he is interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they are going to suspect me?&rdquo; Pauline&rsquo;s  voice was so full of despair that Fleming Stone caught his breath as he looked  at her. Her great eyes were wide with fear, her hands were clenched and her whole  body tense with horrified suspense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me some good reasons why you can not be  suspected,&rdquo; he cried, eagerly leaning forward in his chair. &ldquo;Give me some proof  that you were in the hall at that moment, or that you were in your own room, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That proves, Mr. Stone, that you <i>do</i> suspect me! Your assumption that I could  have been in my own room shows that you do not believe I was in the hall,&mdash;as I  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t Miss Frayne see you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know she didn&rsquo;t? Why do you accept  her words as truth, yet disbelieve mine?&rdquo; Pauline had risen now and stood  before him. Her tall slimness, her wonderful grace and her beautiful, angry  countenance made an alluring picture. &ldquo;I was not in favor of your taking this  case, Mr. Stone, and I am even less so, now, that you refuse to believe what I  say! I shall cable at once for my cousin to return. I do not wish Gray Haviland  and Anita Frayne to arrange all this to suit themselves. I am mistress here, in  Mr. Loria&rsquo;s absence, and if my authority is doubted I want him here to stand up  for me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Miss Stuart. You are not  entirely just to me. It is necessary for me to question you, but you must see  that your innocence&mdash;of which I have no doubt&mdash;will be more easily established by  a policy of frankness on your part, than by futile anger toward Miss Frayne or  Mr. Haviland. The incident of the paper snake, as explained by you, is not  necessarily incriminating, and if you will wait a few days before calling your  cousin home, I think very likely you will prefer not to do so. I understand  that you do not wish him to come home, unless he can be of assistance to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is his desire, to stay over there  unless I want him. But, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and now the lovely face was almost smiling,  &ldquo;if you mean what you said, that <i>you</i> do not doubt my innocence, then I will not send for Mr. Loria. I am content to  let it all rest in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s beauty now was dazzling. Color showed  in her cheeks, her eyes shone, and the curve of her exquisite red lips was almost  a smile. Stone looked at her in amazement. He had spoken truly, he had not  doubted her innocence, but this sudden elation on her part puzzled him. What  did it mean? Only, as she meant it to seem, that if he believed in her  innocence it could be easily proved? Well, he would accept that diagnosis of  her attitude, but he would move warily. This case was unlike any other he had ever  engaged in, so he must attack it in a different way. And first of all, he must  decide which of these two women was speaking the truth. Yet, how could he  decide? If Pauline had been in that room when Anita listened at the door, she  would, of course, try to prove that she was elsewhere. But, in such a case, why  not say she was in her own room? It wasn&rsquo;t plausible that she should confess to  being in the hall, if she were really in the boudoir. That, then, was in  Pauline&rsquo;s favor. But the conversation detailed by Anita? That must be further  analyzed.</p>
  <p>These thoughts flew through Stone&rsquo;s quick-moving  brain as he stood looking at his beautiful hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Puzzling it out, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; and Pauline&rsquo;s  smile was a full-fledged one now; &ldquo;perhaps I can help you. If you&rsquo;ll accept my  assistance without doubting my word, I&rsquo;m sure we can do wonders in a detective  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was not in Pauline&rsquo;s favor. It was too much  like bargaining with him to believe her innocent. Then, too, though all  unconscious of it, Stone was influenced by the wonderful charm of the girl.  Though her lips were smiling a little, her great dark eyes still held that look  of fear, that hunger for protection, that desire for some one on whom to lean.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t send for my cousin just yet,&rdquo; she  went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to call him home when he&rsquo;s so busy over there. You know,  Mr. Stone, that Mr. Loria is a wonderful man. His achievements in excavation  have brought him fame and glory. And you mustn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s heartless because  he doesn&rsquo;t return at once. You know it was all arranged for us to go over there  next month and he had made all sorts of plans for us and for himself. He can&rsquo;t leave  his work at a moment&rsquo;s notice, unless, as he says, I have need of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was he fond of his aunt?&rdquo; inquired Stone,  casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was her idol. To Aunt Lucy the sun rose and  set in Carr. She was perfectly crazy to go on this trip to Egypt, in order to  be with him. He was fond of her, yes. More so than I was, because she was  always kind and good-natured to him, while she was always unpleasant to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Well, I suppose I may as well  tell you, one reason was because she was always envious of any one whom she  considered better-looking than she was herself. This may sound strange to you,  Mr. Stone, but it was the key-note of my aunt&rsquo;s existence. She adored beauty in  every way,&mdash;pictures, clothes, everything,&mdash;but she was so sensitive about her  own plainness, that a younger or prettier face made her, at times, irritable  and even cruel. She would never engage a servant with any pretensions to good  looks. Therefore, as she chose to consider Miss Frayne and myself of comely  personal appearance, she was unkind to us both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Mr. Loria? Is he not handsome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very. But Aunt Lucy liked handsome  men. Carr Loria is like a picture. His father was of Italian descent, and Carr  has the clear olive skin and dark beauty of that race. Gray Haviland is  good-looking, too, but it was only feminine prettiness that stirred up Aunt  Lucy&rsquo;s ire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did she ever engage such an angel-face as  Miss Frayne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone watched closely for a sign of  irritation at this speech, and saw it. Pauline&rsquo;s smile faded, and she said,  abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think her so beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has the perfect blonde fairness usually  typified by the celestial white-robed creatures on the old canvases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Anita <i>is</i> a perfect example of a blonde. Why, she is the daughter of an old school-mate  of my aunt&rsquo;s, and so that&rsquo;s why Aunt Lucy took her, and then she proved such an  efficient secretary and such a patient, meek thing to scold, that she kept her  position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne doesn&rsquo;t seem so extraordinarily  meek to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed! She&rsquo;s not meek at all. But she  always was to Miss Carrington. That, of course, to keep the position, which was  both easy and lucrative. Easy, that is, except for my aunt&rsquo;s temper. That was vented  on poor Anita, morning, noon and night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That, then, might give us a motive for Miss  Frayne&rsquo;s desire to be rid of her cruel mistress and to get the inheritance that  she knew would come to her at Miss Carrington&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline shuddered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of such a  thing, Mr. Stone, but, if anybody in this house is to be suspected of the awful  thing, it can be no one but Anita. She tried, I know, to supplant me in my aunt&rsquo;s  affection, and to have my inheritance, or part of it, transferred to herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. For some time she has been making insinuations  and telling my aunt tales about me,&mdash;untrue ones,&mdash;that would make Aunt Lucy  angry at me. I tell you this, Mr. Stone, because I want you to know Anita  Frayne as she really is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was the ring of sincerity in the tone,  there was a look of truth in the big, dark eyes, and there was a most appealing  expression on the lovely face that gazed into his own, but Fleming Stone turned  from the speaker with a polite but decided gesture of dismissal, saying, &ldquo;Please  ask Miss Frayne to come here a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>XVII<br>
    The Overheard Conversation</b></h2>
  <p>Awaiting the arrival of Anita Frayne, Stone  thought rapidly. Forming his judgments, as always, more by impressions than by  words, he found himself believing in Pauline Stuart. She had bought the paper  snake, she had lied about it, but many women would have done the same. Knowing  that the purchase of the toy meant definite suspicion, wouldn&rsquo;t any innocent  girl have feared and dreaded that exposure? If she had been guilty, she would scarcely  have dared deny the facts of buying it, lest it be proved against her, and make  matters worse. Again, it was impossible to connect that magnificent woman with  crime! If she were connected with it, it could only be as the criminal herself.  There was no theory that admitted of her being an accomplice, or a tool. Stay,  there was that Loria man. Stone couldn&rsquo;t rid himself of a vague idea of  implicating the distant nephew by means of an accomplice on the spot. But the  notion was not logical. If Pauline had killed her aunt under her cousin&rsquo;s instructions,  she was just as much a murderer as if she had done it entirely of her own initiative.  And if the two cousins had conspired or worked in collusion, it was Stone&rsquo;s  duty to fasten the deed on Pauline, as the available one of the pair. Stone ran  over in his mind the letter from Loria. It gave no hint of greed or cupidity in  his nature. He was engrossed in the pursuit of his hobby, arch&aelig;ology, and was  only willing to leave his work if that would definitely please his cousin, on  whom, he fully appreciated, the responsibilities of the occasion would fall. He  fully trusted Gray Haviland to look after all business affairs, so he was not a  suspicious or over-careful nature. He asked no immediate money and only desired  some, in the course of time, to further his work. Whatever might be the truth,  there was no reason to cast a glance of suspicion toward Carrington Loria. His  opinion of Pauline&rsquo;s possible guilt Stone held in abeyance, and Miss Frayne  entering, he greeted her with punctilious politeness and a confidential air,  tending to put her at ease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;the situation is a  grave one. I am forced to the conclusion, tentatively at least, that Miss  Carrington was deliberately poisoned by some one in her own household. It may  have been a servant, but it is difficult to imagine how or why a servant could accomplish  the deed. At any rate, I must first consider the members of the family, and in  so doing, I must request absolute truth and sincerity from all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve no reason to equivocate, Mr.  Stone,&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s voice was almost flippant. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve told about what I  heard at Miss Carrington&rsquo;s door is absolutely true, and I can repeat it word  for word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems strange you have it so accurately at  your tongue&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. I went to my room and wrote it down  as soon as I heard it. I often make such memoranda. They are frequently useful  later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone mused. This seemed a strange thing  to do, at least in view of the later events, but then, if Miss Frayne had been  the guilty one, and had made up all this story of overheard conversation,  surely she would not have done anything so peculiar as to make that detailed memorandum;  or if she did, would not have told of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have, of course, a copy of that memorandum,&rdquo;  continued Stone; &ldquo;what I want is for you to tell me again why you think it  could not have been entirely a soliloquy on the part of Miss Carrington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For two reasons. First, I have lived with the  lady for four years, and never have I known her to talk to herself or soliloquize  aloud. Of course, this does not prove that she never did so, but I know it was  not her habit. Second, nobody in soliloquy ever would use that definite intonation  which is always used in speaking <i>to</i> a  person. You know yourself, Mr. Stone, that a soliloquy is voiced slowly,  mumblingly, and usually in disjointed or partially incoherent sentences. The  talk I heard was in clear concise speeches unmistakably addressed to somebody  present. She could not in a soliloquy use that direct form of address, even if talking  to some one in her imagination. She would not keep it up, but would go off in a  reverie or drop into impersonal thought. I wish I could make this more clear to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do make it clear, Miss Frayne. I know just  what you mean. I quite agree that one could easily tell the difference between  a spoken soliloquy and remarks addressed to a hearer. But you heard no replies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None at all. But I hold that is not peculiar,  for while Miss Carrington&rsquo;s voice was especially high and carrying, an  ordinarily low voice would not be audible through that closed door. You can  prove that by simple experiment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone. &ldquo;I have tried it,  and as you say, an ordinary voice in a low tone is not audible. But Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s must have been raised unnecessarily, to allow of its being heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone watched Anita&rsquo;s face as she listened to  this. But she only replied, with a shrug of indifference, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as to  that. I heard every word clearly, that&rsquo;s all I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose she had been talking to a picture of  some one, say a photograph of Miss Stuart or of Mr. Loria, or of Count  Charlier, would her tone of voice then be explicable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But she would have had to imagine  vividly the person there before her. And, again, Miss Carrington had no such  photographs in her rooms. All her family photographs are in this library, in  frames or cases. She was methodical in such matters. She has series of pictures  of Miss Stuart and of Mr. Loria from their childhood to now, but they are all  in order in the cases over there.&rdquo; Anita made a slight motion of her hand  toward a mahogany cabinet. &ldquo;No, Mr. Stone, whomever or whatever Miss Carrington  was talking to, it was not a photograph of any of her relatives or friends. As  you know, there was none discovered in her room, so what could she have done  with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Miss Frayne. But hasn&rsquo;t the theory  of a living person in there also inexplicable points? If somebody was there, it  was, of course, some one well known and whose presence in the house was unquestionably  correct. But her remarks, as I read them from your notes, imply different auditors.  Granting for a moment that Miss Stuart was there, why would Miss Carrington  say, &lsquo;Henri, Henri, you are the mark I aim at&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I admit that must have been a soliloquy, or an  apostrophe to the man she wanted to marry, though he was not present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have no thought, then, that Count Charlier  was present?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not! The idea is absurd. Miss Stuart  was in there with her aunt, and I&rsquo;m sure it was some remark of Pauline&rsquo;s, which  I, of course, did not hear, that made Miss Carrington speak of the Count as if  to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How, then, do you account for the presence of  Count Charlier&rsquo;s glove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stuart put it there as a blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how did Miss Stuart get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily. The Count had been spending the evening  here. He may have left his glove by mistake,&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or Pauline may have abstracted it purposely  from his coat-pocket during the evening with a prearranged plan to do all just  as she did do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Frayne! you can&rsquo;t mean to assert your  belief that Miss Stuart so far planned the crime as to intend to cast suspicion  on Count Charlier by means of that glove!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? If Pauline Stuart is responsible for  her aunt&rsquo;s death, I assure you, Mr. Stone, she is quite clever enough to  prearrange all details, and to plan so adroitly that suspicion should fall on  some one else. Miss Stuart is far more crafty and deep than you can have any  idea of! I have known her for four years, and I can tell you she is far from  ingenuous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose we leave the question of Miss Stuart  out of the discussion, and continue our first line of thought. Had Miss  Carrington ever spoken to you of changing her will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As was his frequent experience, Fleming Stone&rsquo;s  quick question caught his witness unaware, and she stumbled a little in her  speech, as she replied: &ldquo;N&mdash;no. Why should she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only because her frequent quarrels with Miss  Stuart might have made her wish to leave less of her fortune to her niece. And  in the conversation you overheard, Miss Carrington touched on this subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, she did. But except for that reference,  spoken to her unknown companion, I have never heard anything of such an  intention on her part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fond of pearls, Miss Frayne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what you&rsquo;re getting at now. That  speech Miss Lucy made about fondness for pearls. Of course, I am. Who isn&rsquo;t? I  often told Miss Carrington that I admired her pearls far more than all her  diamonds or other glittering stones. But I wouldn&rsquo;t commit a crime for all the  pearls in the world! And, if I had, why didn&rsquo;t I steal the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita&rsquo;s voice rang out triumphantly as she put  this question, but Fleming Stone said quietly: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t accused you of crime,  Miss Frayne, but since you ask that, let me remind you, that if the crime were  done with intent of robbery, the reason that the robbery was never accomplished  is the same that kept the man Bates from stealing. Few people can bring themselves  to take valuables from a dead body. However, I cannot think the poisoning was  done with any idea of direct robbery, but for the gain that would come by the  bequests of the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then your search is limited by the list of  inheritors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, Miss Frayne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Stone, how can you overlook or  undervalue the weight of evidence against Pauline Stuart? Remember, she bought  that snake herself. Miss Lucy never told her to buy it, <i>never</i> in this world! Pauline feared her aunt would disinherit her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; the question was shot at  her, and Anita fairly jumped as she heard it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, you know I heard reference made to it  that night when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you overheard that conversation; yes, go  on.&rdquo; Fleming Stone had gained his point, which was to prove that Anita <i>did</i> know of the proposed change in the  will before that time, and to his own belief he had proved it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I cannot doubt now that Pauline knew her  aunt intended to change her will, and so she was so desperate at the idea of  losing her fortune, she&mdash;I cannot bear to put it in words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She poisoned the lady,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone,  very gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Anita&rsquo;s voice choked, but she enunciated  the word. &ldquo;Mr. Stone, you must think me dreadful to hold these suspicions, but  you asked me to be frank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I wish you to be so. I am here, Miss  Frayne, to discover the poisoner of Miss Carrington. It is my duty to get all  possible light on the matter from any one I can. It is the duty of those whom I  question to tell all they know, truthfully and straightforwardly. If these  truths implicate or seem to implicate a member of the household, none the less must  the investigation be carried on and the case be pushed to its inevitable  conclusion. The great danger lies in mistaking opinions or imaginations for  facts. Now you are telling facts as to the words you overheard, but you are  giving only opinions as to whom those words were addressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s gaze was a wondering  one. &ldquo;But, Mr. Stone, since the <i>fact</i> of that person in the room is undiscoverable, one can&rsquo;t help forming an  opinion. Haven&rsquo;t you one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think those words were spoken to some  inanimate object, not to a person. Suppose the remark thought to be said to  Count Charlier was addressed to his glove, which she was undoubtedly holding at  the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never thought of that, because I have assumed  that Pauline put that glove in her hand after&mdash;after it was all over, to  implicate the Count. And, any way, that&rsquo;s only that one remark,&mdash;or two. To what  inanimate object was she talking when she said &lsquo;To-morrow all these jewels may  be yours&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I cannot answer. That whole conversation  is most mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed it is, Mr. Stone, under any other  hypothesis than that of the presence of Pauline Stuart in her aunt&rsquo;s room at  the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; and Gray Haviland&rsquo;s  good-natured face appeared, as he knocked and opened the door almost  simultaneously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;and I will ask you, Miss  Frayne, to leave us. I am getting to work in earnest now, and I want to push  things a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone watched the effect of this speech on Anita  and was not surprised to see her look at him with startled eyes, as she  unwillingly went through the door he held open for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; asked Haviland, in his breezy  way; and Stone replied, frankly: &ldquo;Lots. Those two girls are sworn foes, aren&rsquo;t  they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of late they have seemed to be. The break came  a month or more before Miss Carrington died. Two beauties never can remain  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are both beautiful women,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;Which  do you think had a hand in the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Neither of them! What are you talking  about? That Count man is responsible for the whole thing, Bates and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you think so, Mr. Haviland, but I can&rsquo;t  agree with you. Now, look here, we&rsquo;ve got to face things squarely. Take the  story Miss Frayne tells, about that mysterious conversation. If it were all a  figment of her brain,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! Man, you&rsquo;re crazy! Anita Frayne make that  all up out of the solid! Never, in a thousand years! If she said that talk was  talked, it <i>was</i> talked, and that&rsquo;s all  there is about that! Why or by whom it was talked, is another matter, and as I  understand it, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re here to find out. And, between you and me and  the arc light, I don&rsquo;t believe you ever will find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! And this is no aspersion on your powers. I  believe that fool Count was in there, and as he&rsquo;ll never admit it, and you&rsquo;ll  never believe it, how can it be proved?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, now. Prepare yourself, Mr.  Haviland, for some unwelcome questions. You don&rsquo;t want to, but I must insist on  your answering them. Which do you consider the more truthful and honest of the  two young women I&rsquo;ve just been talking to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nixie! You can&rsquo;t get an answer to that question  out of me! Why, I&rsquo;d be a cad to say anything but that they are both impeccably  truthful and honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you would, in ordinary circumstances. But  you must realize, Mr. Haviland, that I&rsquo;m here for the definite purpose of  solving the mystery of a terrible crime, and I can only do it by inquiry and  investigation. If you really refuse to help me I must learn what I want to know  in other ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, hang it, man,&rdquo; and Haviland, impressed by  Stone&rsquo;s manner, considered the question; &ldquo;I do think they&rsquo;re both truthful,&mdash;that  is, one of them&mdash;Oh, I can&rsquo;t say it! I can&rsquo;t talk against a woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be obliged to tell all you know, sooner  or later. If you tell me now, I truly believe it will be better all round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&mdash;now wait, I&rsquo;ve got to think this  thing out; I believe,&mdash;why, blessed if I don&rsquo;t believe either of them would lie  if she was in a tight place! There! you&rsquo;ve made me say a nice, honorable thing,  haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and Haviland looked utterly disgusted with Stone and with himself  too.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br>
    Fled!</b></h2>
  <p>The days went by, leaving the mystery unsolved.  Count Charlier was released from custody, there not being sufficient evidence  to hold him. Bates was in jail awaiting the action of the Grand Jury, but it  was recognized that he was not the murderer of Miss Carrington.</p>
  <p>Search for the poisoner had so far been  fruitless, and the newspapers were clamoring for the arrest of somebody. But  the Police Detectives were at their wits&rsquo; end, and even Fleming Stone was  baffled.</p>
  <p>For hours, Stone sat thinking over the many  peculiar features of the case. It was not in embarrassment that he felt himself  unable as yet to trace the criminal, it was rather with a sensation of  curiosity that he wondered what point he had overlooked. There must be some  clue, some definite indication of what way to look, but so far he had not  perceived it.</p>
  <p>So interested was he in the search that he took  no note of the passing of time or the growing impatience of those who watched  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Hardy,&rdquo; he would say to the  younger detective, &ldquo;the mystery centres about that paper snake. When we find  out the reason for Miss Carrington&rsquo;s sending for that thing, we&rsquo;ve the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You believe, then, that she did send for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course; why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only Miss Stuart&rsquo;s word for that; and it  doesn&rsquo;t seem as if Miss Carrington would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It doesn&rsquo;t seem, you mean, as if Miss  Stuart would&mdash;Why, man, what possible sense <i>could</i> there be in Miss Stuart&rsquo;s buying that snake on her own account? If she set out  to poison her aunt,&mdash;which she didn&rsquo;t,&mdash;she could have managed it in a dozen ways  without lugging in that paper reptile. In fact, it never would have occurred to  her to do so. <i>Why</i> would she do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In an attempt to frighten the lady to death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish! The first effect of such a fright  would be a fearful outcry on Miss Carrington&rsquo;s part, and immediate discovery of  the plot. Moreover, if Miss Stuart bought that snake for any such purpose, she  would have bought it secretly; at some little, obscure shop, not at a  well-known emporium. No, sir, the snake is the key to the puzzle, but how? That  is the question. You see, the doctors are pretty sure that the thing was put round  the lady&rsquo;s neck before she died. Therefore she was either unconscious at the  time, or,&mdash;she was willing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never! Everybody says her fear of the things  would never let her have it put on her willingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know they say so, but they may be mistaken. I&rsquo;m  beginning to evolve a theory that will fit the facts, queer as they are. But my  theory needs a whole lot of other facts to back it up, and those facts I can&rsquo;t  seem to find.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does your theory implicate Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You thought quite right. It does not implicate  Miss Stuart, because she is in no way responsible for her aunt&rsquo;s death. But she  may have knowledge, or she may think she has, that is leading her to shield somebody  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She is rather a puzzling creature.  Is she&mdash;is she in love with that cousin of hers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haviland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, the one in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Loria. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. You read his  letter to her, it wasn&rsquo;t in any sense a love-letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but it was evidently a letter written with  the idea of other people reading it, because of the circumstances. Of course,  he wouldn&rsquo;t put any intimate talk in it. And it was typewritten, so I couldn&rsquo;t  judge anything of the man from his chirography.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does handwriting mean much to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. It is a wonderful expression of  character. But I don&rsquo;t suppose it would declare his adoration of a lady, unless  he put it in words also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t connect Loria with the crime in any  way, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can, unless in collusion or  through the assistance of Miss Stuart. And I&rsquo;m not ready to do that. I&rsquo;m  working now on that conversation overheard by Miss Frayne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You accept that whole, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, for the simple reason that she would not  have invented all that talk. Even if she were in the room herself, and the  remarks were addressed to her, she might be trying to lay the blame elsewhere;  to create that conversation out of her own brain is too preposterous. You see,  Hardy, these things must be weighed in the balance of probability. If Miss  Frayne had set out to invent a lot of stuff which she merely pretended to  overhear, she would have had two sides to the conversation. It is that unusual  effect of one voice only that gives her story the stamp of truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there must have been another voice, even though  inaudible to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point. There may have been,&mdash;probably  was. But if the story was her own invention, she never would have thought of  representing that second voice as inaudible. Now, either she did hear Miss  Carrington say those things, or she didn&rsquo;t. I believe she did, because if she hadn&rsquo;t,  she must have invented the tale, and if she had invented it, it would have been  different. Likewise, Miss Stuart&rsquo;s snake story. If it were not true that her  aunt asked her to buy that snake, Miss Stuart must have made up that yarn. And  if she had made it up, it would have been different. That&rsquo;s always my test for  the truth of an amazing statement. If the teller were falsifying, would he tell  it that way? If so, then it is probably a lie: if not, then probably it is a  true bill. Now they say Miss Carrington had a high, shrill voice. Did you ever  hear it, Hardy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I never knew the lady. But I&rsquo;ve heard a  record of it on the phonograph, and it is high, and rather thin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the phonograph? How does that happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray Haviland is a dabster at that sort of  thing, and he has people sing for him and make records frequently. And once I  heard that they had a record of the dead woman&rsquo;s singing, and I asked to hear  it, merely out of curiosity or a general interest. And it contained some spoken  words too, and her speaking voice is high and shrill, just such as would carry through  a closed door. You can, of course, hear the record, if you care to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do care to. I&rsquo;ll make a note of that. Now,  here&rsquo;s another thing. Miss Stuart has declared that she obliterated a footprint  which was noticeable in that powder scattered by the dressing-table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it. And Haviland states that it was  he who wiped out that print! What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Haviland did do it, and Miss Stuart fibbed  about it to shield Haviland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s Haviland you think Miss Pauline is  shielding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it may be; at any rate, she suspects  some one dear to her and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re &lsquo;way off, Mr. Stone! If you&rsquo;ll excuse my  saying so, Miss Stuart has pulled the wool over your eyes until you don&rsquo;t know  where you&rsquo;re at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone gasped. Pulled wool over his eyes!  Over the eyes, the gimlet eyes, the all-seeing eyes of Fleming Stone! What  could the man mean? And this so-called wool pulled by a woman! What unheard-of absurdity!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Hardy,&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Nothing of the sort, and all  that. But it&rsquo;s true, Mr. Stone. Miss Stuart is a siren from Sirenville. She can  make any man think black is white if she chooses. And she has been bullied and  cowed by that old aunt of hers for years, and for my part, I don&rsquo;t blame her  for getting to the end of her rope. If she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop! Mr. Hardy, I know you think you&rsquo;re right,  but you are not! Do you hear, you are not! And I&rsquo;ll prove it to you, and that  soon! I&rsquo;ll ferret out this thing, and I&rsquo;ll do it on this new theory of mine  whether you believe it or not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy looked at the man in amazement. He had  expected a different mode of procedure from this talented sleuth. He had looked  for a quiet, even icy, demeanor, and magical and instantaneous solution of all  mystery. And here was the great man, clearly baffled at the queerly tangled web  of evidence, and, moreover, caught in the toils of a woman whom Hardy fully believed  to be the criminal herself.</p>
  <p>But he only said quietly, &ldquo;What way does your  theory point, Mr. Stone? I may be able to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Hardy, because you&rsquo;re so determined  to find Miss Stuart guilty that you couldn&rsquo;t see it as I do. You consider the  strange features of this case&mdash;and Lord knows they <i>are</i> strange!&mdash;separately, whereas they must be looked at as a whole.  The gown, the quantity of jewelry, the smiling face, the glove, the overheard  conversation,&mdash;all these points are to be considered as of one import,&mdash;as  leading to one conclusion. And you think of them as implicating&mdash;separately,  mind you&mdash;Miss Stuart, Miss Frayne, and the noble Count. Now, all those queer points  are not only connected, but identical in their significance. But never mind  that. Here&rsquo;s the place to begin. Miss Carrington was poisoned. She didn&rsquo;t  poison herself. Who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, you have put it tersely. I entirely  agree that all we are seeking is the answer to that last question of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will yet give it to you,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone  spoke solemnly rather than boastingly. &ldquo;The poison, the aconitine, was taken by  Miss Carrington as she sat there at her own dressing-table. She took it  willingly, smilingly,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, because she didn&rsquo;t know she was taking it.  When she ate the sandwich&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The poison wasn&rsquo;t in the sandwich. She took  that poison in water. The tumbler and spoon that were used are even now on the  glass shelf in her bath-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that in the glass that now stands there  a chemist has found a slight trace of aconite. I took the glass myself to be  tested, with that result. This is not a great discovery, it merely proves that  the poison was administered in water, not in a sandwich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it also means that it was given to her by  some one who could persuade her to take the solution, unquestioningly,&mdash;not  under compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would seem so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that points to Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. Hardy, I refuse to discuss  these things with you if you avow everything to condemn her. Why does what I  have just told you point to Miss Stuart any more than any one else in the  house? Why not Miss Frayne? Or Haviland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Nobody suspects Gray Haviland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why not? If you&rsquo;re merely suspecting here  and there without definite reason, why not include him on your list? And here&rsquo;s  another thing. Whoever mixed that poison in the glass of water, afterward  rinsed the glass and returned it to its place in the bath-room? This was either  done at the time, that is, before the lady died, or later on, after death had ensued.  In either case, it opens up a field of conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t with me,&rdquo; said Hardy, bluntly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no room for conjecture. It simply piles up the proof against Miss Stuart, and  all your skill and even your will can&rsquo;t get her off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A low moan was heard and a sound as of a falling  body. Stone sprang to the door, and flinging it open, disclosed Pauline lying  on the floor where she had just fallen. With a low exclamation, Stone picked  her up and carried her to a couch. In a moment she sat up and cried, &ldquo;What do you  mean, Mr. Hardy? Do you think I killed Aunt Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there, Miss Stuart, don&rsquo;t ask foolish  questions,&rdquo; and Hardy, deeply embarrassed, stood at bay. It was one thing to  assert his suspicions to Fleming Stone, and quite another to have them  overheard by this beautiful and indignant girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Pauline went on. &ldquo;I was at the  door and I heard all you said. No, I am not ashamed of listening, I&rsquo;m glad I  did. Now I know what I have to fight against! And you, Mr. Stone, do you think  me a murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline cringed not at all. She looked more like  an avenging goddess, as she confronted the two men, and her blazing eyes and  frowning face challenged their replies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; said Stone, quietly,  but Pauline responded, &ldquo;How do I know? If you did, you&rsquo;d say you didn&rsquo;t! I have  no friend, no one to stand up for me. I shall send for Carr. He will defend me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a disdainful glance round, she left the  room. The two men looked at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; said Hardy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Stone, and then the two went their  different ways.</p>
  <p>Hardy&rsquo;s way led to the Police Headquarters, and  his report there, which included Stone&rsquo;s story of the tested glass, was heard  with interest.</p>
  <p>He demanded Miss Stuart&rsquo;s immediate arrest,  claiming that only she could have persuaded her aunt to swallow the poisoned  draught.</p>
  <p>Inspector Brunt was not quite willing to order  arrest, but he set machinery at work which he hoped would bring decisive  results of some sort.</p>
  <p>It did.</p>
  <p>That same evening, Pauline went to Fleming  Stone. The two were alone. Standing before him, in all her somewhat tragic  beauty, Pauline asked: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think me guilty, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked deep in the great, dark eyes that  seemed to challenge his very soul, and after a moment&rsquo;s steady glance, he  replied, &ldquo;I know you are not, Miss Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you prove it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That means nothing. Are you sure you can?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone looked troubled. Never before in  his career had he been unable to declare his surety of success; but with those  compelling eyes upon him he couldn&rsquo;t deny a present doubt.</p>
  <p>Shaking himself, as if to be freed from a spell,  he said, at last, &ldquo;Miss Stuart, I am <i>not</i> sure. I am convinced of your innocence, but the only theory of guilt that I can  conceive of is so difficult, so almost impossible of proof, and so lacking in  plausibility, that it seems hopeless. If determination and desperate effort can  do it, you shall be exonerated. But there are many circumstances not in your  favor. These I shall overcome, eventually. But, to be honest, until I can get a  clue or a link of some sort to join my purely imaginative theory to some  tangible fact, I can do little. I am working day and night in my efforts to  find this connection I seek, but it may take a long time. Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, I may be arrested?&rdquo; Pauline&rsquo;s voice  was a mere whisper; her face was drawn and white with fear. To Stone she did  not look like a guilty woman, but like an innocent girl, frightened at thought  of unjust suspicion and terrorized by imagination of the unknown horrors that  might come to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, help me!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;Mr. Stone, can&rsquo;t you  help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking her hands in  his; &ldquo;Pauline! Go!&rdquo; he cried, tensely: &ldquo;I will save you, but until I do, keep  away from me! You unnerve me! I cannot think!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand!&rdquo; and Pauline slowly drew her  hands from his. &ldquo;I will keep away from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone let her go. He closed the door after her,  locked it, and threw himself into a chair. What had he done? Full well he knew  what he had done. Hardy was right. He had fallen in love with Pauline Stuart!  He realized it, quietly, honestly, as he would have realized any incontrovertible  fact. His subconsciousness was that of a deep, still gladness; but, strangely  enough, his surface thought was that since he had fallen in love with her, so  undeniably, so irrevocably, she <i>must</i> be innocent.</p>
  <p>Then on the heels of this thought, came another,  equally logical: if he deemed her innocent, was it not only because he loved  her?</p>
  <p>It was only after an hour of deep thought that  Fleming Stone pulled himself together and realized with a conquering assurance,  that he could go on with the case, and do his duty. If, as he was confident, he  could prove his vague theory to be fact, then his love for Pauline would help him  to good work and triumphant conclusions. If, instead, his further investigations  showed his theory to be false, then he must push on, and if&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t be, but  if&mdash;well,&mdash;he could always drop the case. But,&mdash;and of this he was certain,&mdash;his  heart should not only be kept from interfering with the work of his head but it  should help and encourage such desperately clever work that success must come.</p>
  <p>Pauline did not appear at dinner that night, and  on inquiry, Stone was told she had gone over to New York for a day or two.</p>
  <p>This, then, was what she had meant when she  said, &ldquo;I will keep away from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next day came District Attorney Matthews to  interview Miss Stuart. Her absence from home annoyed him and he asked for her  New York address. This no one knew, as she had not informed any of them where  she was staying in the city, and Mr. Matthews went off in a state of angry excitement.  But the household at Garden Steps was even more excited.</p>
  <p>For this was the first sign of a definite action  against Pauline. What it meant or how far it would go, no one could say.</p>
  <p>And then, that afternoon, came a letter from  Pauline herself. It had been mailed in New York that morning and contained the  surprising news that Pauline had sailed at noon that day for Alexandria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get her back!&rdquo; roared Haviland, as he read the  letter. &ldquo;Wireless the steamer and make her get picked up by some incoming ship!  Don&rsquo;t think of expense! She musn&rsquo;t run off like that! It&rsquo;s equivalent to  confession of the crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; demanded Fleming Stone. &ldquo;How dare you  say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; cried Anita. &ldquo;Why else would  Pauline run away? She knew she was on the verge of arrest and she fled to Carr  Loria. He will hide her from her pursuers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can,&rdquo; said Haviland, thoughtfully: &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s  as well she&rsquo;s gone there. Of course, she did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, she didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Fleming Stone&rsquo;s  voice trembled in its very intensity. &ldquo;And I shall prove to a lot of  dunder-headed police that she didn&rsquo;t, but it will make my work much harder if  you two insist on Miss Stuart&rsquo;s guilt. Why do you want to railroad her into  conviction of a crime she never dreamed of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then who did it?&rdquo; demanded Anita. &ldquo;To whom <i>was</i> Miss Lucy speaking when she said  those things I heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you harp on that string much longer,&rdquo; said  Stone, looking at her, &ldquo;one might almost be justified in thinking she said them  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anita, in a low, awed voice, and  looking straight at Fleming Stone, &ldquo;no, she did not say them to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Stone knew she spoke the solemn truth.</p>
  <p>But she had not spoken the truth when she said  she saw Pauline Stuart coming from the boudoir of her aunt.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>XIX<br>
    Letters From The Fugitive</b></h2>
  <p>Pauline&rsquo;s flight was deemed by many a confession  of guilt. The District Attorney declared his intention of cabling a command to  hold her for examination at Alexandria. Or, he said, perhaps it would be better  to intercept her course at Gibraltar or Naples.</p>
  <p>The people at Garden Steps paid little attention  to these suggestions, so absorbed were they in planning for themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Haviland, &ldquo;she ran away in  sheer panic. You don&rsquo;t know Pauline as we do, Mr. Stone; she is brave in the  face of a present or material danger. When a gardener&rsquo;s cottage burned, she was  a real heroine, and saved a tiny baby at risk of her own life. But always a vague  fear or an intangible dread throws her into a wild, irresponsible state, and  she loses her head utterly. Now, I may as well own up that I do think Polly  committed this deed. I think that she had stood Aunt Lucy as long as she  possibly could, and you&rsquo;ve no idea what the poor child had to put up with. I  think that when Lady Lucy threatened to send Pauline away, homeless and  penniless, this panic of fear overcame her and she gave that poison, on an  impulse,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Stone, &ldquo;that would imply her  having the poison in readiness. She couldn&rsquo;t procure it at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Haviland, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but,  even so, it&rsquo;s my belief that that&rsquo;s the way it all happened. How Pauline got  the stuff I&rsquo;ve no idea, but there&rsquo;s no other explanation that fits the facts.  Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s aversion to drugs or medicines could have been overcome by few  people, but Pauline could have wheedled her into taking it by some misrepresentation  of its healing qualities or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must have been under some such  misapprehension that she took it,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;m convinced she took it  dissolved in a glass of water, and therefore, was conscious of the act, though  not of the nature of the dose. But couldn&rsquo;t Miss Stuart have given it  innocently by mistake, as a headache powder, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Carrington never had headaches,&rdquo; returned  Anita, &ldquo;and, any way, Pauline couldn&rsquo;t make such a mistake. It isn&rsquo;t as if Miss  Carrington had a medicine cabinet like other people, where drugs might get  mixed up. No, Mr. Stone, there was no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think Miss Stuart administered the poison  purposely, to kill her aunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It would have been a brazen soul indeed, that  could have spoken falsely under the piercing gleam in Fleming Stone&rsquo;s eyes  then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am forced to think that,&rdquo; replied Anita,  quietly. &ldquo;And you know I was present when Miss Carrington denounced Pauline and  told her to leave this house the next day. And I also heard Miss Carrington  when she said, later, that half her fortune should not go to a niece who  treated her as Pauline did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would she have used those words in speaking to  Miss Stuart?&rdquo; asked Stone, pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely she would. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind all that, &lsquo;Nita,&rdquo; said Haviland. &ldquo;Polly&rsquo;s  gone,&mdash;run away,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s up to us to do all we can to help her. If her flight means  she&rsquo;s guilty, never mind, we must stand up for her, and deny anything that  incriminates her. If she did poison Aunt Lucy, we don&rsquo;t want her convicted of  it. She&rsquo;ll go straight to Loria, and he&rsquo;ll look out for her all right. But if  we find anybody&rsquo;s going to head her off at Naples, or anywhere, we must warn  her and help her to thwart their plans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Accessory after the fact&mdash;&rdquo; began Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Haviland. &ldquo;You bet we&rsquo;ll be  accessories after the fact, to help Polly out! Why, Mr. Stone, if she did this  thing, the best possible plan for her was to vamoose, just as she did do. Carr  Loria can hide her in Egypt, so nobody can find her, and after a while&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Haviland,&rdquo; and Stone&rsquo;s eyes gleamed, &ldquo;I am  surprised at your attitude. How can you so easily take Miss Stuart&rsquo;s guilt for  granted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No other way out. Now, look here, Mr. Stone,  neither Miss Frayne nor I did this thing. We weren&rsquo;t tied to Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  apron strings. We could walk off and leave her if we chose. But Miss Stuart  couldn&rsquo;t. Her life was a perfectly good hell on earth. I know all about it, a  lot more, even, than Miss Frayne does. I don&rsquo;t quite say I don&rsquo;t blame Polly,  but I do say I quite understand it. She is an impulsive creature. She&rsquo;ll stand an  awful lot and then fly all to pieces at some little thing that sets her nerves  on edge. She&rsquo;s clever as the Devil, and if she procured that aconite, long ago,  say, it was in anticipation of some time when she&mdash;well, when she just reached  the limit. And it happened to come that night. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wrong, Mr. Haviland, all wrong!&rdquo; and Stone&rsquo;s  face was positively triumphant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found an additional hint, in what you&rsquo;ve  just said, and I&rsquo;m convinced I&rsquo;m on the right track! One more question, Miss  Frayne, about that conversation you so luckily overheard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luckily?&rdquo; said Anita, her great blue eyes  showing alarm in their startled gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely! Most fortunate, to my mind. Indeed, it  may well be that that carefully exact memorandum of yours may be the means of  clearing Miss Stuart of all suspicion. Now, tell me this. You heard only Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  voice, as if speaking to somebody. Did it sound as if she spoke always to the  same person, or to more than one at the different times?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it did sound as if she spoke to different  persons, but it couldn&rsquo;t have been so. Surely, if there had been more than one  I must have heard some other words than her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind your own surmises. You say, it  seemed as if she addressed more than one person. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because she used a different intonation. At  times angry, at times loving. But this is only an impression, as I now look  back in memory. I haven&rsquo;t thought about this point before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor need you think of it again. You have told  me all I want to know, and I assure you it will be of no use for you to mull  this over or give it another thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to think, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and  Anita began to cry, &ldquo;that I want to suspect Pauline&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not considering your wishes in the matter,&rdquo;  said Stone, coldly. &ldquo;If you do not want to think Miss Stuart implicated in this  matter, your words and actions are unintelligible to me, but they are equally unimportant,  and I have neither time nor thoughts to waste on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With this somewhat scathing speech, Stone went  away, leaving the angry Anita to be comforted by Haviland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he mean?&rdquo; she cried, her cheeks pink  with anger, and her blue eyes shining through tears. &ldquo;Gray, does he suspect me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Anita, of course not. But he&rsquo;s on a trail.  Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t Polly after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it had to be! It was somebody in the house,  and it wasn&rsquo;t you or me or any of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you listen to me, girl. If they quiz you  any more about that talkfest you butted into, don&rsquo;t you color the yarn to make  it seem against Polly. I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How cross you are! But I never did, Gray. I  never made it seem to be evidence against Pauline.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never did anything else!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love me any more?&rdquo; and the soft lips  quivered as an appealing glance was raised to his face. Her eyes, like  forget-me-nots in the rain, were so beautiful, Haviland clasped the lovely face  in both his hands, and said as he held it: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t love you, &lsquo;Nita, if you go  back on our Polly. I&rsquo;m surprised at your attitude toward her just now, and I  warn you I won&rsquo;t stand any more of it. I&rsquo;m forced to think she did this thing,  but I intend to admit that to nobody but you and Stone. If he can find the real  criminal, and it isn&rsquo;t Polly, I&rsquo;ll bless him forever. But you know, as well as  I do, why he is clinging to that forlorn hope. It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I know! Because he&rsquo;s in love with  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and it&rsquo;s a remarkable thing for him to  fall head over heels in love at first sight, like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, of course, she is handsome,&rdquo; and Anita&rsquo;s  grudging admission was real praise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet she is! And old Stone fell for her in a  minute! Now there&rsquo;s the old adage of &lsquo;Love will find a way,&rsquo; and if Fleming  Stone has any magic ability, or whatever these wizard detectives claim, he&rsquo;s  going to work it to the limit to prove Polly innocent. And I hope to goodness  he succeeds. Great Scott! I wouldn&rsquo;t suspect the girl if there was a glimpse of  a gleam of any other way to look. But, you hear me, Anita! Don&rsquo;t you say a word,  true or false, that will help on the case against Pauline Stuart! I won&rsquo;t stand  for it! And don&rsquo;t you say you saw her coming from that room, when you <i>know</i> you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The postman came just then, and brought with him  two letters addressed in Pauline&rsquo;s dashing hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that!&rdquo; exclaimed  Gray, half glad and half scared at the sight. &ldquo;One for me, and one for F. S.  Here, Anita, take Mr. Stone&rsquo;s to him, while I eat up mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it! I want to see what&rsquo;s in yours,  first,&rdquo; and Anita stood by Gray&rsquo;s side to look over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; and they read together:</p>
  <p>Dear Gray:</p>
  <p>I couldn&rsquo;t help it. You see, I was so frightened  at what you all said, that I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I came over to New York,  with a vague idea of asking Mr. Price to help me. I stayed with Ethel all  night, and somehow things seemed to look so black, I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything  but to go to Carr. I went down to the steamer office to see about changing my  tickets for an earlier date, or something, and I found the <i>Catalonia</i> sailed to-day. I&rsquo;m scratching this off to go back by the pilot.  I had about two hours to get ready, so I bought a trunk and some clothes, went  to the bank and got a letter of credit, and here I am. I don&rsquo;t know yet whether  I&rsquo;m glad or sorry to be here. But I know I could not stand it at Garden Steps  another minute, with you and Anita both against me! Mr. Stone doesn&rsquo;t believe I  did it, but he is doubtful of being able to prove my innocence, so I&rsquo;m going to  Carr, and you can address me in his care. He&rsquo;s my nearest relative, and it&rsquo;s  right for me to go there. I cabled him from New York to expect me, and to meet  me at Alexandria. I&rsquo;d write more, but it&rsquo;s most time for the pilot to go, and I  want to send a word to Mr. Stone. Of course, you will look after all my bills  and affairs till further notice.</p>
  <p>Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Gray, &ldquo;Think of that poor  child going off like that, because she thought you and I were against her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Anita, an angry gleam  in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! never!&rdquo; shouted Gray. &ldquo;If Pauline is guilty  a thousand times, I&rsquo;m not against her! I&rsquo;m <i>for</i> her, Anita, for her, first, last and all the time! Come on, now, let&rsquo;s take Mr.  Stone his letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They found Stone in the boudoir, the room where  the ghastly crime had been committed. He spent many hours here of late; it  seemed necessary for the furthering of his theory, and yet, whenever any one  was admitted to his presence there, he was found sitting staring at the room  and its furnishings, as if waiting for the inanimate objects to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A letter? From Miss Stuart?&rdquo; he said, eagerly. &ldquo;I  hoped for one, by the pilot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He opened it, and after a glance handed it over  to Haviland.</p>
  <p>It said, only:</p>
  <p class="letter">My dear Mr. Stone:</p>
  <p class="letter">Thank you for your belief in me, and forgive me  for running away. And, please,&mdash;oh, I beg of you, <i>please</i> drop the case entirely. Your further investigation and  discovery can only bring sorrow and anguish to my already distracted soul. I  have no time to write more, but assume that I have put forth any or every  argument that could persuade you, and at once cease all effort to learn who is  responsible for the death of my aunt.</p>
  <p class="letter">Sincerely yours,</p>
  <p class="letter">Pauline Stuart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>XX<br>
    In The Boudoir</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently, Fleming Stone paid little attention  to this letter from Pauline. Really, every word engraved itself on his heart,  as he read the lines, and when he gave the paper to Gray Haviland, it was only  because he knew he would never need to refresh his memory as to the message Pauline  had sent him.</p>
  <p>Stone also read the letter she had written to  Gray, and his deep eyes clouded with pain at some of the lines. But he returned  it to Haviland without comment, and then courteously dismissed the pair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bothered to death,&rdquo; said Gray, as they  went downstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I,&rdquo; responded Anita. &ldquo;But nobody cares  about me, it&rsquo;s all Pauline,&mdash;whether she&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let up on that, &lsquo;Nita!&rdquo; and Gray spoke  warningly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call Pauline names in my hearing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita, pouting, flounced away to her own room.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone remained in Miss Lucy Carrington&rsquo;s  boudoir. He sat on a window-seat, and looked out across the wide gardens and  the innumerable steps. There was not much snow now. Merely great wind-swept  stretches, dotted with evergreen trees, and the carved stone of the terrace  railings and balustrades.</p>
  <p>Long, Stone mused over Pauline&rsquo;s letter. For a  time, he gave himself up to thoughts of her in which consideration of crime had  no part. He knew he loved her, loved her with all the strength and power of his  great nature; with all the affection and devotion of his big heart; and with all  the passion and adoration of his deep soul. He knew she was not averse to him.  Knew almost, with his marvelous power of knowledge, that she cared for him, but  he knew, too, that if he let his mind dwell on such alluring thoughts or  visions, he could not work. And work, he must. Ay, work as he had never before,  with an incentive he had never had before. And Fleming Stone&rsquo;s mind was  troubled to know whether this love for Pauline would help or hinder this work  he must do. And he resolved, with all his mighty will-power, that it should  help, that he would control this surging emotion, so new to him, and would force  it to aid and assist his efforts, and to triumph over all doubts or obstacles.</p>
  <p>Again he concentrated his whole mentality on the  room and its contents. He swore to wrest from the silent witnesses the story of  the crime. This was not his usual method of procedure. On the contrary, he  almost invariably learned his points from questioning people, from observing suspects,  or quizzing witnesses. But, he realized the difference in essence between this  case and any other in which he had ever engaged. He had no more questions to  ask. He knew all any one could or would tell him. He knew all the facts, all  the theories, all the evidence, all the testimony. And none of it was worth a  picayune to him, except negatively. This case must be, and should be, solved by  the application of his highest mental powers, by the most intense thought and,  doubtless, by most brilliant and clever deduction from hints not facts, from  ideas, not visible clues. To work, then! To the work that <i>must</i> bring success!</p>
  <p>Leaving the window-seat, Stone walked round the  room, and finally drew up in front of the mirror the easy chair in which Miss  Carrington had sat when she received the blow given by Bates. Whether she had  sat here while taking the poison, no one knew. If Stone&rsquo;s theory was right, she  had not.</p>
  <p>By referring to the photographs taken of Miss  Carrington after her death, Stone was able to reconstruct the scene correctly.</p>
  <p>He placed the easy chair just as it had been  when she sat in it. He assumed the position she showed in the photographs, and  gazed at himself in the mirror, as she must necessarily have done.</p>
  <p>Slowly, he went over that conversation reported  by Anita Frayne. Never, for a moment, had he doubted the truth of that report.  He was sure Miss Carrington had really said all the things Anita repeated, and  the clear and indubitable explanation of those remarks would mean, he was sure,  the solution of the mystery.</p>
  <p>By way of interviewing his silent witnesses, he  endeavored to reconstruct, in thought, Miss Carrington&rsquo;s movements that night.  Pauline and Anita had left her, all three of them angry, at a little after twelve.  Later, Estelle had left her,&mdash;that was about quarter to one. Then she had on her  embroidered robe and some jewels. She was not then sitting at the  dressing-table. Nor had she then, presumably, taken the poison. For the doctors  insisted that she had swallowed the poison very near the hour of one, but after  it rather than before, and had placed the hour of her death at two. So, Stone  reasoned, Miss Carrington must have taken that aconite at pretty nearly the  very time Anita heard her talking. It seemed to Stone incredible that there  could have been a person present to whom Miss Carrington could have addressed  those remarks, and who could have given or allowed her to take the deadly  draught.</p>
  <p>The idea that Pauline could have been this  person was not among Fleming Stone&rsquo;s catalogue of possibilities.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the fact of the one voice strongly  impressed him. Another voice, however low, must have at some point of the  conversation risen to an audible sound to a listener with normal hearing. Also,  Anita had asserted that the speeches of Miss Carrington did sound as if  addressed to different persons. It was not likely there were two or more  intruders or visitors there at once, and slowly but surely Fleming Stone  decided, once for all, that Miss Carrington was alone in that room at that  time. This meant, not exactly soliloquy, the mode of address contradicted that,  but it meant, to him, at least, that she was addressing some inanimate object  or objects as if they were sentient.</p>
  <p>His task was to discover those objects. His  first thought was, as he sat in the easy chair before the mirror, that the lady  had spoken to her own reflection. But the speeches, of which he had a  memorandum, precluded this hypothesis. She would not say to herself &ldquo;You are so  fond of pearls,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You have a beautiful face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abandoning that supposition, Stone methodically  searched for something that might have been addressed.</p>
  <p>Clearly,&mdash;that is, if he were on the right track,&mdash;the  words &ldquo;Henri, you are the mark I aim at!&rdquo; could have been spoken to the Count&rsquo;s  glove, which she held in her hand. In the same vein, assuming that the glove,  to her, represented the Count himself, might have been said the speech about the  ten thousand dollars, and the remark that he loved pearls.</p>
  <p>Accepting these possibilities as facts, Stone  went on to discover more. His method was to repeat to himself her very words  and strive to see or sense something to which they might have been addressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have the most beautiful face I ever saw,&rdquo;  he quoted softly and then, scanning the room, went on: &ldquo;I only wish mine were  as beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes lighted on the picture of Cleopatra,  which hung above the mirror of the dressing-table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he cried, with instant conviction. &ldquo;She  looked at that beautiful face and then in the mirror, at her plain features,  and she involuntarily cried out for the beauty denied her! Poor woman, to live all  her lonely, hungry life, surfeited with wealth yet unable to buy the fairness  she craved!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not doubting for an instant the truth of his  conclusion, Stone checked off that speech and passed on to the next on his  list. If he could account for them all, he would be sure Lucy Carrington met  her death alone, and therefore by her own hand. Of course, she did not  knowingly poison herself, but if persuaded that the prepared draught was some innocent  remedy&mdash;oh, well, that was aside the point for the moment.</p>
  <p>But, quoting the phrase, &ldquo;To-morrow I shall be  forever free from this curse of a plain face,&mdash;to-morrow these jewels may all be  yours,&rdquo;&mdash;even his ingenuity could suggest no meaning but a foreknowledge of  approaching death. What else could free her from her hated lack of beauty? What  but death could transfer her fortune of jewels to another? Of course it might be  that marriage with her would give the jewels to Count Charlier, but the two  speeches were consecutive, and the implication was all toward the fate that was  even then almost upon her.</p>
  <p>The remark about ten thousand dollars was unimportant,  as she had recently willed that sum to five different people, and the reference  to a change in her will that should cut out Pauline might have been merely a burst  of temper. At any rate, Stone ascribed little importance to it then. He felt  that he had learned enough to assume positively that Miss Carrington was not  talking to a human being when Anita Frayne heard her voice. Then, he  conjectured, as the maid was free of all suspicion on the poisoning matter, and  as the two girls had left the room at a little after twelve, the weight of  evidence was in favor of the poison being self-administered, no matter for what  reason or intent. Granting this, there must be some trace of the container of  the aconite, before it was placed in the glass. This must be found. If not, it  proved its removal by some one, either before or after the poisoning actually  occurred.</p>
  <p>Eagerly, almost feverishly, Stone searched.  Exhaustive search had long ago been made, but again he went over all the  possible places. The ornate waste-basket beneath the dressing-table still held  its store of dainty rubbish. This had been ordered to remain undestroyed. Stone  knew the contents by heart, but in hope of an overlooked clue, he again turned  the contents out on a towel. Some clippings of ribbon, a discarded satin flower,  two or three used &ldquo;powder-leaves,&rdquo; a couple of hairpins and a torn letter were  the principal items of the familiar lot. Nothing that gave the least  enlightenment.</p>
  <p>Stone got up and wandered around. What had that  poison been in before it was put in that glass?</p>
  <p>The ever-recurring thought that some one might  have brought it to the boudoir after preparing it elsewhere, he would not  recognize. A sort of sixth sense convinced him that if he kept on looking he  must find that clue.</p>
  <p>He went into the bedroom. The beautiful  appointments, replicas of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s, seemed to mock at his quest. &ldquo;We  know,&rdquo; they seemed to laugh at him, &ldquo;we know all about it, but we will never  tell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Untouched since Estelle&rsquo;s deft hand had turned  back its silken coverlets, the bed seemed waiting for some fair occupant. With  a sigh at the pathos of it, Stone suppressed an involuntary thought of the  incongruity of that gilded, lace-draped nest, and its pitifully unbeautiful  owner. There was a profusion of embroidered pillows, and across the satin puff  lay a fairy-like night-robe of gossamer texture, and coquettish ribbons. A peignoir  of pink cr&ecirc;pe lay beside it, and on the floor a pair of brocade <i>mules</i> waited in vain for feet that would  never again slip into their furred linings.</p>
  <p>There was nothing helpful here, and with a sigh  Stone went on to the bath-room. Fit for a princess, the shining white and  gleaming silver showed careful readiness. Embroidered towels, delicate soaps  and perfumes were in place&mdash;all showed preparation, not use.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I were searching traces of Estelle, now,&rdquo;  groaned Stone, despairingly, to himself, &ldquo;I could find thousands. But Miss  Carrington didn&rsquo;t come in here at all. But, whoever rinsed that glass did!&rdquo; The  thought caused Stone to start with eagerness. It was the fact of the glass  being out of line with the other appointments of the wash-stand that had first  attracted his attention to it. After the test, the glass had been returned to  its place, now in strict position between a silver cup and a flask of violet  water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spoon in it,&rdquo; mused Stone. &ldquo;Shows carelessness  on the part of whoever put it there. Don&rsquo;t believe a spoon was in a glass,  generally, in this celestial bath-room. If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His ruminations were cut short by a shock of  surprise. Under the wash-stand was a small waste-basket. Had this been  overlooked by the searchers? Not surprising, for thorough search had not been  made in bedroom or bath-room, as in the room where death had taken place.</p>
  <p>Stone mechanically looked over the contents of  the little basket. There was only a scant handful of papers. But carefully  spreading a towel on the floor he turned the basket upside down. Tremblingly he  fingered the papers. The first was the wrapper that had contained a cake of  French soap. At a glance, Stone saw the corresponding soap in its silver dish. Estelle  had doubtless placed it there, casting away its paper.</p>
  <p>But among the scraps was another paper&mdash;two more.  They were,&mdash;they surely <i>were</i> in  creases like the folds of a powder paper!</p>
  <p>With lightest touch, Stone unfolded them. There  was one, about four inches square, that had been folded as if to contain a  powder. This was white, and of a texture like writing paper. The other was of a  paraffin paper, exactly the same size and shape, and in similar creases. Also there  was a bunchy ball of tin-foil, that, when smoothed out, proved to be of  identical shape and size with the other two.</p>
  <p>There was no room for doubt. These were  unquestionably the wrappers of the aconitine! Stone detected on the inside of  the paraffin paper traces of the powder itself, and knew that a test would  prove his discovery a true find.</p>
  <p>Now, then, where did he stand? To his own mind,  what he had found proved that Miss Carrington had herself gone to her  bath-room, opened the powder, thrown the papers carelessly in the basket, and  then, mixing the stuff with water, had taken it then and there and rinsed the  glass and set it back on the shelf. It was all natural and plausible.</p>
  <p>But, he well knew, others would say that,  remembering her detestation of medicaments, Miss Lucy Carrington never did such  a thing. Also, they would say, some one else, some one of whom Miss Lucy felt  no fear, had mixed the draught, and had administered it, by means of some yet undiscovered  but plausible misrepresentation.</p>
  <p>And only too well he knew whose name would be  associated with the deed!</p>
  <p>Heavy of heart, he returned to the boudoir and  sat in the easy chair, before the mirror.</p>
  <p>New thoughts came surging. It was sure, now,  that Miss Carrington took the aconitine in a glass of water, in her own  apartments,&mdash;one of them,&mdash;and took it, if not knowingly or willingly, at least  without any great objection or disturbance. Clinging to his theory that she was  alone, Stone visualized her taking the draught by herself. Assume for the moment,  an intended headache cure,&mdash;but no! If she took the aconitine alone and  voluntarily, she knew it was poison, for she said &ldquo;To-morrow I shall be freed  forever from this homely face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did it all come back, then, to suicide? No, not  with that glad face, that happy smile, that joyful look of anticipation. A  suffering invalid, longing for death, might thus welcome a happy release, but  not life-loving Lucy Carrington.</p>
  <p>It was too bewildering, too inexplicable. Again  and again Stone scanned the powder papers. They told nothing more than that  they were the powder papers. That was positive, but what did it prove? To whom  did it point?</p>
  <p>Frowning, Stone studied his own face in the  mirror before him. Desperately, he repeated again all the sentences on Anita&rsquo;s  list.</p>
  <p>At one of them he paused, even in the act of  repetition.</p>
  <p>He stared blankly into his own mirrored eyes, a  dawning light beginning to flame back at him. Then, a little wildly, he glanced  around,&mdash;up, down, and back to his almost frenzied, reflected face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he muttered, through his clinched teeth,  for Stone was not a man given to strong expletives, &ldquo;it is! I&rsquo;ve got it at  last! The powder, the pearls,&mdash;the snake! My Heavens! the <i>snake!</i> Oh, Pauline, my love, my love&mdash;but who? who? Have I  discovered this thing only to lead back to her? I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> have it so! I am on the right track at last, and I&rsquo;ll follow  it to the end&mdash;the end, but it shall <i>not</i> lead, I <i>know</i> it will not&mdash;to my heart&rsquo;s  idol, my beautiful Pauline!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>XXI<br>
    Fleming Stone&rsquo;s Theory</b></h2>
  <p>Alone in the library, Fleming Stone and  Detective Hardy were in counsel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you this thing as I see it,  Mr. Hardy,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;I frankly admit it&rsquo;s all theory, I haven&rsquo;t a particle  of human testimony to back it, but it seems to me the <i>only</i> solution that will fit all points of the mystery. And I shall  ask you to consider it confidential for the present, until I can corroborate it  by unmistakable proofs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy nodded assent, his eyes fixed on the  speaker in a sort of fascination.</p>
  <p>This young detective had not been at all idle of  late, but his work had amounted to nothing definite, and though he was himself  convinced that Pauline Stuart was responsible for her aunt&rsquo;s death, he seldom  exploited that view before Stone, having learned that it was an unwelcome  subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the theory in a very small nutshell,&rdquo;  said Stone, &ldquo;but remember, you&rsquo;re not to mention it to any one until I give you  permission. Miss Lucy Carrington took that powder, thinking it a drug that  would make her beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A charm? a philter?&rdquo; Hardy&rsquo;s eyes seemed to  bulge in his excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether it was a fake magic  affair, say, from a clairvoyant or fortune-teller, or whether it was a plain  swindle from a beauty doctor or something of that sort. You know such people  play on the credulity of rich patrons and get enormous sums and a promise of  secrecy for a so-called beauty producer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why would the beauty doctor or the  clairvoyant person give a patient poison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t. They gave a harmless powder, and  some evil-minded person added the aconite, secretly, knowing of the beauty  scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s yet to be discovered, but it will be  easier if we can trace the one who sold her the nostrum. Now, listen while I  reconstruct the scene. Miss Carrington, having dismissed her maid, goes to her  bath-room, and takes the powder dissolved in water. These powder papers, which  I found in her bath-room waste-basket, carry out that idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy stared at the papers, but did not interrupt  the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, joyfully waiting the effect of the charm,  she sits in front of the mirror to watch her features become beautiful. This is  why she said to her own reflection, &lsquo;To-morrow I shall be freed forever from  this homely face!&rsquo; She gazed at the picture of Cleopatra above her  dressing-table, and said &lsquo;Yours is the most beautiful face I have ever seen. I  wish mine were as beautiful.&rsquo; The remarks concerning Count Charlier were  addressed to the glove which she held in her hand, a sentimental part of the  whole performance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mighty interesting, Mr. Stone, but pretty  fantastic, so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone gave his slow, grave smile, that  always betokened a surety of his own statements. &ldquo;Wait a bit, Hardy, before you  condemn this notion. I haven&rsquo;t finished yet. Now Cleopatra figures pretty  strongly in this scheme. Look at these photographs taken after death. They show  the lady exactly as she looked when she sat there. See, she is gazing at the picture  of Cleopatra, too intently to be merely a casual glance. And, what do you think  of this? She gazed at Cleopatra, and, holding the Count&rsquo;s glove, her mind and  heart full of the Count, who would adore her when she achieved this looked-for  beauty, she said, &lsquo;You are the Mark I aim at!&rsquo; meaning, as Cleopatra had her Mark  Antony, she, Lucy Carrington, aimed at the Mark of her choice,&mdash;the Count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, Mr. Stone, you are the wizard  of the ages! How did you dope it out? What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, wait a minute. This isn&rsquo;t the pipe dream  you think it. But listen while I tell the rest in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen! I should think I would! Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know, these fakers give out these charms  with all sorts of fool directions to impress the duped customer. As I say, I&rsquo;m  not sure yet whether it was a professional of the clairvoyant type, or a  regular beauty doctor. But in either case, I&rsquo;ve no doubt that Miss Carrington paid  him enough to compensate for giving up his practice and leaving for parts  unknown. For after the charm failed to work, of course she would expose the  fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the poison&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that for the moment, Mr. Hardy.  Surely, if we can discover for certain how and why the dose was taken, it will  go far to help us trace the criminal who added the deadly element to the  powder. Now, continuing the Cleopatra idea, I am sure that the clever clairvoyante,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll  assume that&rsquo;s what she was,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merely to designate this faker person. Somehow  I seem to see her as one of those crystal-gazing, frowsy-headed kimonoed  females, who prey on the credulity of rich and foolish women,&mdash;well, let&rsquo;s call  her that for the present, this clever clairvoyante somehow conceived the idea  of offering to make Miss Carrington as beautiful as Cleopatra. Perhaps she had  been here to see Miss Carrington on the subject, and that beautiful picture of Cleopatra  put it into her head. But, assuming something of this sort, assume further that  she directed Miss Carrington to robe herself, in a general way, like the queen  in the picture. Note the pearls! Wouldn&rsquo;t this explain Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  getting her pearls from the bank for this occasion? And wouldn&rsquo;t it explain her  speech, &lsquo;You love pearls,&rsquo; as being addressed to Cleopatra, to whom she was  talking!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Mr. Stone! <i>Go</i> on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will go on! Wouldn&rsquo;t that explain, as nothing  else on this green earth can, the purchase of a paper snake by the woman who  feared and abhorred the reptiles! Supposing the fool clairvoyante had told her  that to become like Cleopatra she must have a semblance of a snake at her  throat, as Cleopatra had the asp!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Hardy, nothing else would  account for that snake! And any one of these things might seem the result of a  lunatic imagination by itself, but taken all together, the theory holds water!  Why think of the Oriental scarf, the embroidered robe, the mass of jewels in  addition to the significant pearls, and the scarabs! All point to the type of Cleopatra.  If there had been a picture on the wall, say, of Helen of Troy, and Miss  Carrington had been rigged up in a Greek costume, with a fillet in her hair,  and sandals on her feet,&mdash;or if the picture had shown the Goddess of Liberty,  and we had found Miss Carrington draped in an American flag, could any one have  denied the significance? There can be no doubt,&mdash;no doubt in this world, Hardy,  that the costume, the jewels and the snake all point to a connection with the  picture of Cleopatra, and if so, what other connection is possible than the one  I&rsquo;ve blocked out? Answer me that! And, finally, the speech to the Count, whose  glove she fondled, &lsquo;You are the Mark I aim at.&rsquo; A pleasantry of wording inevitably  suggested by the thought of the man Cleopatra charmed and the man Miss  Carrington desired to charm. And a play on words too, not at all unnatural to  her, for I&rsquo;m told she was both witty and clever in conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, I am carried away by your arguments.  I can&rsquo;t deny their plausibility, but I am bewildered. How did you fathom this  remarkable plan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply because there is no other plan that will  fit the facts. I believe Miss Carrington did say all those things Miss Frayne  relates. I believe she was alone in the room when she said them. Therefore,  they must have had some meaning, and the meanings I have just ascribed to them  must be the true ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They must be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I will further satisfy you that they are.  Here is a memorandum I found in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s desk. It is, as you see, a  list of items. Read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy&rsquo;s eyes stared more widely than ever as he  read:</p>
  <p>Green and gold boudoir robe. Jewels, especially  pearls. Scarabs. Scarf. Snake. Something belonging to H.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, that,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone spoke in low,  even tones, without a hint of boasting or pride in his achievement, &ldquo;is a list  in Miss Carrington&rsquo;s own writing, and is undeniably a list of things to be worn  on the occasion which she hoped would mean a delightful change to the beauty  she so desired to be, but which, instead, was a change to the cold stillness of  death. I found that, after reaching my own conclusions about the Cleopatra  business. If I had found it before, I would have known it must refer to her  costume, but I couldn&rsquo;t have gleaned from it the conclusions I had already come  to. Now, Hardy, are you convinced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am, Mr. Stone. And I am also puzzled. From  all this knowledge, we start fresh, as it were, and we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Hardy. Let&rsquo;s go slowly. Now,  here are two ways to look at this thing. I told you about the clairvoyante  first, because that first came to my mind as the inevitable explanation. But,  suppose, instead of a professional clairvoyante or beauty doctor, some friend  or&mdash;&rdquo; Stone set his teeth, but went on steadily, &ldquo;or some one in the household,  planned all this scheme, and pretended to get a powder that would accomplish  this transformation, gave it to the unsuspecting lady to take by herself, and in  reality this powder was the aconite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy jumped. &ldquo;Then Miss Stuart&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; and Stone&rsquo;s face was white and his voice  like cutting steel, &ldquo;<i>Why </i>Miss Stuart?  Why not Miss Frayne, who listened at the door? Why not Estelle, who knew all  her mistress&rsquo; secrets? Why not Haviland, who is openly enjoying his present  responsible position as man of affairs? Why not Count Charlier, whose crafty  cunning shows on his face? Of course, <i>also,</i> why not Miss Stuart, but why <i>necessarily</i> Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she has run away, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So she has, because of unjust and unfounded  suspicions! When clues point directly to her, I shall admit them, but when they  may equally well point to half a dozen others, I shall patiently investigate  them and learn the truth. Now, I ask of you, Hardy, as man to man, <i>not</i> to favor Miss Stuart unduly, but to  give her a fair show, and remember her lonely position and her timid nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hardy looked furtively at Fleming Stone, whose  eyes were downcast and fastened on some papers he was holding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Count on me, Mr. Stone. I am at your orders. I  subscribe to your theories, and I will do exactly what you tell me, and no more  or less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good, Hardy, and thank you. Now, look at these  papers. They are the ones that contained the fatal powder. See, this paraffin  one was inside; then one of tin-foil, then one of rather heavy writing-paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look altogether like a  clairvoyante&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? It does to me. They are mighty careful  to do up their goods in an elaborate manner to impress their customers. But, mind  you, I don&rsquo;t for a moment suspect this clairvoyante individual of intended  murder. Either the aconite was added to the parcel from the clairvoyante, or  the whole affair was concocted by the murderer and under pretense of its having  come from the clairvoyante.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Hardy was clearly beyond his depth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; went on Stone, &ldquo;we must deduce what we can  from these papers. What do you see peculiar about them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just plain little old nothing,&rdquo; Hardy declared  after a good scrutiny. &ldquo;I see, as you remarked, three papers, folded similarly,  and of nearly the same size. What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much more,&rdquo; confessed Stone, gazing  discontentedly at the papers. &ldquo;And yet, there must be something to notice. Here&rsquo;s  one point. These papers, if tampered with, I mean if anything was added to  their contents, were manipulated very carefully. You know how difficult it is  to unfold and refold a powder-paper without making it look messy. These, I  would be willing to assert, have never been refolded, or, as I say, if they  were, it was done very carefully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t much of a clue,&rdquo; and Hardy smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; returned Stone. &ldquo;It at least  indicates a possible elimination of the clairvoyante and an indication of the  murderer preparing the powder alone. At any rate, Hardy, I&rsquo;ve told you all this  in order to ask your help. Will you go and see what you can round up in the way  of the clairvoyante of our dreams? Go to all you can find in New York City.  That is the prominent ones. Get a line on beauty doctors, and generally look up  this sort of thing. And keep it all under your hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and Hardy was off at  once.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone put away the papers, and sat for  more than an hour in a brown study. It must be admitted that a photograph of  Pauline Stuart, which stood on a near-by table, held his eyes much of the time.  And his gaze, as it rested on the lovely face, was now tender and now sad.</p>
  <p>At last he rang for a servant. To the footman  who replied, he made a request that a chamber-maid be sent to him.</p>
  <p>The girl came, wondering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary?&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jane, sir,&rdquo; returned the maid, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;You have intelligence,  Jane, as shown by your calm rejoinder. Now, I want you to go to the various  bedrooms or dressing-rooms of all the members of the family and of all the  servants, and bring me all the manicure scissors you can find. I assume that  some of the servants might possibly have them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, some of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Get all you can possibly find, and  be very, <i>very</i> careful to remember  which ones are whose. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go. If anybody questions you, say Mr.  Stone ordered it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jane returned with many pairs of the kind of  scissors asked for by the Detective. Absorbedly, Stone took them from her, and  one by one he used them to snip at a sheet of paper from the library desk.</p>
  <p>At each test, he asked Jane whose the scissors  were, and sometimes he wrote the name beside the cut and sometimes not. One  pair in especial seemed to interest him. &ldquo;Whose are these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those, sir, I took from Miss Carrington&rsquo;s  dressing-table.&rdquo; Jane gave a slight shudder as if at the recollection of the  tragedy of that table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But these are of a different patterned handle  from the rest of that dressing-table&rsquo;s silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, as to that. They were there  and I brought them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Jane. Take them all back to their  places. Mind now, don&rsquo;t mix them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A strange excitement seemed to seize upon  Fleming Stone. Abruptly he left the room, and, flinging on his overcoat in the  hall, he snatched his hat and went away, almost on a run. His steps took him to  the garage and in a few moments he was in a swift little runabout being driven  to the sanatorium where Estelle was still staying.</p>
  <p>After a call there, he hurried to Police  Headquarters. Thence, after a rather long call, to a telegraph office, to one  or two shops and then back to Garden Steps.</p>
  <p>Here he put several servants at work for him,  packing his effects and such matters, then summoning Gray Haviland to the  library, he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sailing for Egypt this afternoon. May I ask you to make  no further investigations till my return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egypt!&rdquo; gasped Gray. &ldquo;Good Heavens, man! what  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the interest of my work for you,&rdquo; returned  Stone, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish! You&rsquo;re chasing Pauline! We&rsquo;ll never  see either of you again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone smiled. &ldquo;I do love her, Haviland,  I make no denial of that fact. And I do hate to have her alone in a strange  land. So, if I can be of any help to her, an ocean or two to cross shall not keep  me from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your detective work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will not suffer by my absence. I&rsquo;ve been to the  Police and to the District Attorney and they approve my plans as I&rsquo;ve outlined  them so far. The rest must wait my return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, and when will you be back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but I will keep you  informed of my whereabouts. Say good-by to Miss Frayne for me, and please  excuse me now, as I&rsquo;ve heaps to do. By the way, where is that record of Miss  Carrington&rsquo;s song that I have heard of? Play it for me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thought you were in such a hurry!&rdquo; laughed  Haviland, but granted the request.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; commented the Detective, as he  heard it on the phonograph. &ldquo;It is a perfectly-made record. If you don&rsquo;t mind,  I&rsquo;ll take possession of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Gray, carelessly, and in  another half hour Fleming Stone was on his way to the pier where the <i>Macedonia</i> was making ready to sail.</p>

    Pauline In Cairo</b></h2>
  <p>On the first of March, about mid-afternoon, the <i>Catalonia</i> steamed into the harbor of  Alexandria. Pauline, at the rail, watched the clearing outlines of mosques and  minarets, as the beautiful city became visible. It was a glistening, dazzling  strip, between the deep blue of the sea and the azure of the sky, and,  breathless with delight, she gazed at the shining sunlit picture.</p>
  <p>Then the Arab pilot came aboard, and soon  Pauline found herself in a shore-boat, swiftly making for the quay. She knew  Loria would meet her at Alexandria, she had had a telegram at Naples to that  effect, and she thrilled with pleasure at thought of seeing wonderful Egypt  with him. Landing, she was bewildered by the crowd of strange-looking people, natives,  tourists, officials and porters, all shouting, running and getting in each  other&rsquo;s way. Luggage was everywhere, and the game seemed to be to present any  piece of it to anybody except the owner. Pauline fell to laughing at the antics  of a black man robed in white and a brown man robed in yellow fighting for  possession of a small portmanteau, while its timid and bewildered owner  desperately hung on to it herself.</p>
  <p>Three or four Arabs gathered round Pauline  herself, each asserting his claim to all the virtues of a perfect dragoman. In  more or less intelligible English, each insisted he had been sent to her  personally by Effendi This or That, of marvelous wealth and power. Greatly  interested, she listened to their arguments, until, encouraged, they became so insistent  that she was frightened. Seeing this, they waxed threatening, even belligerent,  in their determination to be engaged, and just as one laid his brown, long  fingers on her arm, and she drew back in a panic of fear, she saw Carr Loria&rsquo;s  smiling face coming to her through the crowd.</p>
  <p>With a wave of his hand and a few short  commands, he sent the bothersome Arabs flying, and greeted Pauline with  affectionate enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Polly, dear! but I&rsquo;m glad to see you! Have you  had a good trip? But such questions must wait a bit. Where are your checks? Do  you see your boxes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one, and some hand things. Here is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Loria took the little sheaf of  papers she produced from her handbag. &ldquo;Ahri, look after these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A tall Arab glided to Loria&rsquo;s side, and took the  checks. &ldquo;Ahri is my dragoman and body-servant and general factotum,&rdquo; said  Loria, by way of introduction. &ldquo;This lady, Ahri, is my cousin, Miss Stuart. Her  word is law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Loria. Miss Stoort is queen of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man made a salaam of obeisance and turned  away to look after the luggage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonder, that Ahri,&rdquo; said Carrington  Loria, looking after the retreating Arab. &ldquo;But be very haughty with him, Polly.  He presumes upon the least encouragement. Treat him like the dust under your  feet, and he&rsquo;ll adore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; and Pauline smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  scared to death of these brown and black men. But your servant is so grand of  costume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a very high-class affair. Handsome  chap and fond of dress. But he&rsquo;s invaluable to me. Speaks almost perfect  English, and knows everything there is to know,&mdash;and then some. Knows, too,  everybody who has ever been in Cairo or ever thought of coming here. And he  possesses the proud distinction of being the only dragoman here-abouts who hasn&rsquo;t  a letter of recommendation from Hichens. You haven&rsquo;t that, have you, Ahri?&rdquo; for  the Arab had just reappeared.</p>
  <p>A marvelous set of white teeth gleamed in the  sunlight, as the response came quickly: &ldquo;I had one, Mr. Loria, but I sold it.  They are of use to others; Ahri needs none.&rdquo; His self-conceit was superb, and  he spoke with the air of a prince. But warned by Loria, Pauline gave him no  answering smile, rather a patronizing nod, and Ahri&rsquo;s respect for the newcomer  went up several points.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come along, girlie,&rdquo; commanded Carrington and  he took Pauline&rsquo;s arm as he hurried her to the boat-train.</p>
  <p>Watchful Ahri showed them to the compartment he  had secured for them, and soon they were on their way to Cairo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, tell me everything,&rdquo; said Carr Loria, as  they sat alone. &ldquo;This is a three-hour trip and I want to know the whole story.  Just think, Pauline, I&rsquo;ve had only a few letters, and they were&mdash;well,&mdash;they were  almost contradictory in some ways. So tell me all, from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline did, and by the time they reached Cairo,  Loria knew as much as she of the death of their aunt and the subsequent search  for the murderer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it strange,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;that that Bates  person should go in to kill her, the very night somebody else had the same  intention?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, but, Carr, Bates didn&rsquo;t start out to kill  her, you know; he went to steal the jewels, and he knew they were all in the  house that night, because Estelle told him so. Now, of course, whoever gave her  the poison, must have known it too&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Why didn&rsquo;t somebody want to  put her out of the way to get a bequest? Not necessarily the Count gentleman,  but maybe one of the servants. Maybe that Estelle? Didn&rsquo;t she receive a legacy  in Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but nobody has thought of suspecting her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why not. I thought of her first clip.  I don&rsquo;t think that Stone paragon amounts to much. Hey, what are you blushing  about? Sits the wind in that quarter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease me, Carr. I <i>do</i> like him better than any man I ever saw, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so you ran away and left him! Out with it,  Polly. Tell your old Uncle Dudley the story of your life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell, Carr, about Mr. Stone.  But I came to you, because some people suspect me,&mdash;<i>ME</i>&mdash;of&mdash;of killing Aunt Lucy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pauline! They don&rsquo;t! Who suspects you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the police people, and Gray and Anita  Frayne,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They do! You poor little girl! I&rsquo;m glad you  came to me. I&rsquo;ll take care of you. But, Polly, whom do <i>you</i> suspect? Honest, now, who is in your mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Carr. I can&rsquo;t seem to think. But  when they fastened it on me, I was so frightened, I just flew. Why, just think,  every one at Garden Steps was suspicious of me! I could see it even in the  servants&rsquo; eyes. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and I was afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, go on,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I was afraid Mr. Stone would think so,  and I couldn&rsquo;t bear that, so I just ran off on impulse. I regretted it lots of  times on the trip over,&mdash;and then at other times I was glad I came. Are you  glad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, Polly. I wanted you to stick to your plan  of coming over, you know. Yes, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here. Now, we&rsquo;ll soon be in  Cairo, and you&rsquo;ll love it,&mdash;all the strange sights and experiences. You&rsquo;ll live  at Shepheard&rsquo;s for the present. I&rsquo;ve engaged a chaperon for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How thoughtful you are, Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, a beautiful young woman can&rsquo;t  live alone in Cairo, and also of course, you couldn&rsquo;t live with me. So, Mrs.  MacDonald will look after you, but she won&rsquo;t in any way bother you. Whenever  you need a duenna, she&rsquo;ll be right at your elbow, and when you don&rsquo;t want her  about, she is self-effacing. You&rsquo;ll like her, too, she&rsquo;s not half-bad as a companion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At Cairo, Ahri handed them from the train. Again  Polly was impressed with the Arab&rsquo;s dignified bearing and rich costume. His  long galabeah, shaped like a well-fitting bathrobe, was of white corded silk,  exquisitely embroidered. Collarless, it gave glimpses of other silken  vestments, and over it he wore a correct English topcoat, short and  velvet-trimmed. From his tarbush to his English shoes and silk hose, he was  perfectly garbed and groomed, while the scarab ring on his little finger was  the only bit of jewelry visible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; laughed Loria, following her  glance. &ldquo;Wait till you see him in all the glory of his burnoose and other  contraptions. Here, Ahri, take this duffel, too. And, now, Polly-pops, you&rsquo;ll  see Cairo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ride to the hotel was like a moving picture  in color. The street crowds were rushing by, a flare of bright-hued raiment and  dark-skinned faces. Everywhere, baubles were for sale. Street vendors carried  them on their heads, in their arms, or thrust them forth with eager hands.</p>
  <p>Post-cards, jewelry, scarfs, and fans.  Fly-whisks with dangling beads. Embroideries, carved ivories, brasses,  sweetmeats, fruits and newspapers, all were successively and collectively  offered for immediate, almost compulsory sale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I want to buy every one!&rdquo; declared Pauline,  entranced at the sight of the catch-penny toys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All in good time, honey. To-morrow, Ahri shall  take you to the bazaars, with or without Mrs. MacDonald, as you choose, and you  can get a bushel of foolishness if you want to. Everybody has to cure that  first mad desire to buy rubbish, by yielding to it. You soon get enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I may go alone with Ahri to the shops?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, anywhere, by daylight, except to social  affairs. There, or to any in-door entertainment, you must take her. But she&rsquo;ll  know all these things. Abide always by her decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you be with me, Carr? You speak as if  I will be much without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully busy, Pauline; I&rsquo;ll tell you all  about it this evening. Then you&rsquo;ll understand. Here we are at Shepheard&rsquo;s. Did  you ever see such a horde of freaks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was just about dusk. The last rays of the  Egyptian sunset were lingering, as if for Pauline to get one glimpse of the  picture by their rainbow lights. Many were at tea on the broad Terrace; the  scarlet-coated band crashed their brasses; and Pauline entered the hotel, her  whole being responding to the strange thrill that Cairo gives even to the most phlegmatic  visitor or jaded tourist.</p>
  <p>Later, at dinner, she met Mrs. MacDonald, a  correct, tactful and diplomatic widow, who looked forward with pleasure to the  chaperonage of the beautiful girl to whom she was introduced.</p>
  <p>At Loria&rsquo;s advice, Pauline had put on evening  dress; and she made a striking picture, in black tulle, devoid of all jewelry  or ornament save a breast-knot of purple orchids her cousin had sent to her  rooms.</p>
  <p>At dinner, conversation was general, and the  trio was made a quartet by the addition of an English friend of Loria&rsquo;s whom he  ran across in the hotel lobby. Later, after they had had their coffee in the  great hall, Mrs. MacDonald and the Englishman strolled away and the cousins  were left alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How beautiful you have grown, Pauline,&rdquo; Carr  said, his eyes resting on her piquant face, crowned with its mass of soft, dark  hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, John,&rdquo; she returned smiling  up into the handsome, sunburned face of the man who scrutinized her. &ldquo;You have  acquired not only a becoming tan, but a new air of distinction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad you think so, girlie. Thanks a whole lot.  How do you like the MacDonald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very much so far. She won&rsquo;t try to boss me,  will she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not unless you make it necessary; but you must  remember that English etiquette obtains in Cairo, and you mustn&rsquo;t try to be  unconventional, except as Mrs. MacDonald approves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t disgrace you, Carr, I&rsquo;ve common  sense, I hope. Now tell me about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m deep in a new project, Polly, a wonderful  one. It&rsquo;s an enormous undertaking, but I shall put it through all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it? Excavation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a way. But here&rsquo;s the story. Mind, now, it&rsquo;s  a dead secret. Don&rsquo;t mention it to Mrs. Mac. I trust you with it, but it must  go no further. Well, in a word, I&rsquo;ve come into possession of an old papyrus,  that tells of a treasure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Carr, are you a treasure-seeker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, wait till I tell you. This papyrus is  authentic, and it&rsquo;s nothing more nor less than an account of a great hoard of  jewels and gold sunk, purposely, by an old Egyptian king to save them from  seizure. You wouldn&rsquo;t understand all the reasons that prove this is a true  bill, but it is, and so you must take my word for it. All right. The old duffer  saw fit to sink this stuff in the Nile, at a certain spot, designated in this papyrus  thing, and all I&rsquo;ve got to do is to dig her up, and there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&rsquo;s face lighted up with the enthusiasm  of the true arch&aelig;ologist, and Pauline caught the spirit, too, as she exclaimed,  &ldquo;How splendid! How do you get down to it,&mdash;if it&rsquo;s under the Nile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big scheme, Polly!&rdquo; and Loria&rsquo;s eyes  sparkled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have a coffer-dam, an enormous one,&mdash;and, oh, and a whole  lot of paraphernalia, and it will cost like fury, but the end justifies the expense,&mdash;and  then, think of the glory of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got a right to do all this? Can  anybody dig wherever he likes in Egypt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you little goose! But I&rsquo;ve managed all that  part. I won&rsquo;t tell even you about it, but I&rsquo;ve&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve fixed it up. Now,  listen here, Pollypops, you&rsquo;re to tell just simply <i>nobody</i> a word of all this,&mdash;not one, littlest, leastest mite of a  word! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Carr, of course I won&rsquo;t tell, if you  say not to. But will you be away from us? Out of Cairo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Off and on. I&rsquo;ll be back and forth, you know.  This place is up the Nile a bit, and, of course, I have to be there much of the  time. But you&rsquo;ll be all right. I know heaps of people, jolly sort, too, and  Mrs. Mac will take you round, and you&rsquo;ll have the time of your sweet young  life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall. But, Carr, have you forgotten  all about America, and Aunt Lucy and&mdash;and Fleming Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Pauline, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten those things.  But, I own up, aside from the awful circumstances, I&rsquo;m not terribly wrought up  over Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s death. Poor old thing, she wasn&rsquo;t so awfully happy, you know,  and Lord knows, she didn&rsquo;t make anybody else happy. Then, too, you must realize  that as I wasn&rsquo;t there, through the dreadful time, as you were, I can&rsquo;t feel  the same thrill and horror of it. In fact, I try to forget it all I can, as I  can&rsquo;t do anybody any good by mulling over it. So, if you want to please me, old  girl, you&rsquo;ll refer to it as little as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you care who killed her? Don&rsquo;t you  want to find out the murderer and bring him to justice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want that done, Polly, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to do it. That&rsquo;s why I put it  all in Haviland&rsquo;s hands; that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to go to America, unless, as  I told you at first, unless <i>you</i> needed me. I can&rsquo;t pay proper attention to my work here if I have any such  worriment as that on my shoulders. And I tell you, Pauline, this chance that  has come to me is the chance of a lifetime, the chance of a century! It means  fortune, fame and glory for me. It means&mdash;oh Pauline, it means <i>everything!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Carr, I won&rsquo;t interfere in anyway  with your work. I&rsquo;ll do as you tell me, but&mdash;but if they continue to suspect me,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspect you! My <i>dear</i> girl! Let &lsquo;em try it! I&rsquo;ll see to that! Don&rsquo;t you fear. If  anything bothers you, just leave it to me! Ah, here come our truants. Now,  Polly, for my sake, leave all those subjects for the present, and be your own  dear entertaining self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Pauline granted his request, and was so  attractive and charming that the Englishman straightway fell over head and  heels in love and Mrs. MacDonald was torn between throes of admiration and  envy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br>
    Two Wills</b></h2>
  <p>For a few days Loria staid in Cairo, and devoted  all his time to the amusement and entertainment of Pauline. Together they  visited the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Together they made trips to Old  Cairo and to the Ostrich Farm. Together they saw the Little Petrified Forest.  But the immediate sights of Cairo, the tombs, mosques and bazaars, Loria told her,  she could visit with Mrs. MacDonald or with their dragoman, after he and Ahri  had gone on their trip up the Nile.</p>
  <p>Pauline was happy. At Carr&rsquo;s request she had  endeavored to put out of her mind the horrors she had been through. Frightened  at the suspicions directed toward herself, fearing that she could not  successfully combat them,&mdash;and, for another reason,&mdash;she had fled to Egypt, and  her cousin&rsquo;s protection. This other reason she had almost dismissed from her  mind, and she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the novelty and interest of  her present situation.</p>
  <p>After their sight-seeing each day, they returned  for tea on the Terrace at Shepheard&rsquo;s or went to Ghezireh Palace for it, or to  the house of some friend. Dinner was always a pleasant affair, and they had  frequent guests and were often invited out.</p>
  <p>As Pauline was wearing mourning, no large social  affairs were attended, and under Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s guidance the girl pursued her  happy way.</p>
  <p>Nearly a week after Pauline&rsquo;s arrival, Loria  told her that the next day he must leave her, and go up the Nile to attend to  his work there. They were in the sitting room of Pauline&rsquo;s pleasant suite at  the hotel, and Mrs. MacDonald promised to cherish most carefully her charge in  Loria&rsquo;s absence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long shall you be away, Carr?&rdquo; asked  Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncertain, Polly. Perhaps only a few days  this time, perhaps a week. I&rsquo;ll be back and forth, you know, and you&rsquo;re bound  to find enough to interest you. Keep me advised of any news from America. You  can always reach me by mail or wire, or telephone if need be. And, here&rsquo;s another  matter, Pauline. You know, this work I&rsquo;m up against is more or less dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dangerous, how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s blasting and danger of cave-ins  and such matters,&mdash;but don&rsquo;t feel alarmed, I&rsquo;ll probably come through all right.  Only, I want to make my will, so if anything should happen, you&rsquo;ll be my heir  without any fuss about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk about such things, Carr. You  frighten me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, don&rsquo;t take it like that. Now, see  here. You know my way. Touch and go is my motto. So, I&rsquo;ve asked a lawyer chap  to come here to-night and fix up things. Suppose you make your will, too. Then  it will seem more like a business matter, and not as if either of us expects to  die soon. Who&rsquo;s your heir to be, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve never thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you ought to. You see, now you&rsquo;re <i>some</i> heiress, and it isn&rsquo;t right not to  have a will made,&mdash;on general principles. To be sure, you may marry,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I ever will, Carr!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Pollypops, of course you will. But  you must take your time and select a good chappie. Now, how does this strike  you? Jeffries, my lawyer, is coming here, right away. Suppose we each make a  will, leaving all our worldly goods to each other. Then, later, when you decide  on your life mate, you can change and rearrange as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any fortune yet. Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s  estate isn&rsquo;t all settled, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No matter about that. It will be, in course of  time. I have every confidence in Haviland, he&rsquo;s as honest a chap as ever  breathed. He&rsquo;ll fix up all our interests over there, in apple-pie order and don&rsquo;t  you forget it! Humor me in this thing, Polly, and believe I know more of  business affairs than you do, and it&rsquo;s best to do as I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline was easily persuaded, and as the  arrangement was conceded to be merely temporary, she agreed. Jeffries came. The  two wills were drawn, signed and witnessed, all in correct form. Loria, in his,  bequeathed to Pauline all he might die possessed of, and except for a few  charities and minor bequests, Pauline left her fortune to Carr. The business  was soon over, and Loria took both documents, saying he would put them in his  Safe Deposit box for the present, as Pauline had no place for valuable papers.</p>
  <p>The next day, Loria, accompanied by the  invaluable Ahri, went away to the site of his projected enterprise. This affair  was conducted with such strict secrecy that even the location was not known to  many. Actual work had not yet been begun, but negotiations and preparations of  vast importance were being made, and secret conclaves were held by those most interested.  Pauline had been emphatically adjured to give not the least hint to any one  whatever of the project, and she had promised faithfully to obey Carr&rsquo;s  injunctions.</p>
  <p>The next afternoon, a telegram from Fleming  Stone announced his arrival at Alexandria and his immediate appearance in  Cairo.</p>
  <p>Addressed to her, in Loria&rsquo;s care, Pauline  received it duly, for her mail was brought to her at Shepheard&rsquo;s, and Carr&rsquo;s  forwarded to him wherever he might be. She had had a cable from Haviland, but  no American letters had yet reached her. Stone, having sailed just a week after  Pauline&rsquo;s departure from New York, was arriving eight days after her own advent  at Cairo.</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s first emotion was of joy. The thought  of seeing Stone again, eclipsed all other thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Mac!&rdquo; she cried, clasping that  somewhat rotund matron round the waist and leading her an enforced dance. &ldquo;Mr.  Stone is coming! Will be here for tea! Oh, I <i>am</i> so glad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But her second thoughts were more disturbing. <i>Why</i> was he coming? What were his  suspicions? Could he be tracking her down? Though Fleming Stone had never said  a word of love to her, Pauline knew, by her own heart&rsquo;s &lsquo;detective instinct,&rsquo;  that he <i>cared.</i> But, his sense of duty  might make it necessary to follow where the trail of suspicion led, even at  cost of his own affections. Then, too, could he suspect?&mdash;But Pauline&rsquo;s irrepressible  joy at thought of seeing him left her little time or wish to indulge in gloomy  forebodings.</p>
  <p>Singing, she ran off to dress for Stone&rsquo;s reception.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which is prettier?&rdquo; she asked of Mrs. Mac,  holding up an embroidered white cr&ecirc;pe, of Cairo construction, and a black net  gown, brought from New York.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wear the white, Miss Stuart. It&rsquo;s most becoming  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was, and when arrayed in the lovely, soft,  clinging affair, with a cluster of tiny white rose-buds at her belt, Pauline&rsquo;s  unusually pink cheeks and her scarlet flower of a mouth gave all the color  necessary.</p>
  <p>Her beautiful hair, piled in a crown atop her  little head, was held by a carved ivory comb, and beneath their half-drooped  lashes her great eyes shone like stars.</p>
  <p>For the Terrace, she donned a large white hat,  with black ostrich plumes, and flinging a white cape edged with black fur over  her arm, she descended to meet her guest.</p>
  <p>Though little given to emotional demonstration,  Fleming Stone caught his breath with a quick gasp at sight of her, and advanced  with outstretched hands and a smile of a sort no one had ever before seen on  that always calm face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said, smiling; for, though  thrilled herself, she remembered the unfailing curiosity of the Terrace crowds.</p>
  <p>But Stone, having taken her two hands in his,  stood looking at her as if he intended to pursue that occupation for the rest  of his natural life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said, laughing a little  nervously under his gaze; &ldquo;this is our table. Will you have tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea, of course,&rdquo; and at last Fleming Stone took  himself in hand and behaved like a reasonable citizen. &ldquo;And how are you? And  your cousin, where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Loria is out of Cairo just now,&rdquo; and  Pauline turned to give the waiter his order. &ldquo;But we are three, as I am under  most strict surveillance&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, realizing what that phrase meant to a detective!  &ldquo;Of a perfect dragon of a chaperon,&rdquo; she continued bravely, trying to control  her quivering lip. &ldquo;Here she comes now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The appearance and introduction of Mrs.  MacDonald gave Pauline time to regain her poise, and a glance of pathetic  appeal to Stone made him take up the burden of conversation for a few moments.  And then, with the arrival of the tea, the chat became gayer, and, of course,  impersonal.</p>
  <p>The Englishman, Pitts, appeared, indeed, he  inevitably appeared when Pauline was on the Terrace, and joined the group  without invitation.</p>
  <p>It was not Fleming Stone&rsquo;s first visit to Egypt,  and he noted with interest the changes, and looked with gladness on things  unchanged, as the kaleidoscopic scene whirled about him.</p>
  <p>Later, they all went up to Pauline&rsquo;s sitting  room, and viewed the street pageant from second-story windows.</p>
  <p>And then, Mrs. MacDonald, after a short and  losing battle between her conventions and her kind-heartedness, insisted that  Mr. Pitts must take her across the street to buy some imperatively necessary  writing-paper.</p>
  <p>Outwardly courteous but inwardly of a rampageous  unwillingness, Mr. Pitts acquiesced in her scheme, and Fleming Stone politely  closed the door behind them.</p>
  <p>He turned, to see Pauline looking at him, with a  gaze, frightened, but,&mdash;yes, surely,&mdash;welcoming, and not waiting to analyze the  intent of the gaze more deeply, Stone took a chance, and in another instant,  held her in his arms so closely that the intent of her glance was of little importance  to anybody.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pauline!&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;how I love you! My  darling,&mdash;mine! No, no, don&rsquo;t speak&mdash;&rdquo; and he laid his finger tips on her parted  lips, &ldquo;Just look at me, and so&mdash;tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wonderful eyes raised themselves to his, and  Stone&rsquo;s phenomenal insight was not necessary for him to read the message they  held.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do love me!&rdquo; he whispered: &ldquo;oh, my little  girl!&rdquo; and after a long, silent embrace, he cried jubilantly: &ldquo;Now tell me! Now  tell me in words, in words, Pauline, that you do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unhesitatingly, without shyness, Pauline,  radiant-faced, whispered, &ldquo;I love you, dear,&rdquo; and the vibrant tones filled the  simple words to the brim of assurance.</p>
  <p>Though it seemed to them but a moment, it was  some time later that Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s tap sounded on the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Pauline, springing away from Stone&rsquo;s  side, while he sauntered to the window. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. MacDonald, you must know it  at once! Mr. Stone is my fianc&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Mac was duly surprised and delighted, and,  after congratulations, sent Stone away to dress for dinner, and endeavored to  calm down her emotional charge.</p>
  <p>Later that evening, Stone and Pauline sat in the  hall watching the people. Almost as much alone as on a desert island, they  conversed in low tones, and Stone, between expressions of adoration, told her  of his theory of the beauty charm.</p>
  <p>With paling face, Pauline listened. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; she  whispered. &ldquo;Who? Do you suspect anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know of your aunt ever having  consulted any beauty doctor or any such person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;m sure she never did. Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know of any one who would give  her poison, under pretense of its being a charm or beautifier?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo; and, with a face  white as ashes, Pauline rose from her chair. &ldquo;You must excuse me, Mr. Stone. I  am ill,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t feel well&mdash;. Really I must beg to be excused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Almost before he realized what she was doing,  Pauline had left him, glided to the elevator, and he heard the door of the cage  clang to, even as he followed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;poor dear  little girl!&rdquo; and going in quest of Mrs. MacDonald, he asked her to go to  Pauline.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will perhaps find her greatly disturbed,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;but I assure you it is nothing that can be avoided or remedied.  Please, Mrs. MacDonald, just try to comfort and cheer her, without asking the  cause of her sadness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a straightforward look into Stone&rsquo;s eyes,  which was as frankly returned, Mrs. MacDonald nodded her head and hastened  away.</p>
  <p>As Stone had predicted she found Pauline sobbing  hysterically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she queried, &ldquo;tell Mrs. Mac.  Or, if you&rsquo;d rather not, at least tell me what I can do for you. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t  cry so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But no words could she get from the sobbing  girl, except an insistent demand for a telegraph blank. This was provided, and  Pauline wrote a message to Carr Loria telling him that Fleming Stone had come  to Cairo. This she ordered despatched at once. Then she begged Mrs. MacDonald  to leave her, as she wished to go to bed and try to forget her troubles in sleep.</p>
  <p>Meantime, Fleming Stone left the hotel and  proceeded straight to Carr Loria&rsquo;s rooms. He expressed surprise when the  janitor informed him of Mr. Loria&rsquo;s absence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be back in a  few days. But I&rsquo;ll just go in and write a note and leave it on his desk for  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The janitor hesitated, but after a transference  of some coin of the realm was effected, he cheerfully unlocked the door and  Stone found himself in Loria&rsquo;s apartment. It was a comfortable place, even  luxurious, in a mannish way, and the Detective looked about with interest. As  he had proposed, he went to the writing table and taking a sheet of paper from the  rack, wrote a short note. But instead of leaving it, he put it in his pocket,  saying to the watchful janitor that perhaps it would be better to mail it.  Then, he stepped into Loria&rsquo;s bedroom, but so quickly did he step out again,  that the janitor hadn&rsquo;t time to reprove or forbid him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, as he started to leave. &ldquo;When  Mr. Loria returns you can tell him I called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This permission went far to allay the janitor&rsquo;s  fears that he had been indiscreet; for Carr Loria was not a man who brooked  interference with his affairs or belongings.</p>

    Confession</b></h2>
  <p>Carr Loria was at Heluan when he received  Pauline&rsquo;s telegram. For a few moments he studied it, and then going to a hotel  office, he possessed himself of a telegram blank which he proceeded to write  on, by the use of a type-writer near-by.</p>
  <p>With a preoccupied look on his face, as if  thinking deeply, he called Ahri and gave him a long and careful list of  directions.</p>
  <p>And it was in pursuance of these directions that  the Arab presented himself at Shepheard&rsquo;s at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning and  asked for Miss Stuart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Ahri?&rdquo; asked Pauline, as she  received the dragoman in her sitting room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Stoort,&rdquo; and the Arab was deeply  respectful, &ldquo;Mr. Loria begs that you go with me to Sakkara to visit the  Pyramids and Necropolis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; said Pauline, in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady. Mr. Loria will himself meet you  at the station. Will you start at once, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am expecting a caller&mdash;Mr. Stone,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon, but Mr. Loria said if you hesitated for  any reason, to implore you to go with me quickly, and he will explain all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline paled a little, but she said, simply, &ldquo;Very  well, Ahri, I will go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Escorted by the silent, majestic-mannered Arab,  Pauline was taken through the crowded streets to the station, and they boarded  a train just as it was leaving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We did get the train, Miss Stoort,&rdquo; said Ahri,  with his sad smile, &ldquo;Mr. Loria would be greatly mad if we had missed it. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline nodded at him, her thoughts full of the  spoiled day, which she had hoped to spend with Stone.</p>
  <p>Yet she longed to see Carr, she wanted to tell  him what Mr. Stone had said about the beauty charm and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said Mr. Loria would meet us at the  station, Ahri; you put me on the train so quickly I had no chance to speak.  Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not the Cairo station, my lady. The station at  Bedrashein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where we are going. We alight there to see the  ruins of Memphis and the Pyramids of Sakkara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline looked puzzled, but said no more and sat  silently wrapped in her own thoughts, now of Stone, now of Carr, and again of  herself.</p>
  <p>At Bedrashein, they left the train. Pauline  looked anxiously around but saw nothing of her cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not see him,&rdquo; said Ahri, gravely, meeting  her inquiring glance; &ldquo;but I obey his orders. He said, if he be not here, we go  to the desert to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the desert? How? Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This way. Here are our carts.&rdquo; Ahri led the way  to where two sand-carts stood waiting, evidently for them. They were a little  like English dog-carts and drawn by desert horses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You take that one, Miss Stoort, and I this,&rdquo;  directed Ahri, standing with outstretched hand, like a commanding officer.</p>
  <p>Bewildered but knowing the responsibility of  Carr&rsquo;s servant, Pauline got into the cart he indicated. She did not at all like  the looks of the gaunt black Moor who drove her, but thought best to say  nothing. She had learned never to show fear of the native servants, and she  held her head high, and gave the driver only a haughty stare. Ahri, after she  was arranged for, sprang into the other cart, and they set off.</p>
  <p>The road was through the village, through palm  groves, past large expanses of water, and at last through desert wastes, among  foot-hills that quickly cut off the view of the road just traversed.</p>
  <p>Pauline&rsquo;s cart was ahead of the other, and looking  back she could not see the other one, in which Ahri rode.</p>
  <p>A strange feeling began to creep into her heart.  Covertly she glanced at her driver. The hard bony face was not turned her way,  but she had an uncanny sense that the man was grinning at her. Sternly she bade  him stop and wait for the other cart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No Ingleese,&rdquo; he rejoined, with a dogged  expression on his ugly countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I command you,&rdquo; and Pauline laid hold of his  arm, &ldquo;I insist that you stop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No Ingleese,&rdquo; he repeated, and now he gave her  a distinctly impudent look and spurred the horse to faster pace.</p>
  <p>Pauline considered. She was frightened beyond  words to express, but she knew she must not show fear. Haughtily she held her  proud little head aloft, and tried to think what was best to do. Something was  wrong, that she knew, but whether it was Ahri who was at fault, or this  dreadful man beside her, or&mdash;or,&mdash;she stifled back the thought of Loria.</p>
  <p>He would save her, she knew he would, cried her  worried brain, but in her heart was black doubt. All the unadmitted fears she  had known of late, all the repressed suspicions, all the insistent doubts,  these came flocking, clamoring for recognition.</p>
  <p>On they went,&mdash;where they might be she had no  idea. Nothing could be seen but the never-ending hills, not high, but of  sufficient height to cut off all view of anything but their sandy slopes. Miles  and miles they traversed. The sun was under a cloud, and Pauline had no  knowledge of the direction they were taking. But from the man&rsquo;s grim, stony  face, and cruel eyes, she knew she was in dreadful, even desperate danger. Courageously,  she insisted over and over that they stop. The reply was only a shaken head and  a reassertion that English was an unknown tongue. This Pauline knew to be a  lie, from his intelligent expression at her words. At last, desperately trying  to control her trembling hands, she offered her purse, if he would stop.</p>
  <p>To her surprise, he consented, and jerked his  horse to a stand-still. Pauline handed over the purse, and the driver got out  of the cart, indicating by gestures that she should also alight, and rest  herself.</p>
  <p>The cart was small, and the ride had been  uncomfortable, so after a moment&rsquo;s thought Pauline jumped out. She reasoned  that the man having her money, had no desire to prolong the trip, and in a  moment they would go back to Bedrashein. Often had she heard of these  robberies, and she felt that, cupidity satisfied, she had little to fear.</p>
  <p>But no sooner was she on the ground, than the  Moor sprang again into his cart, and whipping up his horse, sped away across  the desert sand and in a minute rounded a hill and was out of sight.</p>
  <p>Pauline looked after him an instant, and then,  realizing to the uttermost what it meant,&mdash;that she was abandoned to her fate in  a trackless desert,&mdash;fell in a little heap on the sands and fainted away.</p>
  <p>It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock on the morning of  that same day, that Carr Loria went to Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel and asked for Fleming  Stone.</p>
  <p>The two men met, and eyed each other  appraisingly. There was no light chat, each was of serious face and in grave  mood.</p>
  <p>Loria spoke first, after the short greeting. &ldquo;I  have a telegram from my cousin, Miss Stuart,&rdquo; he said, drawing a paper from his  pocket. &ldquo;I know why you are here, Mr. Stone, and I think best to show you this.  Frankly, I am glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone took the message, and read:</p>
  <p>I have run away again. I am afraid of F. S. Don&rsquo;t  try to find me, I am all right, and I will communicate with you after he goes  back to U. S. I positively will not make my whereabouts known as long as he is  in Cairo. Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
  <p>Polly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We may as well be honest with one another,&rdquo;  Loria went on. &ldquo;I gather, from your presence here, that you know my cousin is  guilty of the death of her aunt; but you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> know, what that poor  girl had to put up with. I can&rsquo;t blame her, that in a moment of,&mdash;really of temporary  insanity,&mdash;she let herself be tempted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to cut short this interview, Mr.  Loria,&rdquo; said Stone, in his quiet way, &ldquo;but, truly, I&rsquo;ve a most important  engagement just now. If I could see you, say this evening, and talk these  things over by ourselves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, Mr. Stone. I must return to my work  to-morrow, but I&rsquo;ll see you to-night. Will you come to my place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. About nine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine it is,&rdquo; and Loria swung away, as Fleming  Stone turned and hastened into the hotel.</p>
  <p>Straight to Mrs. MacDonald he went and asked  where Pauline was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She went to visit Memphis and Sakkara with her  cousin,&rdquo; said the smiling chaperon. &ldquo;That is, she went with her cousin&rsquo;s  dragoman, and Mr. Loria met them at Bedrashein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>did  he!</i> Now listen, Mrs. MacDonald. Miss Stuart is in danger. I am sure of  this. I am going to her aid, but I may not&mdash;&rdquo; Stone choked, &ldquo;I may not succeed  soon. Tell me of this dragoman. What does he look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Graphically, Mrs. MacDonald described the  statuesque Ahri, and almost before she stopped speaking, Stone was flying along  the corridor, down the stairs, and out at the door.</p>
  <p>He caught a train to Bedrashein, and the first  person he bumped into at the little station was Ahri himself waiting for the  train to Cairo.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone went straight to the point. &ldquo;Look  here, Ahri,&rdquo; he said to the astonished Arab, who had never seen him before, &ldquo;what  have you done with Miss Stuart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For once the phlegmatic Arab was caught off his  guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I have not  seen her to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me,&rdquo; and Stone gave him a look  that cowed him. &ldquo;Now listen. You&rsquo;re in Mr. Loria&rsquo;s pay. All right. He paid you  well for the job you&rsquo;ve just done. Now, I&rsquo;ll pay you twice,&mdash;three times as well  to undo it. Moreover, I&rsquo;ll inform you straight that you&rsquo;ll never work for Mr.  Loria again. He&rsquo;s a villain, a wicked man. Take my advice, Ahri, give him up and  come over to me. By so doing, you&rsquo;ll not only escape punishment for your work  to-day, but get a fresh start toward a good position. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re a  bad man at heart, Ahri. At least, I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll continue to be if you&rsquo;re  better paid to be good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone was right about this, and the talk ended  in another expedition of two sand-carts into the desert. Ahri in one, with a  native driver, Stone alone in the other, driving himself. Ahri&rsquo;s cart was  driven by the same Moor that had driven Pauline only two or three hours before.  Stone followed them, the wicked driver easily bought over to betray the place where  he had left Pauline.</p>
  <p>And there they found her.</p>
  <p>Crouched at the base of a small hill, worn out  by weeping and despair, racked by fright and terror, she had fallen into a  fitful slumber from sheer exhaustion. Jumping from his cart, Stone waved the  others back and went to her. On her face were traces of tears. Her gloves and handkerchief  were torn in strips by her agonized frenzies. Her shoulders were huddled as if  in frantic fear, and her face was drawn and pinched with anguish. But in spite  of all this, Stone thought he had never seen her look so beautiful. Stepping  nearer he lifted her to her feet, and unheeding the observers, he clasped her  closely in his arms, and whispered endearing words.</p>
  <p>Pauline, her eyes still closed, murmured, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  only a dream. I must not wake, I <i>must </i>not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No dream, darling,&rdquo; said the strong, glad voice  in her ear. &ldquo;Does this seem like a dream?&rdquo; and his lips met hers in a long,  close kiss.</p>
  <p>Then her eyes opened, wondering, and lest she  should faint from very joy, Stone carried her to the cart and placed her in it.  Jumping in beside her, he ordered the other cart to lead and they started back.</p>
  <p>Neither Pauline nor Stone ever forgot that ride.  At first, she was content to ask no questions, happy in his nearness and her  own rescue from an awful fate. But, later, she inquired about Loria.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must know the truth soon, dearest,&rdquo; said  Stone, gently, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll tell you, in part now. Your cousin is a wicked man,  Pauline, and you must grasp this fact before I go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carr wicked?&rdquo; and Pauline paled and trembled as  if struck with a sudden blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it was his hand, his will, that sent you  to be lost in the desert. He showed me a false telegram, saying you had run  away from me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? oh, I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t try now,&rdquo; and Stone smiled at her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all I can do to manage this fiery steed without trying to tell you unbelievable  things at the same time. Let me tell you something more easy of credulity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline&rsquo;s smile was permission, and Stone had no  difficulty in convincing her of certain self-evident truths.</p>
  <p>By the time the trio reached Cairo, Ahri was as  staunch a follower and as true a slave of Fleming Stone as he had been of  Carrington Loria. At Stone&rsquo;s direction he returned to his former master, for  the present, and gave no hint of the later development of the kidnapping  scheme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All went off as planned?&rdquo; said Loria, secure in  his servant&rsquo;s fidelity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; answered the devoted trusty, and  Loria said no more on the subject.</p>
  <p>That evening when Fleming Stone went to Carr  Loria&rsquo;s rooms, he was accompanied by Pauline and the Englishman, Pitts.</p>
  <p>Loria started at sight of his cousin, but  quickly recovered his poise and jauntily asked her where she had come from.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No place like Cairo, for me,&rdquo; she replied in the  same light tone, and they all sat down in Loria&rsquo;s den.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More company than I expected,&rdquo; he said, as he  bustled about, seating them. &ldquo;Ahri, another chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ahri obeyed the request, and then softly left  the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Loria,&rdquo; said Stone, directly, &ldquo;there is no  use wasting words, we are here to accuse you of the murder of your aunt and the  attempted murder of your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&rsquo;s face blanched, but he tried to put  on a bold front.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by this nonsense? Is it a  joke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By no means; I have all the proofs of your  crimes and I ask you if you will confess here, or to the Police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend Pitts, I believe, is connected with the  Police,&rdquo; and Loria laughed grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. Have you anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only to deny your accusations. Except that it&rsquo;s  too absurd even to deny such foolish talk. What do you mean anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you poisoned Miss Lucy Carrington,  wilfully and purposely, by sending her a dose of powdered aconite, under the  pretense of its being a beauty charm that would bring fairness and youth to her  plain face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carr Loria&rsquo;s jaw dropped. He looked at Stone as  if at something supernatural. &ldquo;W&mdash;what?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did it to get her money, <i>now</i>, to go on with your work in the bed of  the Nile. Then, in order to get your cousin&rsquo;s share of the fortune, you sent  her away to die in the desert, having first induced her to will you her money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; laughed Loria, feebly. &ldquo;Poor joke,  Stone, pretty poor joke, I say! Murdered my own aunt! Not much I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carr Loria, listen!&rdquo; Impressively Stone held up  his finger, to adjure silence, and at the same time he bent on Loria a glance  of accusation that made him cringe. But, fascinated, he stared into Stone&rsquo;s  eyes, and in the death-like silence came a voice,&mdash;the voice of Lucy Carrington,&mdash;in  a burst of ringing laughter! Loria&rsquo;s eyes seemed to start from his head, and  the sweat gathered in great drops on his forehead, as the voice of his aunt  spoke: &ldquo;This song is one of Carr&rsquo;s favorites,&rdquo; they heard, distinctly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  sing it for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, in Miss Lucy&rsquo;s high, clear notes, came the  song, &ldquo;Oh, Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before the last strains came, Loria was raving  like a maniac. He had never heard of the phonograph records of his aunt&rsquo;s  songs, for they had meant to surprise him with them on his next trip home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have mercy!&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;stop her! Oh, my God!  what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confess,&rdquo; ordered Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will confess! I do confess! I did send her  the powder, just as you say. I wrote her to dress up like Cleopatra, and put on  her pearls, and scarabs, and fasten an asp, a paper one, at her throat, and  take the stuff, and it would cause Cleopatra&rsquo;s beauty to come to her. I told  her to hold in her hand something belonging to the man she loved. It was a great  scheme,&mdash;a fine scheme,&mdash;&rdquo; Loria was babbling insanely now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how any  one ever found it out. I was so careful! I made her promise to burn all my  notes and letters about it, before I would send the powder. <i>Who</i> suspected it? I planned everything  so carefully&mdash;<i>so</i> carefully&mdash;Made her  promise to burn everything,&mdash;everything&mdash;letters of instruction, powder-papers,  everything must be burned, I said&mdash;everything,&mdash;and she said, yes, Carr,  everything. Over and over I wrote it. Told her that if she left anything  unburnt the charm wouldn&rsquo;t work, and it didn&rsquo;t. Ha, ha,&rdquo; with a demoniac  chuckle, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take me away, I can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; moaned  Pauline.</p>
  <p>Again there was a silence. The phonograph had  ceased; Loria sat, with his head fallen forward on his hands, at his table. He  was still, and Stone wondered if he were alive. Then, suddenly, he lifted his  head, and cried out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did it because I was crazy, <i>wild</i> over my Nile scheme. Ah, that wonderful  work! It will never be done now. When I heard Stone was here I knew it was all  up. I planned to lose Polly for a time,&mdash;not forever, no, <i>not</i> forever&mdash;I would have found her some day,&mdash;some day,&mdash;all dead, in  the desert, all dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pauline fainted and Stone flew to her side. But  in a moment she revived, and he begged her to go home. She consented, and Ahri,  dependable now, took her to the hotel.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone and Mr. Pitts attempted to get  Loria to calm down and talk more coherently. Shortly he did so. He gave a full  account of all the details of his crime, and though he denied the intention of  leaving Pauline to die in the desert, his word was not believed by the two listeners.</p>
  <p>Finally, he rose and walked across the room. &ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; he said, a little wearily, but quite sane, now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bad streak in me.  My father was a Spaniard and he killed his own uncle. The Loria line is a  series of criminals. Aunt Lucy never knew this, for my parents lived always  abroad. But blood will tell. And my father, after he killed my uncle, followed  it up by taking his own life,&mdash;like this,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though Stone caught the gesture and sprang to  prevent it, Loria was too quick for him. He had snatched a dagger from the  table, and plunged it into his heart.</p>
  <p>Both men leaped at him, but it was all over in  an instant. Carr Loria had himself dealt the punishment for his crimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s as well,&rdquo; said Stone, musingly. &ldquo;A  trial, and all that, would have been awful for his cousin, and the family  connections. Now the matter can be disposed of with far less notoriety and  publicity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Pitts.</p>
  <p>Fleming Stone waited till morning to tell  Pauline of her cousin&rsquo;s death. She was wide-eyed and pathetically sad, but  composed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all so dreadful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but,  Fleming, I knew it before I left New York. I didn&rsquo;t<i> know</i> it, exactly, but I felt sure it must be so, and I had to come  here to see. Then I found Carr so gay and light-hearted I thought I must be  mistaken, and I was glad, too. Then when you came, I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind  whether you suspected Carr, or whether&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether I came only to see you,&rdquo; supplied Stone.  &ldquo;It was both, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What made you think of Carr, in the first  place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because there was no real evidence against any  one else, though the police were making things dangerous for you, my little  girl.&rdquo; Stone held her close, as if even yet there might be a hint of danger. &ldquo;And  I made Miss Frayne confess that she didn&rsquo;t really see you leave your aunt&rsquo;s  room that night, though she did honestly think that you were in there, and your  aunt was talking to you. Nor you didn&rsquo;t see her actually leaving the room, did  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only saw her with her hand on the door-knob.  That was my first glimpse of her, and I thought she was coming out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she thought of going in to apologize for  her hasty temper. But, hearing a voice, she paused, and so thrilling was the talk  she overheard, she waited there some minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then, you thought of Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sized up all the people who had motive, and  Loria was surely in that category. And then I found the powder-papers. Dear,  those would have gone sorely against you if any one else had discovered them. I  resolved to wrest the secret from those papers, and I did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did? How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By studying them for hours; with magnifying  glasses, and without. I found at last a clue,&mdash;a possible clue,&mdash;in the fact that  the edges of the papers had been cut with the curved blades of a pair of  manicure scissors. I had Jane bring me all the manicure scissors in the house,&mdash;thank  Heaven, <i>your</i> scissors didn&rsquo;t come  within a mile of fitting the edges! You see, the papers were faintly scalloped  on every edge. They <i>must</i> have been  cut by the little curved blades, and rarely do two pairs of manicure scissors  make the same scallop. The great discovery was that Miss Lucy&rsquo;s own scissors  did fit them! This, dearest, would have pointed to you in the eyes of these  determined police, for you had access to your aunt&rsquo;s toilet appointments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So did Anita or anybody in the house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but the police were hot on your track, and  ready to bend any hint your way. Oh, thank God, that I could and did save you!  Well, I further noticed that these scissors of Miss Carrington&rsquo;s were of a  different pattern from the brushes and mirrors of her set. I went to Estelle,  and she told me that the last time Carr Loria was at home he took a great fancy  to his aunt&rsquo;s scissors and asked her to give them to him. She did, and when she  tried to get another pair with that especial shaped blade, she could do so only  by taking a different patterned handle! Do you wonder that I came straight over  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and the lovely eyes beamed with admiration  of Stone&rsquo;s cleverness, as well as with affection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, last night, I went to Loria&rsquo;s rooms, and  found not only the scissors, that fitted exactly the scalloped papers, but  found that the outside powder wrapper is undoubtedly a piece of his own writing-paper.  It is the same color and texture. Moreover, as he confessed it all, there is no  further room for doubt. Another hint I had was when I found some of Loria&rsquo;s  letters in your aunt&rsquo;s desk. Not their contents, they were just such as any  affectionate nephew might write his aunt, but the chirography. You know the  letter from him that you showed me, was typewritten, and I judged nothing from  it. But his handwriting,&mdash;I have studied the science,&mdash;gave evidence of criminal  traits, and I felt sure then I was on the right track. I brought the phonograph  record to frighten him into confession, and it did. Ahri started it, in the  next room, at my signal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might have known you would do it. When I came  here, you know, I wrote and asked you to drop the case. I feared your  investigations would lead to Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It had to be a question of his guilt or yours,&rdquo;  returned Stone gravely. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, darling, how near you were to arrest!  Let&rsquo;s not think of it ever again. I&rsquo;ll engage to keep your dear mind occupied  with pleasant thoughts all the rest of our life. You don&rsquo;t want to stay in  Cairo, do you? Shall we try Algiers for a honeymoon spot? Or, if you don&rsquo;t want  Africa at all, how about Greece, or over to Algeciras? Whither away, my Heart&rsquo;s  Dearest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither? Together, then what matter whither?&rdquo;  said Pauline, her eyes full of a love deep enough to drown the sorrows that had  filled the past weeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Together always,&rdquo; he responded, holding her to  him; &ldquo;always, my Pauline.</p>
