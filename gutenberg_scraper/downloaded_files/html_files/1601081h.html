  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter I<br>
    Vicky Van</b></h2>
  <p>Victoria  Van Allen was the name she signed to her letters and to her cheques, but Vicky  Van, as her friends called her, was signed all over her captivating  personality, from the top of her dainty, tossing head to the tips of her  dainty, dancing feet.</p>
  <p>I  liked her from the first, and if her &ldquo;small and earlies&rdquo; were said to be so  called because they were timed by the small and early numerals on the clock  dial, and if her &ldquo;little&rdquo; bridge games kept in active circulation a goodly  share of our country&rsquo;s legal tender, those things are not crimes.</p>
  <p>I  lived in one of the polite sections of New York City, up among the East  Sixties, and at the insistence of my sister and aunt, who lived with me, our  home was near enough the great boulevard to be designated by that enviable  phrase, &ldquo;Just off Fifth Avenue.&rdquo; We were on the north side of the street, and,  nearer to the Avenue, on the south side, was the home of Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>Before  I knew the girl, I saw her a few times, at long intervals, on the steps of her  house, or entering her little car, and half-consciously I noted her charm and  her evident zest of life.</p>
  <p>Later,  when a club friend offered to take me there to call, I accepted gladly, and as  I have said, I liked her from the first.</p>
  <p>And  yet, I never said much about her to my sister. I am, in a way, responsible for  Winnie, and too, she&rsquo;s too young to go where they play Bridge for money. Little  faddly prize bags or gift-shop novelties are her stakes.</p>
  <p>Also,  Aunt Lucy, who helps me look after Win, wouldn&rsquo;t quite understand the  atmosphere at Vicky&rsquo;s. Not exactly Bohemian&mdash;and yet, I suppose it did represent  one compartment of that handy-box of a term. But I&rsquo;m going to tell you, right  now, about a party I went to there, and you can see for yourself what Vicky Van  was like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  late you&rsquo;re going out,&rdquo; said Winnie, as I slithered into my topcoat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  after eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  girls mustn&rsquo;t make comments on big brothers,&rdquo; I smiled back at her. Win was  nineteen and I had attained the mature age of twenty-seven. We were orphans and  spinster Aunt Lucy did her best to be a parent to us; and we got on smoothly  enough, for none of us had the temperament that rouses friction in the home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Across  the street?&rdquo; Aunt Lucy guessed, raising her aristocratic eyebrows a hair&rsquo;s  breadth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I returned, the least bit irritated at the implication of that hairbreadth  raise. &ldquo;Steele will be over there and I want to see him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time the said eyebrows went up frankly in amusement, and the kind blue eyes  beamed as she said, &ldquo;All right, Chet, run along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  I was Chester Calhoun, the junior partner of the law firm of Bradbury and  Calhoun, and held myself in due and consequent respect, I didn&rsquo;t mind Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s  calling me Chet, or even, as she sometimes did, Chetty. A man puts up with  those things from the women of his household. As to Winnie, she called me  anything that came handy, from Lord Chesterton to Chessy-Cat.</p>
  <p>I  patted Aunt Lucy on her soft old shoulder and Winnie on her hard young head,  and was off.</p>
  <p>True,  I did expect to see Steele at Vicky Van&rsquo;s&mdash;he was the club chap who had introduced  me there&mdash;but as Aunt Lucy had so cleverly suspected, he was not my sole reason  for going. A bigger reason was that I always had a good time there, the sort of  a good time I liked.</p>
  <p>I  crossed the street diagonally, in defiance of much good advice I have heard and  read against such a proceeding. But at eleven o&rsquo;clock at night the traffic in  those upper side streets is not sufficient to endanger life or limb, and I  reached Vicky Van&rsquo;s house in safety.</p>
  <p>It  was a very small house, and it was the one nearest to the Fifth Avenue corner,  though the long side of the first house on that block of the Avenue lay  between.</p>
  <p>The  windows on each floor were brilliantly lighted, and I mounted the long flight  of stone steps sure of a merry welcome and a jolly time.</p>
  <p>I  was admitted by a maid whom I already knew well enough to say &ldquo;Evening, Julie,&rdquo;  as I passed her, and in another moment, I was in the long, narrow living-room  and was a part of the gay group there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angel  child!&rdquo; exclaimed Vicky Van herself, dancing toward me, &ldquo;did he come to see his  little ole friend?&rdquo; and laying her two hands in mine for an instant, she  considered me sufficiently welcomed, and danced off again. She was a will o&rsquo;  the wisp, always tantalizing a man with a hope of special attention, and then  flying away to another guest, only to treat him in the same way.</p>
  <p>I  looked after her, a slim, graceful thing, vibrant with the joy of living,  smiling in sheer gayety of heart, and pretty as a picture.</p>
  <p>Her  black hair was arranged in the newest style, that covered her ears with soft  loops and exposed the shape of her trim little head. It was banded with a  jeweled fillet, or whatever they call those Oriental things they wear, and her  big eyes with their long, dark lashes, her pink cheeks and curved scarlet lips seemed  to say, &ldquo;the world owes me a living and I&rsquo;m going to collect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  as a matter of financial obligation, be it understood.</p>
  <p>Vicky  Van had money enough and though nothing about her home was ostentatious or over  ornate, it was quietly and in the best of taste luxurious.</p>
  <p>But  I was describing Vicky herself. Her gown, the skirt part of it, was a sort of  mazy maize-colored thin stuff, rather short and rather full, that swirled as  she moved, and fluttered when she danced. The bodice part, was of heavily  gold-spangled material, and a kind of overskirt arrangement was a lot of long  gold fringe made of beads. Instead of a yoke, there were shoulder straps of  these same beads, and the sleeves weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
  <p>And  yet, that costume was all right. Why, it was a rig I&rsquo;d be glad to see Winnie  in, when she gets older, and if I&rsquo;ve made it sound rather&mdash;er&mdash;gay and festive,  it&rsquo;s my bungling way of describing it, and also, because Vicky&rsquo;s personality  would add gayety and festivity to any raiment.</p>
  <p>Her  little feet wore goldy slippers, and a lot of ribbons criss-crossed over her  ankles, and on the top of each slipper was a gilt butterfly that fluttered.</p>
  <p>Yet  with all this bewildering effect of frivolity, the first term I&rsquo;d make use of  in describing Vick&rsquo;s character would be Touch-me-not. I believe there&rsquo;s a  flower called that&mdash;<i>noli me tangere</i>&mdash;or some such name. Well, that&rsquo;s Vicky  Van. She&rsquo;d laugh and jest with you, and then if you said anything by way of a  personal compliment or flirtatious foolery, she was off and away from your  side, like a thistle-down in a summer breeze. She was a witch, a madcap, but  she had her own way in everything, and her friends did her will without  question.</p>
  <p>Her  setting, too, just suited her. Her living room was one of those very narrow,  very deep rooms so often seen in the New York side streets. It was done up in  French gray and rose, as was the dictum of the moment. On the rose-brocaded  walls were few pictures, but just the right ones. Gray enameled furniture and  deep window-seats with rose-colored cushions provided resting-places, and soft  rose-shaded lights gave a mild glow of illumination.</p>
  <p>Flowers  were everywhere. Great bowls of roses, jars of pink carnations and occasionally  a vase of pink orchids were on mantel, low bookcases or piano. And sometimes  the odor of a cigarette or a burning pastille of Oriental fragrance, added to  the Bohemian effect which is, oftener than not, discernible by the sense of  smell.</p>
  <p>Vicky  herself, detested perfumes or odors of any kind, save fresh flowers all about.  Indeed, she detested Bohemianism, when it meant unconventional dress or manners  or loud-voiced jests or songs.</p>
  <p>Her  house was dainty, correct and artistic, and yet, I knew its atmosphere would  not please my Aunt Lucy, or be just the right place for Winnie.</p>
  <p>Many  of the guests I knew. Cassie Weldon was a concert singer and Ariadne Gale an  artist of some prominence, both socially and in her art circle. Jim Ferris and  Bailey Mason were actors of a good sort, and Bert Garrison, a member of one of  my best clubs, was a fast rising architect. Steele hadn&rsquo;t come yet.</p>
  <p>Two  tables of bridge were playing in the back part of the room, and in the rest of  the rather limited space several couples were dancing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t  we open the doors to the dining room, Vicky?&rdquo; called out one of the card players.  &ldquo;The calorics of this room must be about ninety in the shade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open  them a little way,&rdquo; returned Miss Van Allen. &ldquo;But not wide, for there&rsquo;s a  surprise supper and I don&rsquo;t want you to see it yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  set the double doors a few inches ajar and went on with their game. The dining  room, as I knew, was a wide room that ran all across the house behind both  living-room and hall. It was beautifully decorated in pale green and silver,  and often Vicky Van would have a &ldquo;surprise supper,&rdquo; at which the favors or  entertainers would be well worth waiting for.</p>
  <p>Having  greeted many whom I knew, I looked about for further speech with my hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  upstairs in the music room,&rdquo; said Cassie Weldon, seeing and interpreting my  questing glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, lady, for those kind words,&rdquo; I called back over my shoulder, and went  upstairs.</p>
  <p>The  front room on the second floor was dubbed the &ldquo;music room,&rdquo; Vicky said, because  there was a banjo in it. Sometimes the guests brought more banjos and a concert  of glees and college songs would ensue. But more often, as to-night, it was a  little haven of rest and peace from the laughter and jest below stairs.</p>
  <p>It  was an exquisite white and gold room, and here, too, as I entered, pale pink  shades dimmed the lights to a soft radiance that seemed like a breaking dawn.</p>
  <p>Vicky  sat enthroned on a white divan, her feet crossed on a gold-embroidered white  satin foot-cushion. In front of her sat three or four of her guests all  laughing and chatting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he vowed he was going to get here somehow,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves was saying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  his name?&rdquo; asked Vicky, though in a voice of little interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somers,&rdquo;  returned Mrs. Reeves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  heard of him. Did you, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; and Vicky Van looked up at me as I  entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Miss Van Allen. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care. Only as Mrs. Reeves says he is coming here  tonight, I&rsquo;d like to know something about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming  here! A man you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; I drew up a chair to join the group. &ldquo;How can he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Steele is going to bring him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;He says&mdash;Norman Steele says,  that Mr. Somers is a first-class all-around chap, and no end of fun. Says he&rsquo;s  a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  a millionaire more or less to me?&rdquo; laughed Vicky. &ldquo;I choose my friends for  their lovely character, not for their wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you&rsquo;ve selected all of us for that, dear,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;but this Somers  gentleman may be amiable, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Reeves was a solid, sensible sort of person, who acted as ballast for the  volatile Vicky, and sometimes reprimanded her in a mild way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love the child,&rdquo; she had said to me once, &ldquo;and she is a little brick. But once  in a while I have to tell her a few things for the good of the community. She  takes it all like an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Vicky went on, &ldquo;Norman Steele has no right to bring anybody here  whom he hasn&rsquo;t asked me about. If I don&rsquo;t like him, I shall ask some of you  nice, amiable men to get me a long plank, and we&rsquo;ll put it out of a window, and  make him walk it. Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all agreed to do this, or to tar and feather and ride on a rail any gentleman  who might in any way be so unfortunate as to fall one iota short of Vicky Van&rsquo;s  requirements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; said Vicky, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll all please go downstairs, except Mrs. Reeves and  Mr. Garrison and my own sweet self, I&rsquo;ll be orfly obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sweeping gesture with which she sought to dismiss us was a wave of her white  arms and a smile of her red lips, and I, for one, found it impossible to obey.  I started with the rest, and then after the gay crowd were part way down stairs  I turned back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,  mayn&rsquo;t I join your little class, if I&rsquo;ll be very good?&rdquo; I begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want  Bert Garrison to be left alone at the mercy of two such sirens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Van Allen hesitated. Her pink-tipped forefinger rested a moment on her curved lip.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head. &ldquo;Yes, stay, Mr. Calhoun. You may be a help.  Are you any good at getting theatre boxes after they&rsquo;re all sold?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my profession,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I learned it from a correspondence school. Where&rsquo;s  the theatre? Lead me to it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the Metropolis Theatre,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And I want to have a party there  to-morrow night, and I want two boxes, and this awful, dreadful, bad Mr.  Garrison says they&rsquo;re all sold, and I can&rsquo;t get any! What can you do about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll fix it. I&rsquo;ll go to the people who bought the boxes you want, and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t  know what I&rsquo;ll say to them, exactly&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll fix up such a yarn that they&rsquo;ll  beg me to take the boxes off their hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  will you, really?&rdquo; and the dazzling smile she gave me would have repaid a much  greater Herculean task than I had undertaken. And, of course, I hadn&rsquo;t meant  it, but when she thought I did, I couldn&rsquo;t go back on my word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do my best, Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; I said, seriously, &ldquo;and if I can&rsquo;t possibly turn  the trick, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll buy the Metropolitan Opera House, and put on a show  of my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she laughed, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t do that. But if you try and fail&mdash;why, we&rsquo;ll just have  a little party here, a sort of consolation party, and&mdash;oh, let&rsquo;s have some  private theatricals. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  fun than the original program?&rdquo; I asked quickly, hoping to be let off my  promise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;decidedly not! I want especially to have that theatre party  and supper afterward at the Britz. Now you do all you can, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  promised to do all I could, and I had a partial hope I could get what she  wanted by hook or crook, and then, as she heard a specially favorite fox-trot  being dashed off on the piano downstairs, she sprang from her seat, and kicking  the satin cushion aside, asked me to dance. In a moment we were whirling around  the music room to the zipping music, and Mrs. Reeve and Garrison followed in  our steps.</p>
  <p>Vicky  danced with a natural born talent that is quite unlike anything acquired by  lessons. I had no need to guide her, she divined my lead, and swayed in any  direction, even as I was about to indicate it. I had never danced with anyone  who danced so well, and I was profuse in my thanks and praise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love it,&rdquo; she said simply, as she patted the gold fringes of her gown into  place. &ldquo;I adore dancing, and you are one of the best partners I have ever had.  Come, let us go down and cut into a Bridge game. We&rsquo;ll just about have time  before supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pirouetting  before me, she led the way, and we went down the long steep stairs.</p>
  <p>A  shout greeted her appearance in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Vicky, we have missed you! Come over here and listen to Ted&rsquo;s latest old joke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  come over here and hear this awful gossip Ariadne is telling for solemn truth.  It&rsquo;s the very worst taradiddle she ever got off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  a place, Vicky Van, a nice cosy corner, &lsquo;tween Jim and me.<br>
    Come on, Ladygirl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks, everybody. I&rsquo;m going to cut in at this table. May I? Am I a nuisance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Vicky-nuisance! They ain&rsquo;t no such animal!&rdquo; and Bailey Mason rose to give her  his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;I want you to stay, Mr. Mason. &lsquo;Cause why, I want to play wiz you.  Cassie, you give me your place, won&rsquo;t you, Ducky-Daddles? and you go and flirt  with Mr. Calhoun. He knows the very newest flirts! Go, give him a tryout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vicky  Van settled herself into her seat with the happy little sigh of the bridge  lover, who sits down with three good players, and in another moment she was  breathlessly looking over her hand. &ldquo;Without,&rdquo; she said, triumphantly, and  knowing she&rsquo;d say no word more to me for the present, I walked away with Cassie  Weldon.</p>
  <p>And  Cassie was good fun. She took me to the piano, and with the soft pedal down,  she showed me a new little tone picture she had made up, which was both  picturesque and funny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better go into vaudeville!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as she finished, &ldquo;your talent is  wasted on the concert platform.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what Vicky tells me,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Sometimes I believe I will try it, just  for fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find it such fun, you&rsquo;ll stay in for earnest,&rdquo; I assured her, for she had shown  a bit of inventive genius that I felt sure would make good in a little musical  turn.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
    Mr. Somers</b></h2>
  <p>It  was nearly midnight when Steele came, and with him was a man I had never seen  before, and whom I assumed to be the Mr. Somers I had heard about.</p>
  <p>And  it was. As Steele entered, he cast his eye around for Vicky, and saw her at the  bridge table down at the end of the room. Her back was toward us, and she was  so absorbed in the game she did not look round, if, indeed, she heard the noise  of their arrival.</p>
  <p>The  two men stopped near the group I was with and Steele introduced<br>
    Mr. Somers.</p>
  <p>A  little curiously I looked at him, and saw a large, self-satisfied looking man  wearing an expansive smile and expensive apparel. Clothes the very best  procurable, jewelry just inside the limits of good taste&mdash;he bore himself like a  gentleman, yet there was an unmistakable air of ostentatious wealth that  repelled me. A second look made me think Mr. Somers had dined either late or  twice, but his greetings were courteous and genial and his manner sociable, if  a little patronizing. He seemed a stranger to all present, and his eye roved  about for the charming hostess Steele had told him of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  reach Miss Van Allen presently.&rdquo; Steele laughed, in answer to the glance, &ldquo;if,  indeed, we dare interrupt her game. Let&rsquo;s make progress slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  hurry,&rdquo; returned Somers, affably, beaming on Cassie Weldon and meeting Ariadne  Gale&rsquo;s receptive smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anchored here for the moment. Miss Weldon? Ah,  yes, I&rsquo;ve heard you sing. Voice like a lark&mdash;like a lark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly,  Somers was not much of a purveyor of small talk. I sized him up for a lumbering  oldster, who wanted to be playful but didn&rsquo;t quite know how.</p>
  <p>He  had rather an austere face, yet there was a gleam in his eye that belied the  austerity. His cheeks were fat and red, his nose prominent, and he was clean  shaven, save for a thick white mustache, that drooped slightly on either side  of a full-lipped mouth. His hair was white, his eyes dark and deep-set, and he  could easily be called a handsome man. He was surely fifty, and perhaps more.  Had it not been for a certain effusiveness in his speech, I could have liked  him, but he seemed to me to lack sincerity.</p>
  <p>However,  I am not one to judge harshly or hastily, and I met him half way, and even  helped him in his efforts at gay affability.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  never been here before?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;Good old Steele to bring you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  never before,&rdquo; and he glanced around appreciatively, &ldquo;but I shall, I hope, come  often. Charming little nest; charming ladies!&rdquo; a bow included those nearest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed,&rdquo; babbled Ariadne, &ldquo;fair women and brave men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brave,  yes,&rdquo; agreed Somers, &ldquo;to dare the glances of such bright eyes. I must protect  my heart!&rdquo; He clasped his fat hands pretty near where his heart was situated,  and grinned with delight as Ariadne also &ldquo;protected&rdquo; her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;two hearts in danger! I feel sure we shall be friends, if only  because misery loves company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it really misery with you?&rdquo; and Ariadne&rsquo;s sympathy was so evidently profound,  that Cassie Weldon and I walked away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give Ariad her innings,&rdquo; said the vivacious Miss Weldon, &ldquo;and<br>
    I&rsquo;ll make up to the Somers kid later. Where&rsquo;d Vicky pick him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t know him at all. Norman Steele brought him unbeknownst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Why, Vick doesn&rsquo;t allow that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I&rsquo;m told. Any way, Steele did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Vicky&rsquo;s such a good-natured darling, maybe she won&rsquo;t mind for once. She won&rsquo;t,  if she likes the little stranger. He&rsquo;s well-meaning, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s  Ariadne. From her smile, I think she well means to sell him her latest &lsquo;Autumn  In The Adirondacks,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lady With A Handbag&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  don&rsquo;t be mean!&rdquo; but Cassie laughed. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t blame her if she does. Poor Ad  paints above the heads of the public, so if this is a high-up Publican, she&rsquo;d  better make sales while the sun shines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  her work like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can see more of it in this house than anywhere else. Vicky is so fond of  Ariadne and so sorry her pictures don&rsquo;t sell better, that she buys a lot  herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Miss Gale know Miss Van Allen does it out of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say charity! No, they&rsquo;re really good stuff, and Vicky buys &lsquo;em for Christmas  gifts and bridge prizes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she ever play for prizes? I thought she liked a bit of a stake, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  at evening parties. But, often we have a dove game of an afternoon, with prizes  and pink tea. Vicky Van isn&rsquo;t a gay doll, you know. She&rsquo;s&mdash;sometimes, she&rsquo;s  positively domestic. I wish she had a nice husband and some little kiddies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  it up. She&rsquo;s never seen any man she loved, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she&rsquo;ll love this Somers person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven  forbid! Nothing less than a crown prince would suit Vicky Van.<br>
    Look, she&rsquo;s turning to meet him. Won&rsquo;t he be bowled over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  turned, and though there were several people between us, I caught a glimpse of  Somers&rsquo; face as he was presented to Miss Van Allen. He was bowled over. His  eyes beamed with admiration and he bowed low as he raised to his lips the  dainty, bejeweled hand.</p>
  <p>Vicky,  apparently, did not welcome this old-time greeting, and she drew away her hand,  saying, &ldquo;not allowed. Naughty man! Express proper compunction, or you can&rsquo;t sit  next me at supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive  me,&rdquo; begged Somers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I&rsquo;ll never do it again&mdash;until after I sit next  you at supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  brains than I thought,&rdquo; I said to Cassie, who nodded, and then<br>
    Vicky Van rose from her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  my place for a moment, Mr. Somers,&rdquo; she said, standing before him. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; she  dropped her eyes adorably, &ldquo;I must see about the arrangement of seats at the  supper table.&rdquo; With a merry laugh, she ran from the room, and through the long  hall to the dining-room.</p>
  <p>Somers  dropped into her vacant chair, and continued the Bridge game with the air of  one who knows how to play.</p>
  <p>In  less than five minutes Vicky was back. &ldquo;No, keep the hand,&rdquo; she said, as he  rose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played long enough. And supper will be ready shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finish  the rubber,&mdash;I insist&rdquo; Somers returned, and as he determinedly stood behind the  chair, Vicky, perforce, sat down.</p>
  <p>He  continued to stand behind her chair, watching her play. Vicky was too sure of  her game to be rattled at his close scrutiny, but it seemed to me her shoulders  shrugged a little impatiently, as he criticized or commended her plays.</p>
  <p>She  had thrown a light scarf of gauze or tulle around when she was out of the room,  and being the same color as her gown, it made her seem more than ever like an  houri. She smiled up into Somers&rsquo; face, and then, coyly, her long lashes fell  on her pink cheeks. Evidently, she had concluded to bewitch the newcomer, and  she was making good.</p>
  <p>I  drew nearer, principally because I liked to look at her. She was a live wire  to-night! She looked roguish, and she made most brilliant plays, tossing down  her cards with gay little gestures, and doing trick shuffles with her twinkling  fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could have had that last trick, if you&rsquo;d played for it,&rdquo; Somers said, as the  rubber finished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; Vicky conceded. &ldquo;I saw, just too late, that I was getting the lead  into the wrong hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t ever do that again,&rdquo; he said, lightly, &ldquo;never again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he said the last word, he laid his finger tips on her shoulder. It was the  veriest touch, the shoulder was swathed in the transparent tulle, but still, it  roused Vicky. She glanced up at him, and I looked at him, too. But Somers was  not in flirtatious mood. He said, &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; in most correct fashion.  Had he then, touched her inadvertently? It didn&rsquo;t seem so, but his speech  assured it.</p>
  <p>Vicky  jumped up from the table, and ignoring Somers, ran out to the hall, saying  something about looking after the surprise for the supper. To my surprise,  Somers followed her, not hastily, but rather deliberately, and, quelling an  absurd impulse to go, too, I turned to Norman Steele, who stood near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  this Somers?&rdquo; I asked him, rather abruptly. &ldquo;Is he all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet,&rdquo; said Steele, smiling. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a top-notcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what respects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  known him long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I tell you Cal, he&rsquo;s all right. Forget it. What&rsquo;s the surprise for supper? Do  you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise if we all knew of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Vicky&rsquo;s surprises are always great fun. Why the grouch, old man? Can&rsquo;t you  chirrup?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; and I felt annoyed that he read in my face that I was put out.  But I didn&rsquo;t like the looks of Somers, and I couldn&rsquo;t say so to the man who had  brought him there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  please! Oh, <i>please!</i>&rdquo; shouted a hoarse, strange voice, and one scarcely  to be heard above the hum of gay voices and peals of gay laughter, &ldquo;oh, <i>somebody</i>,  please!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked across the room, and in the wide hall doorway stood a man, who was quite  evidently a waiter. He was white-faced and staring-eyed, and he fairly hung on  to a portiere for support, as he repeated his agonized plea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, as everybody else stared at the man.<br>
  &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; She stepped toward him, and we all turned to look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  you&mdash;no, Madame. Some man, please&mdash;some doctor. Is there one here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of the servants ill?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Reeves, kindly. &ldquo;Doctor Remson, will you come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pleasant-faced capable-looking woman paused only until Doctor Remson joined  her, and the two went into the hall, the waiter following slowly.</p>
  <p>In  a moment I heard a shriek, a wild scream. Partly curiosity and partly a  foreboding of harm to Vicky Van, made me rush forward.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Reeves had screamed, and I ran the length of the hall to the dining room. There  I saw Somers on the floor, and Remson bending over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  killed! He&rsquo;s stabbed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves, clutching at my arm as I reached her.  &ldquo;Oh, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  stood just in the dining-room doorway, which was at the end of the long hall,  as in most city houses. The room was but dimly lighted, the table candles not  yet burning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  the people back!&rdquo; I shouted, as those in the living-room pressed out into the  hall. &ldquo;Steele, keep those girls back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was an awful commotion. The men urged the women back, but curiosity and horror  made them surge forward in irresistible force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut  the door,&rdquo; whispered Remson. &ldquo;This man is dead. It&rsquo;s an awful situation. Shut  that door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow,  I managed to get the door closed between the dining-room and hall. On the  inside were Remson, Mrs. Reeves, who wouldn&rsquo;t budge, and myself. Outside in the  hall was a crowd of hysterical women and frightened men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure?&rdquo; I asked, in a low voice, going nearer to the doctor and looking at  Somers&rsquo; fast-glazing eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure.  He was stabbed straight to the heart with&mdash;see&mdash;a small, sharp knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hands over her eyes, but peering through her fingers, Mrs. Reeves drew near. &ldquo;Not  really,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Oh, not really dead! Can&rsquo;t we do anything for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Remson, rising to his feet, from his kneeling position.<br>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, I tell you. Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  waiter&mdash;&rdquo; I began, and then stopped. Looking in from a door opposite the hall  door, probably one that led to a butler&rsquo;s pantry or kitchen, were half a dozen  white-faced waiters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in here,&rdquo; said Remson; &ldquo;not all of you. Which is chief?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am, sir,&rdquo; and a head waiter came into the room. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man has been killed,&rdquo; said the doctor, shortly. &ldquo;Who are you? Who are you all?  House servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re caterer&rsquo;s men. From Fraschini&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m<br>
    Luigi. We are here to serve supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  sir,&rdquo; and the Italian looked truthful, though scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  you been in and out of the dining-room all evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Setting the table, and such. But now it&rsquo;s all ready, and I was waiting  Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s word to serve it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; I broke in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; Luigi hesitated, and Doctor Remson interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  mustn&rsquo;t ask these questions, Mr. Calhoun. We must call the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;oh no! no! don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my duty,&rdquo; said the doctor, firmly. &ldquo;And no one must enter or leave this room  until an officer arrives. You waiters, stay there in that pantry. Close those  doors to the other room, Mr. Calhoun, please. Mrs. Reeves, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I  must ask you to stay here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; declared the lady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not an officer of the law.<br>
    I&rsquo;ll stay in the house, but not in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  stalked out into the hall, and Doctor Remson went at once to the telephone and  called up headquarters.</p>
  <p>The  guests in the living room, hearing this, flew into a panic.</p>
  <p>Of  course, it was no longer possible, nor, as I could see, desirable to keep them  in ignorance of what had happened.</p>
  <p>After  calling the police, Doctor Remson returned to his post just inside the  dining-room door. He answered questions patiently, at first, but after being  nearly driven crazy by the frantic women, he said, sharply, &ldquo;You may all do  just as you like. I&rsquo;ve no authority here, except that the ethics of my  profession dictate. That does not extend to jurisdiction over the guests  present. But I advise you as a matter of common decency to stay here until this  affair is investigated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  they didn&rsquo;t. Many of them hastily gathered up their wraps and went out of the  house as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Cassie  Weldon came to me in her distress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I may? Why, it would  interfere greatly with my work to have it known that I was mixed up in a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not mixed up in it, Miss Weldon.&rdquo; I began to speak a little sternly, but the  look in her eyes aroused my sympathy. &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose you  will testify if called on. Everybody knows where to find you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, slowly, &ldquo;but I hope I won&rsquo;t be called on. Why, it might spoil my  whole career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  slipped out of the door, in the wake of some other departing guests. After all,  I thought, it couldn&rsquo;t matter much. Few, if any, of them were implicated, and  they could all be found at their homes.</p>
  <p>And  yet, I had a vague idea that we ought all to stay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall remain and face the music,&rdquo; I heard Mrs. Reeves saying. &ldquo;Where <i>is</i> Vicky? Do you suppose she knows about this? I&rsquo;m going up in the music room to  see if she&rsquo;s there. You know, with all the excitement down here, those upstairs  may know nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall remain, too&rdquo; said Ariadne Gale. &ldquo;Why should anyone kill Mr. Somers? Did  the caterer&rsquo;s people do it? What an awful thing! Will it be in the papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> it!&rdquo; said Garrison, who was standing near. &ldquo;Reporters may be here any minute.  Must be here as soon as the police come. Where is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Ariadne began to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, gruffly, but not unkindly. &ldquo;Stay if you want to,  Ariadne, but behave like a sensible woman, not a silly schoolgirl. This is an  awful tragedy, of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, of some sort?&rdquo; asked Miss Gale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean we don&rsquo;t know what revelations are yet to come. Where&rsquo;s Norman<br>
    Steele? Where&rsquo;s the man who brought this Somers here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sure  enough, where was Steele? I had forgotten all about him. And it was he who had  introduced Somers to the Van Allen house, and no one else present, so far as I  knew, was previously acquainted with the man now lying dead the other side of  that closed door.</p>
  <p>I  looked over the people who had stayed. Only a handful&mdash;perhaps half a dozen.</p>
  <p>And  then I wondered if I&rsquo;d better go home myself. Not for my own sake, in any way;  indeed, I preferred to remain, but I thought of Aunt Lucy and Win. Ought I to  bring on them any shadow of trouble or opprobrium that might result from my  presence in that house at that time? Would it not be better to go while I could  do so? For, once the police took charge, I knew I should be called on to  testify in public. And even as I debated with myself, the police arrived.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    The Waiter&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>Doctor  Remson&rsquo;s police call had been imperative, and Inspector Mason came in with two  men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this? What&rsquo;s wrong here?&rdquo; the big burly inspector said, as he faced the few of  us who had remained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in here, inspector,&rdquo; said the doctor, from the dining-room door.</p>
  <p>And  from that moment the whole aspect of the house seemed to change.<br>
    No longer a gay little bijou residence, it became a court of justice.</p>
  <p>One  of the men was stationed at the street door and one at the area door below.  Headquarters was notified of details. The coroner was summoned, and we were all  for the moment under detention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Van Allen? Where is the lady of the house?&rdquo; asked<br>
    Mason. &ldquo;Where are the servants? Who is in charge here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  ever a string of questions so impossible of answers!</p>
  <p>Doctor  Remson told the main facts, but he was reticent. I, too, hesitated to say much,  for the case was strange indeed.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Reeves looked gravely concerned, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>Ariadne  Gale began to babble. That girl didn&rsquo;t know how to be quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess Miss Van Allen is upstairs,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;She was in the  dining-room, but she isn&rsquo;t here now, so she must be upstairs. Shall I go and  see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  thundered the inspector. &ldquo;Stay where you are. Search the house,<br>
    Breen. I&rsquo;ll cover the street door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man he called Breen went upstairs on the jump, and Mason continued. &ldquo;Tell the  story, one of you. Who is this man? Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he talked, the inspector was examining Somers&rsquo; body, making rapid notes in a  little book, keeping his eye on the door, and darting quick glances at each of us,  as he tried to grasp the situation.</p>
  <p>I  looked at Bert Garrison, who was perhaps the most favored of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s  friends, but he shook his head, so I threw myself into the breach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;that man&rsquo;s name is Somers. Further than that I know nothing. He is a  stranger to all of us, and he came to this house to-night for the first time in  his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d  he happen to come? Friend of Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  met her to-night for the first time. He came here with&mdash;&rdquo; I paused. It was so  hard to know what to do. Steele had gone home, ought I to implicate him?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on&mdash;came here with whom? The truth, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  usually speak the truth&rdquo; I returned, shortly. &ldquo;He came with Mr.<br>
    Norman Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Steele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has gone. There were a great many people here, and, naturally, some of them  went away when this tragedy was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Then, of course, the guilty party escaped. But we are getting nowhere. Does  nobody know anything of this man, but his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nobody  did; but Ariadne piped up, &ldquo;He was a delightful man. He told me he was a great  patron of art, and often bought pictures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paying  little heed to her, the inspector was endeavoring to learn from the dead man&rsquo;s  property something more about him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  letters or papers,&rdquo; he said, disappointedly, as he turned out the pockets. &ldquo;Not  unusual&mdash;in evening togs&mdash;but not even a card or anything personal&mdash;looks queer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  in his watch,&rdquo; said Ariadne, bridling with importance.</p>
  <p>Giving  her a keen glance, the inspector followed her suggestion. In the back of the  case was a picture of a coquettish face, undoubtedly that of an actress. It was  not carefully fastened in, but roughly cut out and pressed in with ragged  edges.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Temporary,&rdquo;  grunted the inspector, &ldquo;and recently stuck in. Some chicken he took out to supper.  He&rsquo;s a club man, you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Steele said so, and also vouched for his worth and character.&rdquo; I resented  the inspector&rsquo;s attitude. Though I knew nothing of Somers, and didn&rsquo;t  altogether like him, yet, I saw no reason to think ill of the dead, until  circumstances warranted it.</p>
  <p>Further  search brought a thick roll of money, some loose silver, a key-ring with seven  or eight keys, eyeglasses in a silver case, handkerchiefs, a gold pencil, a  knife, and such trifles as any man might have in his pockets, but no directly  identifying piece of property.</p>
  <p>R.  S. was embroidered in tiny white letters on the handkerchiefs, and a monogram  R. S. was on his seal ring.</p>
  <p>His  jewelry, which was costly, the inspector did not touch. There were magnificent  pearl studs, a watch fob, set with a black opal and pearl cufflinks.  Examination of his hat showed the pierced letters R. S., but nothing gave clue  to his Christian name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somers,&rdquo;  said the inspector, musingly. &ldquo;What club does he belong to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Mr. Steele belongs to several, but Mr. Somers does not  belong to any that I do. At least, I&rsquo;ve never seen him at any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  in the servants. Let&rsquo;s find out something about this household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  no one else moved to do it, I stepped to the door of the butler&rsquo;s pantry, and  summoned the head waiter of the caterer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the house servants?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  aren&rsquo;t any, sir,&rdquo; he replied, looking shudderingly at the grisly form on the  floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  servants? In a house of this type! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, breaking her silence, at last. &ldquo;Miss Van Allen has a  very capable woman, who is housekeeper and ladies&rsquo; maid in one. But when guests  are here, the suppers are served from the caterer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  call the housekeeper. And where is Miss Van Allen herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not in the house,&rdquo; said the policeman Breen, returning from his search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the house!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been all over&mdash;every room&mdash;every floor. She isn&rsquo;t in the house.<br>
    There&rsquo;s nobody upstairs at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  housekeeper or maid?&rdquo; demanded Mason. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ve got away!<br>
    Here, waiter, tell me all you know of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Italian Luigi came forward, shaking with terror, and wringing his fingers  nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  d&mdash;don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; he began, but Mason interrupted,<br>
  &ldquo;You do! You know all about it! Did you kill this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Dio mio! No! a thousand no&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  unless you wish to be suspected of it, tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  commotion at the door heralded the coroner&rsquo;s arrival, also a detective and a  couple of plain clothes men. Clearly, here was a mysterious case.</p>
  <p>The  coroner at once took matters in his own hands. Inspector Mason told him all  that had been learned so far, and though Coroner Fenn seemed to think matters  had been pretty well bungled, he made no comment and proceeded with the  inquiries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  there&rsquo;s nobody upstairs?&rdquo; he asked Breen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positive.  I looked in every nook and cranny. I&rsquo;ve raked the whole house, but the basement  and kitchen part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  down there, then, and then go back and search upstairs again. Somebody may be  hiding. Who here knows Miss Van Allen the most intimately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Or Miss Gale. We are both her warm friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  also her friend,&rdquo; volunteered Bert Garrison. &ldquo;And I can guarantee that if Miss  Van Allen has fled from this house it was out of sheer fright. She never saw  this man until to-night. He was a stranger to us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  the housekeeper?&rdquo; went on Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she must be somewhere about,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Perhaps in the kitchen.  Julie is an all round capable woman. When there are no guests she prepares Miss  Van Allen&rsquo;s meals herself. When company is present the caterer always is  employed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there are no other servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  permanent ones,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I believe the laundress and chore boy  come by the day, also cleaning women and such. But I know that Miss Van Allen  has no resident servant besides the maid Julie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  woman must be found,&rdquo; snapped the coroner. &ldquo;But we must first of all identify  the body. Mason, call up the principal clubs on the telephone, and locate R.  Somers. Also find Mr. Norman Steele. Now, Luigi, let&rsquo;s have your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  trembling waiter stammered incoherently, and said little of moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; said Fenn, bluntly, &ldquo;is that your knife sticking in him? I mean, is it  one belonging to Fraschini&rsquo;s service? Don&rsquo;t touch it, but look at it, you can  tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi  leaned over the dead man. &ldquo;Yes, it is one of our boning knives,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We  always bring our own hardware.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, if you want to clear yourself and your men of doubt, tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know this,&rdquo; and Luigi braced himself to the ordeal. &ldquo;I was waiting in the  pantry for Miss Van Allen to send me word to serve supper, and I peeped in the  dining-room now and then to see if it was time. I heard, presently, Miss Van  Allen&rsquo;s voice, also a man&rsquo;s voice. I didn&rsquo;t want to intrude, so waited for a  summons. After a moment or two I heard a little scream, and heard somebody or  something fall. I had no thought of anything wrong, but thought the guests were  unusually&mdash;er&mdash;riotous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s guests inclined to be riotous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, oh, no,&rdquo; asseverated the man, while Mrs. Reeves and Ariadne looked  indignant. &ldquo;And for that reason, I felt a little curious, so I pushed the door ajar  and peeped in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw,&rdquo; Luigi paused so long that I feared he was going to collapse. But the  coroner eyed him sternly, and he went on. &ldquo;I saw Miss Van Allen standing,  looking down at this&mdash;this gentleman on the floor, and making as if to pull out  the knife. I could scarcely believe my eyes, and I watched her. She didn&rsquo;t pull  the knife, but she straightened up, looked around, glanced down at her gown,  which&mdash;which was stained with blood&mdash;and then&mdash;she ran out into the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did she go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I couldn&rsquo;t see, as the door was but on a crack. Then I thought I  ought to go into the dining-room, and I did. I looked at the gentleman, and I  didn&rsquo;t know what to do. So I went into the hall, to the parlor door, and called  for help, for a doctor or somebody. And then they all came out here. That&rsquo;s all  I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi&rsquo;s  nerve gave way, and he sank into a chair with a sob. Fenn looked at him, and  considerately left him alone for the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  this be true?&rdquo; he said, turning to us. &ldquo;Can you suspect Miss Van<br>
    Allen of this crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Bert Garrison and the women, at once. And, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am positive  Miss Van Allen did not know Mr. Somers and could not have killed an utter  stranger&mdash;on no provocation whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know what provocation she may have had,&rdquo; suggested Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves very decidedly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have Miss  Van Allen spoken of in any such way. I assume you mean that this man, though a  stranger, might have said or done something to annoy or offend Miss Van Allen.  Well, if he had done so, Victoria Van Allen never would have killed him! She is  the gentlest, most gay and light-hearted girl, and though she never tolerates  any rudeness or familiarity, the idea of her killing a man is too absurd. You  might as well suspect a dove or a butterfly of crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; said Garrison. &ldquo;That waiter&rsquo;s story is an hallucination of  some sort&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t a deliberate falsification. Miss Van Allen is a dainty,  happy creature, and to connect her with anything like this <i>is</i> absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  to be found out, Mr. Garrison. Why did Miss Van Allen run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t admit that she did run away&mdash;in the sense of flight. If she were  frightened at this thing&mdash;if she saw it&mdash;she may have run out of the door in  hysterics or in a panic of terror. But she the perpetrator! Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  echoed Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;The poor child! If she did come out here&mdash;and saw this  awful sight&mdash;why, I think it would unhinge her mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;What is her occupation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hasn&rsquo;t an occupation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;She is a young lady of independent  fortune. As to her people or immediate relatives, I know nothing at all. I&rsquo;ve  known her a year or so, and as she never referred to such matters I never  inquired. But she&rsquo;s a thorough little gentlewoman, and I&rsquo;ll defend her against  any slander to my utmost powers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so will I,&rdquo; said Miss Gale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of her fineness of character, and lovely  nature&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  these opinions, ladies, don&rsquo;t help our inquiries,&rdquo; interrupted<br>
    Fenn. &ldquo;What can you men tell us? What I want first, is to identify<br>
    this body, or, rather to learn more of R. Somers, and to find Miss Van<br>
    Allen. I can&rsquo;t hold an inquest until these points are cleared up.<br>
    Mason, have you found out anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the inspector, returning from his long telephone quest. &ldquo;I called up four  clubs. Norman Steele belongs to three of them, but this man doesn&rsquo;t seem to  belong to any. That is, there are Somerses and even R. Somerses, but they all  have middle names, and, too, their description doesn&rsquo;t fit this Somers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Mr. Steele misrepresented him. Did you get Steele, Mason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he wasn&rsquo;t at any of the clubs. I found his residence, a bachelor apartment  house, but he isn&rsquo;t there, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  Steele; find Miss Van Allen; find the maid, what&rsquo;s her name&mdash;Julia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie,  she was always called,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;If Miss Van Allen went away, I&rsquo;ve no  doubt Julie went with her. She is a most devoted caretaker of her mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  oldish woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Perhaps between thirty-five and forty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  she look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe  her, Ariadne, you&rsquo;re an artist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie,&rdquo;  said Miss Gale, &ldquo;is a good sort. She&rsquo;s medium-sized, she has brown hair and  rather hazel eyes. She wears glasses, and she stoops a little in her walk. She  has perfect training and correct manners, and she is a model servant, but she  gives the impression of watching over Miss Van Allen, whatever else she may be  engaged in at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wears  black?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  usually gray gowns, or sometimes white. Inconspicuous aprons and no cap. She&rsquo;s  not quite a menial, but yet, not entirely a housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;English  speaking, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. But I think she&rsquo;s an<br>
    American. Don&rsquo;t you, Mrs Reeves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;American?  Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    Somers&rsquo; Real Name</b></h2>
  <p>Detective  Lowney, who had come with the coroner, had said little but had listened to all.  Occasionally he would dart from the room, and return a few moments later,  scribbling in his notebook. He was an alert little man, with beady black eyes and  a stubby black mustache.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want a few words with that caterer&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; he said, suddenly, &ldquo;and then they&rsquo;d  better clear away this supper business and go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all turned to look at the table. It stood in the end of the dining-room that  was back of the living-room. The sideboard was at the opposite end, back of the  hall, and it was directly in front of the sideboard that Somers&rsquo; body lay.</p>
  <p>Lowney  turned on more light, and a thrill went through us at the incongruity of that  gay table and the tragedy so near it. As always at Vicky Van&rsquo;s parties, the  appointments were dainty and elaborate. Flowers decorated the table; lace,  silver, and glass were of finest quality; and in the centre was the contrivance  known as a &ldquo;Jack Horner Pie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was to be the surprise,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I knew about it.<br>
    The pie is full of lovely trinkets and little jokes on the guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought those things were for children&rsquo;s parties,&rdquo; observed Fenn, looking with  interest at the gorgeous confection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re  really for birthdays,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;and to-day is Vicky&rsquo;s birthday. That  was part of her surprise. She didn&rsquo;t want it known, lest the guests should  bring gifts. She&rsquo;s like a child, Vicky is, just as happy over a birthday party  as a little girl would be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does Miss Van Allen look like?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  pretty,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;awfully pretty, but not a raving beauty. Black  hair, and bright, fresh coloring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was she dressed? Giddy clothes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  an evening gown,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Reeves, who resented the detective&rsquo;s off-hand  manner. &ldquo;A beautiful French gown, of tulle and gold trimmings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Low-necked,  and all that? Jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said, as Mrs. Reeves disdained to answer. &ldquo;Full evening costume, and a  necklace and earrings of amber set in gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what I&rsquo;m getting at is,&rdquo; said Lowney, &ldquo;a woman dressed like that couldn&rsquo;t go  very far in the streets without being noticed. We&rsquo;ll surely be able to trace  Miss Van Allen. Where would she be likely to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t go to my home, I live &lsquo;way down in  Washington Square.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  to mine,&rdquo; chirped Ariadne, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over on the west side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe she left the house,&rdquo; declared the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  us again, Luigi,&rdquo; asked Lowney, &ldquo;just where did the lady seem to go, when you  saw her leave this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say, sir. I was looking through a small opening, as I pushed the door  ajar, and I was so amazed at what I saw, that I was sort of paralyzed and didn&rsquo;t  dare open the door further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back to the pantry,&rdquo; commanded Fenn, &ldquo;and look in, just as you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  waiter retreated to the post he had held, and setting the door a few inches  ajar, proved that he could see body by the sideboard, but could not command a  view of the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  I&rsquo;ll represent Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; and Lowney stood over the body of Somers. &ldquo;Is  this the place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little farther to the right, sir,&rdquo; and Luigi&rsquo;s earnestness and good faith were  unmistakable. &ldquo;Yes, sir, just there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  I walk out into the hall. Is this the way she went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lowney  went from the dining-room to the hall, and it was clear that his further  progress could not be seen by the peeping waiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, Fenn,&rdquo; the detective went on, &ldquo;from here, in the back of this long hall,  Miss Van Allen could have left the house by two ways. She could have gone out  at the front door, passing the parlor, or, she could have gone down these  basement stairs, which are just under the stairs to the second story. Then she  could have gone out by the front area door, which would give her access to the  street. She could have caught up a cloak as she went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo;  said Fenn, musingly, &ldquo;she could have run upstairs. The staircase is so far back  in the hall, that the guests in the parlor would not have seen her. This is a  very deep house, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was true. The stairs began so far back in the long hall, that Vicky could  easily have slipped upstairs after leaving the dining-room, without being seen  by any of us in the living-room, unless we were in its doorway, looking out.  Was anybody? So many guests had left, that this point could not be revealed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see her,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe she was in the  dining-room at all. I don&rsquo;t care what that waiter says!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, Madame,&rdquo; reiterated Luigi. &ldquo;It was Miss Van Allen. I know her well. Often  she comes to Fraschini&rsquo;s, and always I take her orders. She came even this  afternoon, to make sure the great cake&mdash;the Jack Horner, was all right. And she  approved it, ah, she clapped her hands at sight of it. We all do our best for  Miss Van Allen, she is a lovely lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Allen is one of your regular customers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of our best. Very often we serve her, and always she orders our finest wares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  provide everything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  Candles, flowers, decorations&mdash;all&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she pays her bills?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  promptly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there are no servants here but the maid Julie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have often seen others. But I fancy they do not live in the house. Madame Julie  superintends and directs us always. Miss Van Allen leaves much to her. She is  most capable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you see this woman, this Julie, last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  short time before&mdash;before that happened.&rdquo; Luigi looked toward the body. &ldquo;She was  in and out of the pantries all the evening. She admitted the guests, she acted  as ladies&rsquo; maid, and she arranged the favors in the pie. It was, I should say,  ten minutes or so since she was last in the pantry, when I peeped in at the  door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was Julie then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I did not see her. Perhaps upstairs, or maybe in the front of the hall,  waiting to bring me word to serve supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me something distinctive about this maid&rsquo;s appearance. Was she good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a good-looking woman. But nothing especial about her. She had many gold  fillings in her teeth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  something,&rdquo; and Lowney noted it with satisfaction. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Luigi seemed to know nothing else that differentiated Julie from her sisters in  service, and Lowney changed his questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could Miss Van Allen get that knife of yours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir. It was, I suppose, in the pantry, with our other knives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is its use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a boning knife, but doubtless one of our men used it in cutting celery for  salad, or some such purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inquiry  showed that a man, named Palma, had used the knife for making a salad, and had  left it in the butler&rsquo;s pantry an hour or so before the crime was committed.  Any one could have taken the knife without its being missed, as the salad had  been completed and put aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, Miss Van Allen must have secured the knife some little time before  it was used, as Luigi was in the pantry just previously,&rdquo; observed Fenn. &ldquo;That  shows premeditation. It wasn&rsquo;t done with a weapon picked up at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it couldn&rsquo;t have been done by Miss Van Allen!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Reeves  triumphantly, &ldquo;for Vicky had no reason to premeditate killing a man she had  never seen before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky  didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; wailed Ariadne. &ldquo;I know she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must be found,&rdquo; said Lowney. &ldquo;But she will be found. If she&rsquo;s innocent, she will  return herself. If guilty, we must find her. And we will. A householder cannot  drop out of existence unnoticed by any one. Does she own this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not positive, but it&rsquo;s my impression that she  does. Vicky Van never boasts or talks of her money or of herself. But I know  she gives a good deal in charity, and is always ready to subscribe to  philanthropic causes. I tell you she is not the criminal, and I don&rsquo;t believe  she ever left this house in the middle of the night in evening dress! That  child is scared to death, and is hiding&mdash;in the attic or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose,  Mrs. Reeves,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;you go with Mr. Lowney, and look over the  house again. Search the bedrooms and store-rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; and Mrs. Reeves seemed to welcome an opportunity to help. She was a  good-hearted woman, and a staunch friend of Vicky Van. I was glad she was on  hand to stand up for the girl, for I confess things looked, to me, pretty  dubious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  along, too, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what we may  find. Perhaps there&rsquo;s further&mdash;tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew what was in her mind. That if Vicky had done the thing, she might have, in  an agony of remorse, taken her own life.</p>
  <p>Thrilled  with this new fear, I followed Lowney and Mrs. Reeves. We went downstairs  first. We examined all the basement rooms and the small, city back yard. There  was no sign of Vicky Van or of Julie, and next we came back to the first floor,  hunted that, and then on upstairs. The music room was soon searched, and I fell  back as the others went into Vicky&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Lowney, &ldquo;we must make a thorough job of it this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  bedroom was, it seemed to me, like a fairy dream. Furniture of white enameled  wicker, with pink satin cushions. Everywhere the most exquisite appointments of  silver, crystal and embroidered fabrics, and a bed fit for a princess. It  seemed profanation for the little detective to poke and pry around in wardrobes  and cupboards, though I knew it must be done. He was not only looking for  Vicky, but noting anything that might bear on her disappearance.</p>
  <p>But  there was no clue. Everything was in order, and all just as a well-bred,  refined woman would have her belongings.</p>
  <p>The  bedroom was over the dining-room, and back of this, over the pantry extension,  was Vicky Van&rsquo;s dressing-room.</p>
  <p>This  was a bijou boudoir, and dressing-table, chiffonier, robe-chests, and  jewel-caskets were all in keeping with the personality of their owner. The  walls were panelled in pale rose color, and a few fine pictures were in  absolute harmony. A long mirror was in a Florentine gilt frame, and a <i>chaise  longue</i>, by a reading table, bespoke hours of ease.</p>
  <p>Ruthlessly,  Lowney pried into everything, ran his arm among the gowns hanging in the  wardrobe, and looked into the carved chests.</p>
  <p>Again  no clue. The perfect order everywhere, showed, perhaps, preparation for guests,  but nothing indicated flight or hiding. The dressing-table boxes held some bits  of jewelry but nothing of really great value. An escritoire was full of letters  and papers, and this, Lowney locked, and put the key in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no harm done. And if the lady doesn&rsquo;t show  up, we must examine the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  we went to the third floor of the house. The rooms here were unused, save one  that was evidently Julie&rsquo;s. The furnishings, though simple, were attractive,  and showed a thoughtful mistress and an appreciative maid. Everything was in  order. Several uniforms of black and of gray were in the cupboard, and several  white aprons and one white dress. There were books, and a work-basket and such  things as betokened the life of a sedate, busy woman.</p>
  <p>We  left no room, no cupboard unopened. No hall or loft unsearched. We looked in,  under and behind every piece of furniture, and came, at last, to the  unescapable conclusion that wherever Vicky Van might be, she was not in her own  house.</p>
  <p>Downstairs  we went, and found Coroner Fenn and Inspector Mason in the hall. They had let  Doctor Remson go home, also Garrison and Miss Gale. The waiters, too, had been  sent off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  people can go, if you like,&rdquo; Fenn said, to Mrs. Reeves and myself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take  your addresses, and you can expect to be called on as witnesses. If we ever get  anything to witness! I never saw such a case! No criminal to arrest, and nobody  knows the victim! He must be from out of town. We&rsquo;ll nail Mr. Steele to-morrow,  and begin to get somewhere. Also we&rsquo;ll look up Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s credits and  business acquaintances. A woman can&rsquo;t have lived two years in a house like this,  and not have somebody know her antecedents and relatives. I suppose Mr. Steele  brought his friend here, and then, when this thing happened he was scared and  lit out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  Steele did the killing,&rdquo; suggested Lowney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  disagreed Fenn. &ldquo;I believe that Dago waiter&rsquo;s yarn. I cross-questioned him a  lot before I let him go, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s telling what he saw. I&rsquo;ll see  Fraschini&rsquo;s head man to-morrow&mdash;or, I suppose it&rsquo;s to-morrow now&mdash;hello, who&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  policeman came in at the street door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up?&rdquo; he said, looking about in amazement. &ldquo;You here, Mr.<br>
    Fenn? Lowney? What&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Patrolman Ferrall, the officer on the beat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  you been?&rdquo; asked the coroner. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  ever since midnight I been handling a crowd at a fire a couple blocks away.  This is Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  it is, and a friend of hers named Somers has been bumped off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  Killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it. What do you know of Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  except that she lives here. Quiet young lady. Nothin&rsquo; to be said about her. Who&rsquo;s  the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know, except named Somers. R. Somers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  heard of him. Where&rsquo;s Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Skipped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  That little thoroughbred can&rsquo;t be mixed up in a shootin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  isn&rsquo;t shot. Stabbed. With a kitchen knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner and Ferrall went toward the dining room, and, on an irresistible  impulse of curiosity, I followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo;  exclaimed Ferrall, as he caught sight of the dead man&rsquo;s features. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t  no Somers. That&rsquo;s Randolph Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  it is. Schuyler, the millionaire. Lives on Fifth Avenue, not far down from  here. Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look here. Are you sure this is Randolph Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure?  Of course I&rsquo;m sure. His house is on my beat. I see him often, goin&rsquo; in or comin&rsquo;  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then we <i>have</i> got a big case on our hands! Mason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  inspector could scarcely believe Ferrall&rsquo;s statement, but realized that the  policeman must know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  he said, trying to think of a dozen things at once. &ldquo;Then Steele knew him, and  introduced him as Somers on purpose. No wonder the clubs didn&rsquo;t know of R.  Somers! R. S. on his handkerchiefs and all that. He used a false name &lsquo;cause he  didn&rsquo;t want it known that Randolph Schuyler came to see Miss Van Allen! Oh,  here&rsquo;s a mess! Where&rsquo;s that girl? Why did she kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves began to cry. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t know it <i>was</i> Mr. Schuyler.  She doesn&rsquo;t <i>know</i> Mr. Schuyler. I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t, because we were  making lists for bazar patrons and she said she would ask only people she knew,  and we tried to find somebody who knew Randolph Schuyler, to ask him, but we  didn&rsquo;t know anybody who was acquainted with him at all. Oh, it can&rsquo;t be the  rich Schuyler! Why would he come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get hold of Mr. Steele as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Fenn, excitedly. &ldquo;Breen,  call up his home address again, and if he isn&rsquo;t there, go there and stick till  he comes. Now, for some one to identify this body. Call up the Schuyler  house&mdash;no, better go around there. Where is it, Ferrall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  straight out to the Avenue, and turn down. It&rsquo;s No.&mdash;only part of a block down.  Who&rsquo;s going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go, Lowney,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;Mason, will you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course. Come on, Lowney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner gave Mrs. Reeves and myself permission to go home, and I was glad to  go. But Mrs. Reeves declared her intention of staying the night, what was left  of it, in Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too late for me to go down alone,&rdquo; she said, in her sensible way. &ldquo;And, too, I&rsquo;d  rather be here, in case&mdash;in case Miss Van Allen comes home. I&rsquo;m her friend, and  I know she&rsquo;d like me to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The Schuyler Household</b></h2>
  <p>As  for me, I began to collect my senses after the shock of learning the true  identity of the dead man. Though I had never met him, Randolph Schuyler was a  client and friend of my partner, Charles Bradbury, and I suddenly felt a sort  of personal responsibility of action.</p>
  <p>For  one thing, I disliked the idea of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s wife and family receiving the  first tidings of the tragedy from the police. It seemed to me a friend ought to  break the news, if possible.</p>
  <p>I  said as much to Coroner Fenn, and he agreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be an awful errand. In the middle of the night, too. If  you&rsquo;re acquainted, suppose you go there with the boys, Mr. Calhoun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not personally acquainted, but Mr. Schuyler is my partner&rsquo;s client, though  there&rsquo;s been little business of his with our firm of late. But, as a matter of  humanity, I&rsquo;ll go, if you say so, and be of any help I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,  by all means. Probably they&rsquo;ll be glad of your advice and assistance in many  ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  dreaded the errand, yet I thought if the police had had to go and tell Winnie  and Aunt Lucy any such awful news, how glad they&rsquo;d be to have somebody present  of their own world, even of their own neighborhood. So I went.</p>
  <p>As  we had been told, the Schuyler house was only a few doors below the Avenue  corner. Even as Mason rang the bell, I was thinking how strange that a man  should go to a house where he desired to conceal his own name, when it was so  near his own dwelling.</p>
  <p>And  yet, I knew, too, that the houses on Fifth Avenue are as far removed from  houses just off the Avenue, as if they were in a different town.</p>
  <p>Mason&rsquo;s  ring was answered by a keen-eyed man of imperturbable countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  wanted?&rdquo; he said, gazing calmly at the policemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Schuyler?&rdquo; asked the inspector, in a matter-of-fact way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  out,&rdquo; said the man, respectfully enough, but of no mind to be loquacious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. He went to his club after dinner, and has not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you his valet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I wait up for him. He comes in with his key. I&rsquo;ve no idea when he will return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  his wife at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Schuyler is at home.&rdquo; Clearly, this man was answering questions only  because he recognized the authority that asked them. But he volunteered no  information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  else is in the family? Children?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Schuyler has no children. His two sisters are here, and Mrs.<br>
    Schuyler. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are all in bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Has anything happened to Mr. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  there has. Mr. Schuyler is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  The imperturbable calm gave way, and the valet became nervously excited. &ldquo;What  do you mean? Where is he? Shall I go to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will come in,&rdquo; said Lowney, for until now, we had stood outside.<br>
  &ldquo;Then we will tell you. Are any of the other servants about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, they are all in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;what  is your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cooper,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Cooper, call the butler, or whoever is in general charge.<br>
    And&mdash;summon Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  call Jepson, he&rsquo;s the butler, sir. And I&rsquo;ll call Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s maid,  Tibbetts, if she&rsquo;s in. And the maid, Hester, who waits on the Misses Schuyler.  Shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  get things started. Get Jepson as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is an awful affair,&rdquo; said Mason, as Cooper went off. We were in the hall, a  great apartment more like a room, save that a broad staircase curved up at one  side. The furnishings were magnificent, but in a taste heavily ornate and a  little old-fashioned. There were carved and upholstered benches, but none of us  cared to sit. The tension was too great.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  your eyes open, Lowney,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots to be picked up from  servants, before they&rsquo;re really on their guard. Get all you can about Mr.  Schuyler&rsquo;s evening habits from the man, Cooper. But go easy with the ladies. It&rsquo;s  hard enough for them at best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  valet reappeared with Jepson. This butler was of the accepted type, portly and  important, but the staggering news Cooper had evidently told him, had made him  a man among men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;The master dead? Apoplexy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Jepson. Mr. Schuyler was killed by some one. We don&rsquo;t know who did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed!  Murdered! My God!&rdquo; The butler spoke in a strong, low voice with no hint of  dramatic effect. &ldquo;How will Mrs. Schuyler bear it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  shall we tell her, Jepson?&rdquo; Mason showed a consultant air, for the butler was  so evidently a man of judgment and sense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must waken her maid, and let her rouse Mrs. Schuyler. Then the other ladies,  Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s sisters, we must <i>call</i> them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Jepson, do all those things, as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the wait seemed interminable.</p>
  <p>At  last the butler came back, and asked us up to the library, the front room on  the floor above. Here a footman was lighting a fire on the hearth, for the  house had the chill of the small hours.</p>
  <p>First  came the two sisters. These ladies, though not elderly, were middle-aged, and  perhaps, a few years older than their brother. They were austere and prim, of  aristocratic features and patrician air.</p>
  <p>But  they were almost hysterical in their excitement. A distressed maid hovered  behind them with sal volatile. The ladies were fully attired, but caps on their  heads and woolly wraps flung round them bore witness to hasty dressing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; cried Miss Rhoda, the younger of the two. &ldquo;What has happened to  Randolph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  introduced myself to them. I told them, as gently as I could, the bare facts,  deeming it wise to make no prevarication.</p>
  <p>So  raptly did they listen and so earnestly did I try to omit horrible details, and  yet tell the truth, that I did not hear Mrs. Schuyler enter the room. But she  did come in, and heard also, the story as I told it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  it not be,&rdquo; I heard a soft voice behind me say, &ldquo;can it not yet be there is  some mistake? Who says that man is my husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  turned to see the white face and clenched hands of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s widow.  She was holding herself together, and trying to get a gleam of hope from  uncertainty.</p>
  <p>If  I had felt pity and sorrow for her before I saw her, it was doubly poignant  now.</p>
  <p>Ruth  Schuyler was one of those gentle, appealing women, helplessly feminine in  emergency. Her frightened, grief-stricken eyes looked out of a small, pale  face, and her bloodless lips quivered as she caught them between her teeth in  an effort to preserve her self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Chester Calhoun,&rdquo; I said, and she bowed in acknowledgment. &ldquo;I am junior  partner in the firm of Bradbury and Calhoun. Mr. Bradbury is one of your  husband&rsquo;s lawyers and also a friend, so, as circumstances brought it about, I  came here, with Inspector Mason, to tell you&mdash;to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler sank into a seat. Still with that air of determination to be calm, she  gripped the chair arms and said, &ldquo;I heard you tell Miss Schuyler that Randolph  has been killed. I ask you, may it not be some one else? Why should he be at a  house where people called him by a name not his own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had heard, then, all I had told the older ladies. For Mrs. Schuyler was not  old. She must be, I thought at once, years younger than her husband. Perhaps a  second wife. I was glad she had heard, for it saved repeating the awful  narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not been identified, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except by the policeman of  this precinct, who declares he knows him well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was glad to give her this tiny loophole of possibility of mistaken identity,  and she eagerly grasped at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must make sure,&rdquo; she said, looking at Inspector Mason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid there&rsquo;s no room for doubt, ma&rsquo;am, but I&rsquo;m about to send the man, the  valet, over to see him. Do you wish any one else to go&mdash;from the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler shuddered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to go,&rdquo; she said, piteously.<br>
  &ldquo;For I can&rsquo;t think it is really Mr. Schuyler&mdash;and if it should be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no ma&rsquo;am, you needn&rsquo;t go. None of the family, I should say.&rdquo;<br>
    Mason looked at the elder ladies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; cried Miss Sarah, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t think of it! But let Jepson go. He is a  most reliable man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Schuyler, &ldquo;send Cooper and Jepson both. Oh, go quickly&mdash;I cannot bear  this suspense!&rdquo; She turned to me, as the two men who had been hovering in the  doorway, came in to take Mason&rsquo;s orders. &ldquo;I thank you, Mr. Calhoun. It was  truly kind of you to come. Tibbetts, get me a wrap, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s own maid, who went on the errand at once. More servants had  gathered; one or two footmen, a silly French parlor-maid or waitress, and from  downstairs I heard the hushed voices of others.</p>
  <p>Tibbetts  returned, and laid a fleecy white shawl about her mistress&rsquo; shoulders. Mrs.  Schuyler wore a house dress of dull blue. Her hair of an ash-blonde hue, was  coiled on top of her head; and to my surprise, when I noticed it, she wore a  string of large pearls round her throat, and on her hands were two rings, each  set with an enormous pearl.</p>
  <p>I  must have been awkward enough to glance at the pearls, for Mrs. Schuyler  remarked, &ldquo;I dressed so hastily, I kept on my pearls. I wear them at night  sometimes, to preserve their luster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she apparently forgot them, for without self-consciousness she turned to the  detective and began asking questions. Nervously she inquired concerning  minutest details, and I surmised that side by side with her grief at the  tragedy was a very human and feminine dismay at the thought of her husband,  stabbed to death in another woman&rsquo;s house!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; she asked over and over again, unsatisfied with the scant  information Lowney could give.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she lives near here? Just down the side street? Who <i>is</i> she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she is anyone you ever heard of,&rdquo; I said to her. &ldquo;She is a pleasant  young woman, and so far as I know, all that is correct and proper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why would she have Randolph Schuyler visiting her?&rdquo; flashed the retort. &ldquo;Is  that correct and proper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be so,&rdquo; I said, for I felt a sort of loyalty to Vicky Van. &ldquo;You see, she  was not acquainted with Mr. Schuyler until this evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he go there, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steele  brought him&mdash;Norman Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know any Mr. Steele.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to think that Randolph Schuyler had possessed many acquaintances of whom  his wife knew nothing, and I concluded to see Bradbury before I revealed any  more of Schuyler&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
  <p>And  then, Lowney began adroitly to put questions instead of answering them.</p>
  <p>He  inquired concerning Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s habits and pursuits, his recreations and his  social life.</p>
  <p>All  three of the women gave responses to these queries, and I learned many things.</p>
  <p>First,  that Randolph Schuyler was one manner of man at home and another abroad. The  household, it was plain to be seen, was one of most conservative customs and  rigidly straightbacked in its conventions.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler was not a second wife. She had been married about seven years, and had  lived the last five of them in the house we were now in. She was much younger  than her husband, and he had, I could see, kept her from all knowledge of or  participation in his Bohemian tastes. They were the sort of people who have a  box at the opera and are patrons of the best and most exclusive functions of  the highest society. Mrs. Schuyler, after the first shock, recovered her poise,  and though now and then a tremor shook her slight frame, she bore herself with  dignity and calm.</p>
  <p>The  two maiden ladies also grew quieter, but we all nervously awaited the return of  the butler.</p>
  <p>At  last he came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the master, Madame,&rdquo; he said, simply, to his mistress as he entered the room. &ldquo;He  is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  deferential gravity of his tone impressed me anew with the man&rsquo;s worth, and I  felt that the stricken wife had a tower of strength in the faithful servitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  left Cooper there, Madame,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They&mdash;they will not bring Mr. Schuyler  home tonight. In the morning, perhaps. And now, Madame, will you not go to  rest? I will be at the service of these gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  seemed cruel to torture them further that night, and the three ladies were  dismissed by Lowney, and, attended by their maids, they left us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Jepson,&rdquo; Lowney began, &ldquo;tell us all you know about Mr.<br>
    Schuyler&rsquo;s doings. I daresay you know as much as the valet does. Was<br>
    Mr. Schuyler as a man of the world, different from his life in this<br>
    house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jepson  looked perturbed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for me to say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is, my man. The law asks you, and it is for you to tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; and the butler weighed his words, &ldquo;my master was always most strict of  habit in his home. The ladies are very reserved, and abide by rules and  standards, that are, if I may say so, out of date to-day. But, though Mr.  Schuyler was by no means a gay man or a member of any fast set, yet I have  reason to think, sir, that at times he might go to places where he would not  take Mrs. Schuyler, and where he would not wish Mrs. Schuyler to know he had  been himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  enough,&rdquo; said Lowney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got his number. Now, Jepson, had your master any  enemies, that you know of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of. But I know nothing of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s affairs. I see him go out  of an evening, and I may notice that he comes in very late, but as to his  friends or enemies, I know nothing at all. I am not one to pry, sir, and my  master has always trusted me. I have endeavored not to betray that trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  might have sounded pharisaical in a man of less sincerity of speech. But Jepson&rsquo;s  clear, straightforward eyes forbade any doubt of his honesty and truth.</p>
  <p>Again  I was glad that Mrs. Schuyler had this staunch helper at her side, for I  foresaw troublous times in store for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you never heard of this Miss Van Allen? Never was in her house before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,  sir. I know nothing of the houses on the side blocks.&rdquo; I winced at this. &ldquo;Of  course, I know the people who come to this house, but there is among them no  Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  not!&rdquo; I thought to myself. And then I sighed at the memory of<br>
    Vicky Van. Had she killed this millionaire? And if so, why?</p>
  <p>I  was sure Vicky had never met Randolph Schuyler before that evening. I had seen  their meeting, and it was too surely the glance of stranger to stranger that  had passed between them, to make a previous acquaintance possible. Vicky had  been charming to him, as she always was to every one, but she showed no special  interest, and if she did really kill him, it was some unguessable motive that  prompted the deed.</p>
  <p>I  thought it over. Schuyler, at the club, dined and wined, had perhaps heard  Norman Steele extol the charms of Vicky Van. Interested, he had asked to be  taken to Vicky&rsquo;s house, but, as it was so near his own, a sense of precaution  led him to adopt another name.</p>
  <p>Then  the inexplicable sequel!</p>
  <p>And  the mysterious disappearance of Vicky herself.</p>
  <p>Though,  of course, the girl would return. As Mrs. Reeves had said, doubtless she had  witnessed the crime, and, scared out of her wits, had run away. Her return  would clear up the matter.</p>
  <p>Then  the waiter&rsquo;s story?</p>
  <p>Well,  there was much to be done. And, as I suddenly bethought me, it was time I,  myself went home!</p>
  <p>As  I passed Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, on my way home, I saw lights pretty much all over  it, and was strongly tempted to go in. But common sense told me I needed rest,  and not only did I have many matters to attend to on the morrow, but I had to  tell the story to Aunt Lucy and Winnie!</p>
  <p>That,  of itself, would require some thought and tactful management, for I was not  willing to have them condemn Vicky Van entirely, and yet, I could think of no  argument to put forth for the girl&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
  <p>Time  alone must tell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    Vicky&rsquo;s Ways</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Ches-ter  Cal-houn! Get up this minute! There&rsquo;s a reporter downstairs! A reporter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  sleepy eyes opened to find Winnie pounding my shoulder as it humped beneath the  blanket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey?  What?&rdquo; I grunted, trying to collect my perceptions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A <i>reporter!</i>&rdquo;  If Winnie had said a Bengal tiger, she couldn&rsquo;t have looked more terrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Scott! Win&mdash;I remember! Clear out, I&rsquo;ll be down in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  dressed in record time and went downstairs in three leaps.</p>
  <p>In  the library, I found Aunt Lucy, wearing an expression that she might have shown  if the garbage man had asked her to a dance.</p>
  <p>But  Winnie was eagerly drinking in the story poured forth by the said reporter, who  was quite evidently enjoying his audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Chet, this is Mr. Bemis of <i>The Meteor</i>. He&rsquo;s telling us all about the&mdash;you  know&mdash;what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie  was too timid to say the word <i>murder,</i> and I was sorry she had to hear  the awful tale from any one but myself. However, there was no help for it now,  and I joined the group and did all I could to bring Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s eyebrows and  nose down to their accustomed levels.</p>
  <p>But  it <i>was</i> an awful story, make the best of it, and the truth had to be  told.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is appalling,&rdquo; conceded Aunt Lucy, at length, &ldquo;but the most regrettable  circumstance, to my mind, is your connection with it all, Chester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Auntie, have a little heart for poor Mrs. Schuyler, and those old lady sisters.  Also for the man himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I have, Chet. I&rsquo;m not inhuman. But those things are in the papers every day,  and while one feels a general sympathy, it can&rsquo;t be personal if one doesn&rsquo;t  know the people. But, for you to be mixed up in such matters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t mixed up in it, Aunt Lucy, except as I chose to mix myself. And I&rsquo;ve no  doubt I should have gotten into it anyway. Mr. Bradbury will have a lot to do  with it, I&rsquo;m sure. I&rsquo;m no better than he to mix in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a business way, yes. But you were there socially&mdash;where a murder was committed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aunt  Lucy could have shown no more horror of it all, if I had been the convicted  criminal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  I&rsquo;m glad I was!&rdquo; I cried, losing patience a little. &ldquo;If I can be of any help to  the Schuyler people or to Miss Van Allen, I shall be willing to do all I can.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Miss Van Allen is the&mdash;the murderer!&rdquo; and Aunt Lucy whispered the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that!&rdquo; I cried sharply. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know it at all, and there&rsquo;s no reason to  condemn the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  paused. Bemis was taking in my every word with a canny understanding of what I  said, and also of what I didn&rsquo;t say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do your suspicions tend, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; he said smoothly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly,  Mr. Bemis, I don&rsquo;t know. I am an acquaintance of Miss Van Allen and I cannot  reconcile the idea of crime with her happy, gentle nature. Nor can I see any  reason to suspect the waiter who first told of the matter. But might not some person,  some enemy of Mr. Schuyler, have been secreted in the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  plausible theory,&rdquo; agreed Bemis, &ldquo;even an obvious one, but almost no chance of  it. I&rsquo;ve seen the caterer&rsquo;s people, and they were in charge of the basement  rooms and the dining-room all the evening. Unless it were one of the guests at  the party, I think no intruder could have gotten in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  I returned, uneasily, for I wished he would go, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t up to us to invent  theories or to defend them. I will answer your necessary questions, but pardon  me, if I remind you that I am a busy man and I haven&rsquo;t yet had my breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bemis  took the hint, and after a string of definite and pertinent questions, he left.</p>
  <p>Winnie  tried to detain him, but my curt courtesy made it difficult for him to linger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Chessy,&rdquo; cried my sister, as soon as Bemis had gone, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s awful,<br>
    I know, but <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> it exciting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Winnie,&rdquo; reproved Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;A girl of your age should know nothing of these  things, and I want you to put it out of your mind. You can be of no help, and I  do not want your nerves disturbed by the harrowing details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right, Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;but this is going to be a celebrated case,  and Winnie can&rsquo;t be kept in ignorance of its developments. Now be a good sort,  Auntie&mdash;accept the inevitable. Try to realize that I must do what seems to me my  duty, and if that brings us more or less into the limelight of publicity, it is  a pity, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree to all that, Chester, dear. But you are so mixed in it socially. Why did  you ever get into that set?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t a bad set, Aunt Lu. It isn&rsquo;t a fast set, by any means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wouldn&rsquo;t see Winnie or me there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but a decent man goes to places where he wouldn&rsquo;t take his women people. Now,  let up, Auntie. Trust your good-for-nothing nevvy, and just do all you can to  help&mdash;by doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  help you, Chessy-Cat. I&rsquo;ll do exactly as you tell me, if you&rsquo;ll only let me  know about it, and not treat me like a baby,&rdquo; said Winnie, who was  wheedlesomely assisting my breakfast arrangements. She sugared and creamed my  cereal, and, as I dispatched it, she buttered toast and poured coffee and  deftly sliced off the top of a soft-boiled egg.</p>
  <p>I  managed to eat some of these viands between answers to their rapid-fire volley  of questions and at last I made ready to go down town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  remember,&rdquo; I said, as I departed, &ldquo;if a lot of gossippy old hens come around  here to-day&mdash;or your chicken friends&mdash;Winnie, don&rsquo;t tell them a thing. Let &lsquo;em  get it from the papers, or apply to information, or any old way, but don&rsquo;t you  two give out a line of talk! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  kissed them both, and started off.</p>
  <p>Of  course, I went over to Vicky Van&rsquo;s first. I had been on the proverbial pins and  needles to get there ever since I woke to consciousness by reason of the sisterly  pounding that brought me from the land of dreams.</p>
  <p>The  house had an inhabited look, and when I went in, I was greeted by the odor of  boiling coffee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  right down here,&rdquo; called Mrs. Reeves from the basement.</p>
  <p>I  went down, passing the closed dining-room door with a shudder. Two or three  policemen were about, in charge of things generally, but none whom I knew. They  had been relieved for the present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  still here?&rdquo; I said, a little inanely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  returned Mrs. Reeves, who looked tired and wan. &ldquo;I stayed, you know, but I  couldn&rsquo;t sleep any. I lay down on the music-room couch, but I only dozed a few  minutes at a time. I kept hearing strange sounds or imagining I did, and the  police were back and forth till nearly daylight. Downstairs, they were. I didn&rsquo;t  bother them, but they knew I was in the house, if&mdash;if Vicky should come home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face was wistful and her eyes very sad. I looked my sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  liked her, I know,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But everybody &lsquo;most, has turned against her.  Since they found the man was Randolph Schuyler, all sympathy is for him and his  widow. They all condemn Vicky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can scarcely blame them,&rdquo; I began, but she interrupted,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do blame them! They&rsquo;ve no right to accuse that girl unheard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  waiter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I know, the waiter! Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel about it. I can&rsquo;t stay here  much longer, though. I made coffee and got myself some breakfast&mdash;but, honest,  Mr. Calhoun, it pretty nearly choked me to eat sandwiches that had been made  for last night&rsquo;s surprise supper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think it would! Didn&rsquo;t any rolls come, or milk, you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see any. Well, I&rsquo;ll go home this morning, but I shall telephone up here  every little while. The police will stay here, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for a day or two. Do you think Vicky will come back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. She&rsquo;ll have to, sooner or later. I tried to make myself sleep in  her room last night, but I just couldn&rsquo;t. So I stayed in the music room, I  thought&mdash;I suppose it was foolish&mdash;but I thought maybe she might telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d  hardly do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s impossible to say <i>what</i> she might do. Oh, the whole  thing is impossible! Think of it, Mr. Calhoun. Where could that girl have gone?  Alone, at midnight, in that gorgeous gown, no hat or wrap&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t&mdash;not positively. But if she had put on wraps and gone out by either door  she would surely have been seen by some one in the house. I&rsquo;m just sure she  didn&rsquo;t go out by the front street door, for we in the living-room must have  noticed her. And she couldn&rsquo;t have gone out by the area door, for there were  waiters all about, down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were sitting in the front basement room, a pleasant enough place, evidently a  servants&rsquo; sitting room. Before Mrs. Reeves, on the table, were the remnants of  her scarce tasted breakfast. As she had said, the tiny sandwiches and rich  salad, which she had procured from the unused stores of the caterer&rsquo;s  provision, did seem too closely connected with the tragedy to be appetizing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  kitchen is back of this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and dumb waiters to the dining-room. I confess I&rsquo;ve looked about a bit. I&rsquo;m not  a prying woman&mdash;but I felt I was justified.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly are, Mrs. Reeves,&rdquo; I said, warmly, for she was thoroughly  good-hearted, and a staunch friend of Vicky Van. &ldquo;Have you learned anything  illuminating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but things are queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer,  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you wouldn&rsquo;t understand. A man couldn&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s this way. Lots of potted  meats and jars of jam and cans of tea and coffee and cocoa in the pantry, but  no fresh meat or green vegetables about. No butter in the icebox, and no eggs  or bacon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what does that imply? I&rsquo;m no housekeeper, I admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks to me as if Vicky was leaving this morning&mdash;I mean as if she had expected  to go away to-day, and so had no stuff on hand to spoil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  this is her market day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  it&rsquo;s queer, that&rsquo;s what it is. You know sometimes Vicky does go away for days  at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t  she a right to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she has. I&rsquo;m thinking it out. Where does she go? And wherever it is,  that&rsquo;s where she is now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Reeves&rsquo; triumphant air seemed to settle the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  all that isn&rsquo;t queer, my dear lady,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We all know Vicky Van gads about  a lot. I&rsquo;ve telephoned her myself twice, and she wasn&rsquo;t here. Once, Julie  answered, and once there was no response of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose that&rsquo;s the case. She was going away on a visit to-day, maybe, and so  had little food on hand to be disposed of. A good housekeeper would look after  that. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be Vicky&rsquo;s doing, but Julie&rsquo;s. That housekeeper is  a treasure. She could run a hotel if she wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  perhaps,&rdquo; I mused, aloud, &ldquo;Vicky ran away and went to the place, wherever it  is, that she expected to visit to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. This is all merely conjecture. And, too, how could she, in that  dress? No, she has gone to some friend in town. She must have done so. A hotel  wouldn&rsquo;t take her in&mdash;why,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves&rsquo; voice broke, &ldquo;you know that waiter said  there&mdash;there was blood on Vicky&rsquo;s gown!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we believe him at all, why shouldn&rsquo;t we believe the whole tale? I don&rsquo;t know  Vicky Van, you understand, except as a casual friend. I mean, I know nothing of  her family, her past, or her personality, except as I&rsquo;ve seen her in a friendly  way. I like her, thoroughly, but I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  does?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody.  All her friends say the same thing. She is lovely and dear, but never  confidential, or communicative regarding herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever  she went, Julie must be with her,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I dare say that is so, but how on earth could <i>two</i> women get  out of this house without its being known?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet, they did. Whether alone or together, they both got away last night. You  don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re still concealed in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, of course not; after the search we made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help thinking they&rsquo;ll turn up to-day. Julie, anyway. Why, Miss Van Allen  must come back or send back for her valuables. I saw jewelry and money in the  dressing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but, of course, they&rsquo;re safe enough. They&rsquo;re all in care of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were interrupted by the entrance of a policeman and a woman who had come to  work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  says,&rdquo; the policeman addressed Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;that she was expected here to-day  to clean. Now, we can&rsquo;t let her disturb things much, but she&rsquo;d better wash up a  little, and throw away some of the supper stuff that won&rsquo;t keep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everybody  seemed to look to Mrs. Reeves as a sort of proxy housekeeper, and I wondered  what they would have done without her. Though I suppose they would have  managed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed,&rdquo; was her glad response. &ldquo;Let her tidy up these breakfast things I&rsquo;ve  used, and there&rsquo;s some cups and plates in the kitchen, for I gave those poor  policemen some food &lsquo;long &lsquo;bout three o&rsquo;clock this morning. And she can throw  out the melted ice cream, it&rsquo;s no good to anybody, and it surely isn&rsquo;t  evidence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  determined to ask the working-woman some questions, but the police forestalled  me.</p>
  <p>Ferrall  came down and joined us, and spoke to her at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, Mrs. Flaherty. Don&rsquo;t you do anything now, but just what you&rsquo;re told to  do. And first, tell us a thing or two. How often do you come here? I&rsquo;ve seen  you in and out, now and again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do be comin&rsquo; whin I&rsquo;m sint for; not of a reg&rsquo;lar day. Maybe wanst a week,  maybe of&rsquo;ner. Thin agin, not for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as I said,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;Vicky often goes away for days at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shure  she does that. Miss Van Allen is here to-day an&rsquo; gone to-morrow, but Miss Julie  she looks after me wurruk, so she does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  engages you when you are needed?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. They&rsquo;s a tillyphone in me husband&rsquo;s shop, an&rsquo; if anny wan calls me, he  lets me know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did they tell you to come here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas  yisterday, sir. Miss Julie, she sinds wurrud for me to come this marnin&rsquo; to  clane, as they do be havin&rsquo; a party last night. Ach, that this thrubble should  come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  now, Mrs. Flaherty, never mind your personal feelings. We&rsquo;re in a hurry.&rdquo;  Ferrall was busy making notes of the information he was getting, and I could  well understand, that any side-light on Vicky&rsquo;s home life was of importance. So  I tarried to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long have you worked for Miss Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  matther av a year or more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  clean the rooms upstairs, sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  over the house. Manny&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve shwept an&rsquo; vacuumed Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s own  bedroom an&rsquo; boodore. An&rsquo; likewise the music room an&rsquo; parlure an&rsquo; all. Yis, sor,  I&rsquo;m here frekint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other servants does Miss Van Allen employ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  that lives in, &lsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Miss Julie. But there&rsquo;s the laundry woman, as comes&mdash;though  more often the wash goes out. Thin, there&rsquo;s a chore boy, as runs arrants; an&rsquo;  sometimes a sewin&rsquo; woman; an&rsquo; often the caterer man&rsquo;s dagoes. Yis, an&rsquo; a boy, a  Buttons you know, to open the dure for, say, an afternoon party. You see, Miss  Van Allen is off visitin&rsquo; so much, she don&rsquo;t want steady help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  does she visit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I dunno. But go, she does, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s good times she has. For she  comes back, chipper an&rsquo; merry an&rsquo; glad to see her friends&mdash;an&rsquo; thin, all of a  suddint, up an&rsquo; off agin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew that was Vicky Van&rsquo;s habit. All that the woman said corroborated my idea  of the little butterfly&rsquo;s frivolous life. So, why should she keep permanent  servants if she was at home only half the time? I knew the troubles Aunt Lucy  had with her menials, and I approved of Vicky&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that explains the empty icebox,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves was saying, nodding her head in  satisfaction. &ldquo;Vicky meant to go off to-day, after the house was put in order,  and she didn&rsquo;t want a lot of food left to spoil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yis,  mum,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Flaherty. &ldquo;Shall I wash thim dishes now, mum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she was allowed to set to work.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    Ruth Schuyler</b></h2>
  <p>There  were many calls on Vicky Van&rsquo;s telephone that morning. It seemed to me that the  bell rang almost continually. The police people answered it, and one time, I  was surprised to learn that the call was for me.</p>
  <p>I  took up the receiver and heard Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  called up your home,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your sister told me to try this number.  Now, look here, Calhoun, I wish you&rsquo;d go to see Mrs. Schuyler. I&rsquo;ve talked with  her over the telephone, and she asked me to come up there, but I&rsquo;ve got the  Crittendon case on this morning, and I can&rsquo;t get away very well. So you go and  see what you can do for her. She told me you were there last night, and she&rsquo;s  willing to have you in my place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  agreed, feeling rather flattered that the rich man&rsquo;s widow should so readily  accept me as Mr. Bradbury&rsquo;s substitute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry you&rsquo;re going there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reeves, her eyes filling with tears, as I  took leave of her. &ldquo;Of course, the Schuylers will pump you about Vicky, and try  to make you say that she killed that man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must tell Mrs. Schuyler the truth,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but can&rsquo;t you give Vicky the benefit of the doubt? For there is a doubt. Why should  she kill a man she never had seen before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he wasn&rsquo;t a stranger to her, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I heard her say, before he came, that she didn&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard her say she didn&rsquo;t know Mr. Somers,&rdquo; I corrected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking  this thing over. Suppose Vicky did know Mr. Schuyler, and when Steele proposed  bringing a Mr. Somers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you&rsquo;re all wrong!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I saw them when they met, and I&rsquo;m sure they  had never laid eyes on each other before. There was not the least sign of recognition.  Besides, that isn&rsquo;t like Vicky&mdash;to have a millionaire and a married man for her  friend. That girl is all right, Mr. Calhoun, and I don&rsquo;t want you to let Mrs.  Schuyler think she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Mrs. Schuyler knows something about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it. Anyway, you stand up for Vicky, as far as you can do so honestly. Won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can surely promise that,&rdquo; I replied, as I started on my errand.</p>
  <p>Approaching  the Fifth Avenue residence, I looked at the house, which I had been unable to  see clearly the night before.</p>
  <p>It  was large and handsome, but not one of the most modern mansions. Four stories,  it was, and as I glanced up I noticed that all the window shades were down. The  floral emblem of death hung at one side of the wide entrance, and as I  approached, the door silently swung open.</p>
  <p>A  footman was in charge, and I was ushered at once to the library where I had  been some hours earlier. It was not a cheerful room; the appointments were  heavy and somber, though evidently the woods and fabrics were of great value. A  shaded electrolier gave a dim light, for the drawn blinds precluded daylight.</p>
  <p>A  soft step, and Mrs. Schuyler came into the room.</p>
  <p>Black  garb was not becoming to her. The night before, in her blue house-dress, she  had looked almost pretty, but now, in a black gown, without even a bit of  relieving white at her throat, she was plain and very pathetic.</p>
  <p>Her  face was pale and drawn, and her eyes showed dark shadows, as of utter  weariness. She greeted me simply and glided to a nearby chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is kind of you to come, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and the fine quality of her voice and  inflection betokened New England ancestry, or training. &ldquo;As you were here last  night&mdash;you seem more like a friend than a mere business acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; and I spoke sincerely, &ldquo;that you look on me like  that. Please tell me anything you wish to, and command me in any way I can  serve you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speech sounded a little stilted, I knew, but there was something about Ruth  Schuyler that called for dignified address. She had the air of bewildered  helplessness that always appeals to a man, but she had, too, a look of  determination as to one who would do the right thing at any cost of personal  unpleasantness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is all so dreadful,&rdquo; she began, and an insuppressible sob threatened her  speech. But she controlled it, and went on. &ldquo;There is so much to be gone  through with and I am so ignorant of&mdash;of law and&mdash;you know&mdash;of police doings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;and anything that you can be spared, rest assured you  shall be. But there is much ahead of you that will be hard for you&mdash;very hard,  and perhaps I can help you get ready for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  there be an inquest, and all that?&rdquo; she whispered the word half fearfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  there must be; though not for several days, probably. You know they can&rsquo;t find  Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Where can she be? I don&rsquo;t suppose they will ever find her. Why should she kill  my husband? Have you any theory, Mr. Calhoun? How well did you know this&mdash;this  person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  fairly well. By which I mean, I have met her some half a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  in her own house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  always. I&rsquo;ve attended studio parties where she was present&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Bohemian affairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly. Miss Van Allen is a delightful girl, bright and of merry spirits, but  in no way fast or of questionable habits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what they tell me; but pardon me, if I cannot believe a really nice, correct  young woman would have a married man visiting her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  remember, Mrs. Schuyler, Miss Van Allen did not invite Mr. Schuyler to her  house. As near as we can make out, Mr. Steele brought him, without Miss Van  Allen&rsquo;s permission. And under an assumed name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  blush of shame stained her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  realize,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how that reflects against my husband. Must all this be  made public, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear it must. The law is inexorable in its demands for justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if they can&rsquo;t find Miss Van Allen, how can they indict her? or whatever the  term is. Why can&rsquo;t the whole affair be hushed up? Personally, I would far  rather never find the girl&mdash;never have her punished, than to drag the Schuyler  name through the horrors of a murder trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite understand your position, but it will not be possible to evade the legal  proceedings. Of course, if Miss Van Allen is never found, the affair must  remain a mystery. But she will be found. A lady like that can&rsquo;t drop out of  existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not. Why, her bills must be paid, her household effects looked after;  is she in a house or an apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  house. I understand she owns it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she must communicate with her business people&mdash;lawyer, bank or creditors. Can&rsquo;t  you trace her that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  hope to. As you say, she must surely return to attend to such matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  her servants? What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  described the unusual menage that Vicky Van supported, and Mrs.<br>
    Schuyler was interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  strange,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She sounds to me like an adventuress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she isn&rsquo;t that. She has money enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  does she get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But she is a quiet, self-reliant little person, and not  at all of the adventuress type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about her  personality. She must be bad or she wouldn&rsquo;t have killed my husband. I&rsquo;m not  defending him, but men don&rsquo;t go to the houses of complete strangers and get  murdered by them! And I hope she will never be found, for it might bring out a  story of scandal or shame that will always cling to Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s memory. But,  of course, she will come back, and she will plead innocence and lay all blame  on Mr. Schuyler. Can&rsquo;t we buy her off? I would pay a large sum to keep her  story from the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, but that can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you would help me&mdash;I&rsquo;m so disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tears  gathered in her eyes, and her voice trembled. I wished Bradbury had had this  job instead of myself, for I am soft-hearted where feminine appeal is  concerned, and I didn&rsquo;t know quite what to say.</p>
  <p>But  just then the two Schuyler sisters came into the library and I rose to greet  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  cried Miss Rhoda, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all too awful! We can&rsquo;t believe it! I wish I had that  girl here! You must find her, Mr. Calhoun&mdash;you must!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  chimed in Miss Sarah; &ldquo;she must be brought to judgment. An eye for an eye and a  life for a life. That&rsquo;s the Scripture law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk so, Sarah,&rdquo; pleaded Ruth Schuyler. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t bring Randolph back, to  punish his murderer. And think of the awful publicity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care for that. Murder has been done and murder must be avenged. I&rsquo;m  ashamed of you, Ruth, if you let any idea of personal distaste stand in the way  of righteous law and order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  too,&rdquo; agreed Rhoda. &ldquo;Spare no effort or expense, Mr. Calhoun, to find that  wicked girl and have her arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay you are right,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s acquiescence showed her to be more  or less under the iron hand of the family opinion. &ldquo;Of course, if you feel that  way, I shall raise no obstacle to the law&rsquo;s progress. Whatever you advise,  Rhoda, I agree to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  you do. You are young, Ruth, and you are not a Schuyler. Why, the very name  demands the strongest powers of the law. I only fear that the most desperate  efforts may not succeed. What is your opinion, Mr. Calhoun? Can they find that  woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  scorn of the last two words, as uttered by Rhoda Schuyler&rsquo;s sharp tongue, is  not to be reproduced in print.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think most probably, yes, Miss Schuyler. I think she must return sooner or  later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  wait for that!&rdquo; exclaimed Sarah. &ldquo;Send people to search for her. Scour the  country. Don&rsquo;t let her get away beyond retrieval. Offer a reward, if necessary,  but get her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  reward!&rdquo; repeated Rhoda. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. Put it in the paper at once; a large  reward for any information of Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo;  I urged; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t decide on such measures too hastily. Might you not defeat your  own purpose? Miss Van Allen doubtless will see the papers, wherever she may be.  If she learns of the reward, she will hide herself more securely than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; said Ruth, in her gentle voice. &ldquo;I am sure, Rhoda, we oughtn&rsquo;t  to do anything like that just yet. Oh, how hard it is to know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we&rsquo;ve always deferred everything to Randolph. How can we get along without him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler set her pale lips together in an evident determination  to be brave and strong. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Calhoun, what is there to be discussed in a  business way? I mean regarding Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s business with you or Mr.  Bradbury?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  at present,&rdquo; I returned, feeling sure the poor woman had quite enough on her  mind. &ldquo;The will can be examined at your convenience, and any questions of securities  or money can rest over for a time. Do you wish any ready cash? Or shall we look  after any money matters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, no. Such things are systematically arranged in the household. Jepson  attends to bills and tradesmen. My greatest wish is for a secretary or some  person to write notes and look after the flood of letters and telegrams that  has already begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  felt surprised, for I had assumed that the rich man&rsquo;s wife had a social  secretary of her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no one,&rdquo; she said, in response to my glance, &ldquo;Mr. Schuyler didn&rsquo;t wish me to  have a secretary, and indeed I didn&rsquo;t need one. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, it is necessary now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Rhoda. &ldquo;I am surprised at you, Ruth! You know how  Randolph objected to such things, and now, as soon as he is gone, you begin to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Rhoda,&rdquo; said Ruth, with gentle dignity. &ldquo;It was not necessary before, but it is  now. You&rsquo;ve no idea what a task it will be. All our friends and many of  Randolph&rsquo;s acquaintances will call or send messages and they must be  acknowledged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  pray, what else have you to do, but acknowledge them? Sarah and I will attend  to our own. A great many, doubtless, but not too much of a task for us, when it  is in memory of our dear brother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; and Ruth spoke calmly, &ldquo;we will wait for a day or two, Mr. Calhoun, and  then, if, as I believe, the matter requires further consideration, we will  discuss it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clever  woman, I thought to myself. She isn&rsquo;t altogether chummy with those old maid  sisters, and yet she knows better than to have any open disagreement. I&rsquo;ll bet  she gets her secretary when she gets ready for one! I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for  the right girl for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  will they bring my husband home?&rdquo; she continued, without waiting for comment on  her decision about the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  time to-day,&rdquo; I returned, looking commiseratingly at the harassed white face. &ldquo;Probably  this afternoon. Can I take any message regarding the funeral arrangements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler shuddered. &ldquo;Those details are so terrible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible,  yes,&rdquo; said Miss Sarah, &ldquo;but they must be looked after. We will see the  undertaker&rsquo;s men, Ruth. I think Rhoda and I will know better what is fit and  proper for Randolph&rsquo;s burial ceremonies than you possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to realize that the sisters had a family pride which did not include  their brother&rsquo;s wife in their councils. Apparently she was, or they deemed her,  of lesser birth or social standing. Personally, however, I greatly preferred  the gentle kindliness of the widow to the aristocratic hauteur of the sisters.</p>
  <p>Ruth  Schuyler made no objection to the proposition, and seemed relieved that her  advice would not be required.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is in the house where Mr. Schuyler was&mdash;where he died?&rdquo; she asked, hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the police,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;unless Miss Van Allen has returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were&mdash;were  there many people there&mdash;last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly,  she wanted to know more details of the occasion, but didn&rsquo;t like to show  curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I informed her, &ldquo;quite a number. It was Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s birthday, and so, a  sort of little celebration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  birthday? How old was she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no idea. I should guess about twenty-two or twenty-three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she&mdash;is&mdash;what does she look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eternal feminine wanted to ask &ldquo;is she pretty?&rdquo; but Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s dignity  scarcely permitted the question. I noticed, too, that the sisters listened  attentively for my reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said, truthfully, &ldquo;she is pretty. She is small, with very black hair, and  large, dark gray eyes. She is exceedingly chic and up-to-date as to costumes, and  is of vivacious and charming manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  sniffed Miss Rhoda, &ldquo;an actress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all! Victoria Van Allen is a well-bred lady if there ever was one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a staunch friend, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Mrs. Schuyler looked her surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  speak only as I feel; I can&rsquo;t say surely that Miss Van Allen did not commit  this crime, for I know there is evidence against her. But I can&rsquo;t reconcile the  deed with her character, as I know it, and I, for one, shall wait further  developments before I condemn her. But, of course, Mrs. Schuyler, my personal  feelings in the matter have no weight in law, and I stand ready to obey  whatever orders you may give in connection with a search for the missing girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know exactly what I do want done, yet, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Ruth<br>
    Schuyler glanced deferringly toward the sisters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For once Sarah agreed with Ruth. &ldquo;After the funeral, we can set our  minds to the finding of the criminal. Of course, the police will do all they  can, meantime, to trace her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. And such a plan is best. She may return&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  a house guarded by police?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.  If she is innocent, why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innocent!&rdquo;  exclaimed Miss Rhoda with utmost scorn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of her friends think her so,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;Mrs. Reeves, a lady who was at the  party, stayed in the house all night, and is, I think, there still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did she do that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Schuyler, looking puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hoped Miss Van Allen would return, and she waited there to look after her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was kind. Who is this lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  lives down on Washington Square. I only know her slightly, but she is a  warm-hearted and a most capable and sensible one. She refuses to believe that  Vicky Van&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you call her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  friends call her Vicky Van. It&mdash;it sort of suits her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what you say, I judge she is not the terror I thought her at first; but, all  the same, she murdered my husband, and I cannot look on her as you seem to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  can I blame you. Your feelings toward her are entirely just, Mrs.<br>
    Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    The Letter-Box</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a queer case,&rdquo; said Mr. Bradbury to me, when I reached the office that  afternoon. &ldquo;Of course, I know Randolph Schuyler was no saint, but I never  supposed he was deep enough in any affair to have a woman kill him. And so near  his own home, too! He might have had the decency to choose his lady  acquaintances in more remote sections of the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t the queerest part to me,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t understand is, why  that girl stabbed him. She didn&rsquo;t know him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  now, Calhoun, she must have known him. She didn&rsquo;t know any Somers, we&rsquo;ll say,  but she must have known Schuyler. A murder has to have a motive. She had  provided herself with that knife beforehand, you see, and she got him out to  the dining-room purposely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t think it,&rdquo; I said, and I sighed. &ldquo;I know Vicky Van fairly well, and she  wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t say what a woman would or wouldn&rsquo;t do. But it&rsquo;s not our business to look  after the criminal part of it, we&rsquo;ve got all we can handle, attending to the  estate. And here&rsquo;s another thing. I wish you&rsquo;d do all that&rsquo;s necessary up at  the house. I always got along all right with Randolph Schuyler, but I can&rsquo;t  stand those sisters of his. His wife I have never met. But those old Schuyler  women get on my nerves. So you look after them. You&rsquo;re more of a ladies&rsquo; man  than I am, so you go there and talk pretty when they want legal advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  willing,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care such a lot for the sisters myself, but Mrs.  Schuyler is a young thing, ignorant of her own rights, and those old maids boss  her like fury. I&rsquo;m going to see that she has her own way in some few things, at  least. She inherits half the fortune, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and the sisters a quarter each. That is, after some minor bequests and  charitable donations are settled. Schuyler was a good sort&mdash;as men go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  men go pretty badly! He was a brute to his wife; I&rsquo;ve been told he ruled her  with a rod of iron, and what he didn&rsquo;t bother her about, the old sisters did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  neither here nor there. Don&rsquo;t you try to be a peacemaker in that family. I know  those two old ladies, and they&rsquo;d resent anything in the way of criticism of  their treatment of their sister-in-law. And, if Schuyler didn&rsquo;t treat his wife  handsomely, she&rsquo;s rid of him now, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a cold-blooded thing, Bradbury,&rdquo; I informed him, &ldquo;and I am going to do all I  can for that young widow. She&rsquo;ll have a lot of unpleasant publicity at best,  and if I can shield her from part of it, so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Calhoun. Do what you like, but don&rsquo;t get in on the detective work. I  know your weakness for that sort of thing, and I know if you begin, you&rsquo;ll  never let up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bradbury  was right. I have a fondness for detective work&mdash;not the police part of it, but  the inquiry into mystery, the deduction from clues and the sifting of evidence.  I had no mind to miss the inquest, and I had a burning curiosity to know what  had become of Vicky Van. This was not only curiosity, either. I had a high  respect and a genuine liking for that little lady, and, as Mrs. Reeves had put  it, I was only too willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.</p>
  <p>Though  I couldn&rsquo;t feel any real doubt that she had killed Schuyler. As Bradbury said,  she didn&rsquo;t know a Mr. Somers, but she may have known the millionaire Schuyler.  I had never seen anything of a seamy side to Vicky&rsquo;s character; but then, I  didn&rsquo;t know her so very well, and the man was dead, and who else <i>could</i> have killed him?</p>
  <p>I  went around to the caterer&rsquo;s on my way uptown that afternoon, and asked him as  to the reliability of Luigi and the probable truth of his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  man,&rdquo; Fraschini told me, &ldquo;is as honest as the day. I&rsquo;ve had him longer than any  of my other waiters, and he has never said or done anything to make me doubt  his accuracy. I believe, Mr. Calhoun, that Luigi saw exactly what he said he  saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  he not have been mistaken in the identity of the woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  likely. I&rsquo;ll call him, and you can question him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was what I wanted, to question the waiter alone, and I welcomed the  opportunity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it was Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; was the quiet response of the Italian to my  inquiry. &ldquo;I cannot be mistaken. I had seen her many times during the evening.  I, therefore, recognized the gown she wore, of light yellow gauzy stuff and an  over-dress of long gold bead fringes. I saw her stand above the fallen body,  looking down at it with a horrified face. I saw stains of blood on her gown&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  I interrupted. &ldquo;What part of her gown?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luigi  thought a moment. &ldquo;On the lower flounces, as if her skirts had brushed against  the&mdash;the victim, when she stooped over him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she herself observe these stains?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she looked at them, and looked frightened and then she ran to the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saw no other person near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  heard nobody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard only the voices from the parlor. There was much noise of laughter and  talk there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No  amount of questioning could change or add to Luigi&rsquo;s story. It was quite  evident that he was telling just what he saw, and had no interest in coloring  it to make it appear different in any way. He admired Miss Van Allen, he said  she was a pleasant lady and not hard to please if her orders were faithfully  carried out. He expressed no personal interest in the question of her guilt or  innocence, he simply told what he had seen. I didn&rsquo;t altogether like his stolid  indifference, it seemed impossible there should be so little humanity in a  fellow-being, but I knew he was a good and conscientious waiter, and I  concluded he was nothing more.</p>
  <p>I  went home, and, of course, was met by Aunt Lucy and Winnie with a perfect storm  of questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  dinner,&rdquo; I begged. &ldquo;Let me get a little rest and food, and then<br>
    I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  after a few spoonfuls of soup, Winnie declared I was too nervous to eat and I  might as well talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I will,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But, look here, you two. To begin with, I want you to  understand that I&rsquo;m involved in this matter in a business way, and I&rsquo;m also  interested in a personal way. And I don&rsquo;t want any silly talk about it&rsquo;s being  unfortunate or regrettable that I should be. It&rsquo;s a business case, Aunt Lucy,  as far as the settlement of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s estate is concerned, and it&rsquo;s a  personal affair that I&rsquo;m acquainted with Miss Van Allen; and I propose to make  more or less effort to find some trace of that girl, and to see if there is any  possible chance that she may not be the guilty one after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  for you, Lord Chesterton!&rdquo; cried Winnie. &ldquo;I always knew you were the soul of  chivalry, and now you&rsquo;re proving it! What are you going to do&mdash;to find out  things, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know yet, Win. But if you want to help me, you can do a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  she won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;If you have to do these things as a matter of  business, I can&rsquo;t object. But I won&rsquo;t have Winnie dragged into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  dragging, Aunt Lu, and nothing very desperate for Winnie to do.<br>
    But, I&rsquo;d be jolly glad if both of you would just glance out of the<br>
    window occasionally and see if you see anything going on at the Van<br>
    Allen house, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll do that!&rdquo; Winnie cried. &ldquo;Nobody can see me, I&rsquo;ll keep behind our curtains,  and I can see that house perfectly well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean all the time, child. But I do feel sure that Vicky Van will come  back there, and if you glance out now and then, you might see her go in or out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucy, who was becoming interested, in spite of her  scruples.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean to-night, or any night. But in the daytime. She&rsquo;s likely to come, if  at all, in broad daylight, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  the police keeping guard on the house?&rdquo; inquired my aunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the regular patrolman. He passes it every few hours, joggles the doorknob, and  goes on. If Vicky is as clever as I think she is, she&rsquo;ll time that policeman,  and sneak into the house between his rounds. It&rsquo;s only a chance, you know, but  you might see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then I told them all I knew myself of the whole affair. And seeing that I was  deeply into the turmoil of it all, and had grave responsibilities, Aunt Lucy  withdrew all objections and sympathized with me. Also, she was impressed with  my important business connections with the Schuyler family, and was frankly  curious about that aristocratic household. I was asked over and over again as  to their mode of living, the furniture and appointments of the house, and the  attitudes of the widow and the sisters toward each other.</p>
  <p>It  was late in the evening before I remembered some important papers Mr. Bradbury  had given me to hand to Mrs. Schuyler, and as soon as I thought of them I  telephoned to know if I might then bring them over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  came back Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s soft voice. &ldquo;I wish you would. I want to consult you  about some other things also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  interview was less trying than that of the morning had been. Several matters of  inheritance, insurance, and such things were discussed, and Mrs. Schuyler was  more composed and calm.</p>
  <p>She  looked better, too, though this was doubtless due, in part, to the fact that  she wore a white house dress which was far more becoming than black to her  colorless face and light hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, at length, &ldquo;whether what I want to say should be said to  you or to the detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me first,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I may be able to advise you. In any case, it will be  confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are kind,&rdquo; she said, and her grateful eyes smiled appreciatively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this. I&rsquo;d  rather not have that&mdash;that Miss Van Allen traced, if it can be prevented in any  way. I have a special reason for this, which I think I will tell you. It is,  that, on thinking it over I have become convinced that my husband must have  known the young woman, and the acquaintance was not to his credit. For some  reason, I think, she must have forbidden him the house, and that is why he went  there under an assumed name. Mr. Lowney succeeded in getting Mr. Steele on the  long distance telephone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  where is Steele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Chicago. Mr. Lowney says that he had to go there on the midnight train, and  that is why he left the lady&rsquo;s house&mdash;Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s house, so suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?  Well, I am surprised. But, go on, what else did Steele say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said that Mr. Schuyler was with him at the club, and that he, Mr. Steele, said  he was going to Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s party and Mr. Schuyler begged him to take him  along, and introduce him as Mr. Somers. It seems he had asked Mr. Steele before  to do this, but this time he was more insistent. So Mr. Steele did it. Of  course, Mr. Calhoun, I asked Mr. Lowney minutely about all this, because I want  to know just what circumstances led up to my husband&rsquo;s going to that house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, Mrs. Schuyler, you have every right to know. And did Steele say that  was Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s first visit there or merely his first visit as Mr. Somers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Steele thought Mr. Schuyler had never been to the house before at all. But may  he not have been mistaken? May not Mr. Schuyler have known the lady  previously&mdash;oh, it is such a moil! But, in any case, Mr. Calhoun, it seems to me  that further probing and searching will only pile up opprobrium on the name of  Schuyler, and&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it. I am so unused to notoriety or publicity I can&rsquo;t  face all the unpleasantness that must follow! Do help me to avoid it, won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly will, if I can. But I fear you ask the impossible, Mrs. Schuyler. The  law will not be stopped in its course by personal inclinations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I suppose not. What is it, Tibbetts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last question was addressed to her maid, who appeared at the doorway. The  sad-faced woman looked at her mistress with a mingled air of deference and  commiseration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  telephone, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I said you were busily engaged, but it is some  young woman who begs to speak to you a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler excused herself and left the room, and Tibbetts, smoothing down her  trim white apron, followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  would-be secretary,&rdquo; my hostess said, as she returned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how a  report that I wanted one travelled so quickly, but I&rsquo;ve had three offered since  noon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  the Schuyler ladies still object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  at least, they are willing. But I don&rsquo;t want any except a capable one. Not so  much experienced, as quick-witted and intelligent. You may as well know, Mr.  Calhoun, since you are to look after my affairs, that my late husband was of  strictly plain habits. He was almost frugal in his ideas of how little  womankind should be indulged in any luxuries or unnecessary comforts. This did  not incommode his sisters for they were of the same mind. But I desired certain  things which he saw fit to deny me. I make no complaint, I bear his memory no  ill will, but I feel that now I may have some of these things. I am my own  mistress, and while I have no wish to cast any reflection on Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s  management of his own house, yet, it is now my house, and I must have the  privilege of ordering it as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  had come already, then. Ruth Schuyler and her Puritanical sisters-in-law had  met the issue, and Ruth had stood up for her rights. I felt that I knew the  woman well enough to know she would not have taken this stand so soon after her  husband&rsquo;s death except that some discussion or disagreement had made it  necessary for her to assert herself. I bowed in acquiescence, and said, &ldquo;I am  sure, Mrs. Schuyler, there can be no objection to your doing exactly as you  please. This house is entirely your own, half Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s fortune is yours,  and you are responsible to nobody for your actions. If not intrusive, I will  offer to look you up a suitable secretary. I have a young woman in mind, whom I  think you would like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not easy to please,&rdquo; she said, smiling a little; &ldquo;I have a very definite  idea of what I want. Who is your friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a friend, exactly. An acquaintance of my sister&rsquo;s, who is eligible for the  post, if she suits you. Shall I send her round to see you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  please. Your mention of her is enough recommendation. I want, Mr. Calhoun, to  do more or less charitable work this winter. That was another of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s  whims, to attend to all charities himself, and to object to my giving anything  personally. As I shall be quiet and unoccupied this winter, I plan to do some  systematic work in a benevolent way. I know this sounds strange to you, that I  should be planning these things so soon. But the truth is, I do plan them,  purposely, because I don&rsquo;t want to think about the present horror. I need  something to keep my mind from thinking of the awful tragedy or I shall go mad.  It seemed to me not wrong to think about some work that should benefit others; and  to do this, will give me an outlet for my energies and be helpful to the poor  and suffering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  Schuyler looked almost beautiful as her face glowed with enthusiasm on her  subject. I realized how the nervous, highstrung woman must be torn with agony at  the revelations of her husband&rsquo;s defects and the uncertainty of his honor and  morality, and all in addition to the terrible experiences she was undergoing  and must yet encounter.</p>
  <p>I  went home filled with a desire to help her in every way I could, and though I  went to my room at once, I could not think of sleep. I felt like planning ways  to put the police off the track or finding some method of making them cease  their hunt for Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>I  went down to the library, and sat down for a smoke and a revery. And I sat  there until very late, after two o&rsquo;clock, in fact, without getting any nearer a  plan than I was at the start.</p>
  <p>It  was nearly three, when I concluded that I could sleep at last. I stood by the  front window a moment, looking over at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, across the street,  and a few doors from our own.</p>
  <p>As  I looked at the darkened dwelling, I saw the front door slowly open. There was  no one outside, it was being opened from inside. As I knew the body of Mr.  Schuyler had been taken away, and the house had been deserted by all who had  been there, and that it was in custody of the police, I looked curiously to see  what would happen next.</p>
  <p>Out  of the door came a slight, small figure. It was, I felt positive, Vicky Van  herself! I couldn&rsquo;t mistake that sleek, black head&mdash;she wore no hat&mdash;or those  short, full skirts, that she always wore. She looked about cautiously, and then  with swift motions she unlocked the letter-box that was beside her front door,  took out several letters, relocked the box and slipped back into the house  again!</p>
  <p>Without  stopping to think I opened my front door, and flew across the street. Mounting  her steps, I rang the doorbell hard. There was no response, and I kept on  ringing&mdash;a veritable bombardment. Then the door opened a very little bit&mdash;I could  see it was on a night-chain&mdash;and Vicky&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;Please go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t let you come in. Go away, <i>please.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then the door closed, in my very face, and though I pleaded,<br>
  &ldquo;Vicky, <i>do</i> let me in!&rdquo; there was no response.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    The Social Secretary</b></h2>
  <p>I  stood staring at the closed door. What did it mean? Why was Vicky in there and  why wouldn&rsquo;t she let me come in?</p>
  <p>Then,  as I collected my wits, I laughed at myself. I knew why she was there&mdash;to get  her mail. Doubtless there were important letters that she must have, and she  had dared discovery to come at dead of night to get them. The patrolman was not  in sight. She had looked out for this, of course. It was the merest chance that  I had seen her, otherwise she would have escaped all observation. At three in  the morning there are almost no people abroad in the quieter streets of the  city, and Vicky had timed her visit well. Of course, she had her own keys, and  I felt sure she had stealthily entered at the basement door, and waited her  time to secure the letters from the mail-box.</p>
  <p>I  looked at the mail-box, an unusual appendage to a private residence, but Vicky  was away from home so much, it was doubtless necessary. I tried to look in at a  window, but all shades were down and there were no lights inside. I wanted to  ring the doorbell again, but a sense of delicacy forbade me. I was not a  detective, and if I persisted, I might attract the attention of a passer-by or  of the returning policeman, and so get Vicky into all sorts of trouble. I wasn&rsquo;t  tracking the girl down. If she was a criminal, let the police find her, I had  no desire to aid their efforts, but I did want to see Vicky Van. I wanted to  offer her my help&mdash;not in escaping justice, exactly&mdash;but I wondered if I mightn&rsquo;t  do some little errands or favors that would show my friendliness.</p>
  <p>I  went slowly toward home, when I had an inspiration. Hastening into my own  house, I flew to the telephone and called Vicky&rsquo;s number, which I knew well.</p>
  <p>I  waited some time for a response, but at last I heard Vicky&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;Who is  it, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  impulse of protection for her, not for myself, led me to withhold my name. Nor  did I speak hers.</p>
  <p>I  said, &ldquo;This is the man who just left your house. I called up to offer help, if  I can render you any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  good of you,&rdquo; she returned, in a heartfelt way. &ldquo;I appreciate such kindness,  but you can do nothing&mdash;nothing, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least, talk to me a few minutes. I&rsquo;m so anxious about you. You are not  implicated in the&mdash;in the matter, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me,&rdquo; she murmured, in such a serious voice, that my heart sank. &ldquo;What I  did&mdash;or didn&rsquo;t do&mdash;must always remain a mystery. I cannot tell you&mdash;anything. Don&rsquo;t  ask. And, if you would help me, try your best to have inquiries stopped. Can  you do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear not. But can&rsquo;t I see you&mdash;somewhere&mdash;and we can talk plainly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you do believe in me? Do you hold me blameless?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated at this. I couldn&rsquo;t lie to her, nor could I rid my mind of the  conviction of her guilt I said, &ldquo;I will, if you assure me that is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute. Did you know the expected guest was coming under an assumed name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know any Somers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know&mdash;the real man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had met him once, at a dance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you like him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  neither liked nor disliked. He was an object of utter indifference to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  You can never know. I can&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t. Please believe I want to befriend you.&rdquo; The agony and fear in Vicky&rsquo;s  voice thrilled me, and I desired only to shield and protect her. She was so  young and alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is good to have a friendly voice speak to me. But you can only forget me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  let me do something definite. Some errand of trust, some matter of confidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean it? Will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gladly!  What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  if you will collect my mail from the box at the door, after a few days&mdash;say,  three days&mdash;and put it aside for me. You saw me get it to-night, I suppose, and  it is a dangerous thing for me to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you&mdash;I mean, where are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask. I am safe. I see the newspapers and I know I am to be hunted down. So I  must hide. I cannot face the inquiries&mdash;I fear arrest and&mdash;and punishment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  tones betrayed guilty fear, and I shuddered at the confirmation of my  suspicions. But I would do what I could for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  shall I get your letters?&rdquo; I asked, and I honestly tried not to disclose my  sudden knowledge of her guilt. But her quick ears caught my changed inflection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe me guilty!&rdquo; she said, and she stifled a sob. &ldquo;Yet, still, you will help  me! God bless you! Listen, then, for I must stop this talking, it is too  desperately dangerous. I will leave the key of the mail box&mdash;no, I will send it  to you by mail, that will be the safest. Then will you get the letters and put  them&mdash;where shall I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  mail them to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that would never do. You can get into this house, can&rsquo;t you? The police will  let you in at any time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I can probably manage that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  bring them with you, all of the three days&rsquo; mail at once, you understand, and  put them in that great Chinese jar, in the music room. The one with the gold  dragon on the cover. No one will look there for them. I will manage to come and  get them very soon. Please don&rsquo;t spy on me, will you, Chester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  use of my first name was, I knew, inadvertent and unconscious. It thrilled me.  There was a marvellous fascination always about Vicky Van, and now, at the end  of this my mysterious night telephone conversation, I felt its thrill and I  agreed to her plea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear,&rdquo; I said, and not till afterward did I realize the term I had used, &ldquo;I  will not spy. But promise me that you will call on me for any help you may  need. And tell me&mdash;are you alone or is Julie with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie  is with me,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;She helps protect me, and with your friendship,  too, I am blessed indeed. But this is good-bye. I shall leave New York in a few  days never to return. I must have that mail, or I would go at once. If you will  help me get that, you will do all there is left for any one to do for me in the  world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  tone frightened me. &ldquo;Vicky!&rdquo; I cried, forgetting all caution. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;my dear,  don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; but I could not put in words the fear that had suddenly come to me, and  even as I stammered for speech, the click came that told me she had hung up the  receiver.</p>
  <p>I  cursed myself for my stupidity in speaking her name. Such a blunder! Why, it  might have been overheard by anybody on the line. No wonder she left me.  Doubtless I had driven her from her house.</p>
  <p>I  flew to the window. Then I remembered I had promised not to spy, and I turned  quickly away. If she were about to disappear silently and stealthily from that  house, I must not know it.</p>
  <p>I  went to my room, but not to sleep. Clearly, I was not to know untroubled slumber  again very soon. I sat up and thought it all over.</p>
  <p>How  strange that I should have &ldquo;spied&rdquo; on her just at the moment she was secretly  getting her letters. But, I realized, I had looked at the house so often it  would be stranger still if I had missed her!</p>
  <p>And  she was to send me her box key, and I was to secrete her letters for her.  Important indeed, those letters must be, that she should go to such lengths to  get them. Well, I had constituted myself her knight errant in that particular,  and I would fulfil the trust.</p>
  <p>Beneath  the thrilling excitement of the night&rsquo;s occurrence, I felt a dull, sad  foreboding. All Vicky had said or done pointed to guilt. Had she been innocent,  she would have told me so, by word or by implication. She would have given me a  tacit assurance of her guiltlessness, or would have cried out at the injustice  of suspicion.</p>
  <p>But  none of these things entered into her talk, or even into her voice or  intonations. She had sounded sad, hopeless, despairing. And her last words made  me fear she contemplated taking her own life.</p>
  <p>Poor  little Vicky Van. Light-hearted, joy-loving Vicky. What was the mystery back of  it all? What could it be? Well, at least, I would scrupulously perform the task  she had set me, and I would do it well. I knew I could manage to get into the  house by making up some story for the police. But I must wait for the promised  key.</p>
  <p>With  a glimmer of hope that the mailed parcel containing the key might give me a  clue to Vicky&rsquo;s whereabouts, I at last went to sleep.</p>
  <p>Next  morning at breakfast I said nothing of my night experiences. I told Winnie,  however, that she needn&rsquo;t watch the Van Allen house, as I had heard that Vicky  had left it permanently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However  could you hear that?&rdquo; exclaimed my wideawake sister. &ldquo;Have you had a wireless  from the fugitive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  of the sort,&rdquo; I said, smilingly. &ldquo;And now, listen here, Win. How do you think  that friend of yours, Miss Crowell, would like to be a social secretary for  Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d  love it!&rdquo; cried Winnie. &ldquo;Does Mrs. Schuyler want one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and she wants her mighty quick. From what you&rsquo;ve said of the Crowell girl, I  should think she&rsquo;d be just the one. Can you get her on the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but not so early as this. I&rsquo;ll call her about ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, you fix it up. I expect Mrs. Schuyler will pay proper salary to the  right secretary. Of course, Miss Crowell is experienced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; assured Win, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll love to go. Why, any secretary would be  glad to go there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  just now, I should think,&rdquo; observed Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;The amount of work there must  be something fearful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be heavy, for a time,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;but it is only for Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s  personal correspondence and business. I mean, the other two ladies would not  expect to use her services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Winnie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it up with Edith Crowell, and if she can&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll  ask her to recommend somebody. Shall I send her there to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as soon as she will go. And let me know&mdash;telephone the office about noon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo;  Winnie promised, and I went away, my head in a whirl with the various and  sundry matters I had to attend to.</p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t think I thought of the secretary matter again, until at noon, Winnie  telephoned me that it was all right. I thanked her, and promptly forgot the  episode.</p>
  <p>And  so it was, that when I reached home that night, I had one of the surprises of  my life.</p>
  <p>Winnie  came to dinner, smiling, and rather excited-looking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up, Infant?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Have you accepted a proposal from a nice college lad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;  and Win&rsquo;s head tossed. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll open your eyes when I tell you what I  have accepted!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it out, Angel Child. Relieve your own impatience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if you please, I have accepted the post of social secretary to<br>
    Mrs. Randolph Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Winifred  Elizabeth Calhoun! You haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I&rsquo;d arouse some slight interest,&rdquo; she said, and she calmly went on with  her dinner.</p>
  <p>I  looked at Aunt Lucy, who sat with a resigned expression, toying with her unused  oyster-fork.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does she mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has done just what she says,&rdquo; replied Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;But only for a few days. Miss  Crowell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me tell!&rdquo; interrupted Winnie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my party! You see, Chet, Edith Crowell is  wild to have the place, and is going to take it, but she can&rsquo;t go until the  first of next week. And she doesn&rsquo;t want to lose the chance, so I went over and  told Mrs. Schuyler about it. And then as she was simply swamped with letters  and telegrams and telephones and callers, and goodness knows what all, I  offered to help her out till Edith can get there. And she was so grateful&mdash;oh, I  think she is a darling. I never saw anyone I liked and admired so much at first  sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is charming,&rdquo; I conceded, &ldquo;but what a crazy scheme, Win! How did you persuade  Aunt Lucy to agree?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  managed her,&rdquo; and Winnie bobbed her wise young head, cannily.</p>
  <p>It  came to me in a moment. Though not exactly a tuft hunter, Aunt Lucy was deeply  impressed by real grandeur and elegance. And it came to me at once, that Winnie&rsquo;s  tales of the great house and the aristocratic people, had a strong influence on  our aunt&rsquo;s views and had brought about her permission for Win to go there for a  few days. And it was no harm. It wasn&rsquo;t as if Winnie were a regular secretary,  but just to hold the place for Miss Crowell, was simply a kindly deed.</p>
  <p>And  so, after dinner, I settled myself in our cosy library for a comfortable smoke,  and bade Winnie tell me every single thing that had happened through the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it was thrilling!&rdquo; Winnie exclaimed. &ldquo;Part of the time I was at the desk in the  library, and part of the time upstairs in Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s very own room. She  was so kind to me, but she is nearly distracted and I don&rsquo;t wonder! The  undertakers&rsquo; men were in and out, and those two old maids&mdash;his sisters, you  know&mdash;were everlastingly appearing and disappearing. And they don&rsquo;t like Mrs.  Schuyler an awful lot, nor she them. Oh, they&rsquo;re polite and all that, but you  can see they&rsquo;re of totally different types. I like Mrs. Schuyler heaps better,  but still, there&rsquo;s something about the old girls that&rsquo;s the real thing. They&rsquo;re  Schuylers and also they&rsquo;re Salton-stalls, and farther back, I believe they&rsquo;re  Cabots or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Schuyler, what is she?&rdquo; I asked, as Win paused for breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Nothing particular, I guess. Oh, yes, I learned her name was  Ellison before she was married, but the sisters don&rsquo;t consult her about family  matters at all. They do about clothes, though. And she knows a lot. Why, Chess,  she&rsquo;s having the loveliest things made, if they <i>are</i> mourning, and the  sisters, they ask her about everything they order&mdash;to wear, I mean. And, just  think! Mrs. Schuyler never wears any jewels but pearls! It&rsquo;s a whim, you know,  or it was her husband&rsquo;s whim, or something, but anyway, she has oceans of  pearls, and no other gems at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she tell you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but it came in the conversation, you know. She is no boaster. No sir-ee! She&rsquo;s  the modestest, gentlest, sweetest little lady I ever saw. I just love her!  Well, I answered a lot of letters for her, and she liked the way I did it, and  she liked me, I guess, for she said she only hoped Miss Crowell would suit her  as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows you&rsquo;re my sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. But that isn&rsquo;t why she likes me, old bunch of conceit! Though, I must  admit, she likes you, Chet. She said you were not only kind, but you have a fair  amount of intelligence&mdash;no, she didn&rsquo;t use those words, exactly, but I gathered  that was what she meant. The funeral is to be tomorrow evening, you know. I had  to write and telephone quite a good deal about that, though the sisters tended  to it mostly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there much said about&mdash;about the actual case&mdash;Winnie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean about the murder?&rdquo; Win&rsquo;s clear eyes didn&rsquo;t blink at the word; &ldquo;no, not  much in my hearing. But Mrs. Schuyler wasn&rsquo;t in the room all the time. And I  know Mr. Lowney&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he the detective?&mdash;was there once, and I think, twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  some of the servants. Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s own maid, her name is Tibbetts, is the  sort you read about in English novels. A nice, motherly woman, with gray hair  and a black silk apron. I liked her, but the maid who looks after the old  sisters, I didn&rsquo;t like so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the maids, tell me more about Mrs. Schuyler. Does she think Vicky Van  killed Mr. Schuyler? Since you&rsquo;re in this thing so deep Win, there&rsquo;s no use  mincing matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say not! Yes, of course, she thinks the Vicky person did the killing.  How could she think anything else? And the two sisters are madly revengeful. As  soon as the funeral is over, they&rsquo;re going to work to find that girl and bring  her to justice! They say the inquest will help a lot. When will that be, Chess?  Can I go to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not, Winnie?&rdquo; This from Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing for you to help  Mrs. Schuyler out in an emergency, but you&rsquo;re not to get mixed up in a murder  trial!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  inquest isn&rsquo;t a trial, Auntie,&rdquo; and Win looked like a wise owl, as she aired  her new and suddenly acquired knowledge. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go, Chess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  see, Infant. Perhaps, if Mrs. Schuyler needs your services she may want you  there with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  in that case&mdash;&rdquo; began Aunt Lucy, but Winnie was off again on one of her  enthusiastic descriptions of the grand ways of the Schuyler household, and Aunt  Lucy was quite willing to listen.</p>
  <p>As  for me, I wanted the benefit of every possible sidelight on the whole business,  and I, too, took in all Winnie&rsquo;s detailed narrations.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    The Inquest</b></h2>
  <p>The  inquest was in progress. In the coroner&rsquo;s courtroom inquiry was being made in  an endeavor to discover who was responsible for the death of Randolph Schuyler.  The funeral of the millionaire had taken place, and the will had been read, and  now the public awaited news of the action of the police in placing the crime  and producing the criminal.</p>
  <p>The  case had become a celebrated one, not only because of the prominence of the  victim, but because of the mystery surrounding the young woman suspected of the  deed of murder.</p>
  <p>Many  voluntary witnesses had come forward with additional information regarding  Victoria Van Allen, but none of these knew anything more of her relatives or  progenitors than I did myself.</p>
  <p>Some  of these were asked to testify at the inquest, but more were not so called on,  as their testimony was in no way material or vital.</p>
  <p>I  did not propose to attend all the sessions, myself, but I wanted to hear the  opening queries and learn just how the case was to be managed.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Remson told of his examination of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s body and testified that death  was practically instantaneous as a result of a single stab of the short, sharp  knife. The knife was produced and identified. It had been carefully taken care  of and had been photographed to preserve the faint fingermarks, which were on  its handle, and which might or might not be the prints of the murderer&rsquo;s  fingers.</p>
  <p>The  caterer Fraschini told of his orders for the party supper, and of the sending  of his best and most faithful waiters to attend to the feast.</p>
  <p>Luigi,  the head waiter, again went over his story. I had heard this twice before, but  I listened with deep interest, and I realized, that, granting the truth of his  recital, there was no room for doubt of Vicky Van&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
  <p>I  hadn&rsquo;t of course, told of seeing her take her mail from the box that night, nor  of her talking to me over the telephone. Should absolute law and justice call  for that information, I might give it up, but at present, I was awaiting  developments.</p>
  <p>Vicky  had sent me her mailbox key, and I had received it duly, by mail. It was not  sent by parcel post, nor was it registered&mdash;these would have called for the  sender&rsquo;s address&mdash;but, sent by ordinary first-class letter post, the flat little  key came duly and promptly.</p>
  <p>I  had not used it yet, the time was not ripe until that same night, and I  intended to say nothing of it, until I had fulfilled my promise, if, indeed, I  ever told of it.</p>
  <p>But  Luigi&rsquo;s story as I heard it again made me shiver with apprehension. Surely,  since he saw Vicky right there at the moment, bending over the victim, blood  stains on her gown, there could be no loophole of innocence. Had the murderer  been some one else, and had Vicky known it, she must have made an outcry&mdash;must  have accused the guilty party. There was no one whom Vicky loved well enough to  wish to shield. And, too, the guests were all in the big living-room; there was  no one unaccounted for. If Luigi himself, or any of the caterer&rsquo;s men had by  chance done the deed, Vicky wouldn&rsquo;t have run away! There was no sense in that.  So I could see no possible theory but that of Vicky&rsquo;s actual guilt. Why she did  it, was another story. She may have known Schuyler before, might have known him  a long time, might have had her own reasons for wishing him dead; but all that  was outside the issue of her criminality. There was no eyewitness of the  stabbing itself, but Luigi&rsquo;s presence on the scene an instant later, left no  room for question as to the hand that had held the knife.</p>
  <p>The  jury seemed to think this. Gravely the men listened to what the<br>
    Italian told, and their faces showed what they believed.</p>
  <p>Then  came the guests of the party. One after another, they told the same story. All  knew Vicky fairly well, as a pleasant acquaintance; all liked her as a good  friend; all enjoyed her as a delightful hostess; and many told individual  instances of Vicky&rsquo;s kind heart and helping hand. Not infrequently had she lent  assistance, both financial and in other ways, to these friends of hers. Never,  they all said, had they known her to do a mean or deceitful act or to say an  unkind or malicious word.</p>
  <p>The  men spoke of her as a gay, light-hearted butterfly girl, who was a coquette,  but who stopped short of a real flirtation; the women gave her such  commendation as is rarely given them to their own sex, and declared that Miss  Van Allen was a simple, kindly, generous nature without a trace of the  disposition which causes a woman to be dubbed a <i>cat</i>.</p>
  <p>Norman  Steele was present. He explained his sudden departure from the party by the  fact that he had to catch an owl train for Chicago. He said, further, that  Randolph Schuyler had asked him to take him around to Vicky Van&rsquo;s, as he wanted  to meet her. But he had asked Steele, especially, to introduce him as Mr.  Somers. He had given no reason for this, and Steele had thought little of it.  Randolph Schuyler was a man whom his friends obeyed, often without question. I  understood this. Steele was no more of a toady to the millionaire than most men  would be; but a request of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s was not to be thoughtlessly  refused, so Steele acquiesced.</p>
  <p>He  was reticent in further dilating on Schuyler&rsquo;s character. Said he often called  on ladies who could not be called exclusive, but denied knowledge of definite cases  or names.</p>
  <p>On  the whole, Steele&rsquo;s evidence didn&rsquo;t get us anywhere. We already knew that  Schuyler had gone to Vicky Van&rsquo;s under an assumed name. The reason for this had  little, if anything, to do with what had followed. A connection of some sort,  between Vicky and Mr. Schuyler must be traced, in order to arrive at her  possible motive. A woman does not stab to kill a chance guest whom she has  never met before!</p>
  <p>Bert  Garrison came next. His talk ran mostly to eulogies of Vicky. The poor fellow  was dead in love with her, and had been for many moons, but though Vicky  favored him more than some others, yet she gave him no definite encouragement,  as he himself ruefully admitted. But he made a desperate effort to show that a  girl of Victoria Van Allen&rsquo;s high character and fine qualities would be  incapable of a base deed.</p>
  <p>The  coroner smiled a little at Garrison&rsquo;s vehemence, and let him run on for a time,  in praise of the absent Vicky.</p>
  <p>At  last, he said, &ldquo;And, why, then, Mr. Garrison, in your opinion has<br>
    Miss Van Allen disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  disappearance is not of her own volition,&rdquo; declared Garrison; &ldquo;she has been  taken away by somebody and held against her will, in order to make her appear  guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a new theory. I might have given it serious consideration had I not had  speech with the girl herself. It couldn&rsquo;t be that Vicky was held captive, since  she was at her own house two nights after the crime. But I could see that the  jury, and even the coroner and detectives were interested in this idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whom could she possibly, or theoretically, he thus held?&rdquo; the coroner asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. But assuming some intruder effected an entrance and stabbed Mr.  Schuyler, if surprised during or after the act by the sudden appearance of Miss  Van Allen in the dining room, he might in some way have gotten her out of the  house, and still be keeping her in a hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was perhaps, a possibility, but I didn&rsquo;t see how any intruder could do all  that, without being seen by the waiters. Unless, perchance, the waiters had  been bribed to silence. And that, in the face of Luigi&rsquo;s earnest, and  convincing testimony, I could not believe.</p>
  <p>It  was a fantastic theory, evolved in the brain of Garrison, for the purpose of  diverting suspicion from Vicky Van. However, it seemed to impress the coroner,  and he made notes as he dismissed the witness.</p>
  <p>Cassie  Weldon added one bit of new information. She said, though with evident  reluctance, that she had caught a mere glimpse of somebody running upstairs,  just before the waiter had come to call for help.</p>
  <p>Cassie  had not wanted to testify at all. As she had intimated to me, it was  detrimental to her work as a concert singer to be mixed up in this affair. But  since she had to give her testimony, she apparently felt it her duty to tell  the whole truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could you see the stairs from the living-room?&rdquo; asked the interested coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was near the door, and though I was not looking out into the hall, I had a  vague, fleeting impression of somebody running upstairs. I paid no attention to  it, of course, but I am sure somebody did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man or a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman. That is, I was conscious of a flutter of skirts, but I am not sure it  was Miss Van Allen. I didn&rsquo;t see her clearly enough even to notice the color of  her gown. It was merely a glimpse of some one flying round the newel post and  up the stairs. It might have been a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, if there were some intruder, it may have been a woman, and not a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I tell you. I can only say I know somebody ran upstairs. Further  than that, I&rsquo;ve no idea concerning it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must have been Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; said the coroner, decidedly; &ldquo;had it been any  other woman, and had she stabbed Mr. Schuyler, Miss Van Allen would not have  disappeared. Now, if this woman who ran upstairs was Miss Van Allen, she  effected an escape from the upper stories. Is there a skylight exit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No  one seemed to know, as no one had thought of Vicky Van leaving her house by  such means.</p>
  <p>But  to me, the idea was ridiculous. A girl, in elaborate evening gown, clambering  out of a skylight trap-door, to where? Not to a neighbor&rsquo;s, for Vicky Van knew  none of the nearby residents. I had heard her say so, myself. And had she  descended into a strange household, and begged for shelter, it would have  become known before this.</p>
  <p>Well,  anyway, the detective Lowney immediately sent an order to have the skylight  matter looked into and the proceedings went on.</p>
  <p>Ariadne  Gale was closely questioned as to how she knew of the picture in the back of  Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s watch. But she declared that he had shown it to her during  their conversation that evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw the man before,&rdquo; said Ariadne, who unlike Cassie Weldon, rather  enjoyed the publicity of the occasion. &ldquo;I chanced to be about the first girl he  was introduced to, when he came into the house. And we had a chat, and when I  chaffed him a bit on his dignity and awe-inspiring presence, he refuted it by  showing me the picture in his watch. He said it was a little chorus girl he had  taken out to supper the night before. I could see the picture had been merely  tucked in temporarily, it wasn&rsquo;t neatly pasted in, as a watch-case picture  usually is, and then I chaffed him on his fickleness. Our conversation was the  merest foolery, and a moment after, he went over to be presented to Miss Van  Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think they had never met before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure they had not. They looked at each other with the conventional politeness  of strangers, I know Miss Van Allen well, and she is not one to dissemble or  pretend. I am sure she had never laid eyes on that man before. She simply <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have killed him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ariadne&rsquo;s  further evidence amounted to nothing, nor did that of several other of the  party guests who were called on.</p>
  <p>Except  Mrs. Reeves. She knew more of Vicky&rsquo;s home life than any of the rest of us, but  even she knew nothing of the girl&rsquo;s origin.</p>
  <p>She  had first met her at one of Miss Gale&rsquo;s studio parties, and had taken a fancy  to her at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did <i>you</i> first meet her, Miss Gale,&rdquo; the coroner interrupted to ask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  came to my studio to look at my pictures,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She admired them,  and bought one. She was so pleasant and so interested in my work that she came  two or three times, and then I invited her to one of my little studio affairs.  She quickly made friends, and she invited us to her house. I went there first  about two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  did I,&rdquo; Mrs. Reeves resumed. &ldquo;And since then, I have been there frequently, and  every time I saw the girl I liked her better. But she was always a bit of a  mystery. I confess I tried at times, to learn something of her previous life.  But she adroitly evaded my questions, and cleverly changed the subject. I  think, however, from chance hints she let drop, that her home was somewhere in  the Middle West.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  indefinite term,&rdquo; observed Coroner Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did Miss Van Allen go on her frequent absences from her home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I don&rsquo;t know, either. Often she&rsquo;d be away a week, and on her return would tell  of a gay house party down on Long Island or a week-end trip up Westchester way,  but I don&rsquo;t remember any definite place she visited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; piped up Ariadne. &ldquo;She often goes to Greenwich, Connecticut, and to  Bronxville. I&rsquo;ve heard her tell of these trips. She has a wide circle of  acquaintances and, of course, she&rsquo;s a favorite with all who know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a piece of evidence,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Reeves, &ldquo;which I daresay I ought to  exhibit. It is a letter from Miss Van Allen, which I received only this  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  caused a sensation. A letter from Vicky Van! Just received! I found myself  trembling in my shoes. And I asked myself why. Was I afraid the girl would be  caught? Did I want to shield a felon? And I had to admit to myself that I did.  I wasn&rsquo;t in love with Vicky Van, but I had a tremendous interest in her, and I  didn&rsquo;t want that little lone, helpless person haled before a court of justice.  Vicky did seem terribly alone. Hosts of friends she had, but no one who was in  any way responsible for her, or in a position to help her. Well, if she ever  returned, voluntarily or perforce, she would find a friend and champion in one  Chester Calhoun, of that I was certain!</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Reeves handed her letter over to the coroner, and he read it out.<br>
    It ran:</p>
  <p>My  dear Mrs. Reeves: You have always been such a good friend to me that I&rsquo;m  writing you just a line. You are everything that is good and kind, and now I&rsquo;m  going to ask you as a final favor to forget Vicky Van at once and forever. I am  going away and I shall never return. Don&rsquo;t think of me any more hardly than you  must, but if you can keep any loving little memory of the hours we spent  together, I want you to do so. And as a remembrance, I want you to have my  little electric coupe. It is in Rennard&rsquo;s garage, and I have written him to  turn it over to you. I shall miss our happy times together, but&mdash;I can never  come back. Do not worry about me, I am safe. And I am your affectionate Vicky  Van.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure this is from Miss Van Allen?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Reeves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistaking that writing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor  was there. I knew Vicky&rsquo;s penmanship, and it was most peculiar. Never have I  seen such a hand. Angular, slightly backhanded, and full of character, it would  be difficult to imitate it, and, too, no one would have any reason to forge  that letter to Mrs. Reeves. She had verified Vicky&rsquo;s statement, and found that  a letter to the garage owner had instructed him to give up the car to Mrs.  Reeves, and he had already done so, that very morning.</p>
  <p>The  letters had both been mailed in New York the night before, the postmark showing  that they were mailed in the district that included Vicky&rsquo;s residence.</p>
  <p>Was  she, then, even now in hiding near her home? Or, had she sent the letters to be  mailed by some one else? By Julie, perhaps, who, I felt sure, was with her  mistress, wherever that might be.</p>
  <p>My  leaping thoughts took in all this, and by degrees the slower going coroner, put  it in words.</p>
  <p>Lowney,  the detective, bristled with interest. A clue, he had, he thought, but what a  clue! Two letters posted in the city. What did they show of the whereabouts of  the missing girl?</p>
  <p>Lowney  scrutinized the one to Mrs. Reeves. Ordinary paper, such as might be bought in  any stationery or department store, no monogram or initial on it, nor was there  any maker&rsquo;s name under the flap.</p>
  <p>But  a dozen people present testified to Vicky&rsquo;s handwriting, and the coroner  eagerly took possession of the letter.</p>
  <p>Sherlock  Holmes, I thought to myself, would read that letter, look at it through his  good old lens, smell it, and then walk out, and return in a half hour, with  Vicky Van in tow!</p>
  <p>But  for my part, I could see nothing illuminating in that plain paper and envelope,  and the letter in the well-known penmanship.</p>
  <p>All  I gathered was, that wherever Vicky was, she was not only safe but comfortable.  The tenor of the note breathed leisure and composure. Clearly, she was not breathlessly  hurrying from one place to another, or vigilantly eluding pursuit. She was at  ease, with opportunity to indulge in thoughtful kindness to a friend, and to  write at length about herself.</p>
  <p>At  length, yes, but with no hint of her hiding-place nor any clue to it. Poor  little Vicky! She seemed so alone&mdash;and yet&mdash;how did I know? She may have gone to  friends or&mdash;somehow I hated to think that she had any man who was her legal&mdash;or  even willing protector.</p>
  <p>Yet  she said she was safe, and her letter showed no fear of the future. And then  again I was stabbed by the thought that perhaps there was no earthly future for  Vicky Van. I didn&rsquo;t want her to kill herself&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want her to be found and  arrested&mdash;what did I want? I wasn&rsquo;t sure in my own mind, save that I wanted her  safety above all else. I suppose I believed her guilty&mdash;I could believe nothing  else, but even so, I didn&rsquo;t want her brought to bay.</p>
  <p>I  gave my own testimony, which was all true, and all frank, except that I said  nothing of my nocturnal visit to Vicky&rsquo;s house or of our telephone  conversation. If my conscience smote me I combated it with my chivalry, which  would not allow me to betray a woman into the hands of the law.</p>
  <p>The  later witnesses, who were mostly the working people whom Vicky employed by the  day, told nothing of her or of her home life. They all spoke of her as a kind  lady to work for, though, as a rule, they had not seen her, but had been  engaged, directed and paid by the maid, Julie.</p>
  <p>It  seemed to be tacitly assumed that wherever Vicky was Julie was with her. I had  had this information from Vicky herself, but others took it for granted, in the  absence of any reason to think the contrary.</p>
  <p>The  whole day&rsquo;s session, to my mind, achieved little of useful information. Mrs.  Reeves&rsquo; letter proved conclusively that Vicky was aware of the search being  made for her, and showed her determination not to be found. It was Saturday,  and when the inquest was adjourned until Monday morning, I couldn&rsquo;t help  feeling that it might as well have been permanently adjourned, for all the  further conclusions it would lead to.</p>
  <p>I  went home at last, thrilling with the thought that that night I was to get  Vicky&rsquo;s mail from her box and hide it where she had directed. I secretly hoped  she might be in the house herself, waiting for it, but scarcely dared believe  this would be the case.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    A Note From Vicky</b></h2>
  <p>Nor  was it. I had secured a latch-key to the house, from the police, who were  willing enough for me to search for possible clues, as I had told them I would  do.</p>
  <p>At  their wits&rsquo; end to locate Vicky Van, they welcomed my help and felt that as a  friend of hers, I might learn more than a disinterested policeman could.</p>
  <p>So,  well after midnight, watching my chance when the patrolman had just passed on  his regular round, I went across the street.</p>
  <p>Easily  I opened the mailbox and extracted a quantity of letters.</p>
  <p>Quietly,  then, I opened the house door and went in.</p>
  <p>I  had provided myself with a pocket flashlight, as I didn&rsquo;t want to illuminate  the house, and I went at once to the music room, to perform my errand.</p>
  <p>How  strange it seemed! The lovely room, with dainty white and gold furnishings,  reminded me so forcibly of the bewitching girl who owned it all. A thousand  questions rose in my mind. What would become of that bijou residence? The  bric-a-brac and pictures, the rugs and furniture, while not magnificent, were  of the best, and many of them costly. The great Chinese vase, into which I was  to drop the letters was a gem of its kind, though not anything a connoisseur  would covet.</p>
  <p>I  raised the dragon-topped lid, and let the letters fall in. Replacing the lid, I  still lingered. My errand was done, but I felt an impulse to stay. Everything  spoke to me of Vicky Van. Where was she now? Making sure that the opaque blinds  were drawn, I dared to turn on one tiny electric lamp. The faint light made the  shadowed room lovelier than ever. Could a girl of such cultivated tastes and  such refinement of character be a&mdash;a wrong-doer? I couldn&rsquo;t say murderer even to  myself. Then my common sense flared up, and told me that crime is no respecter  of persons. That women who had slain human beings were not necessarily of this  or that walk of life. Granted a woman had a motive to kill a man, that motive  lay in the impulses of her feminine nature, and revenge, jealousy, fear, love  or hate&mdash;whatever the motive, it was of deep and over-powering and might find  its root in equal likeliness in the breast of queen or beggarmaid. I could not  say Vicky was incapable of crime&mdash;indeed, her gay, volatile manner might hide a  deeply perturbed spirit. She was an enigma, and I&mdash;I must solve the riddle. I  felt I should never rest, until I knew the truth, and if Vicky were a martyr to  circumstances, or a victim to Fate, I must know all about it.</p>
  <p>Alone  there, in the midnight hours, I resolved to devote my time, all I could spare,  my energies, all I could command, and my life, so far as I might, to the  discovery of the truth, and I might or might not reveal my findings as seemed  to me best.</p>
  <p>Leaving  the music room, I went back through the long hall, and passed the door of Vicky&rsquo;s  bedroom. Reverently I looked inside. The very walls seemed crying for her to  come back. Would she ever so do? I wandered on through the bedroom, and even  looked in the dressing room. I felt no compunction. It was not from idle  curiosity, rather, I walked as one at a shrine. The exquisitely feminine  boudoir was a mute witness to a love of beauty and art. I used only my  flashlight, but on an impulse, I turned on one light by the side of the long  mirror. I looked in it, as Vicky must often have done when dressing for her  parties, as, indeed, she must have done, when dressing that last fatal night  and seeing my own grim reflection, I gravely nodded my head at myself, and  whispered, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find the truth, old man, you see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the ornate Florentine frame, with its branching arabesques, was a strand of the  gold beads that had adorned Vicky&rsquo;s gown that night. I visualized her, whirling  her skirts about before the mirror, with that quick, lithe grace of hers, and  catching the fluttering fringe in the gilt protuberance. Perhaps she exclaimed  in petulance, but, more likely, I thought, she laughed at the trivial accident.  That was Vicky Van, as I knew her, to laugh at a mischance, and smile  good-naturedly at an accident.</p>
  <p>I  lifted the strand of little beads from the entangling frame, and put it away in  my pocketbook, as a dear and intimate souvenir of the girl I had known. Then,  with a final glance that was a sort of farewell, I glimpsed the pretty, cosy  nest, and went downstairs.</p>
  <p>Here  I paused again. Cassie Weldon had said she could see the staircase from the  door of the living-room. I tried it. She was right. A person standing just  inside the living-room door, could catch sight of a person on the stairs. And,  as Cassie, said, she was not looking that way, but was partly conscious of some  one running up the stairs. It might well be. She would naturally give the  incident no thought at the moment&mdash;it was strange she had even remembered it.  And it may have been Vicky. Then she might have descended by the rear  staircase, there probably was one, I didn&rsquo;t know. And anyway, what mattered it  how she had left the house? She had left it, and had not returned.</p>
  <p>I  remembered the allusion to the skylight. In a jiffy, I had run upstairs clear  to the highest story. There was a skylight, or scuttle, rather, and it was  bolted on the inside.</p>
  <p>That  settled that. Vicky Van had not climbed out that way, and I for one, never  supposed she had.</p>
  <p>Strangely  reluctant to leave the house, I went downstairs again, looked into the  living-room, and passed on to the dining-room. I contemplated the sideboard, in  front of which Randolph Schuyler had met his death. Many pieces of silver and  glass stood upon it, and all was in order, as if it had been carefully looked  after for the party occasion.</p>
  <p>Without  consciously noting details, I chanced to observe that a small silver-handled  carving fork, was lacking its knife. I had no knowledge of Vicky Van&rsquo;s table  appurtenances, but the way the fork lay looked to me as if the knife had lain  across it, and had been removed.</p>
  <p>I  had no concern over it, for I knew the knife that had stabbed Schuyler was now  in possession of the police, and this one had doubtless been used in  preparation of the supper, if indeed, there was a knife belonging to the fork.</p>
  <p>It  was a matter of no moment, but somehow it stuck in my mind. If Vicky or rather,  if Julie had straightened up things on the sideboard in the process of tidying  up for the party, would she not have laid the fork a different way, unless  there had been a matching knife to lay across it? I suppose the whole question  came into my mind, because at home, we had a beefsteak carving set that always  lay crossed on the sideboard. A man gets accustomed to the sight of such  household details, and they photographed on his memory.</p>
  <p>Well,  anyway, I looked for that knife. I even went to the butler&rsquo;s pantry and looked,  but I didn&rsquo;t see it. The pantry had been hastily evacuated by the caterer&rsquo;s  men, and though tidied, it was not in spick and span condition. You see, having  lived so long with two such homey bodies as Aunt Lucy and Win, I was not  utterly unversed in domestic matters. The pantry was well equipped with modern  utensils and implements, and all its appointments spoke of the taste and  efficiency of its mistress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Vicky,&rdquo; I sighed to myself, &ldquo;poor, dear little Vicky Van!&rdquo; and then I went  softly out of the front door and down the steps.</p>
  <p>I  went slowly, and looked back several times, in a vague hope that Vicky might  emerge from some nearby shadow and go into the house for her letters. But I saw  no sign of such a happening, and went on home, my heart full of a gloomy  foreboding that I would never see her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  to work on Sunday, Winnie?&rdquo; I asked, as next morning, my sister appeared,  garbed for the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  regularly to work, but Mrs. Schuyler wants me to look after some matters of  confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho,  how important we are!&rdquo; I chaffed her. &ldquo;When does the Crowell lady come into her  own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for another week. She isn&rsquo;t quite ready to come, and Mrs.<br>
    Schuyler is willing to keep me on a while longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; and I looked at my pretty, bright-faced sister with approval.  &ldquo;I say, old girl, s&rsquo;pose I stroll over with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  along. Though I&rsquo;m not sure Mrs. Schuyler will see you. She usually sends me to  receive callers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Little Miss Manage-It, I could even live through that. And perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a  look-in with the fair sisters-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  surely, if you wish. They&rsquo;re ready and eager to see visitors. I believe they  love to go over the details of the whole affair with anyone who will listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Win, not as bad as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad. They&rsquo;re bound to track down the Van Allen girl, and they  hold the opinion that everybody they get hold of may be an important witness.  They go over the reports from the inquest all the time, and can hardly wait  till tomorrow to see what will come out next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  for them,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a good chat on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went over to the Fifth Avenue house, and were admitted by the solemn and  wise-eyed butler. I was shown to the library, while Winnie was directed to go  to Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>But  it was not long before we were all together in the library&mdash;widow, sisters, and  all, for Lowney had made a discovery and he proposed to tell the family of it.</p>
  <p>Win  and I were allowed to be present, and the detective showed his new find.</p>
  <p>It  seems he had been searching the papers and letters of the late Mr. Schuyler.  This had been not only permitted by the wife, but had been urged by the  sisters, who hoped it might result in some further light on the mysterious Miss  Van Allen. And it did. In the desk, in a secret compartment&mdash;which was not so  secret but that the detective could open it&mdash;were a number of letters from  feminine pens, and a number of receipted bills for jeweled trinkets, presumably  sent to these or other ladies, for they were not of a sort affected by Ruth  Schuyler or the two sisters. A blue enameled watch bracelet, and a rhinestone  tiara were representative purchases entered on these bills.</p>
  <p>But  the pile of letters sank into insignificance, when we learned the fact that  there was a letter from Vicky Van among them!</p>
  <p>Regardless  of Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s feelings, Lowney read the letter aloud.<br>
    This was it:</p>
  <p>My  Dear Mr. Schuyler:</p>
  <p>I  enjoyed your supper party, and it was good of you to give me inside information  about the stocks. But I must beg of you to cease your further attentions to me,  as I cannot number on my list of calling acquaintances the husband of another  woman. I am, perhaps, rather prudish in my view of life, but this is one of my  inviolable rules.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Very  truly yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria Van Allen.</p>
  <p>I  knew that before. Vicky Van, living alone and unchaperoned, save for the  ubiquitous Julie, flouted convention in many ways, but it was as she said, her  inviolable rule to receive no married man without his wife at her parties. Nor  was there often occasion for her to use this stipulation. The young people whom  I had met at her house, had always been maids and bachelors, and now and then,  a young married couple who playfully enacted a chaperon part. Mrs. Reeves, a  widow, was probably the oldest of the crowd, but she was well under forty.</p>
  <p>It  was quite true, no married man, and indeed, no man of the type or age of  Randolph Schuyler, had ever, to my knowledge, enjoyed the friendship of Vicky  Van. But not for a minute, did I think that she would go so far as to kill him  for daring to enter her house! That was unthinkable.</p>
  <p>And  yet, it seemed so to Lowney, and, apparently, to the sisters of the dead man.</p>
  <p>She  declared that the letter proved that Randolph had intruded on her acquaintance,  and she had objected from coyness or coquetry; and that when he persisted, she  was so enraged that she flew into a passion and wilfully ended his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; said Ruth Schuyler, wearily. &ldquo;It seems more to me as if that  letter exculpates the girl. She was quite evidently not in love with my  husband, and she honestly tried to make him understand her scruples. So I can&rsquo;t  think she killed him. I did think so at first, of course, but on thinking  things over, and in the light of this letter, I begin to believe her innocent.  What date does the letter bear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no date,&rdquo; said Lowney, looking at the paper. &ldquo;It was not in an envelope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did it reach my husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course, it came in an envelope, I suppose, but I found none with it. So we  can&rsquo;t tell where it was sent, here or to one of his clubs or to his office  address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  here, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schuyler. &ldquo;Probably to his club. You are quite  welcome to the letter, Mr. Lowney. Make what use you think best of it. If it  serves to establish Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s innocence, I shall be rather glad. But if  it seems to throw further suspicion on her, then justice must be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, it throws suspicion on that woman!&rdquo; declared Miss Rhoda<br>
    Schuyler, with a vindictive glance at the letter in Lowney&rsquo;s hand.<br>
  &ldquo;The hussy, to write to Randolph at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I interposed, unable to stand this unjust speech, &ldquo;Mr. Schuyler must have made  advances to her first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  lured him on. I&rsquo;ve heard you say yourself, Mr. Calhoun, that this<br>
    Van Allen person is a siren, a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  now, Miss Rhoda,&rdquo; I began, but the other sister chimed in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she is! Of course, the wrong was mostly hers. And she killed Randolph, I  know it! Why, the waiter man saw her! Go ahead, Mr. Lowney, hunt her down, and  bring her to account. I never shall sleep peacefully until my brother&rsquo;s death  is avenged! I cannot understand, Ruth, how you can be so indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flush rose to Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s cheek, and, enlightened anew to her husband&rsquo;s  character by that letter, I began to feel a different sort of sympathy for the  widow.</p>
  <p>Randolph  Schuyler had been unfaithful, he had been domineering and tyrannical, and I  knew he had not allowed his wife to have the comforts and luxuries she desired,  although he was enormously wealthy.</p>
  <p>A  social secretary, for instance. Most women of Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s rank in society  had that necessary assistant, yet, during Schuyler&rsquo;s life his wife was  forbidden the favor.</p>
  <p>Winnie  had told me this, and had told me much more, that proved how unjust and unkind  Randolph Schuyler had been. The sisters, too, shared his views, and as a  consequence, the household was run on old-fashioned lines that ill accord with  the ways of to-day.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler had in no way complained, Win told me, but it was easily seen how  matters stood. It fell to Winnie&rsquo;s lot to order many things from the  shops&mdash;stationery, mourning apparel, and house needs. These, my sister said,  were ordered with the most perfect taste, but with a lavishness, which was indubitably  unusual to Ruth Schuyler.</p>
  <p>The  sisters exclaimed at the extravagance, but Ruth, though listening politely,  serenely went her own way, and carried out her own plans. In the matter of  fresh flowers, she was like a child, Win said, and she enjoyed the blossoms she  ordered as if she had hungered for them for years. Winnie was growing deeply  attached to her employer, if that word is applicable, and Ruth Schuyler was  fond of Win.</p>
  <p>But  I am digressing. Mrs. Schuyler replied to her sister-in-law&rsquo;s speech by saying,  gently, &ldquo;I am not indifferent, Sarah, but it seems to me we have no real  evidence against the girl, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  real evidence! When she was caught red-handed! Or nearly caught! If that stupid  waiter had had sense enough to jump and grab her, we would have had no search  to make at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be so, Sarah, you may be right. But until you do find her don&rsquo;t condemn her  utterly. From what Mr. Calhoun has told me of her and from the tone of that  letter she wrote to Randolph, I can&rsquo;t make it seem possible that she killed a  man she knew so slightly. And yet, it may be she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  remarked Lowney, &ldquo;the note proves that she had seen Mr.<br>
    Schuyler before, anyway. Then, when he came to her house as Mr.<br>
    Somers, she was naturally annoyed, as she had asked him not to do so.<br>
    And all that is against the girl, I say. But it remains to be seen<br>
    what the coroner&rsquo;s jury will think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll  see it in its true light,&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler. &ldquo;Of course, she was angry  when he came to her house after being forbidden, unless the sly thing wrote the  note just to lure him on, but in any case, she was alone with him, she used the  knife on him and she ran away. What more evidence do you need? Now, to find  her. That&rsquo;s a task I shall never give up or neglect until I&rsquo;ve accomplished it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are right, Rhoda,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;if the girl is guilty. I hope she will be  found, for I&rsquo;m sure the truth could then be learned, whether she is guilty or  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you come, now, Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; said Tibbetts, from the doorway.<br>
  &ldquo;The flowers have arrived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth,  beckoning to Winnie, rose, and the two left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  idiotic,&rdquo; said Sarah, &ldquo;the way she orders flowers! Fresh ones every day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  hasn&rsquo;t she a right to spend her own money as she likes?&rdquo; I defended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  legal right, perhaps,&rdquo; was the retort, &ldquo;but not a moral right to disregard her  husband&rsquo;s wishes so utterly.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    More Notes</b></h2>
  <p>Next  morning at breakfast, there was but one topic of conversation. Indeed, little  else had been talked of for days but the Schuyler case and all its side issues.</p>
  <p>Winnie  held forth at length on the martyrdom Ruth Schuyler had suffered because of the  cruelty of her late husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wasn&rsquo;t really ugly, you know,&rdquo; explained Win, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s glad he&rsquo;s  dead. But he thwarted her in every little way that she wanted to enjoy herself.  They had a box at the opera, and a big country house and all that, but he  wouldn&rsquo;t let her go to matinees or have a motor of her own or buy anything  until he had passed judgment on it. She even had to submit her costume designs  to him, and if he approved the dressmaker made them up. And he wouldn&rsquo;t let her  have fashionable clothes. They had to be plain and of rich heavy materials,  such as the sisters wear. Mr. Schuyler was under the thumb of those two old  maids, and Rhoda, especially, put him up to all sorts of schemes to bother  Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you call her Ruth?&rdquo; I asked, in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she told me I might. She&rsquo;s lovely to me, and I&rsquo;m so glad to do all I can for  her. Honest, Chet, she lived an awful life with that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to see her,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;All you&rsquo;ve said about her,<br>
    Winnie, makes me a bit curious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you shall, Auntie, some time. She&rsquo;s a real friend of mine now, and even after  Edith Crowell goes there as secretary, she says I must often go to see her as  her friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  charming,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;Every time I see her I&rsquo;m more impressed with her gentle  dignity. And I don&rsquo;t know how she can be so decent to those two old women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; agreed Win, as Aunt Lucy asked, &ldquo;Is she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she, Winnie?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she is and she isn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s so colorless, you know. Her hair is that flat ashy  blonde, and she&rsquo;s so pale always. Then her eyes and lashes are so light,  and&mdash;well, ineffective. But her expression is so sweet, and when once in a while  she laughs outright, she&rsquo;s very attractive. And she&rsquo;s such a thoroughbred. She  never errs in taste or judgment. She knows just what to reply to all the queer  letters of condolence that come to her, and just how to talk to the people who  call. And that&rsquo;s another thing. She hasn&rsquo;t any friends of her own age. She  knows only the people who belong to the most exclusive set, and they&rsquo;re nearly  all the age of the old sisters. But Mrs. Schuyler is lovely to them. And in her  soft pretty black gowns she looks a whole lot better than she ever did in the  ones she wore while he was alive. I&rsquo;ve seen them in her wardrobe, and I&rsquo;ve seen  her try on some that she was going to give away, and they&rsquo;re sights! Elegant,  you know, but not the thing for her. Now, that she can select her own, she has  beauties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  certainly must be glad, then, to be freed from such a tyrant,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t you think that!&rdquo; insisted Winnie, earnestly. &ldquo;She may feel, so, &lsquo;way down  in her deepest heart, but she won&rsquo;t admit it, even to herself. And, of course,  no matter how much she didn&rsquo;t love him, she wouldn&rsquo;t want him taken off <i>that</i> way! No, she&rsquo;s perfectly all right, and she mourns that man just as sincerely  as any woman could mourn a man who didn&rsquo;t understand her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at Win in amazement. Little sister was growing up, it seemed. Well, the  experience would do her no harm. Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s influence could work only for  good, and a taste of real life would give a wider outlook than Win could get at  home.</p>
  <p>I  went down to the coroner&rsquo;s courtroom. The inquest was proceeding in its usual  discursive way, and I sat down to listen for a while. The coroner was hearing  reports from detectives who had interviewed the market men and shopkeepers  where Vicky Van had bought wares.</p>
  <p>It  was just what might be expected from any householder&rsquo;s record. Vicky had always  paid her bills promptly, usually by check on a well-known bank. Sometimes, if  the bills were small they were paid in cash. In such case Miss Van Allen  herself or the maid brought the money; if checks, they were sent by mail. The  garage man reported a similar state of affairs. His monthly bills were promptly  paid, and Miss Van Allen had found no fault with his service. She was away from  home frequently, but when at home, she used her motor car often and was kind to  the chauffeur who drove her. This chauffeur told of taking her to the shops, to  the theatre, to friends&rsquo; houses and to picture galleries&mdash;but had never been  directed to any place where a lady might not go.</p>
  <p>The  bank people said that Miss Van Allen had had an account with them for years,  but as their depositors were entitled to confidential dealings they would say  little more. They stated, however, that Miss Van Allen was a most desirable  patron and never overdrew her account or made trouble of any sort.</p>
  <p>There  was nothing to be gleaned from this kind of testimony. We all knew that Vicky  was a good citizen and all this was merely corroboration. What was wanted was  some hint of her present whereabouts.</p>
  <p>Lowney  had tried to get at this by the use of an address book he had found in Vicky  Van&rsquo;s desk. He had telephoned or called on many of the people whose addresses  were in the book, but all said over and over what we already knew.</p>
  <p>Personally,  I felt sure that Vicky was staying with some friend not far from her own house.  It could well be, that somebody cared enough for the girl to hide her from the  authorities. This, however, argued her guilty, for otherwise, a true friend  would persuade her that the wiser course would be to disclose herself to the  public.</p>
  <p>However,  nothing transpired to bear out my opinion, and as the list of witnesses  dwindled, no progress was made toward a solution of the mystery. And so, when  at last, an open verdict was returned, with no mention of Vicky&rsquo;s name, I was  decidedly relieved, but I didn&rsquo;t see how it could have been otherwise.</p>
  <p>I  dropped in at the Schuyler house on my way home. I was beginning to feel on a  very friendly footing there, and, partly owing to Winnie&rsquo;s graphic powers of  narration, I took an increasing interest in Ruth Schuyler.</p>
  <p>As  Win had said, she looked charming, although pathetic in her black robes. She  permitted herself a touch of white at the turned-in throat, and a white flower  was tucked in her bodice. A contrast, indeed, to the severe garb of the  spinster sisters, who looked like allegorical figures of hopeless gloom.</p>
  <p>But  their manner was more of militant revenge, and, having heard the verdict of the  coroner&rsquo;s jury, they were ready to take up the case themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; they called out, as I entered the library, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just the  man we want to see. Now, that the coroner has finished his task, we will take  the matter up. Mr. Lowney, I suppose, will continue the search for Miss Van  Allen, but we fear he will not be successful. So, we have determined to send  for the great detective, Fleming Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stone!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;why, he won&rsquo;t work with the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he can work without them,&rdquo; declared Rhoda, with asperity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard wonderful  stories of that man&rsquo;s success, and we&rsquo;re going to engage him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  very expensive,&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  matter. We&rsquo;re going to find our brother&rsquo;s murderer if it takes every penny of  our fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of this plan, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  not been consulted,&rdquo; she said, with a slight smile. &ldquo;Since Mr. Randolph&rsquo;s  sisters choose to adopt it, I have no reason to object. I know nothing of Mr.  Stone, but if he is really a great detective, he will not condemn that girl  unheard. And if she is proved guilty, of course the claims of justice must be  met. Do you know him, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  personally. I&rsquo;ve often heard of him, and he&rsquo;s a wonder. If you want to find  Miss Van Allen, you can&rsquo;t do better than to get him on the trail. If he can&rsquo;t  find her, nobody can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I say,&rdquo; put in Sarah. &ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t find her, at least we&rsquo;ve the  satisfaction of knowing we&rsquo;ve done all we could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  thought of offering a reward for information of Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; added Rhoda, &ldquo;but  if we&rsquo;re going to get Mr. Stone, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to consult him about  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it would,&rdquo; I judged.</p>
  <p>Just  then Winnie came into the room. She had been writing notes, and she held a lot  of unopened letters in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Ruth,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what do you think! Here&rsquo;s the mail, Jepson just gave it to  me, and there&rsquo;s a letter for you from Miss Van Allen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried everybody at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  declared Winnie, &ldquo;I know the hand, it&rsquo;s the same as was on that letter to Mr.  Schuyler. It&rsquo;s such a queer hand, you can&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  handed all the letters to Ruth, the one she referred to on top.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Schuyler turned pale as she looked at the envelope. I glanced at it, too, and  without doubt, it was Vicky Van&rsquo;s writing.</p>
  <p>It  had been mailed in New York that same morning, and delivered just now, about  five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  open it, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Ruth, as if she shrank from the task.</p>
  <p>I  took it gravely, for it seemed to me to portend trouble for little<br>
    Vicky. Was she giving herself up, or what?</p>
  <p>Win  handed me a letter-opener, and I slit the envelope.</p>
  <p>As  they breathlessly awaited my words, I read:</p>
  <p>To  Mrs. Randolph Schuyler: Dear Madam: It is useless to look for me. To-day I am  leaving New York forever. The mystery of Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s death will never be  solved, the truth never learned. I alone know the secret and it will die with  me. You may employ detectives from now till doomsday but you will discover  nothing. So give up the search, for you will never find Victoria Van Allen.</p>
  <p>There  was a pause as I finished reading. Myself, I was thrilled by a certain phrase  in the letter. Vicky said, &ldquo;the secret will die with me.&rdquo; Again, I felt that  she was intending to bring about her own death, and that speedily. Would we  know it if she did? I was thinking deeply, when Miss Rhoda, spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe that girl means to kill herself, and I should think she would!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you think that?&rdquo; and Ruth looked up with a startled face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  sounds so, and it would be the natural outcome of her remorse at her dreadful  deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she must be guilty,&rdquo; said Winnie, her dear little countenance drawn with  grief, as she studied the letter for herself.</p>
  <p>None  of us said much more. We all were stunned in a way, by this unexpected  development, and had to readjust our theories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Miss Rhoda said, decidedly, &ldquo;I shall consult Mr. Stone, anyway. I&rsquo;ve written  him, and though I&rsquo;ve not mailed the letter yet, I shall send it off to-night.  Then when he comes to talk it over we can see what he says and abide by his  judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a good idea, Rhoda,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler nodded assentingly; &ldquo;I, too, want justice,  and if Fleming Stone thinks he can find Miss Van Allen, let him do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was six o&rsquo;clock then, and Win and I went home, leaving the Schuyler ladies to  their own discussions.</p>
  <p>Ruth  Schuyler&rsquo;s hand lingered a moment in mine, as I bade her adieu, and she said,  wistfully, &ldquo;I wish you would tell me just what you think we had better do. I am  so unaccustomed to judging for myself in any important matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it is wise to get Mr. Stone,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;In any case it can do no harm,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I suppose not,&rdquo; and she gave me one of her rare smiles of appreciation. &ldquo;I am  glad you are looking after us, instead of Mr. Bradbury,&rdquo; she said further, and  I sincerely responded that I was glad, too.</p>
  <p>Another  surprise awaited me at home. On the hall table lay my own mail, and as I picked  it up, and ran the letters over, there was one from Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>I  hastily concealed it from Winnie&rsquo;s sharp eyes, for I had no notion what it  might divulge, and hurried with it up to my own room.</p>
  <p>Impatiently  I tore it open and raced through its contents.</p>
  <p>Dear  Mr. Calhoun:</p>
  <p>Thank  you deeply for attending to my errand. Owing to your kindness I received the  letters I wanted. Now, will you do me one last favor? Come again to the house  tonight, and take a small parcel which you will find in the Chinese jar in the  music room. Keep this for me and if I do not ask you for it within a year,  destroy it unopened. I wish I could be more frank with you, you have proved  yourself such a staunch friend, but I cannot control circumstances and so I must  bear my fate. I do not know what Mrs. Schuyler will think of it, but I have  written her a letter. When you see her, try to make her realize it is useless  to hunt for me. Since I can keep hidden for this length of time, my retreat is  not likely to be discovered. And now, my kindest of friends, good-bye.</p>
  <p>Vicky  Van.</p>
  <p>I  stood, staring at the letter. I read it through a dozen times. Of course, I  would do her bidding, but my heart rebelled at the finality of the lines. I  knew I would never hear from Vicky Van again. As she said, since we hadn&rsquo;t  traced her yet, we never could.</p>
  <p>I  wondered where she could possibly be. And Julie, too. Somebody was shielding  them both. They couldn&rsquo;t be disguised or anything of that sort, for they had  left the house at dead of night, without luggage or&mdash;and I hadn&rsquo;t thought of  this before&mdash;without money! How could they have found shelter, save in some  friend&rsquo;s house?</p>
  <p>Of  course, Vicky could have snatched up a purse as she ran. Perhaps that was what  she flew upstairs for. And then, maybe, she went down the back stairs&mdash;but no,  the waiters must have seen her that way. And Luigi was in the front hall a  moment after Vicky disappeared.</p>
  <p>Aside  from my personal interest, I hated to think I should never know just how she  did get away. For now, I had no hope that Fleming Stone or anyone else could  ever find the girl. She was too canny to be taken, after her successful  concealment so far.</p>
  <p>I  went downstairs after a time, but I said nothing of my letter to<br>
    Aunt Lucy or Win.</p>
  <p>They  were eagerly discussing the latest news, and Aunt Lucy was saying, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve  heard of Mr. Stone, and they do say he&rsquo;s a marvel. I hope he&rsquo;ll find the girl,  if only to learn the mystery of her disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; assured Winnie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about him over there and he&rsquo;s  a wizard! But I think he&rsquo;ll have a long chase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meantime,  what becomes of the house?&rdquo; queried Aunt Lucy. &ldquo;What does,<br>
    Chet? Can anyone go in it who likes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I returned, a little shortly, for I foresaw Aunt Lucy had that absurd feminine  desire to pry into another person&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in charge of the police, and  they won&rsquo;t let anyone in, without some very good reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  you get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose I might,&rdquo; I admitted unwillingly, &ldquo;if I had any business there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do get up some business, Chet,&rdquo; begged Winnie, &ldquo;and get the keys and let Auntie  and me go with you! Oh, do! I&rsquo;d love to see that girl&rsquo;s things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Winnie,  you&rsquo;re positively lowbred to show such curiosity!&rdquo; I exclaimed, angrily&mdash;the  more so, that I had the house key in my pocket at that moment. But I was glad I  had not told them of Vicky Van&rsquo;s letter to me!</p>
  <p>I  waited until well past midnight, and then, after seeing the post patrol pass  Vicky&rsquo;s door, I softly went out of my own house, and across the street.</p>
  <p>I  walked calmly up the steps of Vicky&rsquo;s home, and sadly put the latchkey in the  door&mdash;for the last time. I felt as if I were performing funeral rites, and I  entered and closed the door behind me, softly, as one does in the house of  death.</p>
  <p>I  went up the stairs, in the gloom. It was not black darkness, for a partly  raised blind gave me a glimmer of light from the street. Into the music room I  went, and by my pocket flashlight, I took the lid from the Chinese jar. But  there was no parcel inside!</p>
  <p>Amazed,  I threw the light down into the big vase, but it was utterly empty.</p>
  <p>There  was no use looking elsewhere for the parcel&mdash;I knew Vicky well enough to know  that she would do exactly as she had said. Or, since she hadn&rsquo;t, I was sure  that she would not have left that parcel in any other hiding-place.</p>
  <p>I  put the flashlight back in my pocket, and started downstairs.</p>
  <p>Slowly  I descended, for I still felt a little uncertain what to do. Should I wait for  a short time, or go back home and return again later?</p>
  <p>I  reached the foot of the stairs, and concluded to go home, and then think out my  next step.</p>
  <p>As  I passed the living-room door, I heard a low voice whisper my name.</p>
  <p>I  turned sharply. In the doorway, I could dimly discern a cloaked figure. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  she said, softly, and beckoned to me.</p>
  <p>It  was Vicky Van!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    Fleming Stone</b></h2>
  <p>Vicky  had said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; but it was an unnecessary precaution, for I was too stunned to  articulate. I peered at her in the darkness and then, unable to control my  desire for certainty I flashed my little pocket light on her for an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  she whispered, putting her hands up before her face.</p>
  <p>But  I had seen. It was really Vicky Van, her smooth black hair looped over her  ears, her scarlet mouth, and soft pink cheeks, flushed with excitement of the  moment, and her long dark lashes, which suddenly fell beneath the blinding  flare of the light, all were those of the runaway girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk,&rdquo; she said, hastily, &ldquo;let me do the talking. I want you to help me, will  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I will,&rdquo; and all sense of law and justice fled before the wave of pity  and solicitude for the trembling suppliant who thus appealed to me.</p>
  <p>Her  voice was indistinct and a little hoarse, as if she was laboring under great  mental and nerve strain, and she was so alone, so unprotected, that I couldn&rsquo;t  help promising any assistance in my power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  wasn&rsquo;t any parcel in the big vase,&rdquo; I said, in a low voice, as she seemed to  hesitate about going on with her explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  here it is,&rdquo; and she handed me a little box, &ldquo;Just put it away safely for the  present. And now, this is what I want to ask of you. Don&rsquo;t let them engage that  Mr. Stone, to hunt me down, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  how can I help it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and she sounded so disappointed; &ldquo;I hoped you could persuade Mrs.  Schuyler not to have him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Schuyler doesn&rsquo;t want him, either!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those two sisters  who insist on getting him. And I never could turn their wills, try as I might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  doesn&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler want him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m not sure that she really objects to the plan, but, I mean she didn&rsquo;t seem  as anxious as the other two. You see, little girl, the widow of Randolph  Schuyler isn&rsquo;t so bitter against you as the two sisters are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  good of her,&rdquo; and Vicky&rsquo;s voice was wistful. &ldquo;But, you know I must remain in  hiding&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you were going to leave New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am. And at once. But if that Mr. Stone gets on my trail, he&rsquo;ll find me, as sure  as fate. And so I risked this interview to try to persuade you to use your  influence against his coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; I returned, heartily. &ldquo;But I feel that I ought to tell you that  I doubt my power to dissuade the Schuyler sisters from their determination.  And, too, how did you know they thought of getting him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see all the papers, you know, and in one of them a reporter gave a personal  interview with the Schuyler people, and they hinted at getting that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vicky  sighed wearily, as if her last hope was gone. I was full of questions I wanted  to ask her, but it seemed intrusive and unkind to quiz her. And yet, one thing I  felt I must say. I must ask her what she knew of the actual crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me,&rdquo; I blurted out, &ldquo;who did kill Randolph Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I felt her tremble, and her voice quivered as she whispered back, &ldquo;It must have  been some enemy of his, who got in at the window, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  heart fell. This was the sort of thing she would say if she were herself the  guilty one. I had hoped for a more sincere, even if despairing, answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I must send you away,&rdquo; she breathed in my ear. We were standing just inside the  room, and Vicky held her hand on a chair-back for support. There was the  faintest light from the street, enough for us to distinguish one another&rsquo;s  forms, but no more. Vicky wore a street gown of some sort, and a long cloak. On  her head was a small hat, and a black net veil. This was tied so tightly that  it interfered a little with her speech, I thought, though when I had looked at  her face by my flashlight, the veil had not been of sufficient thickness to  conceal her features at all. I&rsquo;ve often wondered why women wear those  uncomfortable things. She kept pulling it away from her lips as she talked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want my address book,&rdquo; she went on, hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked all over for it,  and it&rsquo;s gone. Did the detective take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he did,&rdquo; I replied, remembering Lowney&rsquo;s search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you get it back for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, child, what do you think I am? A magician?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I thought you could manage somehow to get it,&rdquo; her voice showed the  adorable petulance that distinguished Vicky Van; &ldquo;and then, you could send it  to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  I cried, eagerly. &ldquo;Where shall I address you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you that. But you can bring it here and leave it in the<br>
    Chinese jar, and I will get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you come in and go out of this house without being seen?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;By  the area door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  so,&rdquo; and she spoke lightly. &ldquo;And perhaps by a window, and maybe by means of an  aeroplane and down through the skylight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the skylight is fastened on the inside, and has been ever  since&mdash;ever since that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then I don&rsquo;t come that way. But if you&rsquo;ll get that book and put it in the big  vase, I&rsquo;ll come and get it. When will it be there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  crazy to think I can get it,&rdquo; I returned, slowly, &ldquo;but if I can I will. Give me  a few days&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week, if you like. Shall we say a week from to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  Monday? Yes. If I can get it at all, I can have it by then. How shall I let you  know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t let me know, for I know now you will get it. Steal it from Mr. Lowney,  if you can&rsquo;t get it otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if Fleming Stone is on your trail, will you come for the book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must,&rdquo; she spoke gravely. &ldquo;I must have the book. It means everything to me. I <i>must</i> have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you shall, if I can manage it. It is your book, it has proved of no value as evidence,  you may as well have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I may as well have it. And now, Mr. Calhoun, will you go, please, or do you  intend to turn me over to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;how can you say such a thing? Of course I&rsquo;ll go, if you bid me. But  let me wait a minute. You know you wrote to Ruth Schuyler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ruth?  Is that one of the old sisters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Ruth is the widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I wrote to her. I didn&rsquo;t know her first name. I wrote because I thought it  was she who is making the desperate search for me, and I hoped I could  influence her to stop it. That&rsquo;s all. I have no interest in Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s  widow, except as she affects my future, but can you do anything by working in  the other direction? I mean can you dissuade Fleming Stone from coming, by  asking him not to? You can bribe him perhaps&mdash;I have money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I doubt if I could do anything like that. But I&rsquo;ll try, I&rsquo;ll try every way I  can, and, if I succeed&mdash;how shall I let you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll know. If he takes up the matter, it will probably get into the papers, and  if I see nothing of it, I&rsquo;ll conclude you succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&mdash;I want to see you again, Vicky&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, you don&rsquo;t. Why, you don&rsquo;t know this minute but what I stabbed that man,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t, Vicky&mdash;tell me you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you that. I can&rsquo;t tell you anything. I am the most miserable girl on  God&rsquo;s earth!&rdquo; and I heard tears in Vicky&rsquo;s voice, and a sob choked her  utterance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  go,&rdquo; she said, after a moment, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more. Please go, and do what  you can for me, without getting yourself into trouble. Go, and don&rsquo;t look back  to see how I make my exit, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I won&rsquo;t do that. Your confidences are safe with me, Vicky, and I will do all in  my power to help you, in any way I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go now,&rdquo; she said, and a gentle pressure of her hand on my arm urged me toward  the door.</p>
  <p>I  went without another word, and neither while in the street, nor after gaining  my own house, did I look back for another glimpse of Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>And  yet, try as I would, maneuver as I might, I couldn&rsquo;t prevent the arrival of  Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p>The  Schuyler sisters were determined to have the great detective, and though Mrs.  Schuyler wasn&rsquo;t so anxious, yet she raised not the slightest objection, and  after some persuasion, Stone agreed to take the case.</p>
  <p>I  was present at his first call to discuss details and was immensely interested  in my first sight of the man.</p>
  <p>Tall,  well-formed, and of a gravely courteous manner, he impressed me as the most  magnetically attractive man I had ever seen. His iron-gray hair and deep-set,  dark eyes gave him a dignity that I had never before associated with my notions  of a detective.</p>
  <p>The  Schuyler sisters were frankly delighted with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you&rsquo;ll run down the murderer of my brother,&rdquo; Miss Rhoda exulted, while  Miss Sarah began to babble volubly of what she called clues and evidence.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone listened politely, now and then asking a direct question and sometimes  turning to Ruth Schuyler for further information.</p>
  <p>As  I watched him closely, it occurred to me that he really paid little attention  to what the women said, he was more engaged in scanning their faces and noting  their attitudes. Perhaps I imagined it, but I thought he was sizing up their  characters and their sympathies, and intended looking up his clues and evidence  by himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first thing to do,&rdquo; he declared, at last, &ldquo;is to find Miss Van<br>
    Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was what I had feared, and remembering my promise to Vicky I said, &ldquo;I think  that will be impossible, Mr. Stone. She wrote she was leaving New York forever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a householder like that can&rsquo;t go away forever,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;she must look  after her goods and chattels, and she must pay her rent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she owns the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  pay the taxes, then. Must sell it, or rent it or do something with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem so,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;And yet, if one is wanted for murder one would  sacrifice household goods and the house itself in order to escape being caught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  and Stone nodded his head. &ldquo;But, still, I fancy she would return for something.  Few women could leave their home like that, and not have some valuables or some  secret papers or something for which they must return. I venture to say Miss  Van Allen has already been back to her house, more than once, on secret  errands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  the man a clairvoyant? How could he know that Vicky had done this very thing?  But I realized at once, that he knew it, not from cognizance of facts, but from  his prescience of what would necessarily follow in such a case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has her keys, of course?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police have charge of the keys,&rdquo; I said, a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; Stone said, impatiently, &ldquo;but there are doubtless more keys than the  ones they have. I should say, that Miss Van Allen took at least the key of one  door with her, however hurried her flight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be so,&rdquo; I conceded. &ldquo;But, granting she has been back and forth on the  errands you suggest, it is not likely she will keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is not. And especially if she learns I am on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could she know that?&rdquo; Ruth Schuyler asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure Miss Van Allen is a most clever and ingenious young woman,&rdquo; Stone replied,  &ldquo;and I feel sure she knows all that is going on. She gets information from the  papers, and, too, she has that dependable maid, Julie. That woman, probably  disguised, can do much in the way of getting information as to how matters are  progressing. You see, I&rsquo;ve followed the case all the way along, and the  peculiarities and unique conditions of it are what induced me to take it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  we offer a reward, Mr. Stone, for the discovery of the hiding place of Miss Van  Allen?&rdquo; asked Rhoda, eagerly. &ldquo;I want to use every possible means of finding  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, Miss Schuyler. Let us try other plans first. But I must enjoin utter  secrecy about my connection with the matter. Not the fact that I am at work on  it, but the developments or details of my work. It is a most unusual, a most  peculiar case, and I must work unimpeded by outside advice or interference. I  may say, I&rsquo;ve never known of a case which presented such extraordinary  features, and features which will either greatly simplify or greatly impede my  progress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what do you mean by that last remark, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; asked Ruth<br>
    Schuyler, who had been listening intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that the absolutely mysterious disappearance of the young woman will  either be of easy and simple solution, or else it will prove an insoluble  mystery. There will be no half-way work about it. If I can&rsquo;t learn the truth in  a short time, I fear I never can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  strange,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Do you often feel thus about the beginning of a case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  rarely, almost never. And never have I felt it so strongly as in this instance.  To trace that girl is not a matter of long and patient search, it&rsquo;s rather a  question of a bit of luck or a slight slip on her part, or&mdash;well&mdash;of some  coincidence or chance discovery that will clear things at one flash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;re depending on luck?&rdquo; exclaimed Rhoda, in a disappointed tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not that,&rdquo; and Stone smiled. &ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m not depending entirely on that. If  luck comes my way, so much the better. And now, please let me see the notes  Miss Van Allen has written.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>None  was available, however, except the one to Ruth Schuyler. For the one to  Randolph Schuyler was in Lowney&rsquo;s possession, and the one I had had from Vicky,  and which was even then in my pocket, I had no intention of showing.</p>
  <p>It  was not necessary, however, for Fleming Stone said one was enough to gather all  that he could learn from her chirography.</p>
  <p>He  studied it attentively, but only for a moment. Then he said, &ldquo;A characteristic  penmanship, but to me it only shows forcefulness, ingenuity and good nature.  However, I&rsquo;m not an expert, I only get a general impression, and the traits I&rsquo;ve  mentioned are undoubtedly to be found in the lady&rsquo;s nature. Are they not?&rdquo; and  he turned to me, as to one who knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;so far as I know Miss Van Allen. But my acquaintance with her  is limited, and I can only agree superficially.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  eyed me closely, and I began to feel a little uncomfortable under his gaze.  Clearly, I&rsquo;d have to tell the truth, or incur his suspicion. Nor did I wish to  prevaricate. I felt friendly toward poor little Vicky, and yet, I had no mind  to run counter to the interest of Ruth Schuyler. The two sisters I didn&rsquo;t worry  about, and indeed, they could look out for themselves. But Ruth Schuyler was in  a position to demand justice, and if that justice accused Vicky Van, I must be  honest and fair to both in my testimony.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone proceeded to question the women, more definitely and concisely now, and  by virtue of his marvellous efficiency, he so shaped his inquiries, that he  learned details with accuracy and rapidity.</p>
  <p>It  would never have occurred to me to ask the questions that he put, but as he  went on, I saw their pertinence and value.</p>
  <p>With  Ruth&rsquo;s permission he called several of the servants and asked them a few  things. Nothing of moment transpired, to my mind, but Stone was interested in a  full account of where each servant was and what he was doing on the night of  the murder. Each gave a straightforward and satisfactory account, and I realized  that Stone was only getting a sense of the household atmosphere, and its  relations to Mr. Schuyler himself.</p>
  <p>Tibbetts,  the middle-aged maid of Ruth Schuyler, told of the shock to her mistress when  the news was brought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Schuyler had retired,&rdquo; said Tibbetts, &ldquo;at about ten o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Schuyler was  out, and was not expected home until late. I attended her, and after she was in  bed, I went to bed myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  told you do not live here,&rdquo; commented Stone, though in a disinterested way, and  at the same time making notes of some other matters in his notebook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a room around on Third Avenue,&rdquo; replied Tibbetts. &ldquo;I like a little home of  my own, and when Mrs. Schuyler permits me, I go &lsquo;round there to sleep, and  sometimes I go in the daylight hours. But on that night I happened to be  staying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tibbetts  is rather a privileged character,&rdquo; interposed Ruth. &ldquo;She has been with me for  many years, and as she likes a little place of her own, I adopted the plan of  which she has told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that night you were here?&rdquo; said Stone, to the maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. I slept in Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s dressing room, as I always do when I&rsquo;m here.  Then when Jepson told me the&mdash;the awful news, I awoke Mrs. Schuyler and told  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Stone. &ldquo;I read all about that in the inquest report.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    Walls Have Tongues</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Fleming Stone, after he had learned all he desired from the Schuyler  household, &ldquo;now, if you please, I would like to go over the Van Allen house.  You have the keys, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a latchkey to the street door.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the rooms are not locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t know why exactly, but I hated to have him go through Vicky Van&rsquo;s house.  Of course, it must have been because she had begged me not to let Stone get  into the case at all. But I hadn&rsquo;t been able to prevent that, the two Schuyler  sisters being determined to have him. And I had no desire to impede justice or  stand in the way of law and order, but, somehow or other, I felt the invasion  of Vicky&rsquo;s home would bring about trouble for the girl, and my mind was filled  with vague foreboding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will go with you,&rdquo; announced Miss Rhoda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to see that house from  the first. You&rsquo;ll go, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; and Ruth Schuyler shrank at the idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to see the place where  my husband was killed! How could you think of it? If I could do any good by  going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mrs. Schuyler,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, &ldquo;you could do no good, and I quite  understand why you would rather not go. The Misses Schuyler and Mr. Calhoun  will accompany me, and we will start at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I go?&rdquo; asked Winnie, who had come in recently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy to see that  house. You don&rsquo;t mind my going, do you, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed, child. I&rsquo;m perfectly willing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Stone raised no objection, so Winnie went with us.</p>
  <p>It  was nearly five o&rsquo;clock, full daylight, though the dusk was just beginning to  fall. We went round to Vicky Van&rsquo;s and I opened the door for the party to  enter.</p>
  <p>The  house had begun to show disuse. There was dust on the shining surfaces of the  furniture and on the polished floors. The clocks had all stopped and the musty  chill of a closed house was in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  cried Winnie, &ldquo;what a creepy feeling! And this house is too pretty to be so  neglected! Why, it&rsquo;s a darling house. Look at that heavenly color scheme!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie  had darted into the living-room, with its rose and gray appointments, and we  all followed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  touch anything, Miss Calhoun,&rdquo; cautioned Stone, and Win contented herself with  gazing about, her hands clasped behind her.</p>
  <p>The  Schuyler sisters sniffed, and though they said little, they conveyed the idea  that to their minds the bijou residence savored of reprehensible frivolity.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone lived up to his reputation as a detective, and scrutinized everything  with quick, comprehensive glances. We went through the long living-room, and  into the dining-room, whose pale green and silver again enchanted Winnie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  walls are exquisite,&rdquo; Stone agreed, looking closely at the panels of silk  brocade, framed with a silver tracery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  walls have ears, they must burn at your praise,&rdquo; I said, in an effort to speak  lightly, for Stone&rsquo;s face had an ominous look, as if he were learning grave  truths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walls  not only have ears, they have tongues,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;These walls have already  told me much of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how?&rdquo; cried Winnie, &ldquo;do tell us how you deduce and all that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked hastily at Stone, thinking he might be annoyed by Winnie&rsquo;s volatile  speech.</p>
  <p>But  he said kindly, &ldquo;To the trained eye, Miss Calhoun, much is apparent that  escapes the casual observer. But you can understand that the taste displayed in  the wall decoration, shows a refined and cultured nature. A woman of the  adventuress type would prefer more garish display. Of course, I am  generalizing, but there is much to bear me out. Then, I see, by certain tiny  marks and cracks, that these walls have lately been done over, and that they  were also redecorated another time not long before. This proves that Miss Van  Allen has money enough to gratify her whims and she chooses to spend it in  satisfying her aesthetic preferences. Further, the walls have been carefully  cared for, showing an interested and capable housekeeperly instinct and traits  of extreme orderliness and tidiness. Cleverness, even, for here, you see, is a  place, where a bit of the plaster has been defaced by a knock or scratch, and  it has been delicately painted over with a little pale green paint which  matches exactly. It is not the work of a professional decorator, so reason  tells me that probably Miss Van Allen herself remedied the defect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Winnie, &ldquo;I can see all that myself, now you tell me, but I  never should have thought of it! Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the pictures, which are so well chosen and placed, that they seem part of the  walls, are, as you notice, all figure pieces. There are no landscapes. This, of  course, means that Miss Van Allen is not distinctly a nature lover, but prefers  humanity and society. This argues for the joy of living and the appreciation of  mental pleasures and occupations. No devotee of nature would have failed to  have pictures of flowers or harmonizing landscapes on these walls. So, you see,  to be edified by the tongues of walls, you must not only listen to them but  understand their language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then Stone began taking in the rest of the dining-room&rsquo;s contents. The table,  hastily cleared by the caterer&rsquo;s men, was empty of the china and glass which  they had supplied, but still retained the candlesticks and epergnes that were  Vicky Van&rsquo;s own. These were of plated silver, not sterling, which fact Stone  noted. The lace-trimmed linen, however, was of the finest and most elaborate  sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  unholy waste of money!&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler, looking at the marvellous  monogram of V. V. A. embroidered on the napkins.</p>
  <p>But  I gazed sadly at the table, only partially dismantled, which had been so gaily  decked for Vicky&rsquo;s birthday supper.</p>
  <p>Scanning  the sideboard, Stone remarked the absence of the small carving knife. I told  him I, too, had observed that, and that I had made search for it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ask the caterer&rsquo;s people if they took it by mistake?&rdquo; said the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I admitted, ashamed that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it, and I promised to do so.</p>
  <p>As  Stone stood, silently contemplating the place where Randolph Schuyler had met  his death, I stepped out into the hall. I had no conscious reason for doing so,  but I did, and chancing to glance toward the stairs, I with difficulty  repressed an exclamation.</p>
  <p>For  half-way up the staircase, I saw Vicky Van!</p>
  <p>I  was sure it was no hallucination, I positively saw her! She was leaning over  the banister, listening to what Stone was saying. Suddenly, even as I looked,  she ran upstairs and disappeared.</p>
  <p>Was  she safe? Could she escape? Perhaps by a back staircase, or could she manage to  elude us and slip away somehow?</p>
  <p>Then  I was conscience-stricken. Was I conniving at the escape of a guilty person?  Did I want to do this? I didn&rsquo;t know. Something told me I must tell Stone of  her presence, and yet something else made it impossible for me to do so.</p>
  <p>I  turned back to the dining-room, and Miss Sarah was saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s<br>
    the spot, then, that&rsquo;s where Randolph was killed by that awful woman!<br>
    Mr. Stone you <i>must</i> get her! An eye for an eye&mdash;a life for a life!<br>
    She must pay the penalty of her guilt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Winnie  was listening, and tears stood in her eyes. Like Ruth Schuyler, from whom she  doubtless took a cue, Win wasn&rsquo;t so ready to condemn Vicky Van unheard, as the  two sisters were. She looked steadily at Fleming Stone, as if expecting him to  produce Vicky then and there, and I quivered with the thought of what would  happen if he knew that even at that moment Vicky was under the same roof with  ourselves!</p>
  <p>But  Stone completed his survey of the dining-room, and as a matter of course,  started next up the stairs. I pushed ahead a little, in my eagerness to precede  him, but a vague desire to protect Vicky urged me on. I stood in the upper hall  as the rest came up, and I imagined that Stone gave me a curious glance as he  noted my evident embarrassment.</p>
  <p>But  Winnie dashed into the music room, and the Schuyler sisters quickly followed.  Trust a woman to feel and show curiosity about her neighbor&rsquo;s home!</p>
  <p>Again  Stone examined the walls, but the immaculate white and gold sides of the music  room said nothing intelligible to me, and if they spoke to him he did not  divulge the message. The women exclaimed at the beautiful room, and, as Stone&rsquo;s  examination here was short, we all filed back to Vicky&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
  <p>I  heard no sound of her, and I breathed more freely, as we did not find her in  bedroom or in the boudoir beyond. She had, then, succeeded in getting away, and  trusted to me not to betray her presence there.</p>
  <p>The  boudoir or dressing-room, all pink satin and white enameled wicker called forth  new exclamations from Winnie, and even Rhoda Schuyler expressed a grudging  admiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> beautiful,&rdquo; she conceded. &ldquo;I wish Ruth had come, after all. She loves  this sort of furniture. Don&rsquo;t you remember, Sarah, she wanted Randolph to do up  her dressing-room in wicker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but he didn&rsquo;t like it, he said it was gim-crackery. And the<br>
    Circassian walnut of Ruth&rsquo;s room is much handsomer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is. Ruth has a charming suite. Oh, do look at the dresses!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone had flung open a wardrobe door, and the costumes disclosed, though not  numerous, were of beautiful coloring and design. Winnie, unable to resist the  temptation, fingered them lovingly, and called my attention to certain  wonderful confections.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she wear the night of the crime?&rdquo; Stone asked, and I told him. Having Win  for a sister, I am fairly good at describing women&rsquo;s clothes, and I drew a  vivid word picture of Vicky&rsquo;s gold fringed gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavenly!&rdquo;  exclaimed Winnie, although she had had me describe the gown to her on the  average of twice a day for a week. &ldquo;I wish I could see it! Some day, Chet, I&rsquo;m  going to have one like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fringe?&rdquo;  said Stone, curiously, &ldquo;do women wear fringe nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;But it was a long fringe of gilt beads that really formed  an overdress to the tulle skirt. Stay, I&rsquo;ve a piece of it,&rdquo; and I took out my  pocketbook. &ldquo;See, here it is. I found it caught in those gilded leaves at the  lower corner of the mirror frame&mdash;that long dressing-mirror.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  all looked at the mirror, which hung flat against the wall; its foliated  Florentine frame full of irregular protuberances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Winnie, nodding her head, &ldquo;I know just how she stood in front of  it, whirling around to see her gown from all sides, like this.&rdquo; Win whirled  herself around, before the glass, and succeeded in catching a bit of her own full  skirt on the frame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  little goose!&rdquo; I cried, as the fabric tore, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need a demonstration at  the expense of your frock!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone was studying the strand of gold fringe. It was composed of tiny beads, of  varying shapes, and had already begun to ravel into shreds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  keep this,&rdquo; he said, and willy-nilly, I lost my little souvenir of Vicky Van.  But, of course, if he considered it evidence, I had to give it up, and the fact  of doing so, partly salved my conscience of its guilty feeling at concealing  the fact of Vicky&rsquo;s presence in her own house just then.</p>
  <p>And,  too, I said to myself, Mr. Stone is out to find her. Surely a detective of his  calibre can accomplish that without help of an humble layman! So I kept my own  counsel, and further search, of the next story, and later, of the basement  rooms, gave no hint of Vicky&rsquo;s presence or departure.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  I began to wonder if I had really seen her. Could she have been so clearly in  my mind, that I visualized her in a moment of clairvoyance? My reason rebelled  at this, for I knew I saw her, as well as I knew I was alive. She had on the  same little hat in which I had last seen her. She had on no cloak, and her  tailor-made street dress was of a dark cloth. I couldn&rsquo;t be sure how she got  away, for the basement door we found bolted on the inside, but she must have  warily evaded and eluded us and slipped here and there as we pursued our course  through the house, and then have gone out by the front door when we were, say,  on the upper floors.</p>
  <p>Returning  to Vicky&rsquo;s boudoir, where her little writing-desk was,<br>
    Fleming Stone began to run over the letters and papers therein.</p>
  <p>It  was locked, but he picked the flimsy fastening and calmly took up the task with  his usual quick-moving, efficient manner.</p>
  <p>I  stayed with him, and the three women wandered back over the house again. He ran  through letters with glancing quickness, flipped over sheafs of bills, and  examined pens, ink and paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  so much that&rsquo;s characteristic about a desk,&rdquo; he said, as he observed the penwiper,  stamps, pin-tray, and especially the pencils. &ldquo;Indeed, I feel now that I know  Miss Van Allen as well, if not better than you do yourself, Mr. Calhoun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, then, you can&rsquo;t believe her guilty,&rdquo; I flashed back, for the very  atmosphere of the dear little room made me more than ever Vicky&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you see,&rdquo; and he spoke a bit sadly, &ldquo;what I know of her is the real woman. I  can&rsquo;t be deceived by her wiles and coquetries. I see only the actual traces of  her actual self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew what he meant, and there was some truth in it. For Vicky was a mystery,  and I was not by any means sure, that she didn&rsquo;t hoodwink us when she chose to.  Much as I liked and admired the girl, I was forced to believe she was not  altogether disingenuous. And she was clever enough to hoodwink anybody. But if  Stone&rsquo;s deductions were to be depended on, they were doubtless true evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she guilty?&rdquo; I sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say that, yet, but I&rsquo;ve found nothing that absolutely precludes her  guilt. On the contrary, I&rsquo;ve found things, which if she is guilty, will go far  toward proving it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sounded a bit enigmatical, but Stone was so serious, that I grasped his general  meaning and let it go at that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean,&rdquo; he said, divining my thoughts, &ldquo;that things may or may not be evidence  according to the guilt or innocence of the suspect. If you find a little boy in  the pantry beside an empty jampot, you suspect him of stealing jam. Now, if  lots of other circumstances prove that child did take the jam, the empty pot is  evidence. But, if circumstances develop that convince you the child did not  have any jam whatever, that day, then the jampot is no evidence at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have found empty jampots?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have. But, so far, I&rsquo;m not sure that they are condemnatory evidence. Though, in  justice to my own work, I must add, that they have every appearance of being  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  already like Vicky Van, then,&rdquo; I said, quickly, moved to do so, by a certain  note of regret in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  man could help liking a woman who possesses her traits. She has delightful  taste and tastes. She is most charitable, her accounts show sums wisely  expended on worthy charities. And letters from friends prove her a truly loyal  and lovable character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a girl <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> kill a man!&rdquo; I broke out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that. There is no one incapable of crime. But such a nature would require  very strong provocation and desperate conditions. These granted, it is by no  means impossible. Now, I am through for to-day, but, if you please I will keep  the key of the house. As the case is now in my hands, you will not object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I said, a little reluctantly. For suppose Vicky should give me another  commission or ask me to perform another errand in the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a transparent face, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone smiled quizzically. &ldquo;Why  do you want to keep the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  aunt is most desirous of seeing this house,&rdquo; I deliberately prevaricated, &ldquo;and  I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  I didn&rsquo;t deceive the astute detective. &ldquo;No, that isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure, but I think you are in touch with Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I am?&rdquo; I flared up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;it is, as you imply, none of my business. But I want to  know your attitude, and if it is antagonistic to my work, I am sorry, but I  will conduct my course accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stone,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;I am not antagonistic, but I do know a little about Miss  Van Allen&rsquo;s movements that I haven&rsquo;t told. I cannot see that it would assist  you in any way to know it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  enough,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone spoke heartily. &ldquo;Your assurance of that is  sufficient. Now, are we working together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated. Then I suddenly thought of Ruth Schuyler. I owed her a business  fealty, and somehow I liked to feel that I also owed her a personal allegiance,  and both these demanded my efforts to avenge the death of her husband,  irrespective of where the blow might fall.</p>
  <p>So  I said, honestly, &ldquo;We are, Mr. Stone. I will help you, if I can, and if at any  time I think my withheld information will help you, I will make it known. Is  that satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  so,&rdquo; and the handshake that Stone gave me was like a signed and sealed bond, to  which I tacitly but none the less truthfully subscribed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Fibsy</b></h2>
  <p>Next  morning as I started for my office, I found myself combating a strong impulse  to call in at Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s. I had no errand there, and I knew that if she  required my services she would summon me. It was no longer incumbent on me to  try to unravel the murder mystery. Fleming Stone had that matter in charge, and  his master-mind needed no assistance from me.</p>
  <p>And  yet, I wanted to stop at the Fifth Avenue house, if only for a moment, to  reassure myself of Ruth&rsquo;s well-being. Though above me in social rank, the  little widow seemed to me a lonely and pathetic woman, and I knew she had begun  to depend on me for advice and sympathy. Of course, she could turn to Fleming  Stone, but, in a way, he was adviser of the Schuyler sisters, and I knew Ruth  hesitated to intrude on his time.</p>
  <p>I  was still uncertain whether to call or not, and as I walked along the few feet  between my own house and the Avenue, I crossed the street as I reached Vicky  Van&rsquo;s house, and naturally looked at it as I passed.</p>
  <p>And  after I had passed the flight of brownstone steps, and was going along by the  iron fence, I turned to look at the area door. This was my performance every  morning, and always without thought of seeing anything of importance.</p>
  <p>But  this time the area door stood half-way open, and looking out was a boy, a  red-headed chap, with a freckled face and bright, wise eyes.</p>
  <p>I  turned quickly and went in at the area gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;and what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  Fibsy,&rdquo; he said, as if that settled it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibsy  who?&rdquo; I asked, but I dropped my indignant tone, for the lad seemed to be  composedly sure of his rights there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw,  jest Fibsy. That&rsquo;s me name, because, if you want to know, because<br>
    I&rsquo;m a natural born liar and I fib for a living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was impudent without being offensive; his wide smile was good-natured and the  twinkle in his eye a friendly one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got yer number,&rdquo; he said, after a comprehensive survey of my person, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re C.  Calhoun. Ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sure am,&rdquo; I agreed, meeting his taste for the vernacular, &ldquo;and now for your  real name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terence  McGuire,&rdquo; he smiled, and with a quick gesture he snatched off his cap. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon  in, if you like. I&rsquo;m F. Stone&rsquo;s right-hand man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  I cried, in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep,  that&rsquo;s what. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, I like to call myself his caddy. I follow him round, and  hold his clues for him, till he wants one, then I hand it out. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  entirely. But I gather you&rsquo;re in Mr. Stone&rsquo;s employ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet I am! And I&rsquo;m on me job twenty-four hours a day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is your job just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  since eight A.M. I&rsquo;ve been holdin&rsquo; up this door, waitin&rsquo; for yer honor to pass  by. An&rsquo; I got you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; I stepped inside and the boy closed the door. We went into the front  basement room, where there was a lighted gas stove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  camp here, &lsquo;count o&rsquo; the heats. There&rsquo;s no use gettin&rsquo; up the steam fer the few  casual callers that drops in at present. Now, Mr. Calhoun, I don&rsquo;t want to be  stuffy nor nuthin&rsquo;, but Mr. Stone said I might ask you some few things, if I  liked an&rsquo; you can answer or not, as you like. This ain&rsquo;t no orficial  investigation, but I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re as intrusted as anybody in findin&rsquo; this here  Victoria Van Allen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  interested in finding the murderer of Mr. Schuyler,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  maybe they ain&rsquo;t one an&rsquo; the same. That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; He spoke thoughtfully and  scanned my face with a quizzical glance. &ldquo;But, of course, Mr. Stone&rsquo;ll find  out. Now, Mr. Calhoun, if you don&rsquo;t mind, will you give me a line on that maid  person, that Julia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie,  she is called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Julie goes. Is she a young thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  just this side of middle-aged. Probably thirty-five or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  looker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  about average. Brown hair, brownish eyes&mdash;really, I never noticed her closely  enough to think about her appearance. She is, I&rsquo;m sure, a good servant and  devoted to Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  don&rsquo;t you know anything special? Anything that would pick her out from a lot of  other good servants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  appearance, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t think of anything. Let me see. She wears glasses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Just ordinary glasses, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spectacles  or nose-riders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure. Spectacles, I think. And she has a great many gold-filled teeth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Front  ones?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is, they&rsquo;re very noticeable when she speaks to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s sumpum. Is she quick and spry-like, or poky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  smiled at the boy&rsquo;s eagerness. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather alert,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but, of course, quiet  and respectful. I never looked at her with any personal interest, so I can only  give you my general impressions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, it&rsquo;s this way,&rdquo; and the boy looked very serious, &ldquo;wherever Miss Van Allen  is, that Julie&rsquo;s there, too. And when Miss Van Allen wants errands done, of  course, she sends Julie. And, of course, said Julie is disguised. I dope out  all this has to be so. For Miss Van Allen has mailed letters and&mdash;oh, well, of  course she could mail letters in lots of ways, but sumpum tells me, that she depends  on Miss Julie as an errand girl. So, I want to find out the look of the Julie  person, and see if I can&rsquo;t track her down, and so get at Miss Van Allen. Vicky  Van, I believe her friends call her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do,&rdquo; said I, looking sternly at the boy, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll say right here, that I&rsquo;m one  of her friends, and I won&rsquo;t stand for any impertinence or any remarks of any  sort about that lady. If she is suspected of this crime, let the law take its  course, but until there is some direct evidence, don&rsquo;t you dare to connect her  name with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  only obeying Mr. Stone&rsquo;s orders. And, take it from me, Mr. Calhoun, I ain&rsquo;t so  fresh as to make remarks about a lady. I&rsquo;m a prevaricator of the truth, but  only when it&rsquo;s abserlutely necessary. And on the other hand, I&rsquo;m a born  protector of women. Why, I&rsquo;d be only too tickled to find a gentleman suspect.  Or, at least, to clear Miss Van Allen from all s&rsquo;picion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you feel such a kindly interest in the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  house, for one reason. You see, I&rsquo;ve been all over it, at Mr. Stone&rsquo;s orders,  and I ree&rsquo;lize what a nice lady she is. I don&rsquo;t have to see her, to understand  her tastes and her &lsquo;complishments. Why, jest the books on her centre tables and  the records for her phonograph spell her out for me, in words of one syllable.  And, though I&rsquo;m hunting for her, it isn&rsquo;t with a solid hunch that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s the  knife-sticker. Not by no means. But find her I&rsquo;ve gotto! Because F. Stone says  for me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at the boy more curiously. He was a strange admixture of street boy and  sleuth. His quick, darting eyes were never still, but warily alert to catch the  meaning of any sound or motion on my part. I felt as if he read me through, and  would not have been surprised to have him tell me he knew of my recent  communications with Vicky. But I only said, &ldquo;You are, then, Mr. Stone&rsquo;s  right-hand man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  put it that way, yes. But really, I&rsquo;m his apprentice, and I&rsquo;m learning his  trade. I study his methods, and I add some gumption of my own, and if I can  help him, I&rsquo;m glad and happy. And anyway, I&rsquo;m learning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this talk about your lying? Is that straight goods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is, how can you believe what I tell you?&rdquo; he asked, whimsically. &ldquo;But, I  used to be a fierce liar. Then, gettin&rsquo; in with F. Stone, made me see it&rsquo;s  wrong to lie&mdash;usuerly, that is. So I don&rsquo;t, now&mdash;leastways, not much. Only when  it&rsquo;s jest the only thing to do to save game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does Mr. Stone know when you&rsquo;re telling the truth, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  land, I don&rsquo;t lie to him! I wouldn&rsquo;t, and if I did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be any use. He&rsquo;d  see through me, quicker&rsquo;n scat! But, honest, I wouldn&rsquo;t. You see, he&rsquo;s my idol,  yes sir, my idol, that&rsquo;s what that man is! Well, Mr. Calhoun, as you&rsquo;ve told me  all you can pry loose from your stock of infermation, you an&rsquo; me may as well  make our adooses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know I haven&rsquo;t revealed all I know of the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I read from your mobile counternance that you&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; sumpum back, but it  don&rsquo;t matter. F. Stone&rsquo;ll nail it, when he gets good an&rsquo; ready. What I wanted  from you was mostly the speakin&rsquo; likeness of the Julie dame. An&rsquo; I guess I got  it. Oh, say, one other thing. Who among Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s friends is an artist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Gale is one. Miss Ariadne Gale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, sir. And will you gimme her address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did so, and then I went away, thinking Fleming Stone a queer sort of detective  to have for assistant such an illiterate, uncultured boy as Fibsy. The name was  enough to condemn him! But as I thought the little chap over, I realized that  his talk had been clear-headed and to the point, besides showing sagacity and  perspicacity.</p>
  <p>It  was growing late, but after this interview I felt I must see Ruth for a few  minutes, so called at the Schuyler house.</p>
  <p>She  greeted me cordially and seemed glad to see me. Winnie was still acting as  secretary for her, but the rush of notes of condolence was over, and as Ruth  was not, of course, giving or accepting social invitations, there was not so  much work for Win as at first. But the two had become fast friends, and Winnie  told me how they sat together chatting often for pleasant half hours at a time.</p>
  <p>I  told Ruth about the strange boy at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about him. Mr. Stone picked him up somewhere and he uses  him as a sort of outside scout. He has all confidence in him, though I believe  the little chap rejoices in the name of Fibber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibsy,&rdquo;  I corrected. &ldquo;He is certainly a bright youth. And he plans to hunt down Miss  Van Allen by means of her maid, Julie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  they together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  only suppose so. It seems probable, that Miss Van Allen would want the help, if  not the protection of her servant. Julie is a most capable woman, and devoted  to her mistress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard so. I have a kind, thoughtful woman, too, and I should miss her terribly  were I without her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but your Tibbetts is a servant, and nothing more. This Julie was a real friend  to Miss Van Allen, and looked after her in every way. Housekeeper, maid, nurse,  and general bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Van Allen must have needed such a person, since, as I am told, she lived  alone. My sisters-in-law are quite in love with the Van Allen house. Both they  and Winnie have been singing its praises this morning. It seems your Vicky Van  is a lady of most refined tastes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  certainly is. I can&rsquo;t help thinking if you and she had known each other, in  favorable circumstances, you would have been friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be. I have never felt sure that she is the guilty one, but I have changed  my mind about not wanting her to be found. I do want that she should be. Mr.  Schuyler&rsquo;s sisters have shown me that to hesitate at or neglect any means of  hunting her out would be wrong. And so, I am glad we have Mr. Stone and I hope  he will succeed in his search.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  changed your mind, especially?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  realized that it would be disloyalty to my husband&rsquo;s memory to let his possible  slayer go free. The girl must be found, and then if she can be freed of  suspicion, very well, but the case must be investigated fully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare say you are right. Mr. Schuyler was a man of importance and influence, and  aside from that, every deed of blood calls for revenge. I honor you for  deciding as you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is justice that moves me, more than my personal inclination,&rdquo; Ruth went on. &ldquo;I  will not deny, Mr. Calhoun, that in some ways, my husband&rsquo;s death has freed me  from certain restrictions that hampered and galled me. I shouldn&rsquo;t mention this  to you, but I know the sisters have told you that I have, in many ways, gone  counter to Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s wishes, since I have been my own mistress. It is  true. He and I disagreed greatly on matters of the household and matters of my  personal comfort and convenience. Now that I can do so, I am arranging my life  differently. It is natural that I should do this, but the Schuyler ladies think  that I have begun indecently soon. I say this, not by way of apology, but because  I want you to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  looked very sweet and wistful, as she seemed to make a bid for my sympathy. I  was impressed anew by the soft pallor of her face and the sweet purity of her  gray eyes. I contrasted her with Vicky Van. One, the embodiment of life and  gayety, the other a gentle, dovelike personality, which, however, hinted  sometimes at hidden fires. I believed that Ruth Schuyler had been so repressed,  so dominated by her brute of a husband, that her nature had never expanded to  its own possibilities.</p>
  <p>And,  like a blinding flash of lightning, the knowledge came to me that I loved her!  It was no uncertain conviction. The fact sprang full-armed, to my brain, and my  heart swelled with the bliss of it.</p>
  <p>I  scarcely dared look at her. I couldn&rsquo;t tell her&mdash;yet. I had no reason to think  she cared for me, other than as the merest acquaintance, yet, then and there, I  vowed to myself that she should care.</p>
  <p>I  thought of Vicky Van&mdash;poor little Vicky. She had interested me&mdash;did interest me,  but in only a friendly way. Indeed, my interest in her was prompted by sympathy  for her luckless position and the trust she had reposed in me, I would hold her  trust sacred. I would never play false to Vicky Van. But henceforth and forever  my heart and soul belonged to my liege lady, my angel-faced Ruth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, Mr. Calhoun?&rdquo; I heard her saying, and I looked up to see her  smiling almost gayly at me. &ldquo;Your thoughts seem to be a thousand miles away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not so far as that,&rdquo; I protested. Somehow, I felt buoyantly happy. I had no  wish to tell her of my love, at present I was quite content to worship her in  secret, and I exulted in a sort of clairvoyant knowledge that I should yet win  her. I smiled into her dear eyes, as I continued: &ldquo;They were really round the  corner in Vicky Van&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  my delight she pouted a little. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of something else,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt Miss Van Allen is charming, and her home a perfect gem, but I own up I&rsquo;m  not anxious to discuss her all the time and with every one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall be exempt from it with me,&rdquo; I promised. &ldquo;Henceforth her name is taboo  between us, and you shall choose our subjects yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let&rsquo;s talk about me. Now, you know, Mr. Calhoun, I never see Mr. Bradbury, so  you must be my legal adviser in all my quandaries. First, and this is a serious  matter, I don&rsquo;t want to continue to live with the Schuyler ladies. We are  diametrically opposed on all matters of opinion, and disagree on many matters  of fact.&rdquo; Ruth smiled, and I marveled afresh at the way her face lighted up  when she indulged in that little smile of hers. &ldquo;Nor,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;do they  want to live with me. So, it ought to be an easy matter to please us all. As to  the house and furnishings, they are all mine, but if the sisters prefer to live  here, and let me go elsewhere, I am willing to give them the house and its  contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you don&rsquo;t care for this type of residence,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;indeed, Miss Schuyler  said yesterday, as we looked over Vicky Van&rsquo;s house, that it was just the sort  of thing you liked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t think I would like her house! I supposed it was a plain little affair.  Harmonious and pretty, Winnie says, but she didn&rsquo;t give me the impression it  was elaborate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be as grand as your home ought to be.<br>
    But mention of the girl is not allowed, I believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled again, and resumed: &ldquo;Well, I want you to sound the Schuyler sisters, and  find out their wishes. When I speak to them, they only say for me to wait until  after the mystery is solved and all this horrid publicity and notoriety at an  end. But I want to go away from them now. I want Mr. Stone to do his work, and  I hope he will find that girl and all that, but I can&rsquo;t stand it to live in  this atmosphere of detectives and reporters and policemen any longer than I  must. Would it do for me to go to some quiet hotel for a while? I could take  Tibbetts, and just be quietly by myself, while the Schuylers continue to live  in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought it over. I understood perfectly how she hated to be questioned continually  as to her life with her late husband, for I was beginning to realize that that  life had been a continuous tragedy. Nothing much definite, but many sidelights  and stray hints had shown me how he had treated her, and how patiently she had  borne it. And, now he was gone, and I, for one, didn&rsquo;t blame her that she  wanted to get away from the scenes of her slavery to him. For it had been that.  He had enforced his ideas and opinions upon her, until she had been allowed to  do nothing and to have nothing as she wished.</p>
  <p>And  now, she desired only peace and quietness somewhere, anywhere, away from the  two who represented Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s tyranny and carping criticism without  his right to obtrude them on her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will speak to them,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure we can arrange some mode of life for  you which will give you rest and freedom of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you only can!&rdquo; she murmured, as she held out a friendly hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    A Futile Chase</b></h2>
  <p>It  was Sunday afternoon, and we were in conclave in the Schuyler library. Fleming  Stone was summing up his results of the past few days and, though it was  evident he had done all that mortal man could do, yet he had no hint or clue as  to where Vicky Van might be.</p>
  <p>And,  he held, that nothing else was of consequence compared to this knowledge. She  must be found, and whether that could be done quickly, by search or by chance,  or whether it would take a long time of waiting, he could not say. He felt  sure, that she must disclose herself, sooner or later, but if not, and if their  search continued unavailing, then he held out no hope for success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a unique case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in my experience. All depends on finding that woman.  If she is innocent, herself, she knows who did it. And, if she is the guilty  one, she is clever enough to remain hidden. It may be she is miles away, out of  the country, perhaps. She has had ample time to make arrangements to go abroad,  or to any distant place. Her guilt seems to me probable, because she has  literally abandoned her house and her belongings. An innocent woman would  scarcely leave all those modern and valuable furnishings unless for some very  strong reason. But as to finding her&mdash;a needle in a haystack presents an easy  problem by contrast!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless  she is hiding in the house of some friend,&rdquo; suggested Ruth, thoughtfully. &ldquo;It  seems to me she must have been taken in and cared for by some one who loved  her, that night she disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been to see all her friends that I can  find out about. I&rsquo;ve called on a score of them, finding their addresses in her  address book that Mr. Lowney gave me. Of course, they may have been deceiving  me, but I feel safe in asserting that she is not under the protection of any  one I interviewed. She returned to her house last Monday night, the police  believe, for the purpose of getting her mail. This shows a daring almost  unbelievable! That mail must have been of desperate importance to her. She has  not been to the house since, they feel sure, and since I have been on the case  she could not have entered, for I have kept it under strict surveillance. I  think she will never return to it. Presumably she got the letters she was so  anxious for. Her mail, that has arrived the last few days, I have not opened,  but the envelopes show mostly tradesmen&rsquo;s cards, or are indubitably social  correspondence. There seem to be no letters from lawyers or financial firms.  However, if nothing develops, I shall open the letters. This case, being  unprecedented, necessitates unusual proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  disappointed in you, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Rhoda Schuyler, testily; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t  suppose you were superhuman, but I did think, with your reputation and all, you  would be able to find that woman. I&rsquo;ve heard say that nobody could absolutely  vanish in New York City, and not be traced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t regret my so-far failure a bit more than I do, Miss Schuyler, but I feel  no shame or embarrassment over it. Nor am I ready to admit myself beaten. I  have a theory, or, rather a conviction that there is one and only one  explanation of this strange affair. I am not quite ready to expound this, but  in a day or two I shall find if it is the true solution, and if so I shall soon  find Miss Van Allen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew you would,&rdquo; and Sarah Schuyler nodded her head, in satisfaction. &ldquo;I told  Rhoda to give you more time and you would not disappoint us. All right, Mr.  Stone, use all the time you need. But no Schuyler must remain unavenged. I want  to see that woman killed&mdash;yes, killed, for her murder of my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sarah  Schuyler looked like a figure of Justice herself, as, with flashing eyes she  declared her wrath. And it was her right. Her brother&rsquo;s blood called out for  vengeance. But the more gentle-souled Ruth shuddered and shrank from this stern  arraignment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Sarah,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;not killed! Don&rsquo;t condemn a woman to that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not, Ruth? If a woman can kill, a woman should be killed. But she won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo;  she added, bitterly. &ldquo;No jury ever convicts a woman, no matter how clearly her  guilt is proven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  then Fibsy appeared. He was a strange little figure, and showed a shy  awkwardness at the grandeur of his surroundings. He bobbed a funny little  curtsy to Ruth, whom he already adored, and with an embarrassed nod, included  the rest of us in a general greeting.</p>
  <p>Then  to Fleming Stone he said, in an eager, triumphant tone, &ldquo;I got &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  what?&rdquo; asked Ruth, smiling at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  pictures of Miss Van Allen, and Julie, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried Ruth, interested at once; &ldquo;let me see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  glanced at her and then at Stone, and handed a parcel to the latter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  my boss,&rdquo; the boy said, as if by way of apology for slighting her request.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone opened the parcel and showed two sketches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Gale made them,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I sent Fibsy over there to induce her to give  us at least a hint of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s personal appearance. The boy could  wheedle it from her, when I couldn&rsquo;t. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  handed the pictures to Miss Rhoda, for he, too, respected authority, but we all  gathered round to look.</p>
  <p>They  were the merest sketches. A wash of water-color, but they showed merit. As the  only one present who knew Vicky Van, I was asked of the truth of their  portraiture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fairly  good,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;yes, more than that. This of Vicky shows the coloring of her  face and hair and the general effect of her costume, more than her actual  physiognomy. But it is certainly a close enough likeness to make her  recognizable if you find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  this was true. Ariadne had caught the sidelong glance of Vicky Van&rsquo;s  dark-lashed eyes, and the curve of her scarlet lips. The coloring was perfect,  just Vicky&rsquo;s vivid tints, and the dark hair, looped over her ears, was as she  always wore it. Ariadne had drawn her in the gown she had worn that fatal  evening, and the women eagerly scrutinized the gorgeous costume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  wonder those long strands of fringe caught in that scraggly mirror frame!&rdquo;  exclaimed Winnie, who never missed a point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;  said Stone. &ldquo;If she whirled around as you did, Miss Calhoun, it&rsquo;s a wonder she  didn&rsquo;t spoil her whole gown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pose and the figure were not exactly Vicky&rsquo;s. Ariadne wasn&rsquo;t much on catching a  likeness or a physical effect. But the color and atmosphere were fine, and I  told this to Stone, who agreed that it was a decided help in the search.</p>
  <p>Julie&rsquo;s  portrait was the same. Not a real likeness of the woman, but an impressionist  transcript of her salient points. The gray gown and white apron, the  thick-rimmed glasses, the parted lips, showing slightly protruding teeth, the  plainly parted brown hair, all were the real Julie; and yet, except for these  accessories I&rsquo;m not sure I could have recognized the subject of the sketch.  However, as I told Stone, it certainly was a helpful indication of the sort of  woman he was to look for, and even in disguise, the physical characteristics  must show.</p>
  <p>The  detective was positive that wherever Vicky Van and Julie were, or whatever they  were doing, they were in all probability disguised, and thoroughly so, or they  must have been discovered ere this.</p>
  <p>To  my amusement, Fibsy and Ruth were holding a tete-a-tete conversation. The  kind-hearted woman had, doubtless, felt sorry for the boy&rsquo;s shyness, and had  drawn him into chat to put him at his ease.</p>
  <p>She  had succeeded, too, for he was animated, and had lost his self-consciousness  under the charm of her smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll bet your birthday comes in the spring,&rdquo; he was saying, as I caught the  tenor of their talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does,&rdquo; said Ruth, looking surprised. &ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause  you&rsquo;re just like a little spring flower&mdash;a white crocus or a bit of arbutus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then, noting my attention, the boy was covered with confusion and blushed to  the tips of his ears. He rose from where he sat, and shuffled awkwardly around  the great room, devoting exaggerated attention to some books in the glassed  cases, and twirling his fingers in acute embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  scared him away,&rdquo; chided Ruth, under her breath, as our glances met. &ldquo;He and I  were getting positively chummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  was he talking of your birthday? I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. He said I was born in the spring, because I&rsquo;m like a  flower! Really, that child will grow up a poet, if he doesn&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are like a flower,&rdquo; I murmured back. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad your birthday is in spring.  I mean to celebrate it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then I thought of poor Vicky Van&rsquo;s birthday, so tragically ended, and I quickly  changed the subject.</p>
  <p>Armed  with the pictures, Fleming Stone and his young assistant spent the next day on  a still hunt.</p>
  <p>And  in the evening Stone came over to see me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little quiet confab,&rdquo; he said, as we secluded ourselves in my sitting-room and  closed the door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to a score of places, and invariably they recognize  Miss Van Allen and her maid, but all say they&rsquo;ve not seen her since the  tragedy. I went to shops, offices, the bank and places where she would be  likely to need to go. Also, her friends&rsquo; houses. But nothing doing. The shops  have heard from her, in the way of paid bills, checks and such matters, but I  learned absolutely nothing that throws any light on her whereabouts. Now, Mr.  Calhoun, the very thoroughness of her disappearance, the very inviolable  secrecy of her hiding-place proves to me that she isn&rsquo;t hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mr. Stone,&rdquo; I said, smiling, &ldquo;you talk like a real story-book detective. Cryptic  utterances of that sort are impressive to the layman, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;  and he looked annoyed, &ldquo;if you knew anything about detective work, you&rsquo;d know  that the most seemingly impossible conditions are often the easiest to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, explain. I&rsquo;ll be glad to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will. And, in return, Mr. Calhoun, I&rsquo;m going to ask you if you don&rsquo;t think,  that all things considered, you ought to tell me what you are keeping back? You  won&rsquo;t mind, will you, if I say that I have deduced, from evidence,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;that  your interests are largely coincident with those of Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  on,&rdquo; I said, shortly, but not annoyed at his perspicacity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I assure you that Mrs. Schuyler is most desirous of locating Miss Van  Allen. She is not so revengeful or vituperative as the sisters of her husband,  but she feels it is due to her husband&rsquo;s memory to find his slayer, if  possible. Now suppose you tell me what you know, and I promise to keep it an  inviolate confidence except so far as it actually helps the progress of the  wheels of justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do want to do what is best for Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s interests,&rdquo; I said, after I had  thought a moment. &ldquo;But, I must confess, I have a certain sympathy and pity for  Victoria Van Allen. I cannot believe her guilty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  tell me frankly the truth. If you are right, and she is not the murderer, the  truth can&rsquo;t harm her. And if she is the guilty person, you are compounding a  felony, in the eyes of the law, to withhold your information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  spoke a little sternly, and I realized he was right. If Vicky were untraceably  hidden, all I could tell wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her. And, too, I couldn&rsquo;t see that it  would, anyway. Moreover, as Stone said, I was making myself amenable to the  law, by a refusal to tell all I knew, and since I was so aware of my own  devotion to Ruth Schuyler, I felt I had no right to do anything that she would  disapprove. And, I knew that a touch of feminine pique in her disposition would  resent any consideration of Vicky over her own claims!</p>
  <p>Therefore,  I told Fleming Stone all I knew of Victoria Van Allen, both before, during and  after the occasion of her birthday party.</p>
  <p>He  listened, with his deep eyes fixed on my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  extraordinary!&rdquo; he said, at last, after I had finished. &ldquo;I never heard of such  daring! To enter her own house when it was watched by the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the post patrol, then,&rdquo; I reminded him. &ldquo;She could easily manage between his  rounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I know. But you&rsquo;ve put the whole thing in different focus.<br>
    Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no more to tell, but I went over my story again, amplifying and remembering  further details, until we had spent the whole evening. He egged me on by  questions and his burning, eager eyes seemed to drink in my words as if they  were so much priceless wisdom.</p>
  <p>And  I told him, too, that I had promised to put Vicky&rsquo;s address book in the Chinese  jar for her that very evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  do it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, promptly. &ldquo;She meant to meet you there, I&rsquo;m sure, but I&rsquo;m  also sure she changed her mind about that, when she learned of my advent.  However, we&rsquo;ll keep your promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Acting  at his instructions, I went with him over to Vicky Van&rsquo;s. It was about  midnight, and as he had the address book with him, he kept possession of it.</p>
  <p>We  went in the house, and in the dark, felt our way up to the music room. Stone  put the book in the jar, and motioned for me to hide behind a sofa. He himself  took up his vigil behind a window-curtain, of heavy brocade.</p>
  <p>He  had planned all this, before we left my house, and no word was spoken as we  took our places. His hope was that Vicky would come into the house late and go  straight for her book and quickly out again. He had directed me to wait until  she had really abstracted the book from the jar and then, as she was leaving  the room, spring after her and stop her.</p>
  <p>I  obeyed orders implicitly, and, as Stone had warned me, we had a bit of a wait.  I grew cramped and tired, and at last I gave up all hope of Vicky&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
  <p>And  then, she came!</p>
  <p>Silently,  absolutely without sound, she glided in from the hall. My eyes, now accustomed  to the semi-gloom of the room, could discern her figure as it approached the  great vase. Softly, she raised the cover, she abstracted the book, and with  noiseless touch was replacing the cover, when she threw back her head, as if  she sensed our presence. I had made no move, nor had I heard a breath of sound  from Stone, but Vicky knew some one was present. I knew that by her startled  movement. She gave a stifled scream, and pushing the great jar off on the  floor, where it crashed to pieces, she rushed out of the room and down stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  her, Calhoun! Fly!&rdquo; shouted Stone, and as he flung back the heavy curtains the  street lights illuminated the scene. But as we avoided the broken fragments we  bumped together and lost a few seconds in our recovery from the impact.</p>
  <p>This  gave Vicky a start, and we heard the street door slam as we raced down the  stairs. Here, too, we lost a second or two, for I stepped back to give Stone  space just as he did the same for me, and when we had reached the foot of the  stairs, leaped through the hall, wrenched open the door and dashed down the  steps to the pavement, we saw the flying figure of Vicky Van round the Fifth  Avenue corner, and turn South.</p>
  <p>After  her we ran, as fast as mortal man can run, I verily believe, and when we  reached the Avenue there was no one in sight!</p>
  <p>Stone  stood stock-still, looking down the street.</p>
  <p>The  Avenue was lighted, as usual, and we could see a block and more in both  directions, but no sign of Vicky. Nor was there a pedestrian abroad, or a  motor. The Avenue was absolutely uninhabited, as far as our eyes could reach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d  she go?&rdquo; I panted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into  some house, or, maybe, hiding in an area. We must search them all, but very  warily. She&rsquo;s a witch, a wonder-woman, but all the same, the earth didn&rsquo;t open  and swallow her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  searched every area way on the block. One of us would go in and explore while  the other stood guard. The third house was the Schuyler residence, but Stone  also searched thoroughly in its basement entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  dark and locked up,&rdquo; he reported, as he came out from there. &ldquo;And, of course,  she wouldn&rsquo;t seek sanctuary there! But I&rsquo;ve wondered if she isn&rsquo;t concealed in  one of these nearby houses, as she has such ready access to her own home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  it was impossible. Every basement entrance was locked and bolted for the night  and all the windows were dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  given us the slip,&rdquo; said Stone, in deep chagrin. &ldquo;But perhaps she crossed the  street. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t run down this side very far. Let&rsquo;s go over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  crossed and looked over the stone wall of the park. Surely Vicky Van had not  had time to scramble over that wall before we reached the corner. It had been  not more than a few seconds after we saw her flying form turn down the Avenue,  and she couldn&rsquo;t have crossed the street and scaled the wall in that time!</p>
  <p>Where  was she? What had become of her?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ring  up the houses and inquire,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re justified in doing that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  use,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;If she was expected they won&rsquo;t give her away, and if she  isn&rsquo;t there, they&rsquo;d be pretty angry at our intrusion. I&rsquo;ll admit, Calhoun, I&rsquo;ve  never been so mystified in my life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I!&rdquo; I emphatically agreed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    The Gold-Fringed Gown</b></h2>
  <p>After  that night Fleming Stone became more desperately in earnest in his search for  Vicky. It seemed as if the sight of her, the realization that she was a real  woman and not a myth, had whetted his eagerness to discover her hiding place  and bring her to book.</p>
  <p>He  established himself in her house, and both he and Fibsy practically lived  there, going out for their meals or picnicking in the basement room. This room  became his headquarters, and a plain clothes man was on duty whenever Stone and  Fibsy were both absent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Though  I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll ever come back again,&rdquo; Stone declared, gloomily. &ldquo;She was  desperately anxious for that address book, and so she got it, through my  stupidity. I might have known she&rsquo;d make a dash for the street door. I should  have had that exit guarded. But I&rsquo;ve seen her, and I&rsquo;ll get her yet! At any  rate she hasn&rsquo;t left the country, or hadn&rsquo;t last night, whatever she may do  to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the day after Vicky had given us the slip. It was midafternoon, and I had  gone to see Stone, on my return from my office. I was sadly neglecting my own  business nowadays, but Mr. Bradbury looked after it, and he sanctioned my  devotion to the Schuyler cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph  Schuyler was an important citizen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and his murderer must be  apprehended if possible. Do all you can, Calhoun, for humanity&rsquo;s sake and the  law&rsquo;s. Take all the time you want to, I&rsquo;ll see to your important business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So,  though I went downtown every morning, I came back at noon or soon after and  plunged afresh into the work of finding Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>There  was little I could do, but Stone consulted and questioned me continually as to  Vicky&rsquo;s habits or pursuits, and I told him frankly all I knew.</p>
  <p>Also  I managed to make business matters loom up so importantly as to necessitate  frequent calls on Ruth Schuyler, and I spent most of my afternoon hours in the  Fifth Avenue house.</p>
  <p>And  Ruth was most kind to me. I couldn&rsquo;t say she showed affection or even especial  interest, but she turned to me as a confidant and we had many long, pleasant  conversations when the subject of the mystery was not touched upon.</p>
  <p>Though  she never said a word against Randolph Schuyler, I couldn&rsquo;t help learning that,  aside from the horror of it, his death was to her a blessed relief. He had not  been a good man, nor had he been a good husband. On the contrary, he had  blighted Ruth&rsquo;s whole life by thwarting her every innocent desire for gayety or  pleasure.</p>
  <p>For  instance, she spoke of her great enjoyment of light opera or farce comedy, but  as Mr. Schuyler didn&rsquo;t care for such entertainment he had never allowed her to  go. He had a box at the Grand Opera, and Ruth loved to go, but she liked  lighter music also.</p>
  <p>This  was not told complainingly, but transpired in the course of a conversation at  which Fibsy chanced to be present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;  he said, looking at Ruth commiseratingly, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you never heard &lsquo;The Jitney  Girl&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Prince of Peoria&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  shook her head, smiling at the boy&rsquo;s amazement. There was a subtle sympathy  between these two that surprised me, for Ruth Schuyler was fastidious in her  choice of friends. But he amused her, and he was never really  impertinent&mdash;merely naive and unconventional.</p>
  <p>Well,  on the day I speak of, Stone and I sat in the basement room awaiting Fibsy&rsquo;s  return. He was out after certain information and we hoped much from it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gotta bunch o&rsquo; dope,&rdquo; he announced, as he suddenly appeared before us. &ldquo;Dunno &lsquo;s  it&rsquo;ll pan out much, but listen &lsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll spill a earful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had learned that Fibsy, or Terence, as we ought to call him, was trying to  discard his street slang, and was succeeding fairly well, save in moments of  great excitement or importance. And so, I hoped from his slangy beginning, that  he had found some fresh data.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  chased up that chore boy first,&rdquo; he related, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t know anything at  all. Said Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s a lovely lady, but he &lsquo;most never saw her, the Julie  dame did all the orderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; payin&rsquo; s&rsquo;far&rsquo;s he was concerned. Good pay, but  irregular work. She&rsquo;d be here a day or two, an&rsquo; then like&rsquo;s not go &lsquo;way for a  week. Well, we knew that before. Then, next, I tracked to his lair the furnace  man. Same story. Here to-day an&rsquo; gone to-morrer, as the song says. &lsquo;Course, he  ain&rsquo;t only a stoker, he&rsquo;s really an odd job man&mdash;ashes, sidewalks, an&rsquo; such.  Well, he didn&rsquo;t help none&mdash;any, I mean. But,&rdquo; and the shock of red hair seemed  to bristle with triumph, &ldquo;I loined one thing! That Julie has been to the sewing  woman and the laundress lady and shut &lsquo;em up! Yes, sir! that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it all,&rdquo; said Stone, briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I struck the seamstress first. She wouldn&rsquo;t tell a thing, and I said, calmly, &lsquo;I  know Julie paid you to keep your mouth shut, but if you don&rsquo;t tell, the law&rsquo;ll  make you!&rsquo; That scared her, and she owned up that Julie was to see her &lsquo;bout a  week ago and give her fifty dollars not to tell anything at all whatsomever  about Miss Van Allen! Some girl, that Vicky Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Julie  went there herself!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep.  The real Julie, gold teeth and all. But I quizzed the needle pusher good and  plenty, and she don&rsquo;t know much of evidential value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was always funny when Fibsy interlarded his talk with legal phrases, but he was  unconscious of any incongruity and went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, as I dope it out, she&rsquo;s accustomed to sit in Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s boodore  a-sewin&rsquo; an&rsquo; might have overheard some gossip or sumpum like that, an&rsquo; Miss Van  Allen was afraid she&rsquo;d scatter it, an&rsquo; so she sent Julie to shut her up. I don&rsquo;t  believe the woman knows where Miss Van is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see her,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. She won&rsquo;t get away. She&rsquo;s a regular citizen, an&rsquo; respectable at that.  Well, then, the laundress. To her also Julie had likewise went. An&rsquo; to her also  Julie had passed the spondulicks. Now, I don&rsquo;t understand that so well, for  laundresses don&rsquo;t overhear the ladies talkin&rsquo;, but, anyway, Julie told her if  she wouldn&rsquo;t answer a question to anybody, she&rsquo;d give her half a century, too.  And did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless  the laundress knew something Miss Van Allen wants kept secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless,  sir,&rdquo; said Fibsy, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; mused Stone, &ldquo;that it would help us any to learn all those  women know. If Miss Van Allen thought they could help us find her, she would  give them more than that for silence or get them out of the city altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Van Allen, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  asked the question casually, as one expectant of an answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  in the city, Fibs, living as somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep,  that&rsquo;s so. Over on the West side, say, among the artist lady&rsquo;s studio gang?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  so. But she has full freedom of action and goes about as she likes. Julie also.  They come here whenever they choose, though I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll come while we&rsquo;re  here. It&rsquo;s a queer state of things, Calhoun. What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe Vicky is disguised. Her personality is too pronounced<br>
    and so is Julie&rsquo;s. I think some friend is caring for them. Not Ariadne<br>
    Gale, of that I&rsquo;m sure. But it may be Mrs. Reeves. She is very fond of<br>
    Vicky and is clever enough to hide the girl all this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police have searched her house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but Mrs. Reeves and Vicky could connive a plan that would hoodwink the  police, I&rsquo;m pretty certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  look into that,&rdquo; and Stone made a note of it. &ldquo;About that carving knife, Fibsy.  Did the caterers take it away by mistake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; I &lsquo;vestergated that, an&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  knife is an important thing, to my mind,&rdquo; the detective went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; eagerly agreed Fibsy. &ldquo;It may yet cut the Gorgian knot! Why, Mr. Stone,  the sewing lady knew that knife. She was here to lunching a few days before the  moider, an&rsquo; she says she always sat at the table in the dining room to eat,  after Miss Van Allen got through. An&rsquo; she says that knife was there, &lsquo;cos they  had steak, an&rsquo; she used it herself. I described the fork puffeckly, an&rsquo; she  reckernized it at onct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a bright boy!&rdquo; I exclaimed in involuntary tribute to this clever bit of work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  &lsquo;ssociated with Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Fibsy, with a quiet twinkle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was clever,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, myself, that the absence of that small  carving knife means something, but I can&rsquo;t fit it in yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went up to the dining-room to look again at the carving fork, still in its  place on the sideboard. I was always thrilled at a return to this room&mdash;always  reminded of the awful tableau I had seen there.</p>
  <p>The  long, slender fork lay in its place. Though it had been repeatedly examined and  puzzled over, it had been carefully replaced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; I offered, &ldquo;why a carving-knife should figure in the matter at  all when the crime was committed with the little boning-knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  why the missing carving-knife ought to be a clue,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;because its  connection with the case is inexplicable. Now, where is that knife? Fibsy,  where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone&rsquo;s frequent appeals to the boy were often in a half-bantering tone, and  yet, rather often, Terence returned an opinion or a bit of conjecture that  turned Stone&rsquo;s cogitations in a fresh direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, sir,&rdquo; he said, this time, &ldquo;that knife is in this house. It&rsquo;s gotter be.  That lady left the house in a mighty hurry but all the same she didn&rsquo;t go out a  brandishin&rsquo; of a carvin&rsquo;-knife! Nor did she take it along an drop it in the  street or an ash can for it&rsquo;d been found. So, she siccreted it summer, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s  still in the house&mdash;unless&mdash;yes, unless she has taken it away since. You know,  Mr. Stone, the Van Allen has been in this house more times than you&rsquo;d think  for. Yes, sir, she has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lots  o&rsquo; ways. Frinst&rsquo; on Sat&rsquo;day, I noticed a clean squarish place in the dust on a  table in the lady&rsquo;s bedroom, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s where a book was. That book disappeared  durin&rsquo; Friday night. I don&rsquo;t remember seein&rsquo; the book, I didn&rsquo;t notice it, to  know what book it was, but the clean place in the dust couldn&rsquo;t get there no  other way. Well, all is, it shows Miss Vick comes an&rsquo; goes pretty much as she  likes&mdash;or did till you&rsquo;n me camped out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think she left the knife here that night, and has since returned and taken  it away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  donno,&rdquo; Fibsy scowled in his effort to deduce the truth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  darted from the room and up the stairs. Stone rose to follow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  boy is uncanny at times,&rdquo; he said, seriously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only too glad to follow his  intuitions, and not seldom; he&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went upstairs, and then on up to the next floor. Fibsy was in Vicky Van&rsquo;s  dressing room, staring about him. He stood in the middle of the floor, his  hands in his pockets, wheeling round on one heel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  say she ran upstairs &lsquo;fore she flew the coop,&rdquo; he murmured, not looking at us. &ldquo;That  Miss Weldon said that. Well, if she did, she natchelly came up here for a cloak  an&rsquo; bonnet. I&rsquo;ll never believe that level-headed young person went out into the  cold woild in her glad rags, an&rsquo; no coverin&rsquo;. Well, then, say, she lef&rsquo; that  knife here, locked up good an&rsquo; plenty. Where&mdash;<i>where</i>, I say, would she  siccrete it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glared round the room, as if trying to wrest the secret from its inanimate  contents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stone says that walls have tongues. I believe it, an&rsquo; I know these walls are  jest yellin&rsquo; the truth at me, an&rsquo; yet, I&rsquo;m so soul-deef I can&rsquo;t make out their  lingo! Well, let&rsquo;s make a stab at it. Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;ll lay you that knife is in  some drawer or cubbid in this here very room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,  Fibsy,&rdquo; said Stone, cheerfully. &ldquo;Where shall we look first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  over.&rdquo; And Fibsy darted to a wardrobe and began feeling among the gowns and  wraps hanging there. With a touch as light as a pickpocket&rsquo;s he slid his  lightning-like fingers through the folds of silk and tulle, and turned back  with a disappointed air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisked  the whole pack; nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t give up the ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  didn&rsquo;t. Having something definite to do, we did it thoroughly, and two men and  a boy fingered every one of Vicky Van&rsquo;s available belongings in an amazingly  short space of time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  for this chest,&rdquo; said Fibsy, indicating a large low box on rollers that he  pulled out from under the couch.</p>
  <p>It  was locked, but Stone picked it open, and threw back the cover. At the bottom  of it, beneath several other gowns, we found the costume Vicky had worn the  night of the murder!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good land!&rdquo; ejaculated Fibsy, &ldquo;the gold-fringed rig! Ain&rsquo;t it classy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  lifted out the dress, heavy with its weight of gold beads, and held it up to  view. On the flounces were stains of blood! And from the wrinkled folds fell,  with a clatter to the floor, the missing carving-knife!</p>
  <p>I  stooped to pick up the knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Scuse  me, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; cried Fibsy, grasping my hand, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch it! Finger  prints, you know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,  boy!&rdquo; and Stone nodded, approvingly. &ldquo;Pick it up, Fibsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo;  and taking from his pocket a pair of peculiar shaped tongs, Terence carefully  lifted the knife and laid it on the glass-topped dressing table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probly  all smudged anyway,&rdquo; he muttered, squinting closely at the knife. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s  sure some marks on it! Gee, Mr. Stone, there&rsquo;s sumpum doin&rsquo;!&rdquo; His eyes shone  and his skinny little fingers trembled with excitement of the chase.</p>
  <p>Stone  studied the gold-fringed dress. The blood stains on the flounces, though dried  and brown, were unmistakable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful  woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve got this dress, and what of it? She put it  here, not caring whether we got it or not. She&rsquo;s gone for good. She&rsquo;ll never be  taken. This proves it to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the knife?&rdquo; I asked, thrilling with interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are again. If Miss Van Allen put that there for us to discover, the marks  on it are of no use. Perhaps some she had put there purposely. You see, I&rsquo;m  inclined to grant her any degree of cleverness from what I know of her ability  so far. She is a witch. She can hoodwink anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  F. Stone, Esquire,&rdquo; amended Fibsy. &ldquo;You pussieve, Mr.<br>
    Calhoun, the far-famed detective, is already onto her coives!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  looked up to smile at the boy&rsquo;s speech, but he returned his gaze to the  golden-trimmed gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is improbable that she took this off before she left the  house that night. I opine she threw a big cloak round her and rushed out to the  house of some friend. Likely she found a taxicab or even commandeered some  waiting private car for her flight. You know, we are dealing with no ordinary  criminal. Now, if I am right, she brought this gown back here on some of her  subsequent trips. As to the knife, I don&rsquo;t know. I see no explanation as yet.  Since she stabbed her victim with another knife&mdash;why in the world hide this one  up here? What say, Fibsy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Way  past me. Maybe she was usin&rsquo; both knives, an&rsquo; the other one turned the trick,  an&rsquo; when she got up here she seen she had this one still in her grip, an&rsquo; she  slung it in this here chest to hide it. I ain&rsquo;t sure that&rsquo;s the c&rsquo;reck answer,  but it&rsquo;ll do temp&rsquo;rar&rsquo;ly. I say, Mr. Stone, I got an awful funny thing to ask  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t be the first funny thing you&rsquo;ve asked me, Terence. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s pretty near eatin&rsquo; time, an&rsquo;&mdash;aw, pshaw, I jest can&rsquo;t dare to say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  ahead, old chap, I can&rsquo;t do more than annihilate you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I wanna go to the Schuylerses to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  dinner!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. An&rsquo; not to the kitchen eats, neither. I wanta set up to their gran&rsquo; table  with their butlerses an&rsquo; feetmen, an&rsquo; be a nonnerd guest. Kin I, Mr. Stone?  Say, kinni?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone looked at the eager, flushed face. He knew and I did, too, that there was  something back of this request. But it couldn&rsquo;t be anything of vital importance  to our mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I understand,&rdquo; said Stone, suddenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken a desperate fancy to Mrs.  Schuyler and you want to further the acquaintance. But it isn&rsquo;t often done that  way, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw,  now, don&rsquo;t kid me, Mr. Stone. Either lemme go or shut down on it, one o&rsquo; the  six! But it&rsquo;s most nessary, I do assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  she won&rsquo;t have you. Why should those grand ladies allow a boy of your age at  their dinner-table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you ask &lsquo;em, sir.&rdquo; Fibsy&rsquo;s tone was full of a quiet dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, I&rsquo;ll ask them,&rdquo; and Stone went away to the telephone.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  stood, looking raptly at the gold gown, and now and then his eyes turned toward  the knife on the dressing-table. The table was covered with silver toilet  implements, and save for its unfitting suggestion, the knife was unnoticeable  among the other trinkets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; said Stone, returning. &ldquo;Mrs. Schuyler sends a cordial invitation  for all three of us to dine with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  obliged, I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; said Fibsy, unsmilingly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter XVIII<br>
    Fibsy Dines Out</b></h2>
  <p>That  dinner at Ruth Schuyler&rsquo;s was memorable. And, yet, it was in no way markedly  unusual. The service was perfect, as might be expected in that well-ordered  household, and the guests were well behaved. Fibsy, thanks to Fleming Stone&rsquo;s  thoughtful kindness, was arrayed in the proper dinner garb of a schoolboy, and  his immaculate linen and correct jacket seemed to invest him in a mantle of  politeness that sat well on his youthful buoyancy and enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>I  glanced round the table. It was a strange combination of people. Fleming Stone  was the sort of man who is at ease anywhere, and I, too, am adaptable by  nature. But the Schuyler sisters were very evidently annoyed at the idea of  receiving as an equal the youth whom they regarded as a mere street arab.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  had become a firm friend of Ruth&rsquo;s, but he couldn&rsquo;t seem to like the other  ladies, and he with difficulty refrained from showing this.</p>
  <p>The  Misses Schuyler were impressive in their heavy and elaborate mourning, and to  my mind Ruth looked far more appropriately dressed.</p>
  <p>She  wore a black and white striped chiffon, with touches of black silk, and the  effect, with her pale face and fair hair was lovely. A breastknot of valley  lilies added to the loveliness, and I allowed my eyes to feast on her fairness.  I had thought Ruth was not what could be called a pretty woman, certainly she  was not beautiful; but that night her charm appealed to me more strongly than  ever, and I concluded that her air of high-bred delicacy and infinite fineness  were more to be desired than mere beauty.</p>
  <p>Fibsy,  too, devoured her with his eyes, though discreetly, and when he thought he was  not observed.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone devoted himself to the sisters; probably, I concluded, because he was in  their employ, and so owed them his attention.</p>
  <p>Ruth  wore her beautiful pearls, and referred to the fact, half-apologetically,  saying that Mr. Schuyler had liked always to see them on her, and she felt  privileged to continue to use them, even in her mourning period.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  like only poils&mdash;pearls, don&rsquo;t you, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy&rsquo;s  slip of pronunciation was due to his slight embarrassment at his novel  surroundings, but he valiantly corrected himself and ignored it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like other gems,&rdquo; Ruth replied, &ldquo;but Mr. Schuyler preferred pearls, and gave me  such beauties that I have grown very fond of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember, Ruth,&rdquo; said Sarah, reminiscently, &ldquo;how you used to beg Randolph for  sapphires and diamonds instead. You even wanted semi-precious stones&mdash;turquoises  and topaz. Oh, I remember. But Randolph taught you that pearls were the best  taste for a young matron and you grudgingly acquiesced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not grudgingly, Sarah,&rdquo; and Ruth flushed at the reprimand in her sister&rsquo;s  voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  grudgingly. Even unwillingly. In fact, all Randolph&rsquo;s decisions you fought  until he made you surrender. You know how you wanted gay-colored gowns until he  made you see that grays and mauves were better taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind my peccadilloes,&rdquo; said Ruth, lightly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk of something less  personal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  talk about the weather,&rdquo; suggested Fibsy, who was not conducting himself on the  seen and not heard plan. &ldquo;The park is fine now. All full o&rsquo; red an&rsquo; gold autumn  leaves. Have you noticed it, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  especially,&rdquo; and Ruth smiled at him, in appreciation of his conversational  help. &ldquo;I must walk over there to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rsquo;m.  An&rsquo; why don&rsquo;t you go for a long motor; ride up Westchester way? The scenery&rsquo;s  great!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know, have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  just lately, but I was last fall. Do you remember the big trees just at the  turn of the road by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Ruth was not listening to the child. Stone had said something that claimed her  attention.</p>
  <p>However,  Fibsy was unabashed. With no trace of forwardness, but with due belief in his  security of position as a guest, he continued to chatter to Ruth, and rarely  addressed any one else.</p>
  <p>He  has something up his sleeve, I thought, for I was beginning to have great faith  in the lad&rsquo;s cleverness.</p>
  <p>He  sat at Ruth&rsquo;s left hand, Stone being in the seat of the honor guest, and as  that left me between the two sisters, I was doomed to participate in their  chatter. But I was opposite my hostess and could enjoy looking at her in the  intervals of conversation.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  I chanced to look up and I saw Fibsy&rsquo;s comical little face drawn with grimaces  as he sang a snatch of a popular song.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My  heart goes twirly-whirly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;When I see my pearlie girlie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  what is that next line? With her&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  her ring-around-a-rosy curls!&rdquo; supplemented Ruth, her own face breaking into  laughter, as, caught by the infection of Fibsy&rsquo;s waggish gayety, she rounded  out the phrase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Fibsy, eagerly, &ldquo;and</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her  teeth like little shining pearls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, she&rsquo;s my queen of all the girls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little twirly-whirly, pearlie Girlie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  and Fibsy finished the silly little song in concert, and Stone clapped his  hands in applause.</p>
  <p>Rhoda  sniffed and Sarah acidly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you, Ruth? I wish you&rsquo;d be a little more dignified.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quickly  the light went out of Ruth&rsquo;s eyes. She looked reproved, and though she didn&rsquo;t  resent it, a patient sadness came into her eyes, and I resolved that I would do  all I could to get it arranged that she should live apart from the two carping,  criticizing sisters.</p>
  <p>After  dinner we had coffee in the library. Again, Fleming Stone took it upon himself  to entertain the Misses Schuyler, and I drifted toward Ruth. She sat down on a  sofa and motioned Fibsy to sit beside her. I drew a chair up to them and  thanked a kind fate that let us all leave the table at once, dispensing with a  more formal tarrying of the men.</p>
  <p>After  the coffee there were liqueurs. I glanced at Fibsy to see if he accepted a tiny  glass from the butler&rsquo;s tray.</p>
  <p>He  did, and, moreover, he examined the contents with the air of a connoisseur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oo  de vee de Dantzic,&rdquo; he remarked, holding up his glass and gazing at the gold  flecks in it.</p>
  <p>We  all smiled at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  favorite cordial, Terence?&rdquo; asked Stone, affably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir.  Don&rsquo;t you love it, Mrs. Schuyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, and then, &ldquo;why, no, I don&rsquo;t love it, child. But one gets accustomed  to something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  don&rsquo;t you like it better than Cream de mint or Benediction?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
  <p>Ruth  laughed outright. &ldquo;How do you know those names, you funny boy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  &lsquo;em on the big signboards,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;They have the biggest billboards in  New York for one of these lickures. I forget which one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  are what I like,&rdquo; said Ruth, smiling, as the footman passed a small bowl of  sugared rose-leaves and crisp green candied mint leaves. &ldquo;Take some, Terence.  They&rsquo;re better for you than liqueurs. Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are good,&rdquo; and Fibsy obeyed her. &ldquo;They taste like goin&rsquo; into a florist&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they do,&rdquo; agreed Ruth, herself taking a goodly portion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo;  said Rhoda. &ldquo;I think these things are silly. Randolph would never allow them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Rhoda, there&rsquo;s no harm in a few candies,&rdquo; protested Ruth, and then she changed  the subject quickly, for she evaded a passage at arms with the sisters whenever  possible.</p>
  <p>The  talk, however, soon drifted to the never forgotten subject of the murder. The  sisters mulled over all they had heard or learned during the day and begged  Stone to propound theories or make deductions therefrom.</p>
  <p>Stone  obeyed, as that was what he was employed for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Miss Van Allen is masquerading as somebody else,&rdquo; he affirmed. &ldquo;I believe  she is in some house not very far from this neighborhood, under the care of  some friend and accompanied and looked after by her maid Julie. I believe she is  in touch with all that goes on, not only from the newspapers but by means of  some spy system or secret investigation. But the net is drawing round her. I  cannot say just how, but I feel sure that we shall yet get her. It was a  grievous mischance that I let her escape last night, but I shall have another  chance at her, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then you&rsquo;ll arrest her,&rdquo; said Rhoda, with a snap of her thin lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare say. Lowney tells me the finger prints on the little knife with which Mr.  Schuyler was killed are clear and unmistakable, but we have not yet found out  whose they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  can you?&rdquo; said Ruth, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we find Miss Van Allen,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;we can at least see if they are her&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  said Fibsy contemptuously, &ldquo;why did&rsquo;n&rsquo; youse tell me before that you had the  claw prints? I kin get Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s all right, all right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  said I, for Fibsy had lapsed into the careless speech that meant business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over  to her house. Why, they&rsquo;re all over. I&rsquo;ve only gotto photygraph some brushes an&rsquo;  things on her dressin&rsquo; table to get all the prints you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t give us what we want.<br>
    Nobody doubts that Miss Van Allen held the knife that stabbed Mr.<br>
    Schuyler, and to prove it would be a certain satisfaction. But what we<br>
    want is the woman herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was then that I noticed Ruth&rsquo;s maid, Tibbetts, hovering in the hall outside the  library door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may go home, Tibbetts,&rdquo; Ruth said to her, kindly. &ldquo;These gentlemen will stay  late and I&rsquo;ll look after them myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tibbetts  went away, and Ruth said, explanatorily, &ldquo;My maid is a treasure. I&rsquo;d like to  have her live here, but she is devoted to her own little roof tree and I let  her off whenever possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  knew Tibbets had a home over on Second or Third Avenue, and I thought it kind  of Ruth to indulge her in this. But after a change of domicile herself perhaps  Ruth would arrange differently for her maid. And, too, as Winnie had often told  me of Ruth&rsquo;s cleverness and efficiency in looking after herself and her  belongings, I well knew she could get along without a maid whenever necessary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you ever trace that picture in Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s watch?&rdquo; Ruth asked, a few moments  later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I said. &ldquo;It was just as we supposed. A little vaudeville actress whom Mr.  Schuyler had taken out to supper gave it to him, and he stuck it in his watch  case, temporarily. Her name is Dotty Fay and she seemed to know little about  Mr. Schuyler and cared less. Merely the toy of an evening, she was to him, and  merely a chance that the picture was in his watch the night of his visit to  Vicky Van&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  had come to discuss the personal matters of Randolph Schuyler thus freely, for  we were all at one in our search for the truth, and there were no secrets or  evasions among us.</p>
  <p>Ruth  sighed, but I knew her dear face so well now that I realized it was not from  personal sorrow, but a general regret that a man of Schuyler&rsquo;s ability and  power should have been such a weakling, morally. I knew she had never loved her  husband, but she had been a faithful and dutiful wife, and no word or hint of  blame had ever escaped her lips regarding him. She had been a martyr, but I  hadn&rsquo;t learned this from her. The sisters, though unconsciously, told me much  of the deprivation and narrowness of Ruth&rsquo;s life. Schuyler had ruled her with a  rod of iron, and she had never rebelled, though at times her patience was  nearly worn out.</p>
  <p>Later  in the evening Fibsy asked for some phonograph music, expressing his great  delight in hearing a really fine instrument and good records.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt if you&rsquo;ll care for our selections,&rdquo; Ruth remarked, as she looked over the  cabinet of records. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost all classical or old-fashioned songs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like the classical kind,&rdquo; Fibsy said, endeavoring to be agreeable.<br>
  &ldquo;Please play the gayest you have, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  there were few &ldquo;gay&rdquo; ones in the collection. Wagner&rsquo;s operas and Beethoven&rsquo;s  solemn marches gave forth their noble numbers and Fibsy sat, politely  listening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  ragtime, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; he said, after a particularly depressing fugue resounded  its last echoes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  and Ruth glanced at him. &ldquo;Mr. Schuyler didn&rsquo;t care for rag time&mdash;on the  phonograph,&rdquo; she added, perhaps remembering Dotty Fay.</p>
  <p>We  stayed late. Several times Stone proposed our departure, but Ruth urged us to  remain longer or began some subject of interest that held us in spite of  ourselves. I had never seen her so entertaining. Indeed, I had never before  seen her in what might be called a society setting. She was a charming hostess,  and the occasion seemed to please her, for there was a pink flush on her cheeks  and an added brightness to her gray eyes that convinced me anew of the joy she  could take in simple pleasures.</p>
  <p>She  singled out Fibsy for her especial attentions, and the boy accepted the honor  with a gentle grace that astounded me. When talking to her he lost entirely his  slang and uncouth diction and behaved as to the manner born. He was  chameleonic, I could see, and he unconsciously took color from his  surroundings.</p>
  <p>And  sometimes I caught him gazing at Ruth with a strange expression that mingled  amazement and sadness, and I couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all.</p>
  <p>Again,  I would find Ruth&rsquo;s eyes fixed on me with a beseeching glance that might mean  anything or nothing.</p>
  <p>As  a whole the atmosphere seemed surcharged with a nameless excitement, almost a  terror, as if something dire were impending. Once or twice I saw Stone and  Terence exchange startled glances, but they rarely looked at each other.</p>
  <p>There  was something brewing, of that I was sure. But whatever it was it did not  affect the Schuyler sisters. They were eager to talk, anxious to hear, but they  felt nothing of the undercurrent of mysterious meaning that affected the rest  of us.</p>
  <p>I  was glad when the time came to go. It was very late, nearly midnight, and I  marveled to see that Ruth showed no sign of weariness. The sisters had been  frankly yawning for some time, but Ruth&rsquo;s eyes were unnaturally bright, and her  pale cheeks showed a tiny red spot on either side.</p>
  <p>She  shook hands nervously and her voice trembled as she said good-night.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone and the boy were moved, I could see that, but they made their adieux  without reference to future meeting or further work on the mystery.</p>
  <p>We  went away, and as we turned the corner, I started to cross the street to go to  my home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  into the Van Allen house a few minutes, Calhoun,&rdquo; said Stone, gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went in at Vicky Van&rsquo;s. Stone&rsquo;s manner was ominous. He and Fibsy both were  silent and grave-looking.</p>
  <p>We  went in at the street door, into the hall and then to the living-room.</p>
  <p>Stone  and I sat down, and Fibsy darted out to the dining-room, back to the hall and  up the stairs, flashing on lights as he went.</p>
  <p>In  silence Stone lighted a cigar and offered me one, which I took, feeling a  strange notion that the end of the world was about to come.</p>
  <p>In  another moment Fibsy came slowly down stairs, walked into the living-room,  where we were, gave one look at Stone, and then threw himself on a divan,  buried his face in the cushions and burst into tears. His thin little frame  shook with sobs, great, deep, heart-rending, nerve-racking sobs, that made my  own heart stand still with fear.</p>
  <p>What  could it all mean? What ailed the boy?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me, Stone,&rdquo; I begged, &ldquo;what is it? What has upset him so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has found Vicky Van,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone. &ldquo;And it has broken his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean? Don&rsquo;t keep me in this suspense! Where is Vicky?<br>
    Upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Stone, &ldquo;not now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain,  please,&rdquo; I said, beginning to get angry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Fibsy, &ldquo;no, Mr. Stone, let me t-t-tell. W-wait a minute,<br>
    I&rsquo;ll tell. Oh, <i>oh</i>, I knew it all day, b-b-but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it!<br>
    I <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> believe it! Why, Mr. Calhoun, Vicky Van is&mdash;is&mdash;why, Mrs.<br>
    Schuyler is Vicky Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
    Proofs And More Proofs</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are absolutely crazy!&rdquo; I said, laughing, though the laugh choked in my throat,  as I looked at Stone. &ldquo;You see, Fibsy, you&rsquo;re gone dotty over this thing, and  you&rsquo;re running round in circles. I know both Mrs. Schuyler and Miss Van Allen,  and they&rsquo;ve nothing in common. There couldn&rsquo;t be two people more dissimilar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I know,&rdquo; wailed the boy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I first caught on. You  see&mdash;oh, tell him, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  boy is right,&rdquo; said Stone, slowly. &ldquo;And the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can&rsquo;t be right! It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; I fairly shouted, as thoughts came flashing  into my mind&mdash;dreadful thoughts, appalling thoughts!</p>
  <p>Ruth  Schuyler and Vicky Van one person! Why, then, Ruth killed&mdash;No! a thousand times  NO! It couldn&rsquo;t be true! The boy was insane, and Stone was, too. I&rsquo;d show them  their own foolishness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop  a minute, Stone,&rdquo; I said, trying to speak calmly. &ldquo;You and the boy never knew  Vicky Van. You never saw her, except as she ran along the street for a few  steps at midnight. And Terence didn&rsquo;t see her then. It&rsquo;s too absurd, this  theory of yours! But it startled me, when you sprung it. Now, Fibsy, stop your  sobbing and tell me what makes you think this foolish thing, and I&rsquo;ll relieve  your mind of any such ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t blame you, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; and Fibsy mopped his eyes with his wet  handkerchief. He was a strange little figure, in his new clothes, but with his  red hair tumbled and his eyes big and swollen with weeping. &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t  believe it, but you listen a bit, while I tell Mr. Stone some things. Then you&rsquo;ll  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Terence,&rdquo; said Stone; &ldquo;go ahead. What about the prints?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  prove up,&rdquo; and Fibsy&rsquo;s woe increased afresh. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no shadder of doubt.  The very reason I know they&rsquo;re the same is &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re so unlike. Yes, I&rsquo;ll  explain&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  a crying spell overwhelmed him, and we waited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  he said, regaining self-control, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;ve spilled all my tears I&rsquo;ll out with  it. The first thing that struck me was the abserlute unlikeness of those two  ladies. I mean in their tastes an&rsquo; ways. Why, fer instance, an&rsquo; I guess it was  jest about the very first thing I noticed, was the magazines. In here, on Miss  Van Allen&rsquo;s table, as you can see yourself, is&mdash;jest look at &lsquo;em! Vogue, Vanity  Fair, Life, Cosmopolitan, an&rsquo; lots of light-weight story magazines. In at  Schuylers&rsquo; house is Atlantic Monthly, Harper&rsquo;s, Century, The Forum, The North  American Review, and a lot of other highbrow reading. An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t <i>only</i> that the magazines in here are gayer an&rsquo; lighter, an&rsquo; in there heavier an&rsquo;  wiser; but there isn&rsquo;t a single duplicate! Now, Miss Vicky Van likes good  readin&rsquo;, you can see from her books an&rsquo; all, so why don&rsquo;t she take Harper&rsquo;s an&rsquo;  Century? &lsquo;Cause she has &lsquo;em in her other home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  wait, child,&rdquo; I cried, getting bewildered; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean Vicky Van lives  sometimes in this house and sometimes in the Schuyler house as its mistress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  jest what I do mean. I know it sounds like I was batty, but let me tell more.  Well, it seemed queer that there shouldn&rsquo;t be any one magazine took in both  houses, but, of course, that wasn&rsquo;t no real proof. I only noticed it, an&rsquo; it  set me a thinkin&rsquo;. Then I sized up their situations. Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s dignified  an&rsquo; quiet in her ways, simple in her dress, wears only poils, no other  sparklers whatever. Vicky Van&rsquo;s gay of action, likes giddy rags, and adores  gorgeous jewelry, even if it ain&rsquo;t the most realest kind. Now, wait&mdash;don&rsquo;t  interrup&rsquo; me, Lemme talk it out. &lsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; I gotter get it  over with. Well, all Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s things&mdash;furnicher, I mean&mdash;is big an&rsquo; heavy  an&rsquo; massive, an&rsquo; terrible expensive. Yes, I know her husband made her have it  that way. But never mind that. Vicky Van&rsquo;s furnicher is all gay an&rsquo; light an&rsquo;  pretty an&rsquo; dainty colorin&rsquo; and so forth. And the day the old sister-in-laws was  in here they said, &lsquo;How Ruth would admire to have things like these! &lsquo;Member  how she begged Randolph to do up her boodore in wicker an&rsquo; pink silk?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s  what they said! Oh, well, I got a bug then that the two ladies I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo;  about was just the very oppositest I ever did see! Then, another thing was the  records. The phonygraft in here is full of light opery and poplar music like  that. Not a smell o&rsquo; fugues and classic stuff. An&rsquo; in at Schuyler&rsquo;s, as we seen  to-night, there&rsquo;s no gay songs, no comic operas, no ragtime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Terence,&rdquo; I broke in, &ldquo;that all proves nothing! The Schuylers don&rsquo;t care for  ragtime and Vicky Van does. You mustn&rsquo;t distort those plain facts to fit your  absurd theory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, his eyes burning as they glared into mine. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Mr. Schuyler he wouldn&rsquo;t  never let his wife go to the light operas or vodyville, an&rsquo; she hadn&rsquo;t any  records, so how&mdash;<i>how</i>, I ask you, comes it that she&rsquo;s so familiar with the  song about &lsquo;My Pearlie Girlie&rsquo; that she joined in the singin&rsquo; of it with me at  the dinner table to-night? That&rsquo;s what clinched it. Mrs. Schuyler, she knew  that song&rsquo;s well as I did, and she picked it up where I left off and hummed it  straight to the end&mdash;words <i>and</i> music! How&rsquo;d she know it, I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  she might have picked that up anywhere. She goes to see friends, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,  who are not so straight-laced as the Schuylers, and they play light tunes for  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  likely. I&rsquo;ve run down her friends, and they&rsquo;re all old fogies like the sister  dames or like old man Schuyler himself. The old ladies are nearly sixty and Mr.  Schuyler was fifty odd, and all their friends are along about those ages, and  Mrs. Schuyler, she ain&rsquo;t got any friends of her own age at all. But, as Vicky  Van, she has friends of her own age, yes, an&rsquo; her own tastes, an&rsquo; her own ways  of life an&rsquo; livin.&rsquo; An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s got the record of &lsquo;My Pearlie Girlie.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  true, Calhoun,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s all incredible, but it&rsquo;s true.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, myself, when Fibsy hinted it to me&mdash;for it&rsquo;s his find&mdash;to  him belongs all the credit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Credit!&rdquo;  I groaned. &ldquo;Credit for fastening this lie, this base lie&mdash;oh, you are well named  Fibsy!&mdash;on the best and loveliest woman that ever lived! For it is a lie! Not a  word of truth in it. A distorted notion of a crazy brain! A&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on, Calhoun,&rdquo; remonstrated Stone, and I dare say I was acting like a madman. &ldquo;Listen  to the rest of this more quietly or take your hat and go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  spoke firmly, but not angrily, and I sat still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  here&rsquo;s some more things,&rdquo; Fibsy continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone over this house with a  eye that sees more&rsquo;n Mr. Stone&rsquo;s lens, an&rsquo; it don&rsquo;t magnerfy, neither. I  spotted a lot of stuff in the pantry and storeroom. It&rsquo;s all stuff that keeps,  you know; little jugs an&rsquo; pots of fine eatin&rsquo;&mdash;imported table delicacies&mdash;that&rsquo;s  what they call &lsquo;em. Well, an&rsquo; among &lsquo;em was lickures an&rsquo; things like that. And  boxes of candied rose leaves an&rsquo; salted nuts&mdash;oh, all them things. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s  why I wanted to go to dinner at Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s an&rsquo; see if she liked to eat  those things. An&rsquo; she did! She had the rose leaves an&rsquo; she had the kind o&rsquo;  lickure that&rsquo;s down in the pantry cupboard in this house. An&rsquo; she said it was  her fav&rsquo;rite, an&rsquo; the old girls said she never used to have those things when  her husband was runnin&rsquo; the house&mdash;an&rsquo; oh, dear, can&rsquo;t you see it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I see it,&rdquo; said Stone, but I still shook my head doggedly and angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to all this but a pipe dream! Why  shouldn&rsquo;t two women like <i>Eau de vie de Dantzic</i> as a liqueur? It&rsquo;s very  fashionable&mdash;a sort of fad, just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  ain&rsquo;t only this thing or that thing, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; said Fibsy, earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the pilin&rsquo; up of all &lsquo;em. An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t through yet. Here&rsquo;s another point. Miss  Van Allen, she ain&rsquo;t got any pitchers of nature views&mdash;no landscapes nor woodsy  dells in this whole house. She jest likes pitchers of people&mdash;pretty girls, an&rsquo;  old cavalier gentlemen, an nymps, an&rsquo; kiddy babies&mdash;but all human, you know.  Now, Mrs. Schuyler, <i>she</i> don&rsquo;t care anythin&rsquo; special for nature, neither.  I piped up about the beauty scenery out Westchester way an&rsquo; over in the park,  an&rsquo; it left her cold an&rsquo; onintrusted. But she has portfolios of world  masterpieces, or whatever you call &lsquo;em, over to that house, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re all  figger pieces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  her writing desk,&rdquo; prompted Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir,  that checked up, too. You know, Mr. Calhoun, they ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; more intim&rsquo;tly  pers&rsquo;nal than a writin&rsquo; desk. Well, Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s has a certain make of pen,  an&rsquo; a certain number and kind of pencils. An&rsquo; Mrs. Schuyler, she uses the same  identical styles an&rsquo; numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  notepaper, I suppose,&rdquo; I flung back, sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, but that helps prove. The note paper in the two houses is teetumteetotally  different! That was planned to be different! Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s is a pale gray,  plain paper. Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s is light pink, to match her boodore, I s&rsquo;pose. An&rsquo;  it has that sort of indented frame round it, that&rsquo;s extry fashionable, an&rsquo; a  wiggly gold monogram, oh&mdash;quite a big one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  well remembered Vicky&rsquo;s stationery, and the boy described it exactly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proves  nothing!&rdquo; I said, contemptuously, but I listened further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; Fibsy said, wearily pushing back his shock of red hair. &ldquo;Well, then,  how&rsquo;s this? On Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s desk the pen wiper is a fancy little  contraption, but it&rsquo;s clean-I mean it&rsquo;s never had a pen wiped on it. Miss Van  Allen&rsquo;s desk hasn&rsquo;t got any pen wiper. On each desk is a pencil sharpener, of  the same sort. On each desk is a little pincushion, with the same size of tiny  pins, like she was in the habit of pinnin&rsquo; bills together or sumpum like that.  On each desk the blotter is in the same place and is used the same way. There&rsquo;s  a lot of pussonality &lsquo;bout the way folks use a blotter. Some uses both sides,  some only one side. Some has their blotters all torn an&rsquo; sorta nibbled round  the edges, an&rsquo; some has &lsquo;em neat and trim. Well, the blotters on these two  desks is jest alike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Fibsy,&rdquo; I cried in triumph, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the handwriting of these two ladies,  over and over again, and they&rsquo;re not a bit alike!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; and Fibsy nodded. &ldquo;But, Mr. Calhoun, did you know that<br>
    Miss Van Allen always writes with her left hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  and I don&rsquo;t believe she does!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir.  I went to the bank an&rsquo; they said so. An&rsquo; I asked the sewin&rsquo; woman, an&rsquo; she said  so. An&rsquo; I asked the caterer people an&rsquo; they said so. And the inkstand is on the  left-hand side of Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, then she is left-handed, but that proves nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, Miss Van Allen ain&rsquo;t left-handed. You know she ain&rsquo;t yourself. You&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo;  noticed it if she had been. But she writes left-handed, &lsquo;cause if she didn&rsquo;t  she&rsquo;d write like Mrs. Schuyler!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  rubbish!&rdquo; I began, but Fleming Stone interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  Calhoun, don&rsquo;t fly to pieces. All Terence is saying is quite true. I vouch for  it. Listen further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  ain&rsquo;t no use goin&rsquo; further,&rdquo; said Fibsy, despondently. &ldquo;Mr. Calhoun knows I&rsquo;m  right, only he can&rsquo;t bring himself to believe it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t blame him. Why,  even now, he&rsquo;s sizin&rsquo; up the case an&rsquo; everything he thinks of proves it an&rsquo;  nothin&rsquo; disproves it. But anyway, the prints prove it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prints?&rdquo;  I said, half dazedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessir.  I photographed a lot o&rsquo; finger prints in both houses, an&rsquo; the Headquarters  people fixed &lsquo;em up for me, magnerfied &lsquo;em, you know, an&rsquo; printed &lsquo;em on little  cards, an&rsquo; as you can see, they&rsquo;re all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  glanced at the sheaf of cards the boy had and Fleming Stone took them to  scrutinize.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got those prints from all sorts of places,&rdquo; Fibsy went on. &ldquo;Off of the glass  bottles and things in the bathrooms and off of the hair brushes and such  things, an&rsquo; off of the envelopes of letters, an&rsquo; off the chairbacks an&rsquo; any  polished wood surfaces, an&rsquo; I got lots of &lsquo;em in both houses, an&rsquo; the police  people picked out the best an&rsquo; cleanest an&rsquo; fixed &lsquo;em up, an&rsquo; there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  seemed to think this settled the matter. But I would not be convinced. Of  course, I&rsquo;d been told dozens of times that no two people in the world have  finger prints alike, but that didn&rsquo;t mean a thing to me. It might be, I told  them, that Vicky Van and Ruth Schuyler were friends, that Ruth had withheld  this fact, and that&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Stone, &ldquo;not friends, but identical&mdash;the same woman. And, listen to this.  Mrs. Schuyler heard us say this evening that Fibsy could photograph the brushes  and such things over here to get Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s finger prints, and what does  she do? She sends Tibbetts over to scrub and wipe off those same brushes, also  the mirrors, chairbacks and all such possible evidence. A hopeless task&mdash;for the  woman couldn&rsquo;t eradicate all the prints in the house. And, also, it was too  late, for Fibsy had already done his camera work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know she did all that?&rdquo; and I glowered at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Fibsy just told me he found evidences of this cleaning up, and, too, because  Mrs. Schuyler purposely kept us over there longer than we intended to stay. You  know how, when we proposed to say good-night, she urged us to stay longer. That  was to give her maid more time for the work. Now, Mr. Calhoun, go on with your  objections to our conclusions. It helps our theory to answer your refutations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  letters,&rdquo; I mumbled, scarce able to formulate my teeming thoughts. &ldquo;Vicky Van  sent a letter to Ruth Schuyler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, she did. Wrote it herself, with her left hand, and mailed it to her  other personality, in order to make the police give up the search. And, too,  the letter from Miss Van Allen, found in Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s desk after his  death, was written and placed there by Mrs. Schuyler for us to find.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  I cried. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow these libels. You&rsquo;ll be saying next that Ruth Schuyler killed  her husband!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did,&rdquo; asserted Fleming Stone, gravely. &ldquo;She did kill him, in her character as  Vicky Van. Don&rsquo;t you see it all? Schuyler came here as Somers, never dreaming  that Vicky Van was his own wife in disguise. Or, he may have suspected it, and  may have come to verify his suspicion. Any way, when she saw and recognized  him, whether he knew her or not, she lured him out to the dining room and  stabbed him with the caterer&rsquo;s knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  I said. I was not ranting now, I was stunned by the revelations that were  coming so thick and fast. I couldn&rsquo;t believe and yet I couldn&rsquo;t doubt. Of one  thing I was certain, I would defend Ruth Schuyler to the end of time. I would  defend her against Vicky Van&mdash;why, if Ruth was Vicky Van&mdash;where was this moil to end!  I couldn&rsquo;t think coherently. But I suddenly realized that what they told me was  true. I realized that all along there were things about Ruth that had reminded  me of Vicky. I had never put this into words, never had really sensed it, but I  saw now, looking back, that they had much in common.</p>
  <p>Appearance!  Ah, I hadn&rsquo;t yet thought of that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  I exclaimed, &ldquo;the two are not in the least alike, physically!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Van Allen wore a black wig,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;A most cleverly constructed one, and  she rouged her cheeks, penciled her eyelashes and reddened her lips to produce  the high coloring that marked her from Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought this over, dully. Yes, they were the same height and weight, they had  the same slight figure, but it had never occurred to me to compare their  physical effects. I was a bit near-sighted and I had never taken enough real  personal interest in Vicky to learn to love her features as I had Ruth&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; Fleming Stone was saying, though I scarce listened, &ldquo;you are the only  person that I have been able to find who knows both Miss Van Allen and Mrs.  Schuyler. No one else has testified who knows them both. So much depends on  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  get nothing from me!&rdquo; I fairly shouted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not the same woman at all. You&rsquo;re  all wrong, you and your lying boy there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  vehemence stultifies your own words,&rdquo; said Stone, quietly; &ldquo;it proves your own  realization of the truth and your anger and fury at that realization. I don&rsquo;t  blame you. I know your regard for Mrs. Schuyler, I know you have always been a  friend of Miss Van Allen. It is not strange that one woman attracts you, since  the other did. But you&rsquo;ve got to face this thing, so be a man and look at it  squarely. I&rsquo;ll help you all I can, but I assure you there&rsquo;s nothing to be  gained by denial of the self-evident truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  man,&rdquo; I said, trying to be calm, &ldquo;the whole thing is impossible! How could Mrs.  Randolph Schuyler, a well-known society lady, live a double life and enact Miss  Van Allen, a gay butterfly girl? How could she get from one house to the other  unobserved? Why wouldn&rsquo;t her servants know of it, even if her family didn&rsquo;t?  How could she hoodwink her husband, her sisters-in-law, and her friends? Why  didn&rsquo;t people see her leaving one house and entering the other? Why wasn&rsquo;t she  missed from one house when she was in the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  answerable questions,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;You know Miss Van Allen went away  frequently on long trips, and was in and out of her home all the time. Here  to-day and gone to-morrow, as every one testifies who knew her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was true enough. Vicky was never at home more than a few days at a time and  then absent for a week or so. Where? In the Fifth Avenue house as Ruth  Schuyler? Incredible! Preposterous! But as I began to believe at last, true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  I repeated; &ldquo;how could she manage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walls  have tongues,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;These walls and this house tell me all the story.  That is, they tell me this wonderful woman did accomplish this seemingly  impossible thing. They tell me how she accomplished it. But they do not tell me  why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no question about the why,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;If Ruth Schuyler did live two lives it&rsquo;s  easily understood why. Because that brute of a man allowed her no gayety, no  pleasure, no fun of any sort compatible with her youth and tastes. He let her  do nothing, have nothing, save in the old, humdrum ways that appealed to his  notion of propriety. But he himself was no Puritan! He ran his own gait, and,  unknown to his wife and sisters, he was a roue and a rounder! Whatever Ruth  Schuyler may have done, she was amply justified&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  in killing him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t kill him! Look here, Mr. Stone, even if all you&rsquo;ve said is true, you  haven&rsquo;t convicted her of murder yet. And you shan&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll protect that woman  from the breath of scandal or slander&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what it is when you accuse her  of killing that man! She never did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  remains to be seen,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone&rsquo;s deep gray eyes showed a sad  apprehension. &ldquo;But nothing can be done to-night. Can there, Terence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Stone, not to-night. No, by no means, not to-night! It wouldn&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; The  boy&rsquo;s earnestness seemed to me out of all proportion to his simple statement,  but I could stand no more and I went home, to spend the night in a dazed  wonder, a furious disbelief, and finally an enforced conviction that Vicky Van  and Ruth Schuyler were one and the same.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
    The Truth From Ruth</b></h2>
  <p>Next  morning I was conscious of but one desire, to get to Ruth and tell her of my  love and faith in her, and assure her of my protection and assistance whatever  happened.</p>
  <p>Whatever  happened! The thought struck me like a knell. What could happen but her arrest  and trial?</p>
  <p>But  as I went out of my own door&mdash;I left the house early, for I couldn&rsquo;t face Aunt  Lucy and Winnie&mdash;I suddenly decided it would be better to see Stone first and  learn if anything had transpired since I left him.</p>
  <p>I  rang the bell at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house with a terrible feeling of impending  disaster, that might be worse than any yet known.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  let me in. I wanted to hate that boy and yet his very evident adoration of Ruth  Schuyler made me love him. I knew all that he had discovered had been as iron  entering his soul, but his duty led him on and he dared not pause or falter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  may as well tell him,&rdquo; he said to Stone, and the detective nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  come downstairs with us and have a cup of coffee first,&rdquo; Stone said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  need it, as you say you&rsquo;ve had no breakfast. Fibsy makes first-rate coffee, and  I can tell you, Calhoun, you&rsquo;ve a hard day before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you learned anything further?&rdquo; I managed to stammer out as we went down to the  basement room that they used as a dining-room now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  as I told you, walls have tongues, and the walls have given up the secret of  how Mrs. Schuyler managed her two-sided existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he would not tell me the secret until I had been fortified with two cups of  steaming Mocha, which fully justified his praise of Fibsy&rsquo;s culinary prowess.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  himself said nothing beyond a brief &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; and the lad&rsquo;s eyes were red  and his voice shook as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew,&rdquo; Stone said, as we finished breakfast, &ldquo;that there must be some means,  some secret means of communication between the two houses, the Schuyler house  and this. You see, the Schuyler house, fronting on Fifth Avenue, three doors  from the corner, runs back a hundred feet, and abuts on the rear rooms of this  house, which runs back from the side street. In a word, the two houses form a  right angle, and the back wall of the Schuyler house is directly against the  side wall of the rear rooms of this house. Therefore, I felt sure there must be  an entrance from one house to the other, not perceivable to an observer. And,  of course, it must be in Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s own rooms; it couldn&rsquo;t be in their  dining-room or halls. A few questions made me realize that Miss Van Allen&rsquo;s  boudoir was separated from Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s bath room by only the partition wall  of the houses. And I said that wall must speak to me. And it did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were now on our way upstairs, Stone ready at last to let me into the secret he  had discovered.</p>
  <p>We  went to Vicky&rsquo;s boudoir, and he continued: &ldquo;You know you found the strand of  gilt beads caught in this mirror frame. We all assumed Miss Van Allen had  flirted it there as she dressed for her party, but I reasoned that it might  have caught there as she escaped to the Schuyler house the night of the murder.  Yes, she did escape this way&mdash;look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  touched a hidden spring and the mirror in the Florentine frame slid silently  aside into the wall, leaving an aperture that without doubt led into the next  house. The frame remained stationary, but the mirror slid away as a sliding  door works, and so smoothly that there was absolutely no sound or jar.</p>
  <p>I  saw what was like a small closet, about two feet deep and perhaps three feet  wide. At the back of it, that is, against the walls of the adjoining room in  the other house, we could see the shape of a similar door, and the secret was  out. There was no need to open that other door to know that it led to Ruth  Schuyler&rsquo;s rooms. There was yet more telltale evidence. In the little cupboard  between the houses was a small safe. This Stone had opened and in it was the  black wig of Vicky Van and also a brown wig which I recognized at once as Julie&rsquo;s  well-remembered plainly parted front hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, Tibbetts is Julie,&rdquo; said Fibsy, in such a heart-broken and despairing  voice that I felt the tears rush to my own eyes.</p>
  <p>Vicky&rsquo;s  wig! The loops of sleek black hair, the soft loose knot behind, the delicate  part, all just as it crowned her little head&mdash;Ruth&rsquo;s head! Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t stand  it! It was too fearful!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  other door,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;opens into Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s bathroom. That I know. You  see, she had to have this entrance from some room absolutely her own. Her  bathroom was safe from interruption, and when she chose she slipped through  from one house to the other and back at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; I insisted, shaking my head. &ldquo;If she came in here as  Ruth Schuyler why wasn&rsquo;t she seen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  before she was seen, she had made herself over into Victoria<br>
    Van Allen. She had donned wig and make-up, safe from interruption,<br>
    here in her boudoir. This make-up she removed before returning to the<br>
    Schuyler house in her role of Mrs. Schuyler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  it is diabolically clever, but quite understandable. Julie and Tibbetts are the  same. This confidential woman looked after her mistress&rsquo; safety on both sides.  She remained when Vicky Van disappeared. She looked after everything, took care  of details, attended to tradesmen and all such matters, and when ready followed  Mrs. Schuyler into the other house, or went from here to her rooms a few blocks  away and later came from them. When there were to be parties, Julie left the  Schuyler house early, came here and made preparations, and then as late as ten  or eleven o&rsquo;clock maybe, Mrs. Schuyler came in from her home, when her own  household thought her abed and asleep. She could go back in the early morning  hours, with no one the wiser. Or, if she chose and she did when her husband was  out of town, she could pretend she had gone away for a visit and stay here for  days at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to see. Truly the wall&rsquo;s tongue had spoken. If this awful theory of Stone&rsquo;s  were true, it could only be managed in this way. I remembered how long and how  often Vicky Van was absent from her home. I remembered that sometimes she was  late in arriving at her own parties, although she always came down from  upstairs in her party regalia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you come to suspect Tibbetts?&rdquo; I asked, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  teeth,&rdquo; said Fibsy. &ldquo;I saw that Tibbetts had false teeth, anyway, an&rsquo; I says,  why can&rsquo;t Julie&rsquo;s gold teeth be false, too? And they are. They&rsquo;re in the safe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  marvelous precautions they had taken! To think of having a set of teeth for the  maid Julie that should appear so different from those of Tibbetts! Surely this  thing was the result of long and careful planning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  glasses, too,&rdquo; went on Fibsy. &ldquo;You see, they made her different from Tibbetts  in appearance. That was all the disguise Tibbs had, the gold teeth, the big  rimmed specs and the brown scratch&mdash;wig, you know. But it was enough. Nobody  notices a servant closely, and these things altered her looks sufficient. Miss  Van Allen, now, she had a wig an&rsquo; a lot of colorin&rsquo; matter an&rsquo; her giddy  clothes. Nothin&rsquo; left to reckernize but her eyes, an&rsquo; they were so darkened by  the long dark lashes and brows that she fixed up that it made her eyes seem  darker. I got all this from the pitchers the artist lady made. You see, she  caught the color likeness but not the actual features. So I sized up the  resemblance of the real women. Oh, Mr. Stone, what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  duty, Terence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  I put forth my plea, that I might be allowed to go and see Ruth first; that I  might prepare her for the disclosures they would make, the discoveries they  would announce.</p>
  <p>But  Stone denied me. He said they would do or say nothing that would unnecessarily  hurt her feelings, but they must accompany me. Indeed, he implied, that it  might be as well for me not to go.</p>
  <p>But  I insisted on going, and we three went on our terrible errand.</p>
  <p>Ruth  received us in the library. She saw at once that her secret was known, and she  took it calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know,&rdquo; she said, quietly, to Stone. &ldquo;I am sorry. I hoped to hide my secret and  let Victoria Van Allen forever remain a mystery. But it cannot be. I admit all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  Ruth,&rdquo; I cried out. &ldquo;Admit nothing until you are accused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am accused,&rdquo; she responded, with a sad smile. &ldquo;I heard you talking in the  passage between the rooms. In my bathroom I could hear you distinctly. There is  there a mirror door also. It looks like an ordinary mirror and has a wide, flat  nickel frame, matching the other fittings. Yes, I had the sliding doors built  for the purposes which you have surmised. Shall I tell you my story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and let us hear it, too,&rdquo; came from the doorway, and the two sisters appeared,  agog with excitement and curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in,&rdquo; said Ruth, quietly. &ldquo;Sit down, please, I want you to hear it. Most of it  you know, Sarah and Rhoda, but I will tell it briefly to Mr. Stone, for I want  not leniency, but justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  seated myself at Ruth&rsquo;s side, and though I said no word I knew that she  understood that my heart and life were at her disposal and that whatever she  might be about to tell would not shake my love and devotion. It is not  necessary to use words when a life crisis occurs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was an orphan,&rdquo; Ruth said, &ldquo;brought up by a stern and Puritanical old aunt in  New England. I had no joy or pleasures in my childhood or girlhood days. I ran  away from home to become an actress. Tibbetts, my old nurse, who lived in the  same village, followed me to keep an eye on me and protect me in need. I was a  chorus girl for just one week when Randolph Schuyler discovered me and offered  to marry me if I would renounce the stage and also gay life of any sort and  become a dignified old-fashioned matron. I willingly accepted. I was only  seventeen and knew nothing of the world or its ways. As soon as we were married  he forbade me any sort of amusement or pleasure other than those practised by  his elderly sisters. I submitted and lived a life of slavery to his whims and  his cruelty for five years. He had agreed to let me have Tibbetts for my maid,  as he deemed her a staid old woman who would not encourage me in wayward  desires. Nor did she. But she realized my thraldom, my lonely, unhappy life, and  knew that I was pining away for want of the simple innocent pleasures that my  youth and light-hearted nature craved. I used to beg and plead for permission  to have a few young friends or to be allowed to go to a few parties or plays.  But Mr. Schuyler kept me as secluded as any woman in a harem. He gave me no  liberty, no freedom in the slightest degree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had been married about four years when I rebelled and began to think up a  scheme of a dual existence. I had ample time in the long lonely hours to perfect  my plans, and I had them arranged to the minutest detail long before I put them  in operation. Why, I practised writing with my left hand and acquired a  different speaking voice for a year before I needed such subterfuges. Had I  been able to persuade my husband to give me even a little pleasure or happiness  I would willingly have given up my wild scheme. But he wouldn&rsquo;t; so once when  he was away on a long trip, I had the passage between the two houses made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had previously bought the other house, under the name of Van Allen, for I had  money of my own, left me by an uncle that Mr. Schuyler knew nothing about. Of  course, this money came to me after I was married or I never should have wed  Randolph Schuyler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tibbetts&rsquo;  cousin, an expert carpenter, did the work, and, as he afterward went to England  to live, I had no fear of discovery that way. Indeed, there was little fear of  discovery in any way. I was expected to spend much of my time in my own  rooms&mdash;and my bedroom, dressing room and bath form a little suite by themselves  and can be locked off from the rest of the house. So, when I retired to my  rooms for the night I could go through into the other house and become Vicky  Van at my pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t believe such baseness!&rdquo; declared Rhoda Schuyler, &ldquo;such ingratitude to a  husband who was so good to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wasn&rsquo;t good to me,&rdquo; said Ruth, quietly, &ldquo;nor was I ungrateful. Randolph  Schuyler spoiled my life; he denied me everything I asked for, every innocent  pleasure and amusement. So, I found them for myself. I did nothing wrong. As  Victoria Van Allen I had friends and pleasures that suited my age and my love  of life, but there never was anything wrong or guilty in my house&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  you killed your husband!&rdquo; interrupted Sarah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  the night of Randolph Schuyler&rsquo;s appearance at Vicky Van&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Ruth went  on. &ldquo;I had been told of a Mr. Somers who wanted to know me, but I had no idea  it was my husband masquerading under a false name. He came there with Mr.  Steele. Of course, I recognized him, but he did not know me at once. I sat,  playing bridge, and wondering how I could best make my escape. I saw that he  didn&rsquo;t know me and then, suddenly as I sat, holding my cards, and he stood  beside me, he noticed a tiny scar on my shoulder. He made that scar himself,  one night, when he hit me with a hot curling iron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  I cried, unable to repress an exclamation of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was curling my hair with the tongs and he became angry at me for some trivial  reason, as he often did, and he snatched up the iron and hit my shoulder. It  made a deep burn and he was very sorry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whenever  he saw it afterward he said, &lsquo;Never again!&rsquo; meaning he would never strike me  again. Then, when he noticed the scar that night, although I had put on a light  scarf to cover it, he said &lsquo;Never again!&rsquo; in that peculiar intonation, and I  knew then that he knew Victoria Van Allen was his own wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ran out to the dining-room and he followed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you stabbed him!&rdquo; cried Rhoda; &ldquo;stabbed your husband! Murderess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; said Ruth, slowly. &ldquo;The jury must decide that. I must be tried,  I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Ruth!&rdquo; I cried, in agony. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that! You shall not be tried! You  didn&rsquo;t kill Schuyler! If you did it was in self-defence. Wasn&rsquo;t it? Didn&rsquo;t he  try to kill you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he did. He snatched the little carver from the sideboard and attacked me,&mdash;and  I&mdash;and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say it, Ruth&mdash;keep still!&rdquo; I ordered, beside myself with my whirling thoughts.  The little carving-knife!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you defended yourself with the caterer&rsquo;s knife&mdash;&rdquo; began Stone, but Fibsy wailed,  &ldquo;No! No! It wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler! I&rsquo;ve got the prints from the caterer&rsquo;s knife  and they ain&rsquo;t Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s at all! She didn&rsquo;t kill him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Tibbetts appeared in the library doorway. &ldquo;I did it myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right!&rdquo; and Fibsy&rsquo;s eyes gleamed satisfaction; &ldquo;she did! It&rsquo;s her fingermarks  on the knife that stabbed old Schuyler. They&rsquo;re plain as print! Nobody thought  of matching up those marks with Tibbetts&rsquo;s mitt! But I&rsquo;ll bet she did it to  save Mrs. Schuyler&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; and Tibbetts came into the room and stood facing us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  your story,&rdquo; said Stone, abruptly, as he looked at the white-faced woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it is,&rdquo; and Tibbetts looked fondly at Ruth as the latter&rsquo;s piteous glance met  hers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved and watched over Mrs. Schuyler all her life. I&rsquo;ve protected  her from her husband&rsquo;s brutality and helped her to bear his cruelty and  unkindness. When she conceived the plan of the double life I helped her all I  could, and I got my cousin to do the work on the houses that made it all  possible. Then, I was Julie, and I devoted my life and energies to keeping the  secret and allowing my mistress to have some pleasure out of her life. And she  did.&rdquo; Tibbets looked affectionately, even proudly, at Ruth. &ldquo;The hours she  spent in that house as Victoria Van Allen were full of simple joys and happy  occupation. She had the books and pictures and furniture that she craved. She  had things to eat and things to wear that she wanted. She went to parties and  she had parties; she went to the theatre and to the shops, and wherever she  chose, without let or hindrance. It did my heart good to see her enjoy herself  in those innocent ways.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Mr. Schuyler came. I knew the man. I knew that he came because he had heard of  the charm and beauty of Vicky Van. He had no idea he would find her his own  wife! When he did discover it I knew he would kill her. Oh, I knew Randolph  Schuyler! I knew nothing short of murder would satisfy the rage that possessed  him at the discovery. I prepared for it. I got the little boning-knife from the  pantry, and as Mr. Schuyler lifted the carver and aimed it at Ruth&rsquo;s breast I  drove the little knife into his vile, wicked, murderer&rsquo;s heart. And I&rsquo;m glad I  did it! I glory in it! I saved Ruth&rsquo;s life and I rid the world of a scoundrel  and a villain who had no right to live and breathe on God&rsquo;s earth! Now, you may  take me and do with me as you will. I give myself up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the truth. On the carving-knife appeared, plain as print, the finger marks  of Randolph Schuyler, proved a hundred times by prints photographed from his  own letters, toilet articles, and personal belongings in his own rooms. In his  mad fury at the discovery of Ruth masquerading as Vicky Van, and in his sudden  realization of all that it meant, he clutched the first weapon he saw, the  little carver, to end her life and gratify his madness for revenge. Just in  time, the watching Tibbets had intervened, stabbed Schuyler, and then ran  upstairs, to escape through the hidden doors to the other house.</p>
  <p>Ruth,  stunned at the sight of the blow driven by Tibbetts, and dazed by her own  narrow escape from a fearful death, picked up the carver that dropped from  Schuyler&rsquo;s lifeless hand and ran upstairs, too.</p>
  <p>She  had, she explained afterward, a hazy idea that she was picking up the knife  that Tibbetts had used, so bewildered was she at the swift turn of events. And  as she stooped over Schuyler in her frenzy the waiter had seen her and assumed  she was the murderer. This, too, explained the blood on the flounces of her  gown&mdash;it had brushed the fallen figure of her husband and became stained at the  touch.</p>
  <p>The  two women had, of course, slipped through the connecting mirror doors into the  Schuyler house, and long before the alarm was brought there they were  rehabilitated and ready to receive the news.</p>
  <p>Then  Ruth&rsquo;s quandary was a serious one. Innocent herself, she could not tell of her  double life without making the whole affair public and incriminating Tibbetts,  whom she loved almost as a mother and who had saved Ruth&rsquo;s life by a fraction  of a second. An instant&rsquo;s delay and Schuyler&rsquo;s knife would have been driven  into Ruth&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>So,  for Tibbetts&rsquo; sake, Ruth, perforce, kept the secret of Vicky Van.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not ashamed of it,&rdquo; she told us, frankly. &ldquo;There was nothing really wrong  in my living two lives. My husband denied me the pleasure and joy that life  owed me, so I found it for myself. I never had a friend or committed a deed or  said a word as Victoria Van Allen that all the world mightn&rsquo;t hear or know of.  And I should have owned up to the whole scheme at once except that it would  bring out the knowledge of Tibbetts&rsquo; act.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wished not to go back to the other house at all and should not have done so for  myself. But I had reasons&mdash;connected with other people. A friend, whom I love,  had asked the privilege of having certain letters sent her in my care, that is,  in care of Miss Van Allen, and I had to go in once or twice to rescue those and  so prevent a scandal that would ensue upon their discovery. For her sake I  risked going back there at night. Also, I wanted my address book, for it has in  it many addresses of people who are my charity beneficiaries. Mr. Schuyler  never allowed me to contribute to any charitable cause, and I have enjoyed  giving help to some who need and deserve it. These addresses I had to have, and  I have them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stone was right. The walls had tongues. He first noticed a little defect in the  green paint in the living room, which I had retouched. Winnie told me of this,  and I realized how clever Mr. Stone is. So, I threw away the paint I had used,  which was in here, and I carefully thought out what else was incriminating and  removed all I could from the other house. Fibsy noticed when I took a book from  a table, but that book I wanted, because&mdash;&rdquo; she blushed&mdash;&rdquo;because Mr. Calhoun had  given it to me and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could get it any other way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the walls told all, and at the last I knew it was only a question of time when  Mr. Stone or Terence would discover the doors. I suppose the strand of beads  that caught as I escaped that night gave a hint, but they would have found them  anyway. They are wonderful doors&mdash;in their working, I mean. No complicated  mechanism, but merely so well made and adjusted that a touch opens or closes  them, and absolutely silently. No one in this house ever dreamed the bathroom  mirror was anything but a mirror. And in the other house the elaborate  Florentine frame precluded all idea of a secret contrivance. The two feet of  thickness of the house walls made a tiny cupboard, where I had that small safe  installed, that we might put our wigs and such definitely incriminating bits of  evidence in hiding, also Vicky&rsquo;s jewelry. But I always changed my costumes from  one character to the other in Vicky Van&rsquo;s dressing-room, and so ran little or  no chance of discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a futile endeavor to distract attention from Victoria Van Allen I wrote a note  to Ruth Schuyler and also wrote the one found in Mr. Schuyler&rsquo;s desk. I did  these things in hopes that the detectives would cease to watch for the return  of Miss Van Allen, but it turned out differently. I assumed, of course, if  search could be diverted from that house into other channels there would be a  possibility of Tibbetts never being suspected. I am sorry she has confessed. I  do not want her to be tried. She saved my life, and I would do anything to keep  her from harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Tibbetts was tried and was acquitted. A just jury, knowing all of the facts,  declared it was a case of justifiable homicide, and the verdict was &ldquo;Not  guilty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Schuyler sisters were finally convinced that Ruth&rsquo;s life had been endangered by  their brother&rsquo;s rage, and, though they condemned Tibbetts in their hearts, they  said little in the face of public opinion.</p>
  <p>As  for me, I couldn&rsquo;t wait until a conventional time had elapsed before telling my  darling of my love for her own sweet self and, as I now realized, for Vicky Van  also. I spent hours listening to the details of her double life; of the narrow  escapes from discovery, and the frequent occasions of danger to her scheme. But  Tibbetts&rsquo; watchful eyes and Ruth&rsquo;s own cleverness had made the plan feasible  for two years, and it was only because Ruth had found her dear heart was  inclining too greatly toward me that she had begun to think it her duty to give  up her double life. She had recently decided to do so, for she was not willing  to let our mutual interest ripen into love while she was the wife of another  man.</p>
  <p>And  so, if it hadn&rsquo;t all happened just as it did, I should never have won my  darling, for she was about to give up the Van Allen house and I never should  have had occasion to meet Mrs. Randolph Schuyler.</p>
  <p>It  is all past history now, and Ruth and I are striving to forget even the  memories of it. We live in another city, and Tibbetts is our faithful and  beloved housekeeper.</p>
  <p>And  often Ruth says to me: &ldquo;I know you love me, Chet, but sometimes I can&rsquo;t help  feeling a little jealous of the girl you cared for&mdash;that, what&rsquo;s her name? Oh,  yes, Vicky Van!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vicky  Van was all right,&rdquo; I stoutly maintain. &ldquo;I never knew a more charming, sweeter,  prettier, dearer little girl than Vicky!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she was awfully made up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s where you score an advantage. The only thing about Vicky I disapproved  of was her paint and powder. Thank heaven, my wife has a complexion that&rsquo;s all  her own.&rdquo; And I kissed the soft, pale cheek of my own Ruth.</p>
