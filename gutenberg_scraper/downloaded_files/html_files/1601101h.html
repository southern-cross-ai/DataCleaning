  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter I<br>
    A President-Elect</b></h2>
  <p>Quite  aside from its natural characteristics, there is an atmosphere about a college  town, especially a New England college town, that is unmistakable. It is not so  much actively intellectual as passively aware of and satisfied with its own  intellectuality.</p>
  <p>The  beautiful little town of Corinth was no exception; from its tree-shaded village  green to the white-columned homes on its outskirts it fairly radiated a  satisfied sense of its own superiority.</p>
  <p>Not  that the people were smug or self-conceited. They merely accepted the fact that  the University of Corinth was among the best in the country and that all true  Corinthians were both proud and worthy of it.</p>
  <p>The  village itself was a gem of well-kept streets, roads and houses, and all New  England could scarce show a better groomed settlement.</p>
  <p>In  a way, the students, of course, owned the place, yet there were many families  whose claim to prominence lay in another direction.</p>
  <p>However,  Corinth was by all counts, a college town, and gloried in it.</p>
  <p>The  University had just passed through the throes and thrills of one of its own  presidential elections.</p>
  <p>The  contest of the candidates had been long, and at last the strife had become  bitter. Two factions strove for supremacy, one, the conservative side, adhering  to old traditions, the other, the modern spirit, preferring new conditions and  progressive enterprise.</p>
  <p>Hard  waged and hard won, the battle had resulted at last in the election of John  Waring, the candidate of the followers of the old school.</p>
  <p>Waring  was not an old fogy, nor yet a hide-bound or narrow-minded back number. But he  did put mental attainment ahead of physical prowess, and he did hold by certain  old-fashioned principles and methods, which he and his constituents felt to be  the backbone of the old and honored institution.</p>
  <p>Wherefore,  though his election was an accomplished fact, John Waring had made enemies that  seemed likely never to be placated.</p>
  <p>But  Waring&rsquo;s innate serenity and acquired poise were not disturbed by adverse  criticism, he was a man with an eye single to his duty as he saw it. And he  accepted the position of responsibility and trust, simply and sincerely with a  determination to make his name honored among the list of presidents.</p>
  <p>Inauguration,  however, would not take place until June, and the months from February on would  give him time to accustom himself to his new duties, and to learn much from the  retiring president.</p>
  <p>Yet  it must not be thought that John Waring was unpopular. On the contrary, he was  respected and liked by everybody in Corinth. Even the rival faction conceded  his ability, his sterling character and his personal charm. And their chagrin  and disappointment at his election was far more because of their desire for the  other candidate&rsquo;s innovations than of any dislike for John Waring as a man.</p>
  <p>Of  course, there were some who candidly expressed their disapproval of the new  president, but, so far, no real opposition was made, and it was hoped there  would be none.</p>
  <p>Now,  whether because of the exigencies of his new position, or merely because of the  irresistible charms of Mrs. Bates, Waring expected to make the lady his wife  before his inauguration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a good thing,&rdquo; his neighbor, Mrs. Adams, observed. &ldquo;John Waring ought to&rsquo;ve  been somebody&rsquo;s good-looking husband long ago, but a bachelor president of  Corinth is out of all reason! Who&rsquo;d stand by his side at the receptions, I&rsquo;d  like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  certain public receptions were dearly loved by the citizens of Corinth, and  Mrs. Adams was one of the most reception-loving of all.</p>
  <p>As  in all college towns, there were various and sundry boarding houses, inns and  hotels of all grades, but the boarding house of Mrs. Adams was, without a  dissenting voice, acclaimed the most desirable and most homelike.</p>
  <p>The  good lady&rsquo;s husband, though known as &ldquo;Old Salt,&rdquo; was by no means a seafaring  man, nor had he ever been. Instead, he was a leaf on a branch of the  Saltonstall family tree, and the irreverent abbreviation had been given him  long ago, and had stuck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams asserted, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve never had a bachelor president of Corinth  and I hope we never will. Mrs. Bates is a nice sweet-spoken lady, a widow of  four years standing, and I do say she&rsquo;s just the one for Doctor Waring&rsquo;s wife.  She has dignity, and yet she&rsquo;s mighty human.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Emily  Bates was human. Not very tall, a little inclined to plumpness, with fair hair  and laughing blue eyes, she was of a cozy, home-loving sort, and her innate  good nature and ready tact were unfailing.</p>
  <p>At  first she had resisted John Waring&rsquo;s appeal, but he persisted, until she found  she really liked the big, wholesome man, and without much difficulty learned to  love him.</p>
  <p>Waring  was distinguished-looking rather than handsome. Tall and well-made, he had a  decided air of reserve which he rarely broke through, but which, Emily Bates  discovered, could give way to confidences showing depths of sweetness and  charm.</p>
  <p>The  two were happily matched. Waring was forty-two and Mrs. Bates half a dozen  years younger. But both seemed younger than their years, and retained their  earlier tastes and enthusiasms.</p>
  <p>Also  both were bound up, heart and soul, in the welfare of the University. Mrs.  Bates&rsquo; first husband had been one of its prominent professors and its history  and traditions were known and loved by the cheery little lady.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  the only person in Corinth who was not pleased at the approaching nuptials of  John Waring and Emily Bates was Mrs. Peyton, Waring&rsquo;s present housekeeper. For  it meant the loss of her position, which she had faithfully filled for ten  years or more. And this meant the loss of a good and satisfactory home, not  only for herself, but for her daughter Helen, a girl of eighteen, who lived  there also.</p>
  <p>Not  yet had Waring told his housekeeper that she was to be dethroned but she knew  the notice would come,&mdash;knew, too, that it was delayed only because of John  Waring&rsquo;s disinclination to say or do anything unwelcome to another. And Mrs.  Peyton had been his sister&rsquo;s school friend and had served him well and  faithfully. Yet she must go, for the incoming mistress needed no other  housekeeper for the establishment than her own efficient, capable self.</p>
  <p>It  was a very cold February afternoon, and Mrs. Peyton was serving tea in the  cheerful living-room. Emily Bates was present; an indulgence she seldom allowed  herself, for she was punctilious regarding conventions, and Corinth people,  after all, were critical. Though, to be sure, there was no harm in her taking  tea in the home so soon to be her own.</p>
  <p>The  two women were outwardly most courteous, and if there was an underlying  hostility it was not observable on the part of either.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came today,&rdquo; Emily Bates said, as she took her tea cup from the Japanese butler  who offered it, &ldquo;because I want to tell you, John, of some rumors I heard in  the town. They say there is trouble brewing for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble  brewing is such a picturesque phrase,&rdquo; Waring said, smiling idly, as he stirred  his tea. &ldquo;One immediately visions Macbeth&rsquo;s witches, and their trouble brew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; Emily flashed an affectionate smile toward him, &ldquo;when the  phrase is used it often means something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  vague and indefinite,&rdquo; suggested Gordon Lockwood, who was Waring&rsquo;s secretary,  and was as one of the family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  necessarily,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates returned; &ldquo;more likely something definite, though  perhaps not very alarming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  as what?&rdquo; asked Waring, &ldquo;and from what direction? Will the freshmen make me an  apple-pie bed, or will the seniors haze me, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  serious, John,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates begged. &ldquo;I tell you there is a movement on foot to  stir up dissension. I heard they would contest the election.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Lockwood stated; &ldquo;nor would anybody try. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,  Mrs. Bates. I&rsquo;m sure we know all that&rsquo;s going on,&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any  &lsquo;trouble brewing&rsquo; for Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard it, too,&rdquo; vouchsafed Mrs. Peyton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not anything definite, but there  are rumors and hints, and where there&rsquo;s smoke, there&rsquo;s bound to be fire. I wish  you&rsquo;d at least look into it, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed Emily Bates, &ldquo;do look into it, John.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can I?&rdquo; Waring smiled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go from door to door, saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to  investigate a rumor,&rsquo; can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t be absurd!&rdquo; Mrs. Bates&rsquo; plump little hands fluttered in protest and then  fell quietly to rest in her lap. &ldquo;You men are so tactless! Now, Mrs. Peyton or  I could find out all about it, without any one knowing we were making inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you, then?&rdquo; asked Waring, and Mrs. Peyton gave a pleased smile as the  guest bracketed their names.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, if you say so.&rdquo; Emily spoke gravely. &ldquo;That is what I wanted to ask you. I  didn&rsquo;t like to take up the matter with any one unless you directly approved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  go ahead,&mdash;I see no harm in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Doctor Waring,&rdquo; put in Lockwood, &ldquo;is it wise? I fear that if Mrs. Bates takes  up this matter she may get in deeper than she means or expects to, and&mdash;well,  you can&rsquo;t tell what might turn up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so, Emily. As matters stand, you&rsquo;d best be careful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  John, how vacillating you are! First, you say go ahead, and then you say stop!  I don&rsquo;t mind your changing your opinions, but I do resent your paying so little  attention to the matter. You toss it aside without thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Waring thinks very quickly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peyton, and Emily gave her a slight  stare.</p>
  <p>It  was hard for the housekeeper to realize that she must inevitably lose her place  in his household, and the thought made her a little assertive while she still  had opportunity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it,&rdquo; was the reply Emily gave, and went on, addressing herself to the  two men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Persuade  him, Mr. Lockwood. Not of his duty, he never misapprehends that, but of the  necessity of looking on this matter as a duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pleader you are, Emily,&rdquo; and Waring gave her an admiring bow; &ldquo;I am almost  persuaded that my very life is in danger!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you won&rsquo;t be good!&rdquo; The blue eyes twinkled but the rosy little mouth took on a  mutinous pout. &ldquo;Well, I warn you, if you don&rsquo;t look out for yourself, I&rsquo;m going  to look out for you! And that, as Mr. Lockwood hints, may get you into trouble!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a contradictory little person it is! In an effort to get me out of trouble, you  admit you will probably get me into trouble. Well, well, if this is during our  betrothal days, what will you do after we are married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then you&rsquo;ll obey me implicitly,&rdquo; and the expressive hands indicated with a wide  sweep, total subjection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find him not absolutely easy to manage,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton declared, and though Emily  Bates said no word, she gave a look of superior managing power that brought the  housekeeper&rsquo;s thin lips together in a resentful straight line.</p>
  <p>This  byplay was unnoticed by large-minded John Waring, but it amused Lockwood, who  was an observer of human nature.</p>
  <p>Unostentatiously,  he watched Mrs. Peyton, as she turned her attention to the tea tray, and noted  the air of importance with which she continued her duties as hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  hot toast, Ito,&rdquo; she said to the well-trained and deferential Japanese. &ldquo;And a  few more lemon slices,&mdash;I see another guest coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  smiled out through the window, and a moment later a breezy young chap came into  the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,  folkses,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;Hello, Aunt Emily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave Mrs. Bates an audible kiss on her pretty cheek and bowed with boyish good  humor to Mrs. Peyton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Uncle Doctor?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How goes it, Lock?&rdquo; he went on, as he threw  himself, a little sprawlingly into an easy chair. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the fair Helen of  Troy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  jumped up as Helen Peyton came into the room. &ldquo;Why, Pinky,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when did  you come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  now, my girl, as you noted from your oriel lattice,&mdash;and came running down to  bask in the sunshine of my smiles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behave  yourself, Pinky,&rdquo; admonished his aunt, as she noted Helen&rsquo;s quick blush and  realized the saucy boy had told the truth.</p>
  <p>Pinckney  Payne, college freshman, and nephew of Emily Bates, was very fond of Doctor  Waring, his English teacher, and as also fond, in his boyish way, of his aunt.  But he was no respecter of authority, and, now that his aunt was to be the wife  of his favorite professor, also the President-elect of the college, he assumed  an absolute familiarity with the whole household.</p>
  <p>His  nickname was not only an abbreviation, but was descriptive of his exuberant  health and invariably red cheeks. For the rest, he was just a rollicking,  care-free boy, ring leader in college fun, often punished, but bobbing up  serenely again, ready for more mischief.</p>
  <p>Helen  Peyton adored the irrepressible Pinky, and though he liked her, it was no more  than he felt for many others and not so much as he had for a few.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea,  Mrs. Peyton? Oh, yes, indeed, thank you. Yes, two lemon and three sugar. And  toasts,&mdash;and cakies,&mdash;oh, what good ones! What a tuck! Alma Mater doesn&rsquo;t feed us  like this! I say, Aunt Emily, after you are married, may I come to tea every  day? And bring the fellows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  answer that,&mdash;you may,&rdquo; said John Waring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll revise the answer,&mdash;you may, with reservations,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates supplemented. &ldquo;Now,  Pinky, you&rsquo;re a dear and a sweet, but you can&rsquo;t annex this house and all its  affairs, just because it&rsquo;s going to be my home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  want to, Auntie. I only want you to annex me. You&rsquo;ll keep the same cook we have  at present, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked solicitously at her, over a large slice of toast and jam he was devouring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  and maybe not,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton spoke up. &ldquo;Cooks are not always anxious to be kept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  any rate, we&rsquo;ll have a cook, Pinky, of some sort,&rdquo; his aunt assured him, and  the boy turned to tease Helen Peyton, who was quite willing to be teased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw your beau today, Helen,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  one?&rdquo; she asked placidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there a crowd? Well, I mean the Tyler person. Him as hangs out at Old Salt&rsquo;s.  And, by the way, Uncle President,&mdash;yes, I am a bit previous on both counts, but  you&rsquo;ll soon have the honor of being both President and my uncle,&mdash;by the way, I  say, Bob Tyler says there&rsquo;s something in the wind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  straw to show which way it blows, perhaps,&rdquo; Waring said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  sir. But it&rsquo;s blowing. Tyler says there&rsquo;s a movement on foot to make things hot  for you if you take the Presidential chair with your present intentions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  intentions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; about athletics, and sports in general.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what are my so-called intentions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  say, you mean to cut out sport&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Pinckney, you know better than that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Doctor Waring, some seem to think that&rsquo;s what you have in mind. If you&rsquo;d  declare your intentions now,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Pinky, don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve enough on my mind in the matter of marrying  your aunt, without bringing in other matters till that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  to be married soon, Uncle Doc?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are. As soon as your aunt will select a pleasant day for the ceremony. Then,  that attended to, I can devote my mind and energies to this other subject. And  meanwhile, my boy, if you hear talk about it, don&rsquo;t make any  assertions,&mdash;rather, try to hush up the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&mdash;I see,&mdash;and I will, Doctor Waring. You don&rsquo;t want to bother with those  things till you&rsquo;re a settled down married man! I know just how you feel about  it. Important business, this getting married,&mdash;I daresay, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&mdash;and so much so, that I&rsquo;m going to take the bride-elect off right now, for a  little private confab. You must understand that we have much to arrange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run  along,&mdash;bless you, my children!&rdquo; Pinky waved a teacup and a sandwich beneficently  toward the pair, as they left the room and went off in the direction of the  Doctor&rsquo;s study.</p>
  <p>The  house was a large one, with a fine front portico upheld by six enormous fluted  columns.</p>
  <p>One  of the most beautiful of New England doorways led into a wide hall. To the  right of this was the drawing-room, not so often used and not so well liked as  the more cozy living-room, to the left as one entered, and where the  tea-drinking group now sat.</p>
  <p>Behind  these two rooms and hall, ran a cross hall, with an outer door at the end back  of the living-room and a deep and wide window seat at the other end, behind the  drawing-room.</p>
  <p>Further  back, beyond the cross hall, on the living-room side, was the dining-room, and  beside it, back of the drawing-room was the Doctor&rsquo;s study. This was the gem of  the whole house. The floor had been sunken to give greater ceiling height, for  the room was very large, and of fine proportions. It opened on to the cross  hall with wide double doors, and a flight of six or seven steps descended to  its rug covered floor.</p>
  <p>Opposite  the double doors was the great fireplace with high over-mantel of carved stone.  Each side of the mantel were windows, high and not large. The main daylight  came through a great window on the right of the entrance and also from a long  French window that opened like doors on the same side.</p>
  <p>This  French window, giving on a small porch, and the door that opened into the cross  hall of the house were the only doors in the great room, save those on  cupboards and bookcases.</p>
  <p>On  the other side of the room, opposite the French window was a row of four small  windows looking into the dining-room. But these were high, and could not be  seen through by people on the sunken floor of the study.</p>
  <p>The  whole room was done in Circassian walnut, and represented the ideal abode of a  man of letters. The fireside was flanked with two facing davenports, the wide  window seat was piled with cushions. The French window-doors were suitably  curtained and the high windows were of truly beautiful stained glass.</p>
  <p>The  spacious table desk was in the middle of the room, and bookcases, both portable  and built in, lined the walls. There were a few good busts and valuable  pictures, and the whole effect was one of dignity and repose rather than of  elaborate grandeur.</p>
  <p>The  room was renowned, and all Corinth spoke of it with pride. The students felt it  a great occasion that brought them within its walls and the faculty loved  nothing better than a session therein.</p>
  <p>Casual  guests were rarely entertained in the study. Only especial visitors or those  worthy of its classic atmosphere found welcome there. Mrs. Peyton or Helen were  not expected to use it, and Mrs. Bates had already declared she should respect  it as the sanctum of Doctor Waring alone.</p>
  <p>The  two made their way to the window seat, and as he arranged the soft cushions for  her, Waring said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Emily, ever feel shut out of this room. As I live  now, I&rsquo;ve not welcomed the Peytons in here, but my wife is a different  proposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  still feel an awe of the place, John, but I may get used to it. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll  try, and I do appreciate your willingness to have me in here. Then if you want  to be alone, you must put me out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  probably do that, sometimes, dear, for I have to spend many hours alone. You  know, I&rsquo;m not taking the presidency lightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it, you conscientious dear. But, on the other hand, don&rsquo;t be too serious  about it. You&rsquo;re just the man for the place, just the character for a College  President, and if you try too hard to improve or reconstruct yourself, you&rsquo;ll  probably spoil your present perfection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  nothing would spoil <i>your</i> present  perfection, my Emily. I am too greatly blest,&mdash;to have the great honor from the  college,&mdash;and you, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you happy, John? All happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Waring&rsquo;s  deep blue eyes fastened themselves on her face. His brown hair showed only a  little gray at the temples, his fine face was not touched deeply by Time&rsquo;s  lines, and his clear, wholesome skin glowed with health.</p>
  <p>If  there was an instant&rsquo;s hesitation before his reply came, it was none the less  hearty and sincere. &ldquo;Yes, my darling, all happy. And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am happy, if you are,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;But I can never be happy if there is a  shadow of any sort on your heart. Is there, John? Tell me, truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean regarding this trouble that I hear is brewing for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  only that; I mean in any direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble,  Emily! With you in my arms! No,&mdash;a thousand times no! Trouble and I are  strangers,&mdash;so long as I have you!&rdquo;</p>

    Miss Mystery Arrives</b></h2>
  <p>Anyone  who has arrived at the railroad station of a New England village, after dark on  a very cold winter night, the train late, no one to meet him, and no place  engaged for board and lodging, will know the desolation of such a situation.</p>
  <p>New  England&rsquo;s small railroad stations are much alike, the crowds that alight from  the trains are much alike, the people waiting on the platform for the arriving  travelers are much alike, but there came into Corinth one night a passenger who  was not at all like the fellow passengers on that belated train. It was a train  from New York, due in Corinth at five-forty, but owing to the extreme cold  weather, and various untoward freezings occasioned thereby, the delays were  many and long and the train drew into the station shortly after seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>Tired,  hungry and impatient, the travelers crowded out of the train and stamped  through the snow to the vehicles awaiting them, or footed it to their nearby  homes.</p>
  <p>The  passenger who was unlike the others stepped down from the car platform, and  holding her small suitcase firmly, crossed the track and entered the station  waiting room. She went to the ticket window but found there no attendant.  Impatiently she tapped her little foot on the old board floor but no one  appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agent,&rdquo;  she called out, rapping with her knuckles on the window shelf, &ldquo;Agent,&mdash;where  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  there? What d&rsquo;y&rsquo; want?&rdquo; growled a surly voice, and a head appeared at the  ticket window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want  somebody to look after me! I&rsquo;m alone, and I want a porter, and I want a  conveyance and I want some information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you do! Well, I can&rsquo;t supply porters nor yet conveyances; but information I may  be able to give you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well then,&rdquo; and a pair of big, dark eyes seemed to pierce his very brain. &ldquo;Then  tell me where I can find the best accommodations in Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  now roused agent looked more interestedly at the inquirer.</p>
  <p>He  saw a mere slip of a girl, young, slender, and very alert of manner. Her dark,  grave little face was oval, and her eyes had a strange uncanny way of roving  quickly about, and coming suddenly back, greatly disconcerting the stolid  ticket agent.</p>
  <p>This  agent was not unused to girls,&mdash;a college town is often invaded by hordes of  smart young women, pretty girls and gay hoydens. Many Junes he had sold tickets  or given information to hundreds of feminine inquirers but none had ever seemed  quite like this one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Best  accommodations?&rdquo; he repeated stupidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard me, then! About when do you propose to reply?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  he gazed at her in silence, running over in his mind the various boarding  houses, and finding none he thought she&rsquo;d like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a rule of the Railroad Company that questions must be answered the same day  they&rsquo;re asked,&rdquo; she said, witheringly, and picking up her suitcase she started  for the door, feeling that any one she might find would know more than this  dummy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&mdash;oh,  I say, miss, wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; she said coolly, proceeding to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&mdash;oh,  hold on,&mdash;try Old Salt Adams,&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t do better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is it?&rdquo; she deigned to pause a moment, and he replied quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  right outside,&mdash;hurry up out,&mdash;you can catch him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  was something she could understand, and she hurried up out, just in time to see  an old man with long white beard jump into his sleigh and begin to tuck fur  robes about him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sprang to his sleigh,&mdash;to his team gave a whistle,&mdash;&rdquo; she quoted to herself, and  then cried out, &ldquo;Hey, there, Santa Claus, give me a lift?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  engaged for our house?&rdquo; the man called back, and as she shook her head, he  gathered up his reins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  take any one not engaged,&rdquo; he called back, &ldquo;Giddap!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&mdash;wait!  I command you!&rdquo; The sharp, clear young voice rang out through the cold winter  air, and Old Saltonstall Adams paused to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho,  ho,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;you command me, do you? Now, I haven&rsquo;t been commanded for  something like fifty years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t stop to fuss,&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, angrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m cold,  hungry and very uncomfortable? You have a boarding house,&mdash;I want board,&mdash;now,  you take me in. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  I hear, but, miss, we&rsquo;ve only so many rooms and they&rsquo;re all occupied or  engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  are engaged, but as yet unoccupied?&rdquo; The dark eyes challenged him, and Adams  mumbled,&mdash;&rdquo;Well, that&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, I will occupy one until the engager comes along. Let me get in. No, I can  manage my suitcase myself. You get my trunk,&mdash;here&rsquo;s the check. Or will you send  for that tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  wait? Might&rsquo;s well get it now&mdash;if so be you&rsquo;re bound to bide. &lsquo;Fraid to wait in  the sleigh alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid of nothing,&rdquo; was the disdainful answer, and the girl pulled the fur  robes up around her as she sat in the middle of the back seat.</p>
  <p>Shortly,  old Salt returned with the trunk on his shoulder, and put it in the front with  himself, and they started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  try to talk,&rdquo; he called back to her, as the horses began a rapid trot. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  hear you against this wind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no intention of talking,&rdquo; the girl replied, but the man couldn&rsquo;t hear her. The  wind blew fiercely. It was snowing a little, and the drifts sent feathery  clouds through the air. The trees, coated with ice from a recent sleet storm,  broke off crackling bits of ice as they passed. The girl looked about, at first  curiously, and then timidly, as if frightened by what she saw.</p>
  <p>It  was not a long ride, and they stopped before a large house, showing comfortably  lighted windows and a broad front door that swung open even as the girl was  getting down from the sleigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the land sake!&rdquo; exclaimed a brisk feminine voice, &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t Letty! Who in the  earth have you got here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Old Salt Adams replied, truthfully. &ldquo;Take her along, mother, and  give her a night&rsquo;s lodging.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  where is Letty? Didn&rsquo;t she come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  can&rsquo;t you see she didn&rsquo;t come? Do you s&rsquo;pose I left her at the station? Or  dumped her out along the road? No&mdash;since you will have it, she didn&rsquo;t come. She <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old  Salt drove on toward the barns, and Mrs. Adams bade the girl go into the house.</p>
  <p>The  landlady followed, and as she saw the strange guest she gazed at her in frank  curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want a room, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;But, I&rsquo;m sorry to say we haven&rsquo;t one  vacant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll take Letty&rsquo;s. She didn&rsquo;t come, you see, so I can take her room for  tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Letty  wouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I would. And I&rsquo;m here and Letty isn&rsquo;t. Shall we go right up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Picking  up her small suitcase, the girl started and then stepped back for the woman to  lead the way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite so fast&mdash;<i>if</i> you please. What is  your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the landlady&rsquo;s tone changed to a sterner inflection, the girl likewise grew  dignified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Anita Austin,&rdquo; she said, coldly. &ldquo;I came here because I was told it was  the best house in Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  York City.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plaza  Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time the strange dark eyes had done their work. A steady glance from Anita  Austin seemed to compel all the world to do her bidding. At any rate, Mrs.  Adams took the suitcase, and without a further word conducted the stranger  upstairs.</p>
  <p>She  took her into an attractive bedroom, presumably made ready for the absent  Letty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  will do,&rdquo; Miss Austin said, calmly. &ldquo;Will you send me up a tray of supper? I  don&rsquo;t want much, and I prefer not to come down to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Land  sake, dinner&rsquo;s over long ago. You want some tea, &lsquo;n&rsquo; bread, &lsquo;n&rsquo; butter, &lsquo;n&rsquo;  preserves, &lsquo;n&rsquo; cake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  thank you, that sounds good. Send it in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  her guest Mrs. Adams showed merely a face of acquiescence, but once outside the  door, and released from the spell of those eerie eyes, she remarked to herself,  &ldquo;For the land sake!&rdquo; with great emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what do you know about that!&rdquo; Old Salt Adams cried, when, after she had started  him on his supper, his wife related the episode.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t make her out,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like her. And  I won&rsquo;t keep her. Tomorrow, you take her over to Belton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as you say. But I thought her kinda interesting looking. You can&rsquo;t say she isn&rsquo;t  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  so, to some folks. Not to me. And Letty&rsquo;ll come tomorrow, so that girl&rsquo;ll have  to get out of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  &ldquo;that girl&rdquo; was eagerly peering out of her window.</p>
  <p>She  tried to discern which were the lights of the college buildings, but through  the still lightly falling snow, she could see but little, and after a time, she  gave up the effort. She drew her head back into the room just as a tap at the  door announced her supper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she said to the maid who brought it. &ldquo;Set it on that stand, please. It  looks very nice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then, sitting comfortably in an easy chair, robed in warm dressing gown and  slippers, Miss Anita Austin devoted a pleasant half hour to the simple but  thoroughly satisfactory meal.</p>
  <p>This  finished, she wrote some letters. Not many, indeed, but few as they were, the  midnight hour struck before she sealed the last envelope and wrote the last  address.</p>
  <p>Then,  prepared for bed, she again looked from the window, and gazed long into the  night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Corinth,&rdquo;  she whispered, &ldquo;Oh, Corinth, what do you hold for me? What fortune or  misfortune will you bring me? What fortune or misfortune shall I bring to  others? Oh, Justice, Justice, what crimes are committed in thy name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next morning Anita appeared in the dining-room at the breakfast hour.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams scanned her sharply, and looked a little disapprovingly at the short,  scant skirt and slim, silken legs of her new boarder.</p>
  <p>Anita,  her dark eyes scanning her hostess with equal sharpness, seemed to express an  equal disapproval of the country-cut gingham and huge white apron.</p>
  <p>Not  at all obtuse, Mrs. Adams sensed this, and her tone was a little more deferential  than she had at first intended to make it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you sit here, please, Miss Austin?&rdquo; she indicated a chair next herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you, I&rsquo;ll sit by my friend,&rdquo; and the girl slipped into a vacant chair  next Saltonstall Adams.</p>
  <p>Old  Salt gave a furtive glance at his wife, and suppressed a chuckle at her  surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Mr. Tyler&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he said to the usurper, &ldquo;but I expect he&rsquo;ll let you have  it this once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to have it all the time,&rdquo; and Anita nodded gravely at her host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the time is this one meal only,&rdquo; crisply put in Mrs. Adams. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss  Austin, but we can&rsquo;t keep you here. I have no vacant room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  entrance of some other people gave Anita a chance to speak in an undertone to  Mr. Adams, and she said;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  let me stay till Letty comes, won&rsquo;t you? I suppose you are boss in your own  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  a matter of fact almost any phrase would have described the man better than &ldquo;boss  in his own house,&rdquo; but the idea tickled his sense of irony, and he chuckled as  he replied, &ldquo;You bet I am! Here you stay&mdash;as long as you want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  my friend, then?&rdquo; and an appealing glance was shot at him from beneath long,  curling lashes, that proved the complete undoing of Saltonstall Adams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the death!&rdquo; he whispered, in mock dramatic manner.</p>
  <p>Anita  gave a shiver. &ldquo;What a way to put it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I mean to live forever, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo;  Old Salt returned, placidly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a freak&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t a very pretty way of expressing it, but I suppose I am,&rdquo; and a mutinous  look passed over the strange little face.</p>
  <p>In  repose, the face was oval, serene, and regular of feature. But when the girl  smiled or spoke or frowned, changes took place, and the mobile countenance grew  soft with laughter or hard with scorn.</p>
  <p>And  scorn was plainly visible when, a moment later, Adams introduced Robert Tyler,  a fellow boarder, to Miss Austin.</p>
  <p>She  gave him first a conventional glance, then, as he dropped into the chair next  hers, and said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  too glad to give up my place to a peach,&rdquo; she turned on him a flashing glance,  that, as he expressed it afterward, &ldquo;wiped him off the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor  could he reinstate himself in her good graces. He tried a penitent attitude,  bravado, jocularity and indifference, but one and all failed to engage her  interest or even attention. She answered his remarks with calm, curt speeches  that left him baffled and uncertain whether he wanted to bow down and worship  her, or wring her neck.</p>
  <p>Old  Salt Adams took this all in, his amusement giving way to curiosity and then to  wonder. Who was this person, who looked like a young, very young girl, yet who  had all the mental powers of an experienced woman? What was she and what her  calling?</p>
  <p>The  other boarders appeared, those nearest Anita were introduced, and most of them  considered her merely a pretty, new guest. Her manners were irreproachable, her  demeanor quiet and graceful, yet as Adams covertly watched her, he felt as if  he were watching an inactive volcano.</p>
  <p>The  meal over, he detained her a moment in the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you here, Miss Austin?&rdquo; he said, courteously; &ldquo;what is your errand in  Corinth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am an artist,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with her mysterious intent gaze. &ldquo;Or,  perhaps I should say an art student. I&rsquo;ve been told that there are beautiful  bits of winter scenery available for subjects here, and I want to sketch.  Please, Mr. Adams, let me stay here until Letty comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sudden twinkle in her eye startled the old man, and he said quickly, &ldquo;How do  you know she isn&rsquo;t coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That,  in turn, surprised Anita, but she only smiled, and replied, &ldquo;I saw a telegram  handed to Mrs. Adams at breakfast&mdash;and then she looked thoughtfully at me,  and&mdash;oh, well, I just sort of knew it was to say Letty couldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  witch! You uncanny thing! If I should take you over to Salem, they&rsquo;d burn you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  ride over on a broomstick some day, and see if they will,&rdquo; she returned,  gleefully.</p>
  <p>And  then along came Nemesis, in the person of the landlady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry, Miss Austin,&rdquo; she began, but the girl interrupted her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,  Mrs. Adams,&rdquo; she said, pleadingly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say any thing to make me sorry, too!  Now, you want to say you haven&rsquo;t any room for me&mdash;but that isn&rsquo;t true; so you  don&rsquo;t know what to say to get rid of me. But&mdash;why do you want to get rid of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Esther  Adams looked at the girl and that look was her undoing.</p>
  <p>Such  a pathetic face, such pleading eyes, such a wistful curved mouth, the landlady  couldn&rsquo;t resist, and against her will, against her better judgment, she said, &ldquo;Well,  then, stay, you poor little thing. But you must tell me more about yourself. I  don&rsquo;t know who you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, myself,&rdquo; the strange girl returned. &ldquo;Do we, any of us know who we  are? We go through this world, strangers to each other&mdash;don&rsquo;t we? And also,  strangers to ourselves.&rdquo; Her eyes took on a faraway, mystical look. &ldquo;If I find  out who I am, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  a dazzling smile broke over her face, they heard a musical ripple of laughter,  and she was gone.</p>
  <p>They  heard her steps, as she ran upstairs to her room, and the two Adamses looked at  each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daffy,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Adams. &ldquo;A little touched, poor child. I believe she has run away from  home or from her keepers. We&rsquo;ll hear the truth soon. They&rsquo;ll be looking for  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said her husband, doubtfully. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t the way I size her up. She&rsquo;s  nobody&rsquo;s fool, that girl. Wish you&rsquo;d seen her give Bob Tyler his comeuppance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d  she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t  what she said, so much as the look she gave him! He almost went through the  floor. Well, she says she&rsquo;s a painter of scenery and landscapes. Let her stay a  few days, till I size her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  size her up!&rdquo; returned his wife, with good-natured contempt. &ldquo;If she smiles on  you or gives you a bit of taffy-talk, you&rsquo;ll size her up for an angel! I&rsquo;m not  so sure she isn&rsquo;t quite the opposite!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the subject of their discussion was arraying herself for a walk. Equipped with  storm boots and fur coat, she set out to inspect Corinth. A jaunty fur cap,  with one long, red quill feather gave her still more the appearance of an elf  or gnome, and many of the Adams house boarders watched the little figure as she  set forth to brave the icy streets.</p>
  <p>Apparently  she had no fixed plan of procedure, for at each corner, she looked about, and  chose her course at random. The snow had ceased during the night, and it was  very cold, with a clear sunshiny frostiness in the air that made the olive  cheeks red and glowing.</p>
  <p>Reaching  a bridge, she paused and stood looking over the slight railing into the frozen  ravine below.</p>
  <p>Long  she stood, until passers-by began to stare at her. She was unaware of this,  absorbed in her thoughts and oblivious to all about her.</p>
  <p>Pinckney  Payne, coming along, saw her, and, as he would have expressed it, fell for her  at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  do it, sister!&rdquo; he said, pausing beside her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t end your young life on this  glorious day! Suicide is a mess, at best. Take my advice and cut it out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned, ready to freeze him with a glance more icy even than the landscape, but  his frank, roguish smile disarmed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freshman?&rdquo;  she said, patronizingly, but it didn&rsquo;t abash him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep.  Pinckney Payne, if you must know. Commonly called Pinky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; and she noticed his red cheeks. &ldquo;Well, now that you&rsquo;re properly  introduced, tell me some of the buildings. What&rsquo;s that one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dormitories.  And that,&rdquo; pointing, &ldquo;is the church.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!  And that beautiful colonnade one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  Doctor Waring&rsquo;s home. Him as is going to be next Prexy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that? And that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  replied to all her questions, and kept his eyes fastened on her bewitching face.  Never had Pinky seen a girl just like this. She looked so young, so merry, and  yet her restless, roving eyes seemed full of hidden fire and tempestuous  excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  you from?&rdquo; he said, abruptly. &ldquo;Where you staying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Mrs. Adams,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;is it a good house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Best  in town. Awful hard to get into. Always full up. Relative of hers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  just a boarder. I chanced to get a room some one else engaged and couldn&rsquo;t use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  lucky. Met Bob Tyler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t like him! I see that. Met Gordon Lockwood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  Doctor Waring&rsquo;s secretary, but he&rsquo;s mighty worthwhile on his own account. I  say, may I come to see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, no. I&rsquo;m not receiving callers&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you will be soon&mdash;because I&rsquo;m coming. I say my aunt lives next door to Adams&rsquo;.  May I bring her to call on you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, please. I&rsquo;m not settled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soon&rsquo;s  you say the word, then. My aunt is Mrs. Bates, and she&rsquo;s a love. She&rsquo;s going to  marry Doctor Waring&mdash;so you see we&rsquo;re the right sort of people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are no right sort of people,&rdquo; said the girl, and, turning, she walked away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    Thirteen Buttons</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently  Miss Austin&rsquo;s statement that there were no right sort of people was her own  belief, for she made no friends at the Adams house. Nor was this the fault of  her fellow-boarders. They were more than willing to be friendly, but their  overtures were invariably ignored.</p>
  <p>Not  rudely, for Miss Austin seemed to be a girl of culture and her manners were  correct, but, as one persistent matron expressed it, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t get anywhere  with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  talked to no one at the table, merely answering a direct question if put to  her. She retained the seat next Old Salt, seeming to rely on him to protect her  from the advances of the others. Not that she needed protection, exactly, for  Miss Anita Austin was evidently quite able to take care of herself.</p>
  <p>But  she was a mystery&mdash;and mysteries provoke inquiry.</p>
  <p>The  house was not a large one, and the two-score boarders, though they would have  denied an imputation of curiosity, were exceedingly interested in learning the  facts about Miss Mystery, as they had come to call her.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams was one of the most eager of all to know the truth, but, as he did on  rare occasions, Old Salt Adams had set down his foot that the girl was not to be  annoyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know who she is or where she hails from,&rdquo; he told his wife, &ldquo;but as long  as she stays here, she&rsquo;s not to be pestered by a lot of gossiping old hens.  When she does anything you don&rsquo;t like, send her away; but so long&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s under  my roof, she&rsquo;s got to be let alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  let alone she was&mdash;not so much because of Adams&rsquo; dictum as because &ldquo;pestering&rdquo;  did little good.</p>
  <p>The  girl had a disconcerting way of looking an inquisitor straight in the eyes, and  then, with a monosyllabic reply, turning and walking off as if the other did  not exist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  said Miss Bascom, aggrievedly relating her experience, &ldquo;I just said, politely, &lsquo;Are  you from New York or where, Miss Austin?&rsquo; and she turned those big, black eyes  on me, and said, &lsquo;Where.&rsquo; Then she turned her back and looked out of the  window, as if she had wiped me off the face of the earth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  too young to act like that,&rdquo; opined Mrs. Welby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she isn&rsquo;t so terribly young,&rdquo; Miss Bascom returned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too experienced to  be so very young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know she&rsquo;s experienced? What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  Miss Bascom hesitated for words, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s&mdash;sort of sophisticated&mdash;you can see that  from her looks. I mean when anything is discussed at the table, she doesn&rsquo;t say  a word, but you can tell from her face that she knows all about it&mdash;I mean a  matter of general interest, don&rsquo;t you know. I don&rsquo;t mean local matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  an intelligent girl, I know, but that doesn&rsquo;t make her out old. I don&rsquo;t believe  she&rsquo;s twenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she is! Why, she&rsquo;s twenty-five or twenty-seven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  in the world! I&rsquo;m going to ask her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  her!&rdquo; Miss Bascom laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get well snubbed if you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this prophecy only served to egg Mrs. Welby on, and she took the first occasion  to carry out her promise.</p>
  <p>She  met Anita in the hall, as the girl was about to go out, and smilingly detained  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  so aloof, my dear,&rdquo; she said, playfully. &ldquo;You rarely give us a chance to  entertain you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Mrs. Welby was between Anita and the door, the girl was forced to pause. She  looked the older woman over, with an appraising glance that was not rude, but  merely disinterested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;  she said, with a curious rising inflection, that somehow seemed meant to close  the incident.</p>
  <p>But  Mrs. Welby was not so easily baffled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she repeated, smilingly. &ldquo;And we want to know you better. You&rsquo;re too young and  too pretty not to be a general favorite amongst us. How old are you, my dear  child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a hundred,&rdquo; and Miss Austin&rsquo;s dark eyes were so grave, and seemed to hold such  a world of wisdom and experience that Mrs. Welby almost jumped.</p>
  <p>Too  amazed to reply, she even let the girl get past her, and out of the street  door, before she recovered her poise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  uncanny,&rdquo; Mrs. Welby declared, when telling Miss Bascom of the interview. &ldquo;I  give you my word, when she said that, she looked a hundred!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looked  a hundred! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that. Her eyes seemed to hold all there is of knowledge, yes&mdash;and of evil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evil!  My goodness!&rdquo; Miss Bascom rolled this suggestion like a sweet morsel under her  tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s anything wrong about the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  If her eyes showed depths of evil, I should say there <i>was</i> something wrong!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  episode was repeated from one to another of the exclusive <i>clientele</i> of the Adams house, until, by exaggeration and imagination  it grew into quite a respectable arraignment of Miss Mystery, and branded her  as a doubtful character if not a dangerous one.</p>
  <p>Before  Miss Austin had been in the house a week, she had definitely settled her status  from her own point of view.</p>
  <p>Uniformly  correct and courteous of manner, she rarely spoke, save when necessary. It was  as if she had declared, &ldquo;I will not talk. If this be mystery, make the most of  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old  Salt, apparently, backed her up in this determination, and allowed her to sit  next him at table, without addressing her at all.</p>
  <p>More,  he often took it upon himself to answer a remark or question meant for her and  for this he sometimes received a fleeting glance, or a ghost of a smile of  approval and appreciation.</p>
  <p>But  all this was superficial. The Adamses, between themselves, decided that Miss  Austin was more deeply mysterious than was shown by her disinclination to make  friends. They concluded she was transacting important business of some sort,  and that her sketching of the winter scenery, which she did every clear day,  was merely a blind.</p>
  <p>Though  Mrs. Adams resented this, and urged her husband to send the girl packing, Old  Salt demurred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  done no harm as yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a mystery, but not a wrong one, &lsquo;s far&rsquo;s  I can make out. Let her alone, mother. I&rsquo;ve got my eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got my two eyes on her, and I can see more&rsquo;n you can. Why, Salt, that girl don&rsquo;t  hardly sleep at all. Night after night, she sits up looking out of the window,  over toward the college buildings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  go and listen at her door,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams admitted, without embarrassment. &ldquo;I want  to know what she&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I hear her moving around restlessly, and putting the window up and down&mdash;and  Miss Bascom&mdash;her room&rsquo;s cornerways on the ell, she says she sees her looking out  the window late at night &lsquo;most every night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Bascom&rsquo;s a meddling old maid, and I&rsquo;d put her out of this house before I would  the little girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course <i>you</i> would! You&rsquo;re all set up  because she makes so much of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Esther, you can&rsquo;t say that child makes much of me! I wish she would.  I&rsquo;ve taken a fancy to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  because she&rsquo;s pretty&mdash;in a gipsy, witch-like fashion. What men see in a pair of  big black eyes, and a dark, sallow face, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  sallow,&rdquo; Old Salt said, reflectively; &ldquo;olive, rather&mdash;but not sallow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  you!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Adams, and with that cryptic remark the subject was  dropped.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood, secretary of John Waring, had a room at the Adams house. But as he  took no meals there save his breakfasts, and as he ate those early, he had not  yet met Anita Austin.</p>
  <p>But  one Saturday morning, he chanced to be late, and the two sat at table together.</p>
  <p>An  astute reader of humanity, Lockwood at once became interested in the girl, and  realized that to win her attention he must not be eager or insistent.</p>
  <p>He  spoke only one or two of the merest commonplaces, until almost at the close of  the meal, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I do anything for you, Miss Austin? If you would care to hear any of the  College lectures, I can arrange it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are the speakers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned her eyes fully upon him, and Gordon Lockwood marveled at their depth and  beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;Doctor Waring is to lecture on Egyptian Archaeology. Are you  interested in that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;very much so. I&rsquo;d like to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly may, then. Just use this card.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took a card from his pocket, scribbled a line across it, and gave it to her.  Without another word, he finished his breakfast, and with a mere courteous bow,  he left the room.</p>
  <p>Miss  Austin&rsquo;s face took on a more scrutable look than ever.</p>
  <p>The  card still in her hand, she went up to her room. Unheeding the maid, who was at  her duties there, the girl threw herself into a big chair and sat staring at  the card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Egyptian Temples,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;Doctor John Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  maid looked at her curiously as she murmured the words half aloud, but Miss  Austin paid no heed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on with your work, Nora, don&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; she said, at last, as the chambermaid  paused inquiringly in front of her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind your being here until you  finish what you have to do. And I wish you&rsquo;d bring me a Corinth paper, please?&rsquo;  There is one, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, ma&rsquo;am. Twice a week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nora  disappeared and returned with a paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Adams says you may have this to keep. It&rsquo;s the newest one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl took it and turned to find the College announcements. The Egyptian Lecture  was mentioned, and in another column was a short article regarding Doctor  Waring and a picture of him.</p>
  <p>Long  the girl looked at the picture, and when the maid, her tasks completed, left  the room, she noticed Miss Austin still staring at the fine face of the  President-elect of the University of Corinth.</p>
  <p>After  a time, she reached for a pair of scissors, and cut out the portrait and the  article which it illustrated.</p>
  <p>She  put the clipping in a portfolio, which she then locked in her trunk, and the  picture she placed on her dresser.</p>
  <p>That  night she went to the lecture. She went alone, for Gordon Lockwood did not reappear  and no one else knew of her going.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I have a key, or will you be up?&rdquo; she asked of Mrs. Adams, as she left the  house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;ll be up.&rdquo; The round, shrewd eyes looked at her kindly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to get  a ticket. Doctor Waring&rsquo;s lectures are crowded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  night,&rdquo; said Miss Austin, and went away.</p>
  <p>The  lecture room was partly filled when she arrived, and her ticket entitled her to  a seat near the front.</p>
  <p>Being  seated, she fell into a brown study, or, at least, sat motionless and  apparently in deep thought.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood, already there, saw her come in, and after she was in her place, he  quietly arose and went across the room, taking a seat directly behind her.</p>
  <p>Of  this she was quite unaware, and the student of human nature gave himself up to  a scrutiny of the stranger.</p>
  <p>He  saw a little head, its mass of dark, almost black hair surmounted by a small  turban shaped hat, of taupe colored velvet, with a curly ostrich tip nestling  over one ear.</p>
  <p>Not  that her ears were visible, for Miss Austin was smartly groomed and her whole  effect modish.</p>
  <p>She  had removed her coat, which she held in her lap. Her frock was taupe colored,  of a soft woolen material, ornamented with many small buttons. These tiny  buttons formed two rows down her back, from either shoulder to the waist line,  and they also formed a border round the sailor collar.</p>
  <p>They  were, perhaps, Lockwood decided, little balls, rather than buttons, and he idly  counted them as he sat watching her.</p>
  <p>He  hoped she would turn her head a trifle, but she sat as motionless as a human  being may.</p>
  <p>He  marveled at her stillness, and impatiently waited for the lecture to begin that  he might note her interest.</p>
  <p>At  last Doctor Waring appeared on the platform, and as the applause resounded all  over the room, Lockwood was almost startled to observe Miss Austin&rsquo;s actions.</p>
  <p>She  clasped her hands together as if she had received a sudden shock. She&mdash;if it  hadn&rsquo;t seemed too absurd,&mdash;he would have said that she trembled. At any rate she  was a little agitated, and it was with an effort that she preserved her calm.  No one else noticed her, and Lockwood would not have done so, save for his  close watching.</p>
  <p>Throughout  the lecture, Miss Austin&rsquo;s gaze seemed never to leave the face of the speaker,  and Lockwood marveled that Waring himself was not drawn to notice her.</p>
  <p>But  Waring&rsquo;s calm gaze, though it traveled over the audience, never rested  definitely on any one face, and Lockwood concluded he recognized nobody.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Mystery!&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood said to himself. &ldquo;I wonder who and what you are.  Probably a complex nature, psychic and imaginative. You think it interesting to  come up here and pretend to be a mystery. But you&rsquo;re too young and too innocent  to be&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so sure of the innocent, though,&mdash;and as to youth,&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t  believe you&rsquo;re much older than you look any way. And you&rsquo;re confoundedly  pretty&mdash;beautiful, rather. You&rsquo;ve too much in your face to call it merely  pretty. I&rsquo;ve never seen such possibilities of character. You&rsquo;re either a deep  one or your looks belie you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  heard no word of the lecture, nor did he wish to; he had helped in the writing  of it, and almost knew it by heart anyway. But he was really intrigued by this  mysterious girl, and he determined to get to know her.</p>
  <p>He  had been told, of course, of the futile attempts of the other boarders to make  friends with her, but he had faith in his own attractiveness and in his methods  of procedure.</p>
  <p>Pinky  Payne, too, had told of the interview he had on the bridge. His account of the  girl&rsquo;s beauty and charm had first roused Lockwood&rsquo;s interest, and now he was  making a study of the whole situation.</p>
  <p>Idly  he counted the buttons again. There were thirteen across the collar. The  vertical rows he could not be sure of as the back of the seat cut off their  view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirteen,&rdquo;  he mused; &ldquo;an unlucky number. And the poor child looks unlucky. There&rsquo;s a  sadness in her eyes that must mean something. Yet there&rsquo;s more than  sadness,&mdash;there&rsquo;s a hint of cruelty,&mdash;a possibility of desperate deeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then Lockwood laughed at himself. To romance thus about a girl to whom he had  not said half a dozen sentences in his life! Yet he knew he was not mistaken.  All that he had read in Anita Austin&rsquo;s face, he was sure was there. He knew  physiognomy, and rarely, if ever, was mistaken in his reading thereof.</p>
  <p>After  the lecture was over, Miss Austin went home as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  would have liked to escort her, but he had to remain to report to Doctor  Waring, who might have some orders for him.</p>
  <p>There  were none, however, and after a short interview with his employer, Gordon  Lockwood went home.</p>
  <p>As  he went softly upstairs to his room in the Adams house, he passed the door of  what he knew to be Miss Austin&rsquo;s room. He fancied he heard a stifled sob come  from behind that closed door, and instinctively paused to listen a moment.</p>
  <p>Yes,  he was not mistaken. Another sob followed, quickly suppressed, but he could  have no doubt the girl was crying.</p>
  <p>For  a moment Lockwood was tempted to go back and ask Mrs. Adams to come and tap at  the girl&rsquo;s door.</p>
  <p>Then  he realized that it was not his affair. If the girl was in sorrow or if she  wanted to cry for any reason, it was not his place to send someone to intrude  upon her. He went on to his own room, but he sat up for a long time thinking  over the strange young woman in the house.</p>
  <p>He  remembered that she had paid undeviating attention to the lecture, quite  evidently following the speaker with attention and interest. He remembered  every detail of her appearance, her pretty dark hair showing beneath her little  velvet toque,&mdash;the absurd buttons on the back of her frock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do, Gordon, old man,&rdquo; he told himself at last. Better let her alone. She&rsquo;s  a siren all right, but you know nothing about her, and you&rsquo;ve no reason to try  to learn more.</p>
  <p>And  then he heard voices in the hall. Low of tone, but angry of inflection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  threw it away!&rdquo; Miss Austin was saying; &ldquo;I tell you she threw it away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there,&rdquo; came Mrs. Adams&rsquo; placating voice, &ldquo;what if she did? It was only a  newspaper scrap. She didn&rsquo;t know it was of any value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want it! Nora has no business to throw away my things! She had no reason to  touch it; it was on the dresser&mdash;standing up against the mirror frame. What do  you suppose she did with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind it tonight. Tomorrow we will ask her. She&rsquo;s gone to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;m afraid she destroyed it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  she did. Don&rsquo;t take on so. What paper was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Corinth Gazette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  new one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. The one she brought me this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if she has thrown it away, you can get another copy. What was in it that you  want so much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;nothing  special.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was.&rdquo; Mrs. Adams&rsquo; curiosity was aroused now. &ldquo;Come, tell me what it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it was only a picture of Doctor Waring, the man who lectured tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a fuss about that! My goodness! Why, you can get a picture of him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  obstinate note rang in the young voice. Perhaps Miss Austin spoke louder than  she meant to, but at any rate, Lockwood heard most of the conversation, and he  now opened his door, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I offer a photograph? Would you care to have this, Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl looked at him with a white, angry face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;how dare you eavesdrop and listen to a conversation not  meant for your ears? Don&rsquo;t speak to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  drew up her slender figure and looked like a wrathful pixie defying a giant.  For Lockwood was a big man, and loomed far above the slight, dainty figure of  Miss Mystery.</p>
  <p>He  smiled good-naturedly as he said, &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get wrathy. I don&rsquo;t mean any harm.  But you wanted a picture of Doctor Waring, and I&rsquo;ve several of them. You see, I&rsquo;m  his secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;are  you! His private secretary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;his  confidential one,&mdash;though he has few confidences. He&rsquo;s a public man and his life  is an open book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it is!&rdquo; The girl had recovered her poise, and with it her ability to be  sarcastic. &ldquo;Known to all men, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Known  to all men,&rdquo; repeated Lockwood, thinking far more of the girl he was speaking  to than of what he was saying.</p>
  <p>For,  again he had fallen under the spell of her strange personality. He watched her,  fascinated, as she reached out for the picture and almost snatched at it in her  eagerness.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams yawned behind her plump hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you&rsquo;ve got your picture, go to bed, child,&rdquo; she said with a kind, motherly  smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in and unhook you, shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obediently,  and without a word of good night to Lockwood, Anita turned and went into her  room, followed by Mrs. Adams. The good lady offered no disinterested service.  She wanted to know why Miss Austin wanted that picture so much. But she didn&rsquo;t  find out. After being of such help as she could, the landlady found herself  pleasantly but definitely dismissed. Outside the door, however, she turned and  reopened it. Miss Mystery, unnoticing the intruder, was covering the photograph  with many and passionate kisses.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    A Broken Teacup</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell her you&rsquo;re here, but I&rsquo;m noways sure she&rsquo;ll see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams stood, her hand on the doorknob, as she looked doubtfully at Emily Bates  and her nephew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bates, in astonishment, and Pinky echoed, &ldquo;Why not, Mrs.  Adams?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  queer.&rdquo; Mrs. Adams came back into the room, closed the door, and spoke softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what she is, Mrs. Bates, queer. I can&rsquo;t make her out. She&rsquo;s been here more&rsquo;n a  week now, and I do say she gets queerer every day. Won&rsquo;t make friends with  anybody,&mdash;won&rsquo;t speak at all at the table,&mdash;never comes and sits with us of an  afternoon or evening,&mdash;just keeps to herself. Now, that ain&rsquo;t natural for a  young girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  old is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows. She looks like nineteen or twenty, but she has the ways of a woman of  forty,&mdash;as far&rsquo;s having her own way&rsquo;s concerned. Then again, she&rsquo;ll pet the cat  or smile up at Mr. Adams like a child. I can&rsquo;t make her out at all. The  boarders are all fearfully curious&mdash;that&rsquo;s one reason I take her part. They&rsquo;re a  snoopy lot, and I make them let her alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  like her, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t help liking her,&mdash;yet she is exasperating. You ask her a question, and she  stares at you and walks off. Not really rude,&mdash;but just as if you weren&rsquo;t there!  Well, I&rsquo;ll tell her you&rsquo;re here, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was only by his extraordinary powers of persuasion that Pinky Payne had won his  aunt&rsquo;s consent to make this call, and, being Sunday afternoon, the recognized  at-home day in Corinth, they had gone to the Adams house unannounced, and asked  for Miss Austin.</p>
  <p>Upstairs,  Mrs. Adams tapped at the girl&rsquo;s door.</p>
  <p>It  was opened slowly,&mdash;it would seem, grudgingly,&mdash;and Anita looked out inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Callers  for you, Miss Austin,&rdquo; the landlady said, cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  me? I know no one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  now, you come on down. It&rsquo;s Mrs. Bates, and her nephew, Pinky Payne. They&rsquo;re  our best people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think I want to see your best people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say you do, but they want to see you,&mdash;and&mdash;oh, pshaw, now, be a little  sociable. It won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  say to Mrs. Bates that I have no desire to form new acquaintances, and I beg to  be excused from appearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  do you know who she is? She&rsquo;s the lady that&rsquo;s going to marry Doctor Waring, the  new President. And Pinckney Payne, her cousin, is a mighty nice boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams thought she detected an expression of wavering on the girl&rsquo;s face, and  she followed up her advantage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;s an awfully nice chap and just about your age, I should judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go down,&rdquo; said Miss Austin, briefly, and Mrs. Adams indulged in a sly smile of  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Pinky that fetched her,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;Young folks are young folks,  the world over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Triumphantly,  Mrs. Adams ushered Anita into the small parlor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Bates,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Mr. Payne,&mdash;Miss Austin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she left them, for Esther Adams had strict notions of her duties as a  boarding-house landlady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Bates?&rdquo; Anita said, going to her and taking her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Miss Austin,&mdash;I am very glad to know you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the words ceased suddenly as Emily Bates looked into the girl&rsquo;s eyes. Such a  depth of sorrow was there, such unmistakable tragedy and a hint of fear. What  could it all mean? Surely this was a strange girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have never met before, have we?&rdquo; Mrs. Bates said,&mdash;almost involuntarily, for the  girl&rsquo;s gaze was too intent to be given to a stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Anita said, recovering her poise steadily but slowly,&mdash;&rdquo;not that I remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have,&rdquo; burst forth the irrepressible Pinky. &ldquo;I say, Miss Austin, please realize  that I&rsquo;m here as well as my more celebrated aunt! Don&rsquo;t you remember the  morning I met you on the bridge,&mdash;and you were just about to throw yourself over  the parapet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and a delightful smile lighted the dark little face. The lips  were very scarlet, but it was unmistakably Nature&rsquo;s own red, and as they parted  over even and pearly teeth, the smile transformed Miss Austin into a real  beauty.</p>
  <p>It  disappeared quickly, however, and Pinky Payne thenceforward made it his earnest  endeavor to bring it back as often as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Bates, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pay any attention to that  foolish boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a very nice boy, if I am foolish,&rdquo; Pinky declared, but Miss Austin vaguely  ignored him, and kept her intent gaze fixed on Emily Bates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  thought perhaps you would go with us over to Doctor Waring&rsquo;s for tea,&rdquo; Mrs.  Bates said, after an interval of aimless chat. &ldquo;It would, I am sure be a  pleasant experience for you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Waring&rsquo;s?&rdquo; repeated Anita, her voice low and tense, as if the idea was of more  importance than it seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I may take you, for the Doctor is my fiance,&mdash;we are to be married next month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried the girl, with such a sharp intonation that Mrs. Bates was startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  they are,&rdquo; put in Pinky, anxious to cover up any eccentricity on the part of  this girl in whom he took an increasing interest. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as blissful as two  young turtle-doves. Come on, Miss Austin, let&rsquo;s go over there. It&rsquo;s a duck of a  house to go to, and jolly good people there. The view from the study window is  worth going miles to see. You&rsquo;re an artist,&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sketch some,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right; if you can find a prettier spot to sketch on this terrestrial globe than  the picture by the Waring study window, I&rsquo;ll buy it for you! Toddle up and get  your hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  gay good nature was infectious and Anita smiled again as she went for her hat  and coat.</p>
  <p>The  walk was but a short one, and when they entered the Waring home they found a  cheery group having tea in the pleasant living room.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Waring was not present and Mrs. Peyton was pouring tea, while Helen and Robert  Tyler served it. The capable Ito had always Sunday afternoon for his holiday,  and while Nogi, the Japanese second man, was willing enough, his training was  incomplete, and his blunders frequent. He was a new servant, and though old Ito  had hopes of educating him, Mrs. Peyton was doubtful about it. However, she  thought, soon the responsibilities of the Waring menage would be hers no  longer, and she resolved to get along with the inexperienced Nogi while she  remained.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton was very regretful at the coming change of affairs.</p>
  <p>She  had looked upon John Waring as a confirmed bachelor, and had not expected he  would ever marry. Now, she declared, he was marrying only because he thought it  wiser for a College President to have a wife as a part of his domestic outfit.</p>
  <p>Helen  disagreed with her mother about this. She said Doctor Waring had begun to take  a personal interest in the attractive Mrs. Bates before he had any idea of  becoming President of the University.</p>
  <p>But  it didn&rsquo;t matter. The wedding was imminent, and Mrs. Peyton had received due  notice that her services would be no longer needed.</p>
  <p>It  was a blow to her, and it had made her depressed and disconsolate. Also, a  little resentful, even spiteful toward Emily Bates.</p>
  <p>The  housekeeper greeted Miss Austin with a cold smile, and then disregarded her  utterly.</p>
  <p>Helen  was frankly curious, and met the newcomer with full intention of finding out  all about her.</p>
  <p>For  Helen Peyton had heard of Miss Mystery from her friend and admirer, Robert  Tyler, who, however, did not report that the girl had snubbed him more than  once.</p>
  <p>One  or two other guests were present and, having been told of Mrs. Bates&rsquo; arrival  Doctor Waring and his secretary came from the study and joined the others at  tea.</p>
  <p>With  a welcoming smile, John Waring greeted his fiancee, and then Mrs. Bates turned  to the girl she had brought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let me present Doctor Waring. John,&mdash;Miss Anita Austin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that very moment Helen Peyton offered Waring a cup of tea, and he was in the  act of taking it from her hand when Mrs. Bates made the introduction.</p>
  <p>The  cup and saucer fell to the floor with a crash, and those nearest saw the Doctor&rsquo;s  face blanch suddenly white, and his hand clench on a nearby chair.</p>
  <p>But  with a sudden, desperate effort he pulled himself together, and gave a little  laugh, as he directed Nogi to remove the wrecked teacup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pick  up the four corners, and carry it all off at once,&rdquo; he ordered, pointing to the  small rug on which the cup had fallen, and Nogi, a little clumsily, obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  the awkwardness, Miss Austin,&rdquo; he said, turning to smile at the girl, but even  as he did so, his voice trembled, and he turned hastily away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, John?&rdquo; asked Emily Bates, going to his side. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;no,  dear; it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right. That foolish teacup upset my nerves. I&rsquo;ll go off by  myself for a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somewhat  abruptly, he left the room and went back to his study.</p>
  <p>Listening  intently, Mrs. Bates heard him lock the door on the inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry,&rdquo; she said, turning to Anita, &ldquo;but I know you&rsquo;ll forgive Doctor Waring.  He is under so much strain at present, and a foolish accident, like the broken  teacup, is enough to give him a nervous shock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said the girl, sympathetically. &ldquo;He must be very busy and absorbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  spoke, as she often did, in a perfunctory way, as if not interested in what she  was saying. Her glance wandered and she bit her red lower lip, as if nervous  herself. Yet she was exceedingly quiet and calm of demeanor, and her graceful  attitudes betokened only a courteous if disinterested guest.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood immediately followed his chief and tapped at the locked study door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Lockwood,&rdquo; Waring recognized the knock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you now. I&rsquo;ll  reappear shortly. Go back to the tea room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Willingly,  Lockwood went back, hoping to have a chance for conversation with Miss Mystery.</p>
  <p>She  was chatting gayly with Helen Peyton, Pinky and Mrs. Tyler.</p>
  <p>To  Lockwood&rsquo;s surprise, Miss Austin was really gay and merry and quite held her  own in the chaff and repartee.</p>
  <p>Yet  as Lockwood noted her more closely, his quick perception told him her gayety  was forced.</p>
  <p>The  secretary&rsquo;s ability to read human nature was almost uncanny, and he truly  believed the girl was making merry only by reason of her firm determination to  do so.</p>
  <p>Why?  He wondered.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood was a rare type of man. He was possessed of the most impassive face,  the most immobile countenance imaginable. He never allowed himself to show the  slightest excitement or even interest. This habit, acquired purposely at first,  had grown upon him until it was second nature. He would not admit anything  could move him, could stir his poise or disturb his equanimity. He heard the  most gratifying or the most exasperating news with equal attention and equal  lack of surprise or enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>Yet,  though this may sound unattractive, so great was Lockwood&rsquo;s personality, so  responsive and receptive his real nature beneath his outer calm, that all who  really knew him liked him and trusted him.</p>
  <p>Waring  depended on him in every respect. He was more than a secretary to his employer.  He was counselor and friend as well.</p>
  <p>And  Waring appreciated this, and rated Lockwood high in his esteem and affection.</p>
  <p>Of  course, with his insight, Gordon Lockwood could not be blind to the fact that  both Mrs. Peyton and her daughter would be pleased if he could fall a victim to  the charms of the fair Helen. Nor could he evade the conviction that Mrs.  Peyton herself had entertained hopes of becoming mistress of the Waring home,  until the advent of Emily Bates had spoiled her chances.</p>
  <p>But  these things were merely self-evident facts, and affected in no way the two men  concerned.</p>
  <p>The  Peytons were treated with pleasant regard for both, and that ended the matter  so far as they were concerned.</p>
  <p>The  subject had never been alluded to by Waring or Lockwood, but each understood,  and when the Doctor&rsquo;s marriage took place, that would automatically end the  Peytons&rsquo; incumbency.</p>
  <p>And  now, Gordon Lockwood smiled patronizingly at himself, as he was forced to admit  an unreasonable, inexplicable interest in a slip of a girl with a dark, eerie  little face and a manner grave and gay to extremes.</p>
  <p>For  Anita was positively laughing at some foolishness of Pinky Payne&rsquo;s. Still,  Lockwood concluded, watching her narrowly, yet unobserved, she was laughing  immoderately. She was laughing for some reason other than merriment. It verged  on hysterical, he decided, and wondered why.</p>
  <p>He  joined the group of young people, and in his quiet but effective way, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  had enough foolery for the moment, Miss Austin,&mdash;come and talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  to the girl&rsquo;s amazement, he took her hand and led her to a davenport on the  other side of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  he said, as he arranged a pillow or two, &ldquo;is that right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, and lapsed into silence.</p>
  <p>She  sat, looking off into vacancy, and Lockwood studied her. Then he said, softly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too bad, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Anita sighed, and then suddenly; &ldquo;what do you mean? What&rsquo;s too bad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  it is that troubles you.&rdquo; The deep blue eyes met her own, but there was no sign  of response or acquiescence on the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo;  she said, rising quickly, &ldquo;I must go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&mdash;don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; cried Pinky, overhearing. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve only just come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I must go,&rdquo; said Miss Mystery, decidedly. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Mrs. Bates, and  thank you for bringing me. Good afternoon, Mrs. Peyton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Including  all the others in a general bow of farewell, the strange girl went to the front  door, and paused for the attendant Nogi to open it.</p>
  <p>Door-tending  the assistant butler understood, and he punctiliously waited until Miss Austin  had buttoned her gloves and had given an adjusting pat to her veil, after a  fleeting glance in the hall mirror.</p>
  <p>Then  he opened the door with an obsequious air, and closed it behind her departing  figure.</p>
  <p>But  it was immediately flung open again by Pinky Payne, who ran through it and  after the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute, Miss Austin. How fast you walk! I&rsquo;m going home with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  not,&rdquo; she said, indifferently, scarcely glancing at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep.  Gotto. Getting near dusk, and you might be kidnapped. Needn&rsquo;t talk if you don&rsquo;t  want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never want to talk!&rdquo; was the surprising and crisply spoken retort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  didn&rsquo;t I say you needn&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t get wrathy&mdash;don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;ee&mdash;now,&mdash;as my old  Scotch nurse used to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Miss Mystery gave him no look, although she allowed him to fall into step  beside her, and the two walked rapidly along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d  you like the looks of the Doctor?&rdquo; Pinky asked, hoping to induce conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  scarcely saw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you saw him,&mdash;though you had small chance to get to know him. Perfect old brick,  but a little on edge of late. Approaching matrimony, I suppose. Did you notice  his ruby stickpin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  it didn&rsquo;t seem to suit him at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he&rsquo;s a conservative dresser. But that pin,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a famous gem,&mdash;was given him by  his own class,&mdash;I mean his graduating class, but long after they graduated, and  he had to promise to wear it once a week, so he usually gets into it on  Sundays. It&rsquo;s a corking stone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Miss Austin.</p>
  <p>On  reaching the Adams house, the girl said a quick good-by, and Pinky Payne found  himself at liberty to go in and see the other members of the household, or to  go home, for Miss Austin disappeared into the hall and up the staircase with  the rapidity of a dissolving view.</p>
  <p>Young  Payne turned away and strolled slowly back to the Waring home, wondering what  it was about the disagreeable young woman that made him pay any attention to  her at all.</p>
  <p>He  found her the topic of discussion when he arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  all rude people,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton declared, &ldquo;she was certainly the worst!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was!&rdquo; Helen agreed. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make her out at all. And I don&rsquo;t call her  pretty, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; observed Emily Bates. &ldquo;I call her very pretty,&mdash;and possessed of great  charm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charm!&rdquo;  scoffed Helen; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t rude,&rdquo; Pinky defended the absent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Mrs. Peyton, she made her  adieux most politely. Why should she have stayed longer? She didn&rsquo;t know any of  us,&mdash;and, perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t like any of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood stated. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like us,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of that. Well, why  should she, if she doesn&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; countered Tyler. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so terribly superior,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear her.  She acts as if she owned the earth, yet nobody knows who she is, or anything  about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  we entitled to?&rdquo; asked Lockwood. &ldquo;Why should we inquire into her identity or  history further than she chooses to enlighten us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Austin?&rdquo; asked Doctor Waring, returning, quite composed and calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  went home,&rdquo; informed Mrs. Bates. &ldquo;Are you all right, John?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, dear. I wasn&rsquo;t ill, or anything like that. The awkward accident touched my  nerves, and I wanted to run away and hide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled whimsically, looking like a naughty schoolboy, and Emily Bates took his  hand and drew him down to a seat beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you drop it, John?&rdquo; she said, with a direct look into his eyes.</p>
  <p>He  hesitated a moment, and his own glance wandered, then he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,  Emily; I suppose it was a sudden physical contraction of the muscles of my  hand&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t control it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Bates didn&rsquo;t look satisfied, but she did not pursue the subject. Then the  discussion of Anita was resumed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you like her looks, Doctor Waring?&rdquo; Helen Peyton asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  scarcely saw her,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;Did you all admire her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of us did.&rdquo; Mrs. Bates answered; &ldquo;I do, for one. Did you ever see her before,  John?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor  Waring stared at the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  he declared. &ldquo;How could I have done so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates laughed. &ldquo;I just had a sort of an impression&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear, I never saw the girl before in my life,&rdquo; Waring reasserted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you need never want to see her again,&rdquo; Robert Tyler informed him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sulky,  silly and supercilious. She&rsquo;s a mystery, they say, but I say she merely wants  to be thought a mystery to make a little sensation. I can&rsquo;t abide that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen  Peyton heard this with undisguised satisfaction, for she had quite enough girls  in her life to be jealous and envious of, without adding another to the list.  Also, she especially wanted to retain the admiration of Robert Tyler, and was  glad to know it was not newly endangered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin is very beautiful,&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood declared, in his usual way of  summing up a discussion and announcing his own opinion as final. &ldquo;Also, she is  a mystery. I live in the same boarding house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; put in Tyler, &ldquo;and she snubs us both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hasn&rsquo;t snubbed me,&rdquo; said Lockwood, simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, Oscar, she will!&rdquo; returned Tyler, and then laughed immoderately at his  own would-be wit.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>That  same Sunday evening the Waring household dined alone. Oftener than not there  were guests, but tonight there were only the two Peytons, Lockwood and John Waring  himself.</p>
  <p>Ito,  the butler, had holiday Sunday afternoon and evening, and Nogi, the second and  less experienced man, was trying his best to satisfy the exactions of Mrs.  Peyton as to his service at table.</p>
  <p>Helen  Peyton was in a talkative mood and commented volubly on the caller of the  afternoon, Miss Austin.</p>
  <p>She  met little response, for her mother was absorbed in the training of the  Japanese, and the two men seemed indisposed to pursue the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think she&rsquo;s odd looking?&rdquo; Helen asked, of Doctor Waring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd  looking,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t notice her especially. She  seemed to me a rather distinguished type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Distinguished  is the word,&rdquo; agreed Lockwood. &ldquo;What about the lecture tomorrow night, Doctor?  Will Fessenden take care of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I must lecture myself tomorrow night. I&rsquo;m sorry, for I&rsquo;m busy with that book  revision. However, I&rsquo;ll look up some data this evening, and I shall be ready  for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you will,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Peyton. &ldquo;You were never caught unready for anything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it means some work,&rdquo; Waring added, as he rose from the table.</p>
  <p>He  went into the study, followed by Lockwood, whose experience made him aware of  what books his chief would need, and he began at once to take them from the  shelves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;  Waring said, looking over the armful of volumes Lockwood placed on the desk and  seating himself in the swivel chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring  me Marcus Aurelius, too, please, and Martial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  classic touch,&rdquo; Lockwood smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it adds dignity, if one is a bit shy of material,&rdquo; Waring admitted, good-naturedly.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, Lockwood. You may go, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I&rsquo;ll stay until eleven or so. I&rsquo;m pretty busy with the reports, and, too,  some one may call whom I can take care of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  chap you are, Lockwood. I appreciate it. Very well, then, don&rsquo;t bother me  unless absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  secretary left the room and closed the study door behind him.</p>
  <p>This  door gave on to the end of the cross hall, and the hall ended then, in a roomy  window seat, and also held a book rack and table; altogether a comfortable and  useful nook, frequently occupied by Gordon Lockwood. The window looked out on  the beautiful lake view, as did the great study window, and it also commanded a  view of the highroad on which stood, not far away, the Adams boarding-house.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  lodged there, as being more convenient, but most of his waking hours were spent  in his employer&rsquo;s home. A perfect secretary he had proved himself to be, for  his prescience amounted almost to clairvoyance, and his imperturbability was  exceedingly useful in keeping troublesome people or things away from John  Waring.</p>
  <p>So,  he determined to stay on guard, lest a chance caller should come to disturb the  Doctor at his work.</p>
  <p>But  Lockwood&rsquo;s own work was somewhat neglected. Try as he would to concentrate upon  it, he could not entirely dismiss from his mind a certain mysterious little  face, whose meaning eluded him. For once, Gordon Lockwood, reader of faces, was  baffled. He couldn&rsquo;t classify the girl who was both rude and charming, both  cruel and pathetic.</p>
  <p>For  cruelty was what this expert read in the knowing eyes and firm little mouth of  Miss Mystery. And because of this indubitable element in her nature, he deemed  her pathetic. Which shows how much she interested him.</p>
  <p>At  any rate he thought about her while his work waited. And, then, he thought of  other things&mdash;for he had troubles of his own, had this supercilious young man.  And troubles which galled him the more, that they were sordid&mdash;money troubles,  in fact. His whole nature revolted at the mere thought of mercenary  considerations, but if one is short of funds one must recognize the condition,  distasteful though it be.</p>
  <p>At  nine-thirty, Nogi came with a tray bearing water and glasses. Under the  watchful eye of Mrs. Peyton the Japanese tapped at the study door and, in  response to the master&rsquo;s bidding, went in with his tray. He left it  punctiliously on the table directed, and with his characteristic bow, departed  again.</p>
  <p>At  ten-thirty, Mrs. Peyton and Helen went upstairs to their rooms, the housekeeper  having given Nogi strict and definite instructions, which included his  remaining on duty until the master should also retire.</p>
  <p>And  the night wore on.</p>
  <p>A  clear, cold night, with a late-rising moon, past the full, but still with its  great yellow disk nearly round.</p>
  <p>It  shone down on what seemed like fairyland, for the sleet storm that had covered  the trees with a coating of ice, and had fringed eaves and fences with icicles,  had ceased, and left the glittering landscape frozen and sparkling in the  still, cold air.</p>
  <p>And  when, some hours later, the sun rose on the same chill scene its rays made no  perceptible impression on the cold and the mercury stayed down at its lowest  winter record.</p>
  <p>And  so even the stolid Japanese Ito, shivered, and his yellow teeth chattered as he  knocked at Mrs. Peyton&rsquo;s door in the early dawn of Monday morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; she cried, springing from her bed to unbolt her door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grave  news, madam,&rdquo; and the Oriental bowed before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has happened? Tell me, Ito.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not sure, madam&mdash;but, the master&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  what about Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is&mdash;he is asleep in his study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asleep  in his study! Ito, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  madam. His bed is unslept in. His room door ajar. I looked in the study&mdash;through  from the dining-room&mdash;he is there by his desk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asleep,  Ito&mdash;you said asleep!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;madam&mdash;but&mdash;I  do not know. And Nogi&mdash;he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone!  Where to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  also, I do not know. Will madam come and look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I will not! I know something has happened! I knew something would happen! Ito,  he is not asleep&mdash;he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say it, madam. We do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  out! Go in and speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the door is locked. I tried it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Locked!  The study door locked, and Doctor Waring still in there? How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  peeped from the dining-room window&mdash;and I could see him, leaning down on his  desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the dining-room window! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  small little inside windows. Madam knows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  study had been added to the Waring house after the house had been built for  some years. Wherefore, the dining-room, previously with a lake view from its  windows, was cut off from that view. But, the windows, three small, square  ones, remained, and so, looked into the new study.</p>
  <p>However,  the study, a higher ceiling being desired, had its floor sunken six feet or more,  which brought the windows far too high to see through from the study side, but  one could look through them from the dining-room. The original sashes had been  replaced by beautiful stained glass, opaque save for a few tiny transparent  bits through which a persistent and curious-minded person might discern some  parts of the study.</p>
  <p>The  stained glass sashes were immovable, and were there more as a decoration than  for utility&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>And  it was through these peepholes that Ito had discovered the presence of Doctor  Waring in his study at the unusual hour of seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
  <p>The  Japanese, true to his tribal instinct, showed no agitation, and his calm  demeanor helped to soothe Mrs. Peyton. But as she hastily dressed herself, she  decided upon her course of action.</p>
  <p>Her  first impulse was to call her daughter, but she concluded not to disturb the  girl. Instead, she telephoned to Gordon Lockwood, and asked him to come over as  soon as he possibly could.</p>
  <p>Old  Salt took the message, and transmitted it to the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter over there?&rdquo; asked Lockwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know. Mrs. Peyton seemed all on edge, &lsquo;s far&rsquo;s I could judge from her voice&mdash;but  she only said for you to come over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, I&rsquo;ll go as soon as I can get dressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once  out of doors, Lockwood couldn&rsquo;t fail to be impressed with the beauty of the  morning landscape. One of the most beautiful bits of New England scenery, it  was newly lovely in its sheath of ice.</p>
  <p>Lockwood&rsquo;s  hasty steps crunched through the crusted snow, and he hurried over to the  Waring house.</p>
  <p>Ito  opened the door for him and Mrs. Peyton met him in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  has happened to Doctor Waring,&rdquo; she said at once; &ldquo;he stayed in the study all  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that. His room door is still open, and his bed hasn&rsquo;t been slept in. Also, Ito  says he can see him in the study, through the dining-room window. I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t  looked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you go in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  study door is locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Locked!  And Doctor Waring still in there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I think he must have had a stroke&mdash;or, something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  He&rsquo;s just asleep. He&rsquo;s overworked of late, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; And Mrs. Peyton looked relieved. &ldquo;You see about it, Mr.  Lockwood, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  secretary went first to the study door. He rapped, and then he tried the door,  and then rapped again, very loudly. But no response came, and Lockwood returned  to the dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you see through that glass?&rdquo; he asked in surprise, noting the thick, leaded  mosaic of pieces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, through this corner,&rdquo; Ito directed him, and, peering through, Lockwood  discerned the figure of John Waring. He sat at his desk, his body fallen  slightly forward, and his head drooped on his breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sound  asleep,&rdquo; said Lockwood, but his tone carried no conviction.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton well knew the man&rsquo;s disinclination to show any emotion, and in spite of  his calm, she was almost certain he shared her own belief that John Waring was  not merely asleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get to him,&rdquo; Lockwood said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Can you get through  one of these windows, Ito, and unbolt the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; these windows do not open at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  open? Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Save  to remark the beauty of their color and design, Lockwood had never before  noticed the windows, especially, and was genuinely surprised to discover that  they could not be opened at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  what use are they?&rdquo; he mused, aloud; &ldquo;They give very little light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were outside windows before the study was built,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton told him, &ldquo;and  when the stained glass was put in, it was merely for decoration and the panes  were not made movable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we must get in,&rdquo; said Lockwood, almost impatiently. &ldquo;How shall we do it? You,  Ito, must know how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, there is no way. Unless, the long window is unfastened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  long French window&mdash;really a double door&mdash;was on the other side of the study,  exactly opposite the useless high windows that gave into the dining-room.</p>
  <p>To  reach it one must go out and around the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very bad snow&mdash;&rdquo; Ito shrugged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heathen!&rdquo; Lockwood exclaimed, scornfully, and himself dashed out at the front  door and around to the side of the house.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton started to follow, but the secretary bade her go back lest she take  cold.</p>
  <p>He  reached the French window only to find it locked on the inside. He could not  see in through its curtained panes, and impulsively he raised his foot and  kicked through the glass at a point high enough to allow of his putting in a  hand and turning back the latch.</p>
  <p>He  went into the room, and after the briefest glance at the man by the desk he  went on and unbolted the door to the hall.</p>
  <p>Helen  had joined her mother and Ito, and the three stood cowering on the threshold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is dead,&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood said, in a calm, unemotional way. &ldquo;But not by a  stroke&mdash;he has killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton cried, her eyes staring and her face white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away, Helen,&rdquo; Lockwood said; &ldquo;go back into the living-room, and stay away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  willingly the girl obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in, Mrs. Peyton,&rdquo; Lockwood went on. &ldquo;You must see him, though it will shock  you. See, the flow of blood is dreadful. He stabbed or shot himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Conquering  her aversion to the sight, Mrs. Peyton, from a sense of duty, drew nearer, and  as Lockwood had said, the condition of the body was terrible indeed.</p>
  <p>Wounded,  apparently in the side of the head, Waring had fallen forward in such a way  that the actual wound was concealed, but the fact was only too apparent that he  had bled to death. The blotter on the desk and many of the furnishings were  crimsoned and there was a large and dark stain on the rug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is positively dead,&rdquo; said Lockwood, in cool, even tone, &ldquo;so I advise that we do  not touch the body but send at once for Doctor Greenfield. He will know best  what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you cold-blooded wretch!&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton burst forth, uncontrollably. &ldquo;Have you no  feelings whatever? You stand there like a wooden image, when the best man in  the world lies dead before you! And you, Ito!&rdquo; She turned on the awe-struck  butler. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re another of those impassive, unnatural creatures! Oh, I hate you  both!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  housekeeper ran from the room, and was soon closeted with her daughter, who, at  least showed agitation and grief at the tragedy that had occurred.</p>
  <p>The  two she had called impassive, stood regarding one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did it, Master?&rdquo; inquired the Japanese, calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did it!&rdquo; Lockwood stared at him. &ldquo;Why, he did it himself, Ito.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Otherwise  immovable, the Oriental shook his head in dissension, but Lockwood was already  at the telephone, and heeded him not.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Greenfield consented to come over at once, and Lockwood going to the living  room, advised the Peytons to have breakfast, as there was a terrible ordeal  ahead of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have some coffee with you, if I may,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Brace up, Helen, it&rsquo;s pretty  awful for you, but you must try to be a brave girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  grateful glance thanked him for the kindness, and Lockwood returned quickly to  the study.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing?&rdquo; he said sternly, as he saw Ito bending over the dead man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  sir,&rdquo; and the butler straightened up quickly and stood at attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  the room, and do not return here without permission. Serve breakfast to the  ladies. Where is Nogi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is gone, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone  where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I do not know. Last night he was here. Now he is gone. I know no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know anything. Get out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Left  to himself, Gordon Lockwood gazed thoughtfully about the room. He did not  confine his attention to the bent figure of his late employer, nor even to the  desk or its nearby surroundings. He wandered about looking at the windows, the  floor, the furniture.</p>
  <p>One  chair, standing rather near the desk, he looked at intently. An expression of  bewilderment came into his face, followed by a look of dismay.</p>
  <p>Then,  after a cautious almost furtive glance about him, he passed his hand quickly  over the plush back of the chair, rubbing it hard, with a scrubbing motion.</p>
  <p>Then  he looked about the room even more eagerly and carefully, and finally sat down  in the same plush chair, to await the Doctor&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
  <p>Helen  Peyton came timidly to the door to ask him to come to breakfast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Helen,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;My place is here until the Doctor comes. Eat your  breakfast, child, and try to throw off your distress. It will do you no good to  brood over it. You can be of real help if you keep brave and calm, but it will  be quite otherwise if you get hysterical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not see the adoring glance she gave him, nor did he realize how much effect  his words had on her subsequent behavior. For Helen Peyton was suffering from  shocked nerves, and only Lockwood&rsquo;s advice would have been heeded by her.</p>
  <p>She  returned to the dining room, saying, quietly, &ldquo;Gordon will come after a while.  Let us eat our breakfast, mother, and try to be brave and strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not more than fifteen minutes later that Lockwood joined them.</p>
  <p>He  took his seat at the table and as he shook out his breakfast napkin he said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Greenfield is there now. He says Doctor Waring was stabbed not shot. He says  the instrument was round and pointed&mdash;not flat, like a knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did it?&rdquo; asked Helen, wide-eyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must have been suicide, Helen, for, as you know, the room was locked. How could  any one get in or out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how absurd to think of Doctor Waring killing himself!&rdquo; The girl looked more  amazed than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  never killed himself,&rdquo; stated Mrs. Peyton. &ldquo;Why, you know that man had  everything to live for! Just about to be married, just about to be President of  the College&mdash;full of life and enthusiasm&mdash;suicide! Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  only telling you what the doctor said. And you know yourselves, the room was  all locked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s so. Ito, leave the room!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton spoke sharply to the butler, who was quite evidently drinking in the  conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must not hear all we say,&rdquo; she observed after the butler had disappeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this about Nogi being gone?&rdquo; asked Lockwood, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton said, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t understand it. I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d  stay, he didn&rsquo;t like the duties at all&mdash;you know he&rsquo;s just learning to be a  butler&mdash;but queer he went off like that. His wages are due for three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  be back, then,&rdquo; surmised Lockwood. &ldquo;Now, what shall we do first? The faculty  must be notified of this tragedy and also, Mrs. Bates must be told. Which of  you two will go and tell Mrs. Bates about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go, Helen,&rdquo; said her mother after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;I ought to be here to  look after the house, and anyway, dear, you can do it wisely and gently. Mrs.  Bates likes you, and after all, it can be soon told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Helen, dismayed at the thought of the awful errand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you can,&rdquo; and Lockwood looked at her with a firm kindliness. &ldquo;You want to be of  help, don&rsquo;t you Helen? Well, here&rsquo;s one thing you can do that will be of great  assistance to your mother and to me. For on us two must fall most of the sad  duties of this day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what can I say? What can I tell her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  tell her the facts as far as you know them yourself. She will guess from your  own agitation that something has happened. And then you will tell her, as  gently as you can. Be a true woman, Helen, and remember that though your news  must break her heart, yet she&rsquo;d far rather hear it from you than from some less  sympathetic messenger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do it,&rdquo; said Helen, struggling bravely to keep her tears back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a good girl. Run right along, now, for ill news flies fast, and rumors may get  to her before you reach there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  about that Nogi,&rdquo; Lockwood said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Call Ito back, please, Mrs.  Peyton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you see Nogi last?&rdquo; the secretary asked of the butler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I came home last night, sir. Sunday is my holiday. I returned about ten, and as  I found Nogi with his duties all properly done, and at his post, I went to bed.  I found this morning that he had not been in his bed at all. His clothes are  gone, and all his belongings. I think he will not come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="VI"></a><b>Chapter VI<br>
  An Incredible Case</b></h2>
  <p>When  Lockwood returned to the study, he found the Medical Examiner and Doctor  Greenfield in consultation.</p>
  <p>The  Examiner was a large, pompous-looking man, with an air of authority. He looked  at Gordon Lockwood from beneath his heavy brows, and demanded, &ldquo;What do you  know of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  younger man resented the tone but he knew the question was justified, and so he  replied, respectfully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  more than you can see for yourself, sir. I broke in at that glass door, being  unable to get in any other way, and I found Doctor Waring&mdash;as you see him now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was some other way, though, to get in and out,&rdquo; Examiner Marsh stated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positively  not,&rdquo; Lockwood repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  contradict me! I tell you there must have been&mdash;for this man was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  sir,&rdquo; and Lockwood&rsquo;s eyes met the Examiner&rsquo;s with a gaze fully as calm and  insistent as his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, how came he by his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not the Examiner,&rdquo; the Secretary said, and he folded his arms and leaned  against the corner of the great mantelpiece; &ldquo;but since you ask me, I will  repeat that there was no way of ingress into this room last night, and that  necessarily, the case is a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so; and, granting that, will you suggest what may have become of the weapon  that was used?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was the weapon?&rdquo; Lockwood asked, not so disturbed by the question as the  Examiner had expected him to be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what puzzles me,&rdquo; returned Doctor Marsh. &ldquo;As you can clearly see the wound  was inflicted with a sharp instrument. The man was stabbed just below his right  ear. The jugular vein was pierced, and he bled to death. A plexus of nerves was  pierced also, and this fact doubtless rendered the victim unconscious at once&mdash;I  mean as soon as the stab wound was made, though he may have been alive for a  few minutes thereafter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood gazed imperturbably at the speaker. He had always prided himself on  his unshakable calm, and now he exhibited its full possibilities. It annoyed  Doctor Marsh, who was accustomed to having his statements accepted without  question. He took a sudden dislike to this calm young man, who presumed to  differ from his deductions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must say,&rdquo; observed the mild-mannered Doctor Greenfield, &ldquo;I knew Doctor Waring  very well, and he was surely the last person I would expect to kill himself.  Especially at the present time&mdash;when he was looking forward to high honors in  the College and also expected to marry a charming lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t the point,&rdquo; exclaimed Doctor Marsh, impatiently. &ldquo;The point is, if he  killed himself, where is the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admit it isn&rsquo;t in view&mdash;and I admit that seems strange,&rdquo; Lockwood agreed, &ldquo;but  it may yet be discovered, while a way of getting into a locked room cannot be  found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of which is out of your jurisdiction, young man,&rdquo; and Marsh looked at him  severely. &ldquo;The police will be here soon, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt they will learn the  truth, whatever it may be. What instrument do you deduce, Doctor Greenfield?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  hard to say,&rdquo; replied Greenfield, slowly. &ldquo;You see the aperture it made is a  perfectly round hole. Now, most daggers or poniards are flat-bladed. I&rsquo;m not  sure a real weapon is ever round. The hole is much too large to have been made  by a hatpin&mdash;it is as big as a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Slate  pencil,&rdquo; suggested the Examiner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or a trifle larger&mdash;but not so large as a lead-pencil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lead-pencil could hardly accomplish the deed,&rdquo; Marsh mused. &ldquo;A slate-pencil  might have&mdash;but that is a most unusual weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  about a bill-file?&rdquo; asked Doctor Greenfield. &ldquo;I knew of a man killed with one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but where is the bill-file?&rdquo; asked Marsh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one on the desk, to be sure,  but it is full of papers, and shows no sign of having been used for a criminal  purpose. If, as Mr. Lockwood insists, this is a suicide case, the victim  positively could not have cleaned that file and restored the papers after  stabbing himself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  most certainly could not have done that!&rdquo; declared Doctor Greenfield.</p>
  <p>Marsh  examined the file carefully. It was an ordinary affair consisting of a steel  spike on a bronze standard. It would without doubt make an efficacious  implement of murder, but it was difficult to believe it had been used in that  way. For the bills and memoranda it contained were, to all appearance, just as  they had been thrust on the sharp point&mdash;and surely, had they been removed and  replaced, they would have shown traces of such moving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo;  Doctor Greenfield said, after another examination, &ldquo;the hole in the side of  Waring&rsquo;s neck seems to me to have been made with an instrument slightly larger  than that file. Surely, there are round stilettos, are there not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  there are,&rdquo; said Lockwood, &ldquo;I have seen them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  demanded the Examiner, suddenly turning on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; For once, the Secretary&rsquo;s calm was a trifle shaken. &ldquo;I should say  in museums&mdash;or in private collections, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you familiar with so many private collections of strange weapons that you can&rsquo;t  remember where you have seen a round-shaped blade?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Examiner  Marsh stared hard at him and Lockwood became taciturn again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  that,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;I have sometime, somewhere, seen a round-bladed  stiletto&mdash;but I cannot remember where.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  brush up your memory,&rdquo; Marsh told him, and then the police arrived.</p>
  <p>The  local police of Corinth were rather proud of themselves as a whole, and they  had reason to be. Under a worthwhile chief the men had been well trained, and  were alert, energetic and capable.</p>
  <p>Detective  Morton, who took this matter in charge, went straight to work in a most  business-like way.</p>
  <p>He  examined the body of John Waring, not as the medical men had done, but merely  to find possible clues to the manner of his death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this ring on his forehead?&rdquo; he asked, looking at the dead man&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;that struck me as queer,&rdquo; said Greenfield. &ldquo;What is it, Doctor Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Examiner peered through his glasses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t make that out, myself,&rdquo; he confessed, frankly.</p>
  <p>Morton  looked more closely.</p>
  <p>There  was a red circle on Waring&rsquo;s forehead, that looked as if it had been put there  of some purpose.</p>
  <p>A  perfect circle it was, about two inches in diameter, and it was red and sunken  into the flesh, as if it might have been done with a branding iron.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a very hot one, though,&rdquo; Morton remarked, after suggesting this, &ldquo;but surely  somebody did it. I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s the sign or seal of the murderer himself. For a  dead man couldn&rsquo;t do it, and there&rsquo;s no sense in assuming that Doctor Waring  branded himself before committing suicide. Was it done before or after death?&rdquo;  he asked of the two doctors present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before,  I should say,&rdquo; Doctor Greenfield opined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  concurred Marsh, &ldquo;but not long before. I&rsquo;m not sure it is a brand&mdash;such a mark  could have been made with, say, a small cup or tumbler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what reason is there in that?&rdquo; exclaimed Morton. &ldquo;Even a lunatic murderer  wouldn&rsquo;t mark his victim by means of a tumbler rim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Absorbedly,  he picked up a tumbler from the water tray, and fitted it to the red mark on  Waring&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t fit exactly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it does almost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  said Gordon Lockwood, in his superior way. &ldquo;Why would any one mark Doctor  Waring&rsquo;s face with a tumbler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it has been marked,&rdquo; Morton looked at the secretary sharply. &ldquo;Can you suggest  any explanation&mdash;however difficult of belief?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Lockwood said. &ldquo;Unless he fell over on some round thing as he died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing here,&rdquo; said Morton, scanning the furnishings of the desk &ldquo;The inkstand  is closed&mdash;and it&rsquo;s a smaller round, anyway. There&rsquo;s no one of these desk  fittings that could possibly have made that mark. Therefore, since it was made  before death, it must have been done by the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  by the suicide,&rdquo; Lockwood insisted firmly.</p>
  <p>Morton,  looking at the secretary, decided to keep an eye on this cool chap, who must  have some reason for repeating his opinion of suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  the detective said, briskly, &ldquo;to get to business, I must make inquiries of the  family&mdash;the household. Suppose I see them in some other room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed Lockwood, with what seemed to Morton suspicious eagerness. Why should  the secretary be so obviously pleased to leave the study&mdash;though, to be sure, it  was a grewsome place just now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute,&rdquo; Morton said, &ldquo;how about robbery? Has anything been missed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never thought to look,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;assuming suicide, of course robbery didn&rsquo;t  occur to me.&rdquo; He looked round the room. &ldquo;Nothing seems to be missing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay  on guard, Higby,&rdquo; the detective said to a policeman, and then asked the  secretary where he could interview the housekeeper and the servants.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  took Morton to the living-room, and there they found Mrs. Bates as well as the  two Peytons.</p>
  <p>Though  her eyes showed traces of tears, Emily Bates was composed and met the detective  with an appealing face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  find the murderer!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how much that room was locked up,  I know John Waring never killed himself! Why would he do it? Did ever a man  have so much to live for? He couldn&rsquo;t have taken his life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  inclined to agree with you, Mrs. Bates,&rdquo; Morton told her, &ldquo;yet you must see the  difficulties in the way of a murder theory. I&rsquo;m told the room was inaccessible.  Is not that right, Mrs. Peyton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flustered  at the sudden question the housekeeper wrung her hands and burst into tears. &ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  indicative, perhaps,&rdquo; and Morton spoke more gently, &ldquo;but at least, tell me all  you do know. When did you see Doctor Waring last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the supper table, last evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  after supper at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is, I didn&rsquo;t <i>see</i> him. I am  training a new servant, and I watched him as he took a tray of water pitcher  and glasses into the study, but I didn&rsquo;t look in, nor did I see the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think I heard him speak. I heard a paper rustle, and I knew he was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  servant came right out again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  my attention was all on him. I told him exactly what to do during the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were those instructions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  attend to his dining-room duties, putting away the supper dishes and that, and  then to stay about, on duty, until Doctor Waring left his study and went to  bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  servant had done these things before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  these things. He arrived but a few days ago, and Ito the butler, attended to  the Doctor. But Sunday afternoon and evening Ito has off, so I began to train  Nogi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this Nogi has disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  he is not to be found this morning. Nor has his bed been disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we may take it he left in the night or early morning. Now the doctors judge  that Doctor Waring died about midnight. We must therefore admit the possibility  of a connection between the Jap&rsquo;s disappearance and the Doctor&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this suggestion, Gordon Lockwood looked interested. Whereas he had preserved a  stony calm, his face now showed deep attention to the detective&rsquo;s words and he  nodded his head in agreement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think so, too, Mr. Lockwood?&rdquo; Morton asked, in that sudden and often disconcerting  way of his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say I think so,&rdquo; the secretary returned, quietly, &ldquo;but I do admit a  possibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem so,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton put in, &ldquo;if Nogi could have got into the study. But  he couldn&rsquo;t. You know it was locked&mdash;impossible, Mr. Lockwood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Gordon returned. &ldquo;I heard Doctor Waring lock his door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was that?&rdquo; asked the detective, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say about ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sitting  in the window nook outside the study door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  you not, then, hear anything that went on in the study?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  not. The walls and door are thick&mdash;they were made so for the doctor&rsquo;s sake&mdash;he  desired absolute privacy, and freedom from interruption or overhearing. No, I  could not know what was taking place in that room&mdash;if anything was, at that  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time did you last see the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  supper I went with him to the study. I looked after his wants, getting him a  number of books from the shelves, and selecting from his files such notes or  manuscript as he asked for. Those are my duties as secretary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he practically dismissed me, saying I might leave for the night. But I remained  in the hall window until eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  of consideration for my employer. He was exceedingly busy and if a caller came,  I could probably attend to his wants and spare the doctor an interruption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  any one call?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you remained until eleven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I was doing some work of my own, and it was later than I thought, when I  decided to go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you spoke to the Doctor before leaving?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  is my custom, I tapped lightly at the door and said good-night. This is my  rule, when he is busy, and if he makes no response, or merely murmurs  good-night, I know there are no further orders till morning, and I go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he respond to your rap last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  cannot say. I heard him murmur a good-night but if he did, it was so low as to  be almost inaudible. I thought nothing of it. Since he did not call out. &lsquo;Come  in, Lockwood,&rsquo; as he does when he wants me, I paid little attention to the  matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you reached home&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  after eleven. It&rsquo;s but a few steps over to the Adams house, where I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  summed up the detective, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the case. You, Mr. Lockwood, are not sure  Doctor Waring responded to your good-night. You did not see or hear him when  Nogi took in the water tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Peyton did not see him then, either&mdash;though she imagined she heard a paper  rustle. Nogi is gone&mdash;he cannot be questioned. So, Mr. Lockwood, the last person  whom we know definitely to have seen John Waring alive, is yourself when, as  you say, you left him at about&mdash;er&mdash;what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  half-past eight or nine,&rdquo; said Lockwood, carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you left him and sat in the hall window. Now, we have no positive evidence that  he was alive after that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  Lockwood stared at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  positive evidence, I say. Nogi went in, but no one knows what Nogi saw in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, Detective Morton,&rdquo; Lockwood said, coldly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re romancing. Do you  suppose for a minute, that if there had been anything wrong with Doctor Waring  when Nogi went in with the water, that he would not have raised an alarm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose that might have easily have been the case. The Japanese are afraid of  death. Their one idea is to flee from it. If that Japanese servant had seen his  master dead, he would have decamped, just as he did do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Nogi was here when I went home. He handed me my overcoat and hat, quite with  his usual calm demeanor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must remember, Mr. Lockwood, we have only your word for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood looked at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not pretend to misunderstand your meaning,&rdquo; he said, slowly and with  hauteur. &ldquo;Nor shall I say a word, at present, in self defence. Your implication  is so absurd, so really ridiculous, there is nothing to be said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; and Morton nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything until you get counsel. Now, Mrs.  Bates&mdash;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry to bother you&mdash;but I must ask you a few questions. And if  I size you up right, you&rsquo;ll be glad to tell anything you can to help discover  the truth. That so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she returned, &ldquo;yes&mdash;of course, Mr. Morton. But I can&rsquo;t let you seem to suspect  Mr. Lockwood of wrong-doing without a protest! Doctor Waring&rsquo;s secretary is  most loyal and devoted&mdash;of that I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that side of it just now. Tell me this, Mrs. Bates. Who will benefit  financially by Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death? To whom is his fortune willed? I take it  you must know, as you expected soon to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Emily Bates said, a little indignantly. &ldquo;Nor do I see how it can  help you to solve the mystery to get such information as that. You don&rsquo;t  suppose anybody killed him for his money, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other motive could there be, Mrs. Bates? Had he enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  well, that is, I suppose he had some acquaintances who were disappointed at his  election to the College Presidency. But I&rsquo;d hardly call them enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Why wouldn&rsquo;t they be enemies? It&rsquo;s my impression that election was hotly  contested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton broke in. &ldquo;It was, Mr. Morton, and if Doctor Waring was  murdered&mdash;which I can&rsquo;t see how he was&mdash;some of that other faction did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that&rsquo;s absurd,&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood protested; &ldquo;there was disappointment among the  other faction at the result of the election, but it&rsquo;s incredible that they  should kill Doctor Waring for that reason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole case is incredible,&rdquo; Morton returned. &ldquo;What is it, Higby, what have you  found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  doctor,&rdquo; Higby said, coming into the living room, &ldquo;they have just noticed that  although there is a pinhole in Doctor Waring&rsquo;s tie, there is no stickpin there.  Did he wear one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he did,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates cried. &ldquo;He had on his ruby pin yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did so,&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Peyton. &ldquo;That ruby pin was worth an immense sum of money!  That&rsquo;s why he was killed, then, robbery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  certainly wore that pin last night,&rdquo; said Lockwood. &ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s missing?  Hasn&rsquo;t it dropped to the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  find it,&rdquo; returned Higby, and then all the men went back to the study.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  else missing?&rdquo; asked Morton, who was deeply chagrined that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed  the pin was gone himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  about money, Mr. Lockwood?&rdquo; said Doctor Marsh. &ldquo;Any gone, that you can notice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  an uncertain motion, Gordon Lockwood pulled open a small drawer of the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;there was five hundred dollars in cash here last night&mdash;and now it is  not here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  dismiss the suicide theory,&rdquo; said Detective Morton, with a quick look at the  secretary.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    The Volume Of Martial</b></h2>
  <p>The  Medical Examiner, Doctor Marsh, the Detective Morton, and the Secretary of the  late John Waring, Gordon Lockwood, looked at one another.</p>
  <p>Without  any words having been spoken that might indicate a lack of harmony, there yet  was a hint of discord in their attitudes.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Marsh was sure the case was a suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find the stiletto somewhere,&rdquo; he shrugged, when held upon that point. &ldquo;To find  the weapon is not my business&mdash;but when a man is dead in a locked room, and dead  from a wound that could have been self-administered, I can&rsquo;t see a murder  situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; said Lockwood. &ldquo;Has the waste-basket been searched for the thing that  killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Acting  quickly on his own suggestion, Gordon Lockwood dived beneath the great desk.</p>
  <p>Like  a flash, Morton was after him, and though the detective was not sure, he  thought he saw the secretary grasp a bit of crumpled paper and stuff it in his  pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, I&rsquo;ll make that search,&rdquo; Morton exclaimed, and almost snatched the  waste-basket from the other&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; and Lockwood put his hands in his pockets and stood looking on, as  Morton fumbled with the scraps.</p>
  <p>He  emptied the basket on the floor, but there were only a few torn envelopes and  memoranda, which were soon proved to be of no indicative value to the  searchers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  save the stuff, anyway,&rdquo; Morton declared, getting a newspaper and wrapping in  it the few bits of waste paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you take a paper from this basket and put it in your pocket?&rdquo; the detective  suddenly demanded.</p>
  <p>Lockwood,  without moving, gave Morton a cold stare that was more negative than any words  could be, and was, moreover, exceedingly disconcerting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you suspect me of killing my employer, come out  and say so. I know, in story-books, the first one to be suspected is the  confidential secretary. So, accuse me, and get it over with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  very impassivity of Lockwood&rsquo;s face seemed to put him far beyond and above  suspicion, and the detective, hastily mumbled,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, Mr. Lockwood, not at all. But you don&rsquo;t seem real frank, now, and you  must know how important it is that we get all the first hand information we  can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, and I&rsquo;m ready to tell all I know. Go on and ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, what do you surmise has become of that five hundred dollars and that ruby  stickpin? Doesn&rsquo;t their disappearance rather argue against suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  meditated. &ldquo;Not necessarily. If they have been stolen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stolen!  Of course they&rsquo;ve been stolen, since they aren&rsquo;t here! I don&rsquo;t see any safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Doctor Waring had no safe. There has been little or no robbery in Corinth, and  Doctor Waring rarely kept much money about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  hundred dollars is quite a sum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was for housekeeping purposes. Whenever necessary, I drew for him from the bank  that amount, and he kept it in that drawer until it was used up. He always gave  Mrs. Peyton cash to pay the servants and some other matters as well as her own  salary. His tradesman&rsquo;s bills were paid by check.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the money in bills?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  invariably brought it to him in the same denominations. Two hundred in five  dollar bills, two hundred in ones, and a hundred in silver coins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  paper rolls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  it may have been injudicious to keep so large a sum in his desk drawer, but he  always did. Though, to be sure, he often paid out a great deal of it at once.  Sometimes he would cash checks for some one or give some to the poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drawer  never locked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  locked. But both the Doctor and I carried a key. He was not so suspicious of me  as you are, Mr. Morton.&rdquo; The speaker gave his cold smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as to the ruby pin, Mr. Lockwood?&rdquo; Morton went on. &ldquo;Are you willing we should  search your effects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  started and for a moment he almost lost his equipoise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not willing,&rdquo; he said, after an instant&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;but if you say it is  necessary, I suppose I shall have to submit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Morton  looked at him uneasily. He had no appearance of a criminal, he looked too proud  and haughty to be a culprit, yet might that not be sheer bravado?</p>
  <p>Discontinuing  the conversation, Morton turned his attention to the table in the window in the  hall where the secretary so often sat.</p>
  <p>He  examined the appurtenances, for the table was furnished almost like a desk, and  he picked up a silver penholder.</p>
  <p>It  was round and smooth and without chasing or marking of any sort, save for the  initials G. L.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  yours?&rdquo; he asked, and Lockwood nodded assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask you, Doctor Marsh,&rdquo; Morton turned to the Examiner, &ldquo;whether that wound  which is in Doctor Waring&rsquo;s neck could have been made with this penholder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Startled,  Marsh took the implement and carefully scrutinized it. Of usual length, it was  tapering and ended in a point. The circumference at the larger end was just  about the circumference of the wound in question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must say it could be possible,&rdquo; Marsh replied, his eyes alternately on the  penholder and on the dead man. &ldquo;Yes, it is exactly the size.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it is strong enough and sharp enough, and it is round,&rdquo; summed up Morton. &ldquo;Now,  Mr. Lockwood, I make no accusation. I&rsquo;m no novice, and I know there&rsquo;s a  possibility that this might have been the weapon used, and yet it might not  have been used by you. But I will say, that I have much to say to you yet, and  I advise you not to try to leave town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no intention of leaving town or of trying to do so,&rdquo; Lockwood asserted, &ldquo;but,&rdquo;  he went on, &ldquo;would you mind telling me, if I killed the man I was devoted to,  how I left the room locked behind me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  locked rooms bore me,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read lots of detective stories  founded on that plot. Invariably the locked room proves to be vulnerable at  some point. I haven&rsquo;t finished examining the doors and windows myself as yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed  with your examinations, then,&rdquo; said Lockwood; &ldquo;if you can find a secret or concealed  entrance, it&rsquo;s more than I can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  than you will do, perhaps, but not necessarily more than you can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  forget that vanished Japanese,&rdquo; prompted Marsh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve small faith in Orientals,  and if there is a way to get in and out secretly, I&rsquo;d question the Jap before I  would Mr. Lockwood here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  should I,&rdquo; declared the impassive secretary himself. &ldquo;And another thing don&rsquo;t  forget, Morton, after the Private Secretary, the next person to be suspected is  the butler&mdash;that is in fiction, which I gather you take as your manual of  procedure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood&rsquo;s  sarcasm drove Morton frantic, but he was too wise to show his annoyance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall neglect no possible suspect,&rdquo; he said, with dignity.</p>
  <p>And  then two men came from the police, who said they were photographers and desired  to take some pictures, at the Chief&rsquo;s orders.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  left them, and went to the living-room where the household and a few neighbors  were assembled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to get out of that detective atmosphere,&rdquo; he said, relaxing in an easy  chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to have the man dead, without seeing and hearing those  cold-blooded police bungling over their &lsquo;clues&rsquo; and &lsquo;evidences.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me a little of the circumstances,&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bates, who was present. &ldquo;I can  bear it from you, Gordon, and I must know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently,  Doctor Waring was sitting at his desk, reading,&rdquo; Lockwood began, with a faraway  look, as if trying to reconstruct the scene. &ldquo;He must have been reading  Martial&mdash;for the volume was open on the desk&mdash;and the pages were blood-stained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Bates gave a little cry, and shuddered, but Lockwood went unmovably on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were other books about, some open, some closed, but Martial was nearest his  hand&mdash;quite as if he were reading up to the last moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the murderer came!&rdquo; Mrs. Bates breathed softly, her eyes wide with horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  couldn&rsquo;t have been murder,&rdquo; Lockwood said, in a positive way, &ldquo;you see, Mrs.  Bates, it just couldn&rsquo;t have been. That Morton detective is trying to trump up  a way the assassin could have entered that locked room&mdash;but he can&rsquo;t find any  way. I know he can&rsquo;t. So it must have been suicide. Much as we dislike to admit  it, it is the only possible theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they say there was robbery,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton put in. &ldquo;The ruby pin is gone and the  money from the drawer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  perhaps,&rdquo; Gordon said, &ldquo;they were taken by a robber who did not also murder his  victim. Nogi, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course!&rdquo; cried Helen Peyton, quickly; &ldquo;I see it! I never could abide Nogi, with  his stealthy ways. He stole the things, and then he ran away, and later, Doctor  Waring killed himself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the robbery!&rdquo; exclaimed Emily Bates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo; Lockwood returned. &ldquo;Certainly not for that. Indeed, the motive is the  greatest mystery of all. We could perhaps imagine a motive for murder&mdash;whether  it was robbery, or some brute of &lsquo;the other faction&rsquo; or some old enemy of whom  we know nothing. But for suicide, though I am sure it was that, I can think of  no motive whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bates. &ldquo;I knew him better than any of you, and I know&mdash;I know for  a certainty, that he was a happy man. That he looked forward eagerly to his  marriage with me, that he was happy in the thought of his Presidency&mdash;that he  hadn&rsquo;t a real trouble in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  other faction,&rdquo; began Mrs. Peyton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Bates, firmly. &ldquo;He knew he was doing his duty, upholding the  principles and tradition of his College, and the other faction did not worry  him. He was too big-minded, too broad-visioned to allow that to trouble him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you&rsquo;re quite right, Mrs. Bates,&rdquo; Lockwood agreed; &ldquo;but granting it was  suicide, what do you think was the cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was suicide, I know it couldn&rsquo;t have  been. He was too happy, too good, too fine, to do such a thing, even if he had  had a reason. And then, what did he do it with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Morton  imagines a secret entrance of some sort,&rdquo; said Lockwood. &ldquo;If there is one, the  robber could have come in afterward, and could have carried off the weapon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Gordon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bates, sternly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too absurd! If it had been  suicide&mdash;which it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;why under heaven would a burglar coming in later, take  away the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  save himself,&rdquo; said Lockwood, shortly. &ldquo;So he wouldn&rsquo;t be suspected of the  greater crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  said Mrs. Peyton, irately; &ldquo;I never heard such rubbish! And, in the first  place, there&rsquo;s no secret entrance to the study. I haven&rsquo;t swept and dusted and  vacuum-cleaned that place all these years without knowing that! Yes, and had  the room redecorated and refloored, and&mdash;Oh, I know every inch of it! There&rsquo;s no  possible chance of a secret entrance. Who built it and when and why? Not Doctor  Waring. His life&rsquo;s always been an open book. Never has he had any secret  errands, any callers whom I didn&rsquo;t know, any matters on which he was silent or  uncommunicative. Until his engagement to Mrs. Bates, he hadn&rsquo;t a ripple in his  quiet life, and that he told me about as soon as it occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton looked squarely at Doctor Waring&rsquo;s fiancee, as if to imply a complete  knowledge of the courtship, as well as an intimate knowledge of the Doctor&rsquo;s  life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; Lockwood said. &ldquo;He was a man without secrets. He was always willing I  should open his mail, and there was never a letter that I did not know about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  even as he spoke, the man remembered the crumpled paper he had taken from the  waste basket, and he felt it in his pocket, though he made no sign.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  people, is my aunt here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Pinky Payne, who, all excitement, came running in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  just heard, and I want to see Aunt Emily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am, dear. Come here, my boy,&rdquo; and she drew him down beside her on the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do they say, Pinky? What&rsquo;s the talk in town?&rdquo; Lockwood asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the place is in a turmoil. There are the wildest reports. Some say it&rsquo;s  a&mdash;a&mdash;that he killed himself, you know, and some say&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t. Which was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy&rsquo;s lip quivered as he looked about at the silent people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  him, Gordon,&rdquo; begged Mrs. Bates, and Lockwood told the principal details of the  mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  a suicide! never!&rdquo; Pinckney Payne declared. &ldquo;I know Doc Waring too well for  that. Suicide means a coward&mdash;and he was never that! No, Aunt Emily, it was  murder. Oh, how terrible,&rdquo; and the boy almost lost control of himself. &ldquo;You  were at the bottom of it, Auntie. I&rsquo;m sure it was either one of those men you  refused when you took up with Doc Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Pinckney! How dreadful of you! Don&rsquo;t say such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I know it. If you&rsquo;d heard Jim Haskell and Philip Leonard talk&mdash;I felt sure they  meant to kill Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pinky,  I forbid you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s true, Auntie. And if it&rsquo;s true, you want them shown up, don&rsquo;t you,  whichever one it was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Pinky&mdash;hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  shut up, Pink,&rdquo; Lockwood spoke sternly. &ldquo;What you suggest is highly improbable,  but even if there&rsquo;s suspicion of such a thing, don&rsquo;t babble about it. That&rsquo;s  the detective&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and  who&rsquo;s your detective? Old blind-as-a-bat Morton, I&rsquo;ll bet, who can&rsquo;t see a hole  through a ladder! I&rsquo;ll show him now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pinky,  I beg of you, hush,&rdquo; said his Aunt, losing her self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  Auntie, dear, don&rsquo;t cry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to worry you, but something must be  done&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  will be done, Pinky,&rdquo; Lockwood assured him. &ldquo;But I tell you right now, if you  try to stick your inexperienced finger in this pie, you&rsquo;ll make trouble for us  all&mdash;from your aunt down. Now, behave yourself. Try to be a man, not a foolish  boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m doing! And I don&rsquo;t propose to lie down on the job, either. I tell you,  Gordon. I know a lot about detective work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  it out, Pink,&rdquo; said Helen, and her words seemed to have an effect on the irrepressible  youth. &ldquo;To read detective stories is one thing&mdash;to solve a real, live mystery is  quite another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Helen,&rdquo; and Lockwood nodded approval. &ldquo;Many a person thinks he has a bit  of detective instinct, when all he has is curiosity and imagination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen,  pleased at this appreciation went on to lay down the law for Pinckney Payne.</p>
  <p>She  was interrupted by the entrance of Morton who wanted to learn more of the  departed Japanese, Nogi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other servants are there?&rdquo; he asked Mrs. Peyton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the two Japanese,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They do all the cooking and serving at table;  all the cleaning of the house; and the rest, my daughter and myself attend to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a chauffeur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but the garage is a few blocks away, and the chauffeur lives at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had Nogi but a short time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  came well recommended?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had very fine written recommendations, but from people I did not know, and too  far away to inquire of. I took him on trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seemed honest and faithful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seemed so&mdash;but he was silent and moody&mdash;a man one could scarcely understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you imagine his killing his master&mdash;granting the opportunity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton considered. &ldquo;I can imagine it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say I  would suspect him of it. He was soft-footed, and went about with a sort of  stealthy manner, but I&rsquo;m not prepared to say he was wrong in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  in Ito, the other one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ito  came, and stood stolidly by. His impassive demeanor was not unlike that of  Gordon Lockwood. Waring had sometimes remarked this in a chaffing way to his  secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew this Nogi?&rdquo; asked Morton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  since he came here,&rdquo; answered the butler, in perfect English.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  liked him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  yes nor no. He knew little of his duties, but he was willing to learn. He was  respectful to me, and friendly enough. I had no reason to dislike him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Morton  didn&rsquo;t seem to get anywhere with this man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what do you think of his character?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you say he was capable of  killing his employer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  men are capable of crime,&rdquo; said the Jap, in a low, even voice, &ldquo;but he could  not kill Doctor Waring and go away leaving the study locked on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he go away, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I do not know. It may be he tired of the place here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there was money due him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that makes it hard to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Morton  had an uncomfortable feeling that the Japanese was scornful of him, and, worse  still, that the other listeners were also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may go,&rdquo; he told Ito, and then, turning to Lockwood, he said, a little belligerently,  &ldquo;Who is in charge here? To whom do I make my report?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question was like a bombshell. All were silent, until Mrs. Bates said, &ldquo;I  suppose I am what might be called in charge. You may report to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; Morton was, clearly, surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  as Doctor Waring&rsquo;s affianced wife, and as his heir, I feel I am in authority.  And also, I wish all reports made to me, as I am the one most deeply interested  in learning the identity of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he was murdered,&rdquo; supplemented Mrs. Bates.</p>
  <p>And  Mrs. Peyton broke in, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think, Mr. Morton, that there&rsquo;s such a thing  as a secret entrance or secret passage in this house, for I know there is not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  there are other theories, other possibilities,&rdquo; the detective said, his air a  little less important than it had been. &ldquo;Suppose, now, that Nogi had robbed and  murdered his master, when he carried in the water tray. Just suppose that, and  suppose that, with his Japanese cunning he had devised a way to lock the door  behind him&mdash;or, say, he had gone out by the glass door, and had locked that  behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  cried Pinckney, his eyes wide with excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  he had previously removed a pane of glass&mdash;they are not large panes. Say, he  reached through, locked the door inside&mdash;the French window, I mean&mdash;and then had  put in the pane, reputtied it, and gone away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;  cried the boy. &ldquo;That could be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it could. And there are other ways it might have been accomplished. Now,  we don&rsquo;t say that did happen, but what I want to know is, who is at the head of  this investigation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t feel that Mrs. Bates is,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton said, a little sullenly. &ldquo;She was  not married yet, and therefore, as resident housekeeper, I feel rather in  authority myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you say you are the heir, Mrs. Bates?&rdquo; the detective inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I ought not to have told that,&rdquo; Emily Bates spoke regretfully. &ldquo;But Doctor  Waring&rsquo;s lawyer will tell you, it is true I am the principal heir. It is so  designated in his will, which you will find in a secret drawer in his desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know where this drawer is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later  on, I will ask you to show us. If you are the heir, there is no further  question of your authority here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Detective Morton left the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    Where Is Nogi?</b></h2>
  <p>Twenty-four  hours later Cray, the District Prosecuting Attorney, stood in the Waring study.</p>
  <p>The  body of the master had been removed, and to Cray&rsquo;s regret he had not seen it  before the embalmer&rsquo;s work had removed the red ring on the forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a sign,&rdquo; he said to Morton, who was moodily listening. &ldquo;A sign like that,  left by the murderer, always means revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  agree to murder, then?&rdquo; Morton spoke eagerly, glad to have his theory  corroborated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else? Look here, Morton; it&rsquo;s got to be either murder or suicide, hasn&rsquo;t it?  Yes? Well, then, to which of the two do the greater number of clues point? Sum  up. For suicide we have only the locked room argument. I admit I don&rsquo;t know how  any one could get in or out of this study, but, as I say, that&rsquo;s the only sign  of suicide. Now, for murder we have the absence of the weapon, the robbery of  the money and the ruby, and sign of a circle on the dead man&rsquo;s forehead. Wish I&rsquo;d  seen that. It wasn&rsquo;t burnt on, for it disappeared after the embalmers took care  of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, it wasn&rsquo;t as deep as a burn. More like an impression left by a ring of cold  metal or the edge of a glass tumbler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  strange, and decidedly an important clue. For, here&rsquo;s the queer part. The  doctors declare the mark must have been made while the man was alive&mdash;now, how  can that be explained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  it up. It&rsquo;s too much for me. But it was too small a circle to have been made by  the tumbler on the water tray. I measured it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; that&rsquo;s why I think it was a sign of revenge. Suppose the motive was  revenge and the reason for revenge had something to do with a quarrel in which  a small glass or cup figured. That&rsquo;s the idea, though, of course, it needn&rsquo;t  have been a glass or cup at all, but something with a ring-like edge. Thus,  there was a reason for the sign on the dead man&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; though I never could have doped it out like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s exactly what happened, but there must have been something of  the sort, for what other hypothesis fits the case at all? We can&rsquo;t imagine  Doctor Waring branding his own forehead, and then killing himself, can we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  and if he had, where&rsquo;s the branding iron&mdash;to call it that&mdash;and where&rsquo;s the  dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right. Now, I propose to treat the matter as a murder case, and look for the  criminal first, and then find out how he entered the locked room afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  those locked rooms&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  &lsquo;way off, Morton, when you sneer at a &lsquo;locked room.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was locked&mdash;I mean impenetrably locked. There is no secret passage&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m  sure. Your ingenious idea of removing and replacing a whole pane of glass was  clever, I grant, but we&rsquo;ve seen that not a pane has been lately reputtied. They&rsquo;re  all framed in old, dried, hard, and even painted putty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it. But some other such way might have been devised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  think of any. We&rsquo;ve examined all the window sashes and door frame&mdash;oh, well, so  far as I can see the room was absolutely unenterable. But, notwithstanding, I&rsquo;m  going to work on a murder basis. Because inexplicable as that seems, there are  even more insurmountable difficulties in the way of the suicide theory. Now, I  suppose you&rsquo;ve had the finger print expert in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I  haven&rsquo;t&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Lord! What kind of a detective are you? Well, get him, and put him to work.  What about footprints?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inside  the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  outside, either. But inside, I suppose has been trampled by a score of people!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t get footprints on a thick rug,&rdquo; the discomfited Morton grumbled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes  you can. And a polished floor will often show marks. What have you done,  anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was enough to do, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; Morton flared back at him. &ldquo;I have been busy every  minute since I began, except for a few hours sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over  twenty-four hours since the alarm was given. You&rsquo;ve put in at least twelve,  then. What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lot. I&rsquo;ve found out, to my own satisfaction, that&mdash;if it is a murder&mdash;Gordon  Lockwood knows all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Either  of the deed, or of guilty knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money.  That young man is over head and ears in debt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  shops&mdash;jewelers, florists, restaurants. All the debts a gay young blade would  incur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  amaze me, Morton. Lockwood isn&rsquo;t that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  he? You&rsquo;re deceived, like every one else, by that icy calm of his. He stares  haughtily, and appears above and beyond ordinary mortals, but he&rsquo;s deep. That&rsquo;s  what he is, deep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  how did he do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  his penholder. A smooth, sharp silver penholder. And he took the money and the  ruby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how did he leave the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me that! That&rsquo;s his secret. But, I&rsquo;ve a notion he was in cahoots with that  new Jap, the one that vamoosed. I theorize,&rdquo; Morton waxed important as he noted  the Prosecutor&rsquo;s attention, &ldquo;that the Jap had some grudge against Waring, and  it was he who branded his forehead, and who contrived a way to leave the room  locked behind him. Why, I read a story the other day, where a key was turned  from the other side of a door by means of a slender steel bar through the key  handle, and a string from the bar, leading down and under the door. Once  outside, the murderer pulled the string, the bar turned the key in the lock,  the bar fell to the floor and he dragged it under the door by means of the  string.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ingenious!  but it implies a door raised from the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. And this one isn&rsquo;t. But it all goes to prove that there can be some  way&mdash;some diabolically clever way to do the trick. And the Japanese are  diabolically clever. And so is Lockwood. And if the two worked together they  could accomplish wonders. Then Lockwood with his wooden face, could disarm  suspicion. The Jap, let us say, couldn&rsquo;t, so Lockwood packed him off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Interesting&mdash;but  all theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  be proved or disproved, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but meantime, you are losing time on more practical investigation. Let&rsquo;s look  outside for footprints&mdash;I mean for any one coming or going from this side  entrance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  French window? Nobody comes or goes that way in this weather; the path isn&rsquo;t  even shoveled. That&rsquo;s used mostly in summer time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo;  Cray opened the window door, &ldquo;somebody has been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Morton  looked out and stared hard. How had he come to neglect a matter of such  importance. There were two plainly visible lines of footprints in the snow, one  quite obviously coming toward the house and one going away from it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  your murderer,&rdquo; said Cray, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; but Morton wriggled uneasily. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be. No murderer is going to  walk through crusted snow, to and from the scene of his crime, leaving definite  footprints like those!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  no argument. He might have come here with no intent of crime, and afterward,  might have been so beside himself he couldn&rsquo;t plan safely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, get what you can from them,&rdquo; said Morton, pettishly. &ldquo;I suppose you  deduce a tall man, with blue eyes and two teeth missing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be cheap, Morton. And, on the contrary, I deduce a small man. They are small  footprints, and close together. The Japanese are small men, Morton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  these prints are more than twenty-four hours old, and they&rsquo;re not clear enough  to incriminate anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  haven&rsquo;t changed an iota from the moment they were made. This cold snap has kept  everything frozen solid. Look at the frost still on the panes, the icicles  still on the window sashes, the ice coating still on all the trees and  branches. In fact it has grown steadily colder since night before last, and  until it begins to thaw we have these footprints as intact evidence. I will  have them photographed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are small,&rdquo; Morton agreed after further examination. &ldquo;And as you say, too close  together for an ordinary sized man. It looks like the Jap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beginning  to wake up, are you? You&rsquo;ve sure been asleep at the switch, Morton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort, Mr. Cray. But I ought to have help. I&rsquo;ve had all I could tackle,  making the necessary first inquiries, and getting the facts straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  business could have waited better than these other things. Now, there&rsquo;s  Crimmins, the lawyer arriving. Let&rsquo;s interview him. But not in the study. Keep  that clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  met Crimmins in the hall, and took him to the living room.</p>
  <p>The  matter of the will was immediately taken up, and Mrs. Bates was asked to tell  which desk drawer it was in.</p>
  <p>Accompanied  by the lawyer and the secretary, Mrs. Bates indicated the drawer, and Lockwood  opened it with his key.</p>
  <p>There  were a few papers in it but no will.</p>
  <p>Nor  could further search disclose any such document.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  took it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Bates, blankly.</p>
  <p>But  no one could answer her. The others came thronging in, Cray&rsquo;s urgent requests  to keep out of the study being entirely ignored.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew it,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Peyton, triumphantly. &ldquo;Now, I guess you won&rsquo;t be so  cocky, Emily Bates&mdash;you or your &lsquo;authority!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Bates looked at her. &ldquo;I am the heir,&rdquo; she said haughtily. &ldquo;I assert that&mdash;but I  cannot prove it until the will is found. It isn&rsquo;t in your possession, Mr.  Crimmins?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Doctor Waring preferred to keep it himself. I cannot understand its disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lot of paper has been burned in this fireplace,&rdquo; said Helen Peyton who was  poking the ashes around.</p>
  <p>Morton  hastened to look, for it seemed to him as if everybody was stealing his thunder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  that can be identified,&rdquo; he said, carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;  demurred Cray. &ldquo;At any rate, it looks as if some legal papers were destroyed.  This bit of ash is quite evidently the remainder of several sheets folded  together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no definite knowledge could be gained outside the fact that much paper had been  burned there. As no fire had been made since the discovery of the tragedy, it  stood to reason the papers were burned by Doctor Waring himself or by his  midnight intruder, if there were such a one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Cray demanded of the lawyer, &ldquo;if no will can be found, then who inherits the  property of Doctor Waring? And is it considerable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Doctor Waring had quite a fortune,&rdquo; Crimmins told them. &ldquo;As to an heir, he has  a distant cousin&mdash;a second cousin, who, I suppose would be the legal inheritor,  in the absence of any will. But, I know he made a will in Mrs. Bates&rsquo; favor,  and it included a few minor legacies to the members of this household and some  neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly familiar with all the bequests. But  where is the will? It must be found! It can&rsquo;t have been burnt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  no right to assume that those paper ashes are the will, but I confess I fear  it,&rdquo; Crimmins announced, his face drawn with anxiety. &ldquo;I should be deeply  sorry, if it is so, for the cousin I speak of is a ne&rsquo;er do well young man, and  not at all a favorite of his late relative. His name is Maurice Trask and he  lives in St. Louis. I suppose he must be notified in any case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Cray, &ldquo;that must be done. But, please, all go out of this room, for the  finger print experts and the photographers are coming soon, and every moment  you people stay here, you help to cloud or destroy possible clues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Impressed  by his sternness, they filed out and gathered in the living-room.</p>
  <p>There  they found a neighbor, Saltonstall Adams, awaiting them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came over,&rdquo; he said, with scant preliminary greetings, &ldquo;because I have something  to tell. You in charge, Mr. Cray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Salt, what do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This.  I was awake late, night before last&mdash;the night Doc Waring died, and I was  looking out my window, and it was pretty light, with the snow and the moonlight  and all, and I saw a man&mdash;a small man, creeping along sly like. And I watched  him, he went along past my house down toward the railroad tracks. He had a bag  with him, and a bundle beside. I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed him probably, but he  skulked along so and seemed so fearful that somebody&rsquo;d see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nogi?&rdquo;  said Gordon Lockwood, calmly, looking at the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say it was, and don&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t. But I went down to the station and the  station master told me that that Jap of Waring&rsquo;s went off on the milk train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did!&rdquo; cried Morton, &ldquo;what time does that train go through?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout  half past four. The fellow passed my house &lsquo;long about half past twelve, I  should say&mdash;though I didn&rsquo;t look, and he must have waited around the station all  that time till the milk train came along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the station master sure it was Nogi?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Peyton, greatly excited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Said  he was, and there&rsquo;s mighty few Japs in Corinth, all told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it was Nogi,&rdquo; said Lockwood, and Morton snapped him up with, &ldquo;Why are  you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  treated the detective to one of his most disconcerting stares, and said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  a detective, and ask such a simple question! Why, since there are but a very  few Japanese in this town, and since one of them left on that milk train, and  since all the rest are accounted for, and only Nogi is missing&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t seem  to me to require superhuman intelligence to infer that it was Nogi who took his  departure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who was mixed up in the murder of Doctor John Waring?&rdquo; cried Morton, exasperated  beyond all caution by the ironic tone of Lockwood. &ldquo;And, unless you can explain  some matters, sir, you may be considered mixed in the same despicable deed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  matters?&rdquo; Gordon Lockwood asked, but his already pale face turned a shade  whiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  sir, you have a large number of unpaid bills in your possession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  secretary&rsquo;s face was no longer white. The angry blood flew to it, and he fairly  clenched his hands in an effort to preserve his usual calm, nor even then,  could he entirely succeed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  if I have?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and how do you know? You&rsquo;ve searched my rooms!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Morton, &ldquo;I warned you I should do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  in my absence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  law is not always over ceremonious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mr. Lockwood,&rdquo; Cray began, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get excited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood almost laughed. For him to be told not to get excited! He, who never  allowed himself to be even slightly ruffled or perturbed! This would never do!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not excited, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; he said, and he wasn&rsquo;t, now, &ldquo;but I am annoyed that my  private papers should be searched without my knowledge. Surely I might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the amenities of life, Mr. Lockwood,&rdquo; Cray went on; &ldquo;your effects were  searched on the authority of a police warrant. Now, regarding these bills&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say. A man has a right to his unpaid bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he has not a right to steal five hundred dollars in cash and a ruby pin, in  order to be able to pay them!&rdquo; This from Morton, and instead of replying to the  detective in any way, Lockwood ignored the speech utterly, quite as if he had  not heard it, and addressed Cray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  anything further found to incriminate me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there anything else to be found?&rdquo; said Cray, catching at the implied suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  for your sleuths to say. I know of nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there&rsquo;s your round, sharp penholder. And the fact that you had keys to all desk  drawers. Also the fact that only you and the Jap are known to have been in that  part of the house that night. These things were not learned from the search of  your rooms; but your pecuniary embarrassment, which was discovered, all go  together to make a web of circumstances that call for investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  beat about the bush!&rdquo; exclaimed Lockwood, his lips set, and his eyes staring  coldly at the District Attorney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d far rather be accused definitely than  have it hinted that I am responsible for this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we haven&rsquo;t sufficient evidence, Mr. Lockwood, to accuse you definitely, that&rsquo;s  why we must question you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sufficient!  You haven&rsquo;t any evidence at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we have some.&rdquo; With a turn of his head, Cray summoned a man who stood at the  hall door.</p>
  <p>The  man came in, and handed Cray a report.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  the attorney scanned the paper. &ldquo;We find, Mr. Lockwood, fresh finger prints on  the chair which stood near Doctor Waring&rsquo;s desk. Facing the Doctor&rsquo;s chair, in  fact, as if some one had sat there talking to him. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I never sat down and talked to him. I was always waiting on him in the matter  of bringing books or taking letters for transcription, and in any case, I  either stood, or sat at my desk, never in that chair you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  man will take the finger prints of all present,&rdquo; the Attorney directed, and one  and all submitted to the process.</p>
  <p>Old  Salt Adams was greatly interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t get the prints of Friend Jap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;d be of more  importance than all of us put together. Me, now, I can&rsquo;t see where I come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet,  after time enough had passed to complete the processes, it was learned that the  finger prints on the shiny black wood of the chair under discussion were  indubitably those of Gordon Lockwood. Also, there were other prints there,  slightly smaller, that Cray immediately assumed to be those of the missing  Japanese.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked more supercilious than usual, if that were possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you identify the prints of a man not here?&rdquo; he asked with an incredulous  look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Supposition  not identification,&rdquo; said Cray, gravely. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re narrowing these things  down, and we may yet get identification.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  the Jap back,&rdquo; advised Old Salt Adams. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your next move, Cray. Get him,  check up his finger prints and all that, and best of all get his confession.  There&rsquo;s your work cut out for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  Doctor Waring&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; Mrs. Bates lamented. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your work cut out for you.  I am not unduly mercenary, but when I know how anxious Doctor Waring was that I  should inherit his estate, when I realize what it meant that he drew this will  before our marriage, so urgent was his desire that all should be mine, you must  understand that I do not willingly forego it all in favor of a distant  relative, whom, Mr. Crimmins tells us, Doctor Waring did not care for at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say not!&rdquo; and Crimmins looked positive. &ldquo;It will be an outrage if Mr.  Trask inherits the estate already willed to Mrs. Bates. I stand ready to do all  I can to see justice done in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  justice, as you see it, can only result from finding the will,&rdquo; said Cray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed Crimmins, &ldquo;and the whole matter opens up a new train of thought. May not  the distant cousin, this man Trask be in some way responsible for the  destruction of the will and the death of the decedent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a new way to look,&rdquo; Cray agreed, with a thoughtful air; &ldquo;and we will look  that way, you rest assured. We will at once get in touch with this cousin, you  will give us his address, and learn where he was and how employed on the night  of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death. We still have to face the problem of an outsider&rsquo;s  exit from a locked room, and though it seems more explicable in the case of a  member of the household, yet a new suspect brings fresh conditions, and perhaps  fresh evidence, which may show us where to look. At any rate, we must speedily  find Mr. Maurice Trask.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    A Love Letter</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Esther,&rdquo; said old Salt to his wife, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a mighty curious case over at  Waring&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you do talk! I should think that to you and me, knowing and loving John Waring  as we did, you&rsquo;d have no doings with the curious part of it! As for me, I don&rsquo;t  care who killed him. He&rsquo;s dead, isn&rsquo;t he? It can&rsquo;t bring him back to life to  hang his murderer. And to my mind it&rsquo;s heathenish&mdash;all this detectiving and  evidencing&mdash;or whatever they call it. Whom do they suspect now? You?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Adams  looked at his wife with a mild reproach. &ldquo;Woman all over! No sense of justice,  no righteous indignation. Don&rsquo;t you know the murderer must be found and  punished? That is if it was a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it was! That blessed man never killed himself! And he about to marry  Emily Bates&mdash;a lady, if ever there was one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  now you listen to me, Esther, and whatever you do, don&rsquo;t go babbling about  this. They say the Jap, who vamoosed from the Waring house, made a line of foot  tracks in the snow. The snow&rsquo;s crusted over, you know, and those footprints are  about as clear now as when they were made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh!  footprints! Corinth is full of footprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but these&mdash;listen, Esther&mdash;these lead straight from the Waring house, over to  this house. And back again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can they?&rdquo; Mrs. Adams looked mystified. &ldquo;That Japanese didn&rsquo;t come over here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t say that he didn&rsquo;t. And, look here, Esther, where&rsquo;s Miss Austin? What&rsquo;s  she doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin? She&rsquo;s in her room. She hasn&rsquo;t been quite up to the mark for a day or  two, and she&rsquo;s had her meals upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  slight cold, she says. I can&rsquo;t make her out, Salt. What&rsquo;s she doing here,  anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  pester her, my dear. How you and Bascom do love to pick at that girl! Why does  she have to do anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  queer, though. And I hate a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she is one&mdash;I grant you that. Have you told her about Doctor Waring? Though I  daresay it wouldn&rsquo;t interest her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I daresay it would! Why, that girl cut his picture out of the paper, and she  did have one stuck up on her dresser, till I looked at it sort of sharp like,  and she put it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  child! Can&rsquo;t even have a newspaper cutting, if she wants it! You&rsquo;re a tyrant,  Esther! Don&rsquo;t you ever try to boss me like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  good-natured smile that passed between them, proved the unlikelihood of this,  and Old Salt went on. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell her, wife, about the tragedy. Seems  like she ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams stared at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her, as a matter of course, but I don&rsquo;t know  why you&rsquo;re so anxious about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, Miss Austin,&rdquo; the good lady said, soon after, &ldquo;better this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  thank you. My cold is almost entirely well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl was sitting by the window, in an easy chair. She had on a Japanese  dressing gown of quilted silk, embroidered with chrysanthemums, and was  listlessly gazing out across the snow covered field opposite.</p>
  <p>The  Adams house was on the outskirts of the little town, and separated by a wide  field from the Waring place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard  the news about Doctor Waring?&rdquo; Mrs. Adams said, in a casual tone, but watching  the girl closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words were simple, and the voice steady, but Miss Austin&rsquo;s hands clutched the  arms of the chair, and her face turned perfectly white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what ails you? You don&rsquo;t know the man, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  heard him lecture, you know. Tell me&mdash;what is the&mdash;the news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  dead.&rdquo; Mrs. Adams spoke bluntly on purpose. She had felt in a vague way, that  this strange person, this Miss Mystery, had more interest in Doctor Waring than  she admitted, and the landlady was determined to find out.</p>
  <p>To  her own satisfaction she did find out, for the girl almost fainted. She didn&rsquo;t  quite lose consciousness, indeed it was not so much a faint as such a desperate  effort to regain her poise, that it unnerved her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  now, Miss Austin, why do you take it so hard? He was a stranger to you, wasn&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,  of course he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you so disturbed then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was such a&mdash;such a fine man&mdash;&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s stifled sobs impeded her speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  somebody killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that, Miss Austin seemed turned to stone. &ldquo;Killed him!&rdquo; she whispered, in  accent of terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;or  else he killed himself&mdash;they don&rsquo;t feel sure.&rdquo; Mrs. Adams, once embarked on the  narrative, told all she knew of the circumstances, and in the exciting recital,  almost forgot to watch the effect of the tale on her listener.</p>
  <p>But  this effect was not entirely unnoted. At the partly open door, Old Salt Adams,  stood, eavesdropping, but with a kindly, anxious look on his face, that boded  no ill to any one.</p>
  <p>And  he noticed that the girl&rsquo;s attention was wandering. She was pitifully white,  her face drawn and scared, and soon she exclaimed, with a burst of nervous  fury, &ldquo;Stop! please stop! Leave the room, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not a command but an agonized entreaty. Mrs. Adams fairly jumped, and  alarmed as well as offended, she rose and started for the door, only to meet  her husband entering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  downstairs, Esther,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;I want to speak to Miss Austin myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Staring  at one then at the other, and utterly routed by this unbelievable turn of  affairs, Mrs. Adams went.</p>
  <p>Old  Salt closed the room door, and turned to the trembling girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;I like you, I want to help you&mdash;but I must ask you to  explain yourself a little. The people in my house call you Miss Mystery. Why  are you here? Why are you in Corinth at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment the girl seemed about to respond to his kindly, gentle attitude and  address. Then, something stayed her, and she let her lovely face harden to a  stony blankness, as she replied, &ldquo;It is a bit intrusive, but I&rsquo;ve no reason not  to tell. I am an art student, and I came here to paint New England winter  scenery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you done much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t been here quite a week yet&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been picking out available bits&mdash;and  for two days I&rsquo;ve had a cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you get cold?&rdquo; The voice was kind but it had a definite note, as if  desirous of an accurate answer.</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery looked at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does any one get cold?&rdquo; she said, trying to smile; &ldquo;perhaps sitting in a  draught&mdash;perhaps by means of a germ. It is almost well now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  by walking in the snow, and getting one&rsquo;s feet wet,&rdquo; Mr. Adams suggested, and  the girl turned frightened eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  she breathed; &ldquo;Mr. Adams, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her voice was piteous her eyes implored him  to stop torturing her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what&rsquo;s the harm in my saying that?&rdquo; he went on, inexorably. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t go  anywhere that you wouldn&rsquo;t want known&mdash;would you&mdash;Miss Mystery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke the last two words in a meaning way, and the great dark eyes faced him  with the look of a stag at bay.</p>
  <p>Then  again, by a desperate effort the girl recovered herself, and said, coldly,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  speak plainly, Mr. Adams. Is there a special meaning in your words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is, Miss Austin. Perhaps I have no right to ask you why&mdash;but I do ask you if you  went over to Doctor Waring&rsquo;s house, late in the evening&mdash;night before last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sunday  night, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery controlled her voice, but her hands were clenched and her foot tapped  the floor in her stifled excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  of course I did not go over there at night. I was there in the afternoon, with  Mrs. Bates and Mr. Payne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that. And you then met Doctor Waring for the first time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the first time,&rdquo; she spoke with downcast face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first time in your life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first time in my life,&rdquo; but if ever a statement carried its own denial that one  seemed to. The long dark lashes fell on the white cheeks. The pale lips  quivered, and if Anita Austin had been uttering deepest perjury she could have  shown no more convincing evidence of falsehood.</p>
  <p>Yet  old Salt looked at her benevolently. She was so young, so small, so alone&mdash;and  so mysterious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t make you out,&rdquo; he shook his head. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m for you, Miss Austin. That is,&rdquo;  he hedged, &ldquo;unless I find out something definite against you. I feel I ought to  tell you, that you&rsquo;ve enemies&mdash;yes,&rdquo; as the girl looked up surprised, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve  made enemies in this house. Small wonder&mdash;the way you&rsquo;ve acted! Now, why can&rsquo;t  you be chummy and sociable like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chummy?  Sociable? With whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  all the boarders. There&rsquo;s young Lockwood now&mdash;and there&rsquo;s young Tyler&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I know. I will&mdash;Mr. Adams&mdash;I will try to be more sociable. Now&mdash;as to&mdash;to  Doctor Waring&mdash;why did he kill himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old  Salt eyed her narrowly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that he did,&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mrs. Adams told me all the details&rdquo;&mdash;she shuddered, &ldquo;and if that room he was in  was so securely locked that they had to break in, how could it be the work  of&mdash;of another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Austin, as they found a bad wound in the man&rsquo;s neck, just under his right  ear, a wound that produced instant unconsciousness and almost instant death,  and as no weapon of any sort could be found in the room, how could it have been  suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  would you rather think it?&rdquo; the strange girl asked, looking gravely at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to me&mdash;I&rsquo;m an old-fashioned chap&mdash;suicide always suggests cowardice, and Doc  Waring was no coward, that I&rsquo;ll swear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he was not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery started at the sudden question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard him lecture, you know,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;and, too, I saw him in his  home&mdash;Sunday afternoon&mdash;and he seemed a fine man&mdash;a fine man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Austin,&rdquo; Old Salt rose to go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to confess you&rsquo;re a mystery to me.  I consider myself a fair judge of men&mdash;yes, and of women, but when a slip of a  girl like you acts so strange, I can&rsquo;t make it out. Now, I happen to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused at the panic-stricken look on her face, and lamely concluded;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind&mdash;I won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  which cryptic remark he went away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what you been saying to her?&rdquo; demanded his aggrieved spouse, as the Adamses met  in their own little sitting-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  nothing,&rdquo; Old Salt replied, and his troubled eyes looked at her pleadingly. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s wrong, Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I do. And maybe a whole lot wrong. Why, Saltonstall, Miss Bascom says she <i>saw</i> Miss Austin traipsing across the  field late Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it! She&rsquo;s a meddling old maid&mdash;a snooping  busybody!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  now, you carry on like that because you&rsquo;re afraid we will discover something  wrong about Miss Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Esther,&rdquo; Adams spoke sternly; &ldquo;you remember she&rsquo;s a young girl, without  anybody to stand up for her, hereabouts. Now, you know what a bobbery a few  words can kick up. And we don&rsquo;t want that poor child&rsquo;s name touched by a breath  of idle gossip that isn&rsquo;t true. I don&rsquo;t believe Liza Bascom saw her out on  Sunday night! I don&rsquo;t even believe she thought she did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I believe it. Liza Bascom&rsquo;s no fool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  worse, she&rsquo;s a knave! And she hates little Austin, and she&rsquo;d say anything, true  or false, to harm the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Salt, she says she saw Miss Austin, all in her fur coat and cap going cross  lots to the Waring house Sunday evening&mdash;late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  she prove it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about that. But she saw her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does she know it was Miss Austin? It might have been somebody who looked like  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know those footprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Jap&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re the Jap&rsquo;s. Miss Bascom says they&rsquo;re the Austin girl&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Esther!&rdquo;  Old Saltonstall Adams rose in his wrath, &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of yourself  to let that girl&rsquo;s name get into the Waring matter at all. Even if she did go  out Sunday night, if Miss Bascom did see her, you keep still about it. If that  girl&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;ll be discovered without our help. If she isn&rsquo;t, we must not  be the ones to bring her into notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;be implicated&mdash;could she, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  he thundered. &ldquo;Esther, you astound me. That Bascom woman has turned your brain.  She&rsquo;s a viper, that&rsquo;s what <i>she</i> is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stormed out of the room, and getting into his great coat, tramped down to the  village.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood was in his room. This was much to the annoyance of Callie, the  impatient chambermaid, who wanted to get her work done.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  was himself impatient to get over to the Waring house, for he had much to do  with the mass of incoming mail and the necessary interviews with reporters and  other callers.</p>
  <p>Yet  he tarried, in his pleasant bedroom at Mrs. Adams&rsquo;, his door securely locked,  and his own attitude one of stupefaction.</p>
  <p>For  the hundredth time he reread the crumpled paper that he had taken from the  study waste-basket under the very nose of Detective Morton.</p>
  <p>Had  that sleuth been a little more worthy of his profession he never would have  allowed the bare-faced theft.</p>
  <p>And  now that Lockwood had it he scarce knew what to do with it.</p>
  <p>And  truly it was an astonishing missive.</p>
  <p>For  it read thus:</p>
  <p>My  darling Anita:</p>
  <p>At  the first glance of your brown eyes this afternoon, love was born in my heart.  Life is worth living&mdash;with you in the world! And yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>That  was all. The unfinished letter had been crumpled into a ball and thrown in the  basket. Had another been started&mdash;and completed? Had Anita Austin received  it&mdash;and was that why she kept to her room for two days? Was she a&mdash;he hated the  word! a vamp? Had she secretly become acquainted with John Waring during her  presence in Corinth, and had so charmed him that he wrote to her thus? Or, had  they known each other before? What a mystery!</p>
  <p>There  was not the slightest doubt of the writing. Lockwood knew it as well as he knew  his own. And on top of all the other scraps in the waste-basket it must have  been the last missive the dead man wrote&mdash;or, rather the last he threw away.</p>
  <p>This  meant he had been writing it on the Sunday evening. Then, Lockwood reasoned,  knowing the routine, if he had written another, which he completed and  addressed, it would, in natural course, have been put with the letters for the  mail, and would have been posted by Ito that next morning.</p>
  <p>What  an oversight, never to have asked Ito about that matter.</p>
  <p>It  was an inviolable custom for the butler to take all letters laid on a certain  small table, and put them in the pillar box, early in the morning.</p>
  <p>Had  Ito done this? It must be inquired into.</p>
  <p>But  far more absorbing was the actual letter before him. How could it be possible  that John Waring, the dignified scholar, the confirmed bachelor, should have  loved this mystery girl?</p>
  <p>Yet,  even as he formulated the question, Gordon Lockwood knew the answer. He knew  that from his own point of view it would not be impossible or even difficult  for any man with two eyes in his head to love that fascinating, enchanting  personality.</p>
  <p>And  as he pondered, he knew that he loved her himself. Yes, had loved her almost  from the moment he first saw her. Certainly from the time he sat behind her at  the lecture, and counted the queer little ball fringes in the back of her  dainty gown.</p>
  <p>Those  fringes! Lockwood gave a groan as a sudden thought came to him.</p>
  <p>He  jumped up, and with a determined air, set about burning the inexplicable letter  that John Waring had written and thrown away.</p>
  <p>In  the empty fireplace of the old-fashioned room, Lockwood touched a match to the  sheet and burned it to an ash.</p>
  <p>Then  he went over to the Waring house.</p>
  <p>It  was an hour or so later that Callie reported to Miss Bascom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer  goin&rsquo;s on,&rdquo; the girl said, rolling her eyes at her eager listener, &ldquo;Mr.  Lockwood, now, he burnt some papers, and Miss Austin, too, she burnt some  papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  queer about that?&rdquo; snapped Miss Bascom, who had hoped for something more  sensational.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s sorta strange they&rsquo;re both burnin&rsquo; paper at the same time. And both so sly  about it. Mr. Lockwood he kep&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; back at the fireplace as he went outa  the door, and Miss Austin, she jumped like she was shot, when I come in  suddenly an&rsquo; found her stoopin&rsquo; over the fireplace. An&rsquo; too, Miss Bascom,  whatever else she burnt, she burnt that picture she had of Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she have his picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep,  one Mr. Lockwood guv her, after Nora carried off the one she cut out of a  paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  in the world did that girl want of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dunno, ma&rsquo;am. What they call hero-worship, I guess. Just like I&rsquo;ve got some  several pictures of Harold Massinger, that man who plays Caveman in the Movies!  My, but he&rsquo;s handsome!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so Miss Austin burned a photograph of John Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am. And you know they&rsquo;re kinda hard to burn. Anyways, she was a kneelin&rsquo; by  the fireplace an&rsquo; the picture was smokin&rsquo; like everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lemme  help you miss,&rsquo; I says, as polite as could be&mdash;&rdquo;and watcha think, she snatched  back, and says, &lsquo;You lemme lone. Get outahere!&rsquo; or somethin&rsquo; like that. Oh, she  was mad all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has a high temper, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,  there&rsquo;s no denyin&rsquo; she has. Then again, she&rsquo;s sweet as pie, and nice an&rsquo;  gentle. She&rsquo;s a queer makeup, I will say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  Callie, that will do; don&rsquo;t gossip,&rdquo; and Miss Bascom, sure she had learned all  the maid had to tell, went downstairs to tell it to Mrs. Adams.</p>
  <p>The  landlady seemed less receptive than usual, being still mindful of her husband&rsquo;s  admonitions. But Miss Bascom&rsquo;s story of the burnt photograph roused her  curiosity to highest pitch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  something queer about that girl,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams opined, and the other more than  agreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  go up and talk to her,&rdquo; Miss Bascom suggested, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,  Mrs. Adams went.</p>
  <p>The  landlady tapped lightly at the door, but there was no response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  right in,&rdquo; the other whispered, and go in they did.</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery lay on the couch, her eyes closed, her cheeks still wet with tears. She  did not move, and after a moment&rsquo;s glance to assure herself the girl was sound  asleep, Miss Bascom audaciously opened one of the small top drawers of the  dresser.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams gasped, and frantically made motions of remonstrance, but swiftly  fingering among the veils and handkerchiefs, Miss Bascom drew out a large roll  of bills, held by an elastic band.</p>
  <p>Anita  Austin&rsquo;s eyes flew open, and after one staring glance at the intrusive woman,  she jumped from the couch and flew at her like a small but very active tiger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you!&rdquo; she cried, snatching the money from Miss Bascom&rsquo;s hand, even as that  elated person was unrolling it.</p>
  <p>And  from inside the roll, down on the painted floor, fell a ruby stickpin.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    Who Is Miss Mystery?</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams fell limply into a chair, her round eyes staring in horror.</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom had taken upon herself the r&ocirc;le of dictator and with an accusing finger  pointed at Miss Mystery she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  replied Anita Austin, coolly, &ldquo;except to insist that you leave my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  your room, indeed! I am only too glad to! And I know where to go, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom&rsquo;s determined air as she strode out of the door gave a hint of her  desperate intention and within five minutes she was out on the road toward the  village.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams, still almost speechless with surprise and dismay, looked sorrowfully at  Anita. Something in the girl&rsquo;s face stayed the kindly words the woman meant to  say, and, instead, she broke out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must leave this house! What are you anyway? A thief&mdash;and a murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Anita put up her hand as if to ward off a physical blow.</p>
  <p>Then,  as if the cruel words had stung her to a quickened sense of her own danger, she  cried, piteously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mrs. Adams, help me&mdash;protect me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you? I don&rsquo;t know what to do&mdash;I&rsquo;m all  alone&mdash;so alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sank into a chair and buried her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>Esther  Adams was uncertain what course to pursue. Should she protect this guilty girl,  of whom she really knew nothing, or should she dismiss her at once from her  house, in the interests of her other boarders, who must be considered?</p>
  <p>Surely,  her first duty was to the others&mdash;the people she had known so long, and who  looked upon her house as a home and a safeguard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must go,&rdquo; she said, though her voice wavered as she saw the pathetic face Anita  raised to look at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! Don&rsquo;t send me away! Where could I go? Even the Inn people wouldn&rsquo;t take me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they wouldn&rsquo;t! Go home! Haven&rsquo;t you a home? Who are you, anyway? But I  don&rsquo;t care who you are&mdash;you must get out of this house today&mdash;this morning. Do  you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime  Miss Bascom, on her virtuous errand had trotted quickly to the office of the  Prosecuting District Attorney.</p>
  <p>There,  however, she was told that Mr. Cray was over at the Waring house, and she  concluded to go there. Nor did this displease her. She longed to be in the  limelight, and the tale she had to tell would surely give her the right to be  there.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton received her coldly, for the two were not friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came to see Mr. Cray,&rdquo; Miss Bascom announced, &ldquo;on important business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; the housekeeper returned, &ldquo;take a seat and I&rsquo;ll ask him to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom waited in the living-room, secure in her knowledge of the importance of  her news.</p>
  <p>The  attorney welcomed her cordially for he saw at once that she brought news of  value.</p>
  <p>And,  expressed in emphatic language, and interspersed with many and unfavorable  personal opinions, Liza Bascom told of the incident of finding the money and  the ruby in Miss Austin&rsquo;s bureau drawer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Astonishing!&rdquo;  commented Cray. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows, that&rsquo;s the queer part. We call her Miss Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did she come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows. She just appeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  the Adamses know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  young girl, you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  appears to be very young&mdash;but you never can tell with those sly things. I  daresay she makes herself look several years younger than she really is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she know Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I know? She came over to this house late Sunday night&mdash;for I saw her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens! Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it was fairly light, with the moon, and the snow all over the ground, you know,  and I saw her, all wrapped up in her fur coat, sneaking away from the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  late?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;after  everybody had gone upstairs and the lights were all out at the Adamses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw her come back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I didn&rsquo;t think much about it at the time&mdash;she&rsquo;s a crazy piece anyway&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by a crazy piece?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  she&rsquo;s queer&mdash;not like other folks. She won&rsquo;t have anything to do with any of us  over there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t make her out crazy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom shrugged impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean insane or demented. I only mean sly  and secretive. She never speaks to anybody at the table&mdash;and though she makes  eyes at Gordon Lockwood, she snubs Mr. Tyler, who is just as good a young man.  They both admire her&mdash;anybody can see that, but she treats them like the dust  under her feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  an adventuress, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. But I do know she&rsquo;s a thief&mdash;or how did she get that money and the  ruby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Doctor Waring gave them to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she is a wrong one! Why should he give a strange girl such things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he was in love with her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Mr. Cray, do try to show ordinary common sense! Doctor Waring was about  to marry Mrs. Bates, a sweet, dear woman, of suitable age. Is he going to have  a little flibbertigibbet coming to see him late at night, for any romantic  reasons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  hesitated to speak his mind, but he ruminated that he had heard of such things,  in the course of his life. Miss Bascom, he thought was an unsophisticated old  maid, but there was certainly a new condition to be investigated, and the case  of Miss Anita Austin must be carefully considered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Miss Bascom,&rdquo; he said, diplomatically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to keep this whole  matter quiet for a time. You must see that we can&rsquo;t work successfully if we  take the whole town into our confidence. Or even this entire household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you try to bamboozle me, Stephen Cray! I know your sort. You want to keep this  matter quiet because you want to get that girl off scotfree! I know you men!  Just because she has a pair of big, dark eyes and a slim little shape you are  ready to hide her guilt and let her off easy. I won&rsquo;t have it! That girl stole  those things, or else she got them from poor John Waring in a way no decent  woman would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about, Liza Bascom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton appeared in the doorway, and though she asked the question, it was  fairly evident that she knew the answer, and had been listening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening at the door, and I&rsquo;m glad I did. First of  all, I won&rsquo;t have Doctor Waring&rsquo;s name traduced, and next, if there&rsquo;s a girl  implicated in the matter, the whole truth about her has got to come out! I know  the girl, she was here Sunday afternoon, and a more brazen-faced, bold-mannered  chit, I never want to see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was here?&rdquo; asked the bewildered Cray. &ldquo;You know her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all I want to know of her,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton declared. &ldquo;Yes, she was here&mdash;came  over with Emily Bates and Pinky. Wouldn&rsquo;t condescend to be really one of us,  but just acted offish and seemed to me about half-witted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly,&rdquo; put in Miss Bascom. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last thing to say of her! Whatever  that girl may be she&rsquo;s got all her wits about her! I can see that for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Doctor Waring present when Miss Austin was here?&rdquo; asked Cray, thinking hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Mrs. Peyton, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a strange thing. When he first saw  her&mdash;unexpectedly, you know&mdash;he dropped his teacup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the meeting?&rdquo; asked Cray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton said. &ldquo;He declared afterward he had never seen the  girl before&mdash;but&mdash;oh&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe she came back here that night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cray said. &ldquo;How could she get in, unless someone admitted  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the French window in the study,&rdquo; Mrs. Peyton suggested, uncertainly. &ldquo;Doctor  Waring could have let her in that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Miss Bascom declared. &ldquo;Land! I&rsquo;ve known John Waring all my life,  and he&rsquo;s not the kind of man that had anything to do with flirtatious young  women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of  a truth, Liza Bascom had known Waring for many years and had spent a number of  them in desperate efforts to persuade him to renounce bachelorhood in her  favor.</p>
  <p>Yet  her words carried little weight with Attorney Cray, who fancied that he knew  men better than the insistent spinster possibly could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Bascom,&rdquo; he said, after further thought, &ldquo;and Mrs. Peyton, too, I&rsquo;m going to  ask you&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to instruct you to keep this matter quiet until after the  funeral of Doctor Waring. That occurs tomorrow, and I want a day or so to look  into this thing quietly. We would gain nothing by rushing matters. I will see  Miss Austin, of course, and rest assured, if she is guilty of any wrong doing,  she shall not escape. But it is a serious matter to accuse a suspect without  giving any chance for explanation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no explanation of that ruby pin and all that money, that is not incriminating  to that girl!&rdquo; Miss Bascom exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,  I am in authority, and I forbid you to discuss the connection of Miss Austin  with the case at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  knew how to impress belligerent women, and he even added a hint of their making  trouble for themselves unless they obeyed his explicit command.</p>
  <p>He  returned to the study, where Gordon Lockwood was going over the morning&rsquo;s mail.</p>
  <p>The  secretary was a busy man, for his late employer had had a number of diversified  interests and every mail brought letters, catalogues, circulars and newspapers  that required careful attention. John Waring had been a collector of rare  books, and other curios, and was interested in several literary enterprises.</p>
  <p>To  many of these correspondents Lockwood could merely send a statement of the  Doctor&rsquo;s death. But others involved careful and wise judgment, and Lockwood  conscientiously discharged his duties.</p>
  <p>The  study had been put in order, and all traces of the tragedy had been removed.  The books that had been on the desk, including the blood-stained copy of  Martial, Lockwood had, after consideration, restored to their places on the  shelves.</p>
  <p>Although  it gave him a thrill of horror, Lockwood had nerved himself to appropriate  Waring&rsquo;s desk, for it meant far greater convenience in his work.</p>
  <p>He  sat there as Cray entered, and raised his impassive face to note the attorney&rsquo;s  excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove, Lockwood,&rdquo; Cray, exclaimed, as he closed the door behind him, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a  new way to look, which seems to promise to straighten out a lot of things. Do  you know that little piece over at your boarding house, named Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know her slightly. What about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  Lockwood&rsquo;s voice no one would suspect that his heart was pounding desperately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she was here late Sunday night! What do you know about that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; returned Lockwood, coldly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe  it. For if she had been here I should have known about it. I was here myself,  just outside the study door, until eleven. You don&rsquo;t mean later than that, do  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno.  The Bascom spinster tells the story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t bank on it. With all due deference to Miss Bascom, I know she is not  always a reliable source of information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she says she saw the girl coming over here late that night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s not true! What under the heavens would she have come for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does any girl visit a man for?&rdquo; Cray gave an unpleasant wink, and Lockwood with  difficulty controlled an insane desire to spring at his throat. &ldquo;And, beside,  she is even now in possession of the missing five hundred dollars and the ruby  pin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here, Mr. Lockwood, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to anybody whether you believe these  things or not. Miss Austin has the valuables, and I&rsquo;m going over there now to  inquire how she got them. Also, it just occurs to me that those small  footprints leading across the field, are directed toward the Adams house, and  may have been made by a woman as likely as by our hypothetical small-footed  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  are Nogi&rsquo;s footprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Common  sense. Even if Miss Austin did come over here for any reason she would have  come by the street, not across the snowy field.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently  she chose the field. So I&rsquo;m going to ask her why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Cray, but you must admit you&rsquo;re illogical, inconsequent and inconsistent.  You think I killed Doctor Waring, because I have a sharp, round penholder, and  owe some large bills. Then, because a gossiping old maid comes over here and  babbles, you fly off at a tangent and accuse an unprotected girl of absurd and  unbelievable crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho!  Interested in the siren yourself, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;m not&mdash;if you mean Miss Austin. That is, not personally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Few  men could have told this lie with such a convincing manner but Lockwood&rsquo;s  phlegmatic calm stood him now in good stead, and his air of obvious  indifference carried conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  he went on, &ldquo;I am sorry for her. It&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business who or what she is, yet  those women over at the Adams house are one and all possessed to find out  something against her. I only want to advise you, Cray, if you talk to anybody  over there, get Old Salt himself. He&rsquo;s more fair minded than his wife or the  other women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men  are apt to be&mdash;where a pretty girl is concerned,&rdquo; said Cray, drily, and Lockwood  ground his teeth in rage, as the Attorney went away.</p>
  <p>His  demand to see Miss Austin was listened to by Old Salt Adams, who had seen him coming  and opened the door for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Cray,&rdquo; said the old man, as he ushered him into the sitting room and shut the  door. &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re after&mdash;and I just want to say, go slow. That&rsquo;s all&mdash;go  slow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Salt. Will you send Miss Austin down here&mdash;also, I must interview her  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I  understand. But don&rsquo;t be led away now, by circumstantial evidence. You know  yourself, it isn&rsquo;t always dependable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  along, Salt, don&rsquo;t try to teach me my business. Have you talked to the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word. My wife has, but she didn&rsquo;t learn much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Adams  went away, and in a few moments Anita Austin came into the room.</p>
  <p>A  first glance showed Cray&rsquo;s experienced eye that the girl was what he called a  siren.</p>
  <p>Her  oval, olive face was sad and sweet. The pale cheeks were not touched up with  artificial color, and the scarlet lips were, even to his close scrutiny, also  devoid of applied art. She wore a smart little gown of black taffeta, with  crisp, chic frills of finely plaited white organdie.</p>
  <p>Whether  this was meant as mourning wear or not, Cray could not determine.</p>
  <p>The  frock was fashionably short, showing thin silk stockings and black suede ties.</p>
  <p>But  Miss Mystery seemed wholly unconscious of her clothes, and her great dark eyes  were full of wondering inquiry as she looked at the attorney, and then a little  diffidently offered a greeting hand.</p>
  <p>The  little brown paw touched Cray&rsquo;s with a pathetic, hopeful clasp, and he looked  up quickly to find himself looking into a pair of hopeful eyes, that, without a  word, expressed confidence and trust.</p>
  <p>He  shrugged his shoulders a trifle and secretly admonished himself to keep a tight  rein on his sympathy.</p>
  <p>Then  relinquishing the lingering hand, he sat down opposite the chair she had chosen  to occupy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; he began, and paused, for the first time in his life uncertain what  tack to take.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, as the pause grew longer, and her soft, cultured voice helped him not  at all.</p>
  <p>How  could he say to this lovely small person that he suspected her of wrong doing?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; she directed him, meantime looking at him with eyes full of a  haunting fear, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  had a sudden, insane feeling that he would give all he was worth for the  pleasure of removing that look of fear, then commanding himself to behave, he  said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, Miss Austin, but I must ask you some unpleasant questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;m here for,&rdquo; she said, with the ghost of a smile on her curved red lips,  and, smoothing down her taffeta lap, she demurely clasped her sensitive little  hands and waited.</p>
  <p>Those  hands bothered Cray. Though they lay quietly, he felt that at his speech they  would flutter in anxiety&mdash;even in fear, and he was loath to disturb them.</p>
  <p>Because  of this hesitancy, he plunged in more abruptly than he meant to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do you come from, Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  York City,&rdquo; she said, a brighter look coming to her face, as if she thought the  ordeal would not be so terrible after all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  address there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  West Sixty-seventh Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told some one else the Hotel Plaza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have lived at both addresses. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;why&rdquo; was disconcerting. After all, Cray thought, he was not a census taker.</p>
  <p>He  gave up getting past history, and said, briefly,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you at Doctor Waring&rsquo;s house Sunday evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  evening,&rdquo; she returned, looking thoughtful. &ldquo;I was there Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  went back again, late in the evening&mdash;to see Doctor Waring, in his study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that?&rdquo; she asked quietly, but a small red spot showed on either  olive cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I must. How well do you&mdash;did you know the Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know  Doctor Waring? Not at all. I never saw him in my life until I came here to  Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost  sure&mdash;oh, why, yes&mdash;that is, I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you went over there Sunday evening, and came back to this house in possession  of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s valuable pin, and a large sum of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, Mr. Cray, I didn&rsquo;t do any such thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  can you explain your possession of those articles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, I suppose the roll of bills that Miss Bascom put into my top bureau drawer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Bascom put in the drawer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that  is, she must have done so, or&mdash;how else could they have been found there? You  know yourself, now, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Cray, that I&rsquo;m not a burglar&mdash;or a bandit or  a sneak thief? You know I never went in to Doctor Waring&rsquo;s study and took those  things! So, as I say, isn&rsquo;t it the only plausible theory, that Miss Bascom, who  found the valuables so readily, first put them there herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    The Spinster&rsquo;s Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;That  matter can easily be settled,&rdquo; Cray said, and going to the door he asked Mrs.  Adams to send Miss Bascom to them.</p>
  <p>With  an important air the spinster entered the room.</p>
  <p>Holding  herself very erect and even drawing aside her skirts as she passed Miss Austin,  she took a seat on the other side of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Miss Bascom,&rdquo; Cray began at once, &ldquo;what made you think of looking in this lady&rsquo;s  bureau drawer for that money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t look for it, Mr. Cray. I merely felt that she had done wrong and I  thought perhaps some evidence would be hidden away in her room. And a top  drawer is the place a woman oftenest hides things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  gave a short laugh. &ldquo;Rather clever of you, I admit. But Miss Austin says she  did not put that money there, herself&mdash;that it was a plant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  plant?&rdquo; Miss Bascom looked puzzled at the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she thinks some in-disposed person put it there to implicate her, falsely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see. Well, Mr. Cray, let her say who did it, and who could have got that  money to do it with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  hard old face took on a look that was almost malignant in its accusation, and  little Anita Austin gave a low cry as she saw it, and hid her face in her  hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  her away,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;oh, take that woman away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hear her,&rdquo; Miss Bascom went on, unrelentingly. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Cray, I&rsquo;m a bit of a  detective myself, and while you&rsquo;ve been down here talking to Miss Mystery, I&rsquo;ve  been searching her room more carefully, and I&rsquo;ve found a few more things, of  which I should like to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  was nonplused. His sympathies were all with the poor little girl, who, clinging  to the arms of her chair, seemed about to go to pieces, nervously, but was  bravely holding on to herself. Yet, if the Bascom woman was telling the truth,  he must beware of the &ldquo;poor little girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure you&rsquo;re within your rights, Miss Bascom,&rdquo; he began, but he was  interrupted with:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rights!  Indeed, the rights of this matter are above your jurisdiction! The blood of  John Waring calls from the ground! I am the instrument of justice that has been  chosen by an over-ruling Providence to discover the criminal. She sits before  you! That girl&mdash;that mysterious wicked girl is both thief and murderess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo; Anita cried, putting up her arm as if to ward off a physical blow.</p>
  <p>Then  she suddenly became quiet&mdash;almost rigid in her composure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a grave accusation, Miss Bascom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must prove it or retract  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  stared at the girl in astonishment. Her agonized cry had been human, feminine,  natural&mdash;but this sudden change to stony calm, to icy hauteur was amazing&mdash;and,  to his mind, incriminating.</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom, however, was in no way daunted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prove  it I will!&rdquo; she said, sternly. &ldquo;In another drawer, Mr. Cray, I found the rolls  of silver coin&mdash;exactly one hundred dollars worth&mdash;that we have been told were in  the desk with the roll of bills. The ruby pin, you know about. And so, these  thefts are proved. Now, as to the murder&mdash;I admit, it seems impossible that a  girl should commit the awful crime&mdash;but I do say that I have found the weapon,  with which it was done, hidden in Miss Austin&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that short, low cry&mdash;more like a hurt animal than a human being. And then, Anita  Austin, the girl of mystery fell back into the depths of her chair, and closed  her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t faint&mdash;or pretend to,&rdquo; admonished Miss Bascom, brutally; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re caught  red-handed, and you know it, and you may as well give up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; came in low moans, but the girl&rsquo;s bravery had deserted her.  Limp and despairing, she turned her great eyes toward Cray for help.</p>
  <p>With  an effort, he looked away from her pleading face, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the weapon? Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a stiletto&mdash;an embroidery stiletto&mdash;and I found it tucked down in the crevice  between the back and seat of a stuffed chair in Miss Austin&rsquo;s room. Did you put  it there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned on the girl and fired the question at her with intentional suddenness,  and though Anita uttered a scared, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; it was a palpable untruth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did,&rdquo; Miss Bascom went on. &ldquo;You can see for yourself, Mr. Cray, she is lying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  even if she is, Miss Bascom, I must ask you to cease torturing her! I can&rsquo;t  stand for such cruelty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray&rsquo;s  manhood revolted at the methods of the older woman who was causing such anguish  to the poor child she accused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not a legal inquisitor, Miss Bascom,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;it is for me to  establish the truth or falsity of your suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you! You&rsquo;re like all the other men! If a girl is pretty and alluring, you would  believe her statement that white is black!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe no statements that cannot be proved to my satisfaction. Miss Austin, do  you own an embroidery stiletto?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the hesitating answer, and the dark eyes swept him a beseeching glance that  made Miss Bascom fairly snort with scorn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  fear I must admit that it is just where Miss Bascom says it is&mdash;unless she has  removed it. Tell me, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; and Miss Mystery suddenly resumed her most  independent air, &ldquo;must I submit to this? I thought accused people were entitled  to a&mdash;oh, you know, counsel&mdash;a lawyer, or somebody to take care of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  Miss Austin. You&rsquo;re not accused yet&mdash;that is, not by legal authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  am I not? Then&mdash;&rdquo; and she gave Miss Bascom a glance of unutterable scorn, &ldquo;I  have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  to say!&rdquo; the spinster almost shrieked. &ldquo;Nothing to say! Of course she hasn&rsquo;t!  She kills a man, takes his valuables, and then declares she has nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  now, Miss Bascom, be careful! Why did you put your stiletto in such a place,  Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dark eyes gave him a gaze of childlike innocence, and Cray couldn&rsquo;t decide  whether he was looking at a deep-dyed criminal or a helpless victim of unjust  suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where did you get the money and the ruby pin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I mean I don&rsquo;t know how they got in my room. This lady says she  found them there&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I know about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  indifferent shrug of the slim shoulders seemed to imply that was all Miss  Mystery cared, either, and Cray asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  if the valuables&mdash;the pin and the money are not yours, you are, of course, ready  to relinquish possession of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I am not! Since I am accused of stealing them, I propose to retain  possession until that accusation is proved or disproved! Perhaps Miss Bascom  wishes to take them herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Mr. Cray spoke very gravely, &ldquo;you are making a mistake in  treating this matter flippantly. You are in danger&mdash;real danger, and you must be  careful what you say. Do you want a lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the girl suddenly looked helpless. &ldquo;Do you think I ought to have  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you funds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I am not a rich girl&mdash;but, neither am I poor. However, I think I shall ask  advice of some one before I decide upon any course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  whom? Perhaps no one can advise you better than I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your advice, Mr. Cray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sweet face looked at him hopefully, the curved red lips quivered a little as  the speaker added, &ldquo;I am very alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Miss Bascom sniffed. Unattractive, herself, she resented with a sort of angry  jealousy the appealing effect this girl had on men. She knew intuitively that  Cray would sympathize with and pity the lonely girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  advice is, Miss Austin, first, that you dispel this mystery that seems to  surround you. Tell frankly who you are, what is your errand in Corinth, how you  came into possession of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s ruby, and why you hid your stiletto, if  it is merely one of your sewing implements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery hesitated a moment, and then said, quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  advice is good, Mr. Cray. But, unfortunately, I cannot follow it. However, I am  willing to state, upon oath, that I did not kill Doctor Waring with that  stiletto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid your oath will be doubted,&rdquo; Miss Bascom intervened sharply. &ldquo;And, too,  Mr. Cray, even if this girl did not strike the fatal blow, she well knows who  did! She is in league with the Japanese, Nogi. That I am sure of!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nogi!&rdquo;  exclaimed Anita.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Nogi,&rdquo; Miss Bascom went on, positively. &ldquo;You came here only a day or two after  he did. You have a Japanese kimono, and several Japanese ornaments adorn your  room. You went to the Waring house that night, Nogi let you in and out, and  though the Japanese doubtless committed the murder, you stole the money and the  ruby, and then, your partner in crime departed for parts unknown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom sat back in her chair with a look of triumph on her plain, gaunt face.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  she was rejoiced at her denunciation of the girl before her, and pleased at the  irrefutable theory she had promulgated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how did Miss Austin or the Jap, either, leave the room locked on the inside?&rdquo;  propounded Cray, his own opinions already swayed by the arraignment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  said Miss Bascom, with an air of finality, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain definitely, but I  am sure it was an example of Japanese jugglery. When you remember the tales of  how the Japanese can do seemingly impossible tricks, can swallow swords and get  out of locked handcuffs, it is quite within the realm of possibility that one  could lock a door behind him, and give it the appearance of having been locked  from the inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now,  Cray had already concluded that the door had been cleverly locked by some one,  but he hadn&rsquo;t before thought of the cleverness of the Japanese.</p>
  <p>He  rose almost abruptly, and said, &ldquo;I must look into some of these matters. Miss  Austin, you need not attempt to leave town, for you will not be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  most certainly shall not attempt to leave&mdash;as you express it&mdash;if I am asked not  to. But, I may say, that when I am entirely at liberty to do so, I propose to  go away from Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  dignity gave no effect of a person afraid or alarmed for her own safety, merely  a courteous recognition of Cray&rsquo;s attitude and a frank statement of her own  intentions.</p>
  <p>Miss  Bascom sniffed and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry, Mr. Cray. I&rsquo;ll see to it, that this young woman does not succeed in  evading justice, if she tries to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  which Miss Mystery gave her a smile that was so patronizing, even amused, that  the spinster was more irate than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  now, Miss Austin,&rdquo; the attorney said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your finger prints, please, as  they may be useful in proving what you did not do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled a little as the girl readily enough gave her consent to the procedure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;  he went on, more gravely, &ldquo;I will ask you for one of your shoes&mdash;one that you  wore on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Surprised  into a glance of dismay, Miss Mystery rose without a word and went upstairs for  the shoe.</p>
  <p>She  returned with the dainty, pretty thing, and merely observed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have  it back, when you are through with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Putting  the shoe in his overcoat pocket, Cray went away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Bascom,&rdquo; Anita said, turning to her enemy, &ldquo;may you never want a friend as much  as I do now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  nerve of her!&rdquo; Liza Bascom muttered to herself, as Miss Mystery went upstairs  to her own room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a very deep mystery here!&rdquo; Cray soliloquized, as he returned to the Waring  house. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m getting light on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  was far from lacking in ingenuity, and he proceeded at once to compare the  finger prints he had of Anita Austin with the prints on the small black-framed  chair that had been found drawn up to the desk chair of John Waring.</p>
  <p>They  were identical and Cray mused over the fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  girl was here that night,&rdquo; he decided; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no gainsaying that.&rdquo; He called  the butler to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ito,&rdquo;  he began, &ldquo;did you let in any one late Sunday night&mdash;after you came home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; the imperturbable Jap declared, thinking the question foolish, as all the  inquirers knew the details of his Sunday evening movements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember seeing this chair, Monday morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Distinctly.  I saw Mr. Lockwood smoothing its back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoothing  its back! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  looked through from the dining-room window, to see if Mr. Lockwood was coming  to breakfast, and I perceived him carefully smoothing the plush of the little  chair, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  meditated. Here was a point of evidence. Lockwood was not the sort to  absent-mindedly paw over a chair back. He was doing it on purpose. For what  reason? What reason could be, save to erase some evidence?</p>
  <p>Cray  examined the chair. It had a frame of shiny black wood, while seat and back  were covered with a dark plush of a fine soft quality.</p>
  <p>Cray  drew his fingers across the back. They left a distinct trail of furrows in the  fabric.</p>
  <p>Ito,  watching, nodded his head, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  finger-prints,&rdquo; Cray said to himself&mdash;&rdquo;but, maybe finger-marks. Whose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  surely saw this, Ito?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; and Miss Peyton also saw. She was then in the doorway, asking Mr. Lockwood  to come to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  went in search of Helen and put the question to her suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was Gordon Lockwood doing, when you went to call him to breakfast, Monday  morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  the truth&mdash;or it may be mean trouble for you and him, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was&mdash;he seemed to be dusting off a chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a duster?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  just passing over it with his hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t dusting it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t know what you call it! Perhaps he was merely pushing the chair into  place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t his custom to push the study furniture into place. He was erasing  indicative marks on that plush chair back&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he was doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo;  Helen cried; &ldquo;what marks could there be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Come and let us see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  took Helen to the study, and asked her to sit in the chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lean  back,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Now, get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl obeyed, and there was plainly seen on the plush the faint but unmistakable  imprint of the beaded design that adorned the back of the frock she wore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you so!&rdquo; Cray said, in triumph. &ldquo;That plush registers every impress, and  when Lockwood rubbed it smooth it was to erase a damaging bit of testimony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  far-fetched, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; said Gordon Lockwood himself, who had come in and had  heard and seen the latter part of the detective&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so very, Mr. Lockwood, when you learn that the finger prints on the chair frame  are your own and those of a certain young person who is already under  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood, as always under a sudden stress, became even more impassive, and his  eyes glittered as he faced the attorney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be too absurd, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; he advised, coldly. &ldquo;I suppose you mean Miss Austin&mdash;I  prefer to have no veiled allusions. But the finding of her finger prints on a  chair in this room, and mine also, does not seem to me to be in any way  evidence of crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;  Cray gave him scorn for scorn. &ldquo;Perhaps then, you can explain Miss Austin&rsquo;s  presence here that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that she was here&mdash;and I most certainly could not explain any of her  movements. But I do deny your right to assume her guilty from her presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you tacitly admit her presence, then. Indeed, one can scarcely doubt it, when  it is shown that this little shoe of hers,&rdquo; he took it from his pocket, &ldquo;exactly  fits the prints that cross the field of snow between here and the Adams house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  measure footprints&mdash;after all this time!&rdquo; and Lockwood&rsquo;s lip curled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  prints are exactly as they were made, Mr. Lockwood. The unchanging cold weather  has kept them intact. I tried this shoe, and the prints are unmistakable.  Moreover, the short stride is just the measure of the natural steps of Miss  Austin. The footprints lead from the Adams house over here and back again. The  returning prints occasionally overlap the ones that came this way, showing that  the trip away from this house was made latest. Miss Austin was seen to come  over in this direction&mdash;well, none but a half-wit would be blind to the  inevitable conclusions!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  but a half-wit would read into this evidence what you pretend to see,&rdquo; retorted  Lockwood, almost losing his calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; Cray said, sharply: &ldquo;now, Mr. Lockwood, why did you smooth off  that chair back? Careful, now, two witnesses saw you do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not denying it&rdquo;&mdash;Lockwood smiled in a bored, superior way, &ldquo;but if I did it, I  was&mdash;and am unconscious of it. One often touches a piece of furniture in passing  with no thought of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t go down. Both the butler and Miss Peyton saw you definitely and  deliberately rub over the back of that chair. Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  was inexorable.</p>
  <p>But  the impassive secretary merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t answer you, Mr. Cray. I can only repeat it must have been an unconscious  act on my part, and it has no sinister significance. I may have been merely  pushing the chair out of my way, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mr. Lockwood, you are a man of honor. Do you, upon oath, declare that you  did not purposely smooth that chairback, for the reason that it showed some  incriminating impress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not under oath. I have stated that I did not do what you accuse me of, and I  have nothing further to say on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  drew himself up and leaned with folded arms against the mantelpiece.</p>
  <p>Cray  dropped the subject, but his snapping eyes and compressed lips seemed to show  he had not finally dismissed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time,&rdquo; he said, abruptly, &ldquo;did Doctor Waring lock his study door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; the secretary replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you heard nothing from the room after that? No sound of voices? Nobody coming  in at the French window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Lockwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we are forced to the conclusion that whoever entered did so very quietly, that  it was with the knowledge and permission of Doctor Waring himself, that the  visitor was the person whose footprints lead straight to the door, and whose  finger prints are on the chair that stood near the Doctor&rsquo;s own chair. We are  borne out in this view by the fact that the same person now possesses the money  and the ruby pin which we know Doctor Waring had in his room with him, and we  know that the person is here in Corinth for unexplained reasons, and is, in  fact, so peculiar that she is known as&mdash;Miss Mystery. Just why, Mr. Lockwood,  are you arguing against these obvious inferences, and why do you undertake to  free from suspicion one against whom everything is so definitely black?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  Lockwood spoke very quietly, but his jaw was set in a stubborn way, &ldquo;the lady  you call Miss Mystery, is a young and defenseless girl, without, so far as I  know, a friend in this town. It is unfair to accuse her on the strength of this  fantastic story and it is unfair to condemn her unheard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unheard,&rdquo; said the attorney, &ldquo;but what she says only incriminates her more  deeply.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    Maurice Trask, Heir</b></h2>
  <p>The  funeral services of John Waring were solemn and impressive. No reference was  made to the manner of his taking-off, save to call it mysterious, and the  encomiums heaped upon him by the clergy and the college faculty were as sincere  as they were well-deserved.</p>
  <p>There  were two members of the great audience who were looked at with curiosity by  many.</p>
  <p>One  of these was Miss Mystery, the girl who, it was vaguely rumored was in some way  connected with the tragedy.</p>
  <p>To  look at her, this seemed impossible, for a sweeter face or a gentler manner  could scarce be imagined.</p>
  <p>Anita  Austin sat near the front, on one of the side aisles. She wore a gown of  taupe-colored duvetyn, and a velvet toque of the same color. Her olive face was  pale, and now and then her small white teeth bit into her scarlet lower lip, as  if she were keeping her self-control only by determined effort.</p>
  <p>A  close observer might note that she paid no heed to the utterance of the able  men who gave tribute to John Waring&rsquo;s character, but her troubled eyes rested  on the flower-covered casket, and the rising tears overflowed as she stifled an  occasional sob.</p>
  <p>And  then, fairly clenching her hands in a determination to show no emotion, this  strange girl would straighten up, and stare blankly ahead of her as if in utter  oblivion of the scene.</p>
  <p>Directly  behind her was Helen Peyton, who had chosen that place with the intention of  watching Miss Mystery. Mrs. Peyton was by her daughter&rsquo;s side, but her whole  attention was on the funeral services, and she thought of little else.</p>
  <p>Not  far off was Gordon Lockwood, and with him were Mrs. Bates and her nephew,  Pinckney Payne. Of this trio only the secretary let his gaze wander now and  then to the sad little face that was rapidly becoming the dearest thing in life  to him. As the church filled, and the flower-scented atmosphere grew  oppressive, Miss Austin let her coat fall from her shoulders, and Lockwood  noted with a start that she wore the same gown she had worn to the lecture at  which he first saw her. Again he counted the queer little buttons that edged  the sailor collar. He shook his head, and a great feeling of compassion filled  his heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  child,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  other magnet for strangers&rsquo; eyes was Maurice Trask, the relative of John  Waring, who had come from his home in St. Louis, to take possession of his  inheritance.</p>
  <p>For,  in the absence of any will, he had proved himself the next of kin, and had  gladly, even eagerly, taken the reins of government of the affairs and home of  the dead man.</p>
  <p>He  was the son of John Waring&rsquo;s cousin, and though the two men had never met, the  credentials and records brought by Maurice Trask left no possible doubt as to  his heirship.</p>
  <p>Trask  was not prepossessing of appearance, though he was well-mannered and moderately  well-dressed. His lack was that of sophistication, and he seemed ignorant of  the finer conventions of life. He was what is known as a self-made man, and men  of home manufacture require some sterling qualities to start with if they are  to turn out a satisfactory product.</p>
  <p>These  qualities Trask didn&rsquo;t have, and a first glance at the sharp-featured face gave  an impression of greed and shrewdness.</p>
  <p>There  was also a slight air of bravado, which was quite evidently caused by an uneasy  feeling of inferiority. He seemed to say, &ldquo;I am as good as you are,&rdquo; because  his conviction of that fact needed some such assertion to bolster it up.</p>
  <p>In  his seat as chief mourner, he was decorum itself. His black garb was very  black, and if it betrayed a provincial cut or fit, such an effect was more in  keeping with the man than correct apparel would have been.</p>
  <p>His  grief might have seemed a trifle ostentatious to one who remembered he had  never seen his cousin, but on the whole Maurice Trask was accepted by those  whose curiosity led to criticism, as a satisfactory heir to the Waring estate.</p>
  <p>Nor  was this an inconsiderable matter, for John Waring, beside his profession, had  written several successful books, and possessed in all a goodly fortune.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  there was no mystery about Trask. His life was an open book, the lawyers had  said; his family tree was of correct record and his claim to the estate clear  and true.</p>
  <p>While  as to that minx, Miss Mystery, nobody knew or could find out where she came  from, what she was doing in Corinth, or who she was, anyway. Clearly she was  mixed up with Doctor Waring in some unconventional way&mdash;that is, if the reports  were true that she visited him in his study without the knowledge of his  household. No shadow of blame was attached to John Waring for this&mdash;although it  would seem that the man was old and wise enough to ward off an attack from such  a small vampire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what she is,&rdquo; Helen Peyton concluded, to herself, as she mused on the girl who  sat in front of her. &ldquo;She just plain vamped poor Doctor Waring&mdash;and she got into  the study&mdash;and, now, I can prove it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  the funeral, the chief mourners went back to the Waring home to discuss  matters. Mrs. Peyton had tea served in the living-room, for all who came, and  many neighbors, drawn by curiosity, accepted her hospitality.</p>
  <p>Trask,  rubbing his hands involuntarily, slipped easily into his new r&ocirc;le of host, and  rather overdid his part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he would say, &ldquo;yes, yes. I learned from the addresses how fine a man my cousin  was&mdash;yes, yes, a noble character. Now, I can&rsquo;t expect to take his place in your  community all at once&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll get there! I&rsquo;ll get there! And you&rsquo;ll all help  me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he beamed on them. &ldquo;Yes, yes, you&rsquo;ll all help me to become one  of the first citizens of Corinth&mdash;one of the first citizens of your lovely,  tree-decked town. Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Plate  and cup in hand, he moved around among his guests, a little awkwardly but full  of amiability and good cheer. His sentiment was quite evidently, &ldquo;the king is  dead; long live the king,&rdquo; and he wanted to get settled on his throne at once.</p>
  <p>But  the cousin of John Waring had another side to him.</p>
  <p>This  was shown when, later on, he met a few people in the study.</p>
  <p>Cray  was there, by invitation, and Morton also. Lockwood and the two Peytons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a few words at the outset,&rdquo; Trask began, and he was noticeably more at ease in  this executive session than he had been in the social atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to maintain this household, for a time at least, as I find it. I shall be  glad, Mrs. Peyton, if you will continue to keep house for me, and I should like  you, Mr. Lockwood, to remain as secretary, if you are willing. There is, of  course, much to be done in settling the estate, and your knowledge would be  invaluable. Also, if you will, Mrs. Peyton, I&rsquo;d like you to engage servants&mdash;or  keep the ones you have. In fact, please look after the house matters entirely.  For, here is what I want to do first. Find the man who killed my cousin. I  never shall feel right in taking and using his home and his money unless I do  everything in my power to discover his murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be a case of suicide,&rdquo; suggested Attorney Cray, who was narrowly watching  the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No-sir-ee!  First place, as near as I can figure it out, my cousin was not the man to take  his own life. Also, he was on the eve of taking a fine position as College  President&mdash;also he was about to marry a beautiful lady. Why worry? And too&mdash;and  this is to me the strongest argument against the suicide theory&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read lots  of detective stories&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t sniff, Mr. Cray, those stories are often  founded on fact&mdash;and many of them hinge on the mystery of a sealed room. Often a  book starts out with a situation just like this; man found dead. Room locked up.  No weapon about. Murder or suicide? And, listen here; invariably the solution  is murder. Yes, sir&mdash;invariably! Why? &lsquo;Cause suicide is a mighty scarce article.  You don&rsquo;t find Human Nature putting an end to itself very often. That is, not worthwhile  Human Nature. Your suicides are weak men, down and outers, ignorant, half-baked  chaps. Not fine, upstanding men such as John Waring was. You know that, Mr.  Cray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  the attorney nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly so, Mr. Trask. And, anyway, if you&rsquo;re  going to make investigations, you have to start on the theory of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that exactly,&rdquo; Trask agreed. &ldquo;Then if we run up against proof&mdash;actual proof of  suicide, why then, we know where we&rsquo;re at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked at Trask and listened to him with interest. He was a new type to the  secretary, who with all his knowledge of characterization couldn&rsquo;t quite place  him.</p>
  <p>At  first, Lockwood had felt an instinctive dislike, the newcomer had been so  patently pleased with his inheritance, and so evidently insincere in his mourning.  But this sensible, straightforward insistence on avenging his cousin&rsquo;s  murder&mdash;if it were murder&mdash;raised Trask in Lockwood&rsquo;s estimation, and he  concluded to remain as secretary, for a time, at least.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have the case in charge, Mr. Cray,&rdquo; Trask went on, &ldquo;and I want you to push  it&mdash;push it, sir. Get help if you want&mdash;get some hifalutin detective, if that&rsquo;s  the proper caper&mdash;but, get results. Results, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m after! Here&rsquo;s my  idea. Get busy, and do all you can as quick as you can. Don&rsquo;t dawdle. Put things  through. And then&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t find the criminal, after due effort, then, we&rsquo;ll  give up the hunt. That&rsquo;s my idea. Do all you can&mdash;and then quit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Mr. Trask,&rdquo; Cray replied; &ldquo;I understand, and I&rsquo;ll do as you say. When you  have the time to devote to it, I&rsquo;ll give you a history of the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  time is now, Mr. Cray. And your history must be put in a nutshell. The  circumstances of John Waring&rsquo;s death, I know. Also, I know whom I suspect as  the murderer. So tell me your decisions to date.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear  we have made no decision, Mr. Trask. As a matter of fact the evidence to date  points in a most painful direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  You&rsquo;re deterred from justice because evidence points in a painful direction! My  stars, Cray! is that the way you detect in New England!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  evidence may be false, and it is unwise to accuse without certainty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have some certain evidence,&rdquo; said Helen Peyton, and all turned to look at the  girl, who spoke hesitatingly and in a low tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I wouldn&rsquo;t tell it&mdash;but&mdash;I think I ought to. I just found it out today.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you must tell it, Miss Peyton,&rdquo; Trask said, dictatorially. &ldquo;Out with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Helen spoke to Cray, &ldquo;you know Mr. Lockwood rubbed off some marks from this  chair the morning after&mdash;after we found Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they were without doubt indicative marks. What do you know about them?&rdquo; Cray  looked at her earnestly, for he had great interest in that act of the secretary&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were the marks made by the buttons on the back of the dress Miss Austin wore  today.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment Gordon Lockwood&rsquo;s calm almost deserted him. It was but a fleeting  instant, yet Cray&rsquo;s sharp eyes caught the look of utter dismay that crossed the  impassive face of the secretary. Immediately the usual hauteur returned and the  grave eyes met Cray&rsquo;s without a tremor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo; Cray was all alertness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sat behind her at the funeral. She took off her coat and I couldn&rsquo;t help  noticing a certain arrangement of buttons. It struck me, because I noticed the  marks on the chair back, and they were just the same design.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd,&rdquo;  Lockwood said, quietly, but with a deep scorn in his tone. &ldquo;As if you could  identify the trimming on a lady&rsquo;s gown!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I did,&rdquo; Helen persisted, spurred by Lockwood&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;I noticed it on the  chair, a clear pattern of the trimming of the collar, and two rows down the  back. And then I saw Mr. Lockwood rub it off of the chairback with utmost care.  And today, when I saw Miss Austin&rsquo;s dress, I recognized it at once. She was  here that night&mdash;Mr. Lockwood knew it&mdash;and he erased the marks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,  don&rsquo;t be too ridiculous!&rdquo; Lockwood spoke now in a soft drawl, that made Helen  flush with anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not ridiculous! Am I, Mr. Cray? It&rsquo;s evidence, isn&rsquo;t it? It proves that girl  was here&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it? And Gordon did rub it off&mdash;Ito saw him too, and I saw him.  He was rubbing the chair when I came to call him to breakfast&mdash;he can&rsquo;t deny it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do deny it,&rdquo; Lockwood said, quietly. &ldquo;Miss Peyton is excited and doesn&rsquo;t  remember accurately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort!&rdquo; blazed Helen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true. Gordon won&rsquo;t admit it because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,  hush!&rdquo; Gordon&rsquo;s look stopped her at once. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say things you&rsquo;ll regret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t regret them,&rdquo; put in Cray. &ldquo;All this is important. Mr. Lockwood, do you  deny obliterating these marks in question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do,&rdquo; Lockwood smiled slightly. &ldquo;If I was moving the chair or touching  it, when Miss Peyton came to call me to breakfast I don&rsquo;t remember it. At any  rate, it was with no intention of removing evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood told these falsehoods with as calm an air as he would have shown in  making truthful statements. He was not only deeply in love with Anita Austin,  but he did not and would not believe her guilty of crime, or of any connection  with a crime. Wherefore, he was ready and willing to tell any number of lies to  save or shield her.</p>
  <p>And  from his manner none could guess he was saying other than absolute truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look here,&rdquo; spoke up Maurice Trask. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, you know. Are you people  accusing a girl of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s murder? A <i>girl!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  accusation yet,&rdquo; Cray told him, &ldquo;but we want to know more about the young lady  in question. In fact, she&rsquo;s been dubbed Miss Mystery, because so little is  known about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Mystery, eh? And she came here to see the Doctor the night he died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not!&rdquo; Lockwood asserted, calmly. &ldquo;Had she done so, I should have known it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you would,&rdquo; Trask looked at him shrewdly. &ldquo;Of course. But the impress of  her clothing was left on the chairback? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; said Helen, sharply. &ldquo;And when forty-leven other things prove her presence  here that evening, I don&rsquo;t know why Mr. Lockwood so positively denies it. He  must have a deep interest in the young lady!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen&rsquo;s  spitefulness was undisguised, and her mother looked pained and regretful. Both  these women had hoped that Gordon Lockwood&rsquo;s affections might turn toward  Helen, and the older one realized that such speeches as this would in no way  further their plans.</p>
  <p>But  Helen was thoroughly jealous of Miss Mystery, for more reasons than one, and  she let her unbridled tongue expose her feelings.</p>
  <p>Cray  knew all this, and therefore took Helen&rsquo;s statements with a grain of salt. And  yet, he soliloquized, she would scarcely make up that rigmarole of the dress  trimming. He fancied it was true. And why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? The evidence of  Anita Austin&rsquo;s presence in John Waring&rsquo;s study that fatal night was far too  strong to be ignored. Moreover, the girl&rsquo;s possession of the money and the ruby  pin had yet to be satisfactorily explained. It was unthinkable that anyone should  have stolen these things and &ldquo;planted&rdquo; them in Miss Austin&rsquo;s bureau drawer!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to see this young woman,&rdquo; said Trask, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going over to see her now, come along,&rdquo; invited Cray, who was a little  impressed by the perspicuity of this stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going, too,&rdquo; declared Helen Peyton, and as Lockwood couldn&rsquo;t keep away, they  all went over to the Adams house.</p>
  <p>In  the cosy sitting-room they congregated, and Mrs. Adams went upstairs to summon  Anita.</p>
  <p>She  found the room locked. When, in response to a repeated summons, the door was  opened, Mrs. Adams faced a tearful, sad-faced girl, who asked indifferently  what was wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to come down stairs,&rdquo; the landlady said; &ldquo;Mr. Cray is there, and&mdash;and some  others. They want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t go down. I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess you&rsquo;ll have to.&rdquo; Mrs. Adams spoke a little crisply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a summons.  You&rsquo;ve got to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;  Miss Austin&rsquo;s manner changed. &ldquo;Well, I will, then. Wait till I bathe my face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Adams came in, closed the door and waited. She felt sorry for Miss Mystery, but  she also felt suspicious of her. Perhaps the mystery would now be cleared up.</p>
  <p>The  good woman was about to speak kindly to her strange boarder but as she watched,  she lost the desire to help her.</p>
  <p>For,  to Mrs. Adams&rsquo; primitive notions, the girl was doing dreadful things.</p>
  <p>Having  bathed her tear-stained face, Miss Mystery proceeded to powder it lightly, and,  horror of horrors, she added the merest flick of rouge to her pale cheeks. And  not content with such baseness she stooped to further degradation and touched  her pale lips with some heathenish contraption that made them just a little  redder!</p>
  <p>No,  Mrs. Adams had no sympathy for a girl who would do such awful things, and she  waited in a grim and stony silence.</p>
  <p>Then  Miss Mystery fluffed out her pretty dark hair a little more over her ears,  settled her sailor collar, with its row of tiny buttons for trimming, and with  a critical glance at her shoes, signified her readiness to go down stairs.</p>
  <p>Still  in disapproving silence, Mrs. Adams marched by her side, and they went together  to face the visitors.</p>
  <p>The  attitude of the girl as she entered the room was a triumph of perfection.</p>
  <p>Her  beauty, which usually needed no artificial aid, was striking, and her large  dark eyes rested on each in turn with an air of innocent wonder, quickly  followed by a pathetic, beseeching little smile that touched the heart of  several auditors, even though they deemed it disingenuous.</p>
  <p>Maurice  Trask, shrewd and calculating, sized her up, as he would have expressed it.</p>
  <p>And  his sizing up was decidedly complimentary. So much so, in fact, that he almost  concluded to take her part against all comers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  for her,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and yet,&rdquo; he added, to the same confidant, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s  nobody&rsquo;s fool! That girl knows what she&rsquo;s about&mdash;and by jingo, if she wanted to  kill a man, she could kill him! I&rsquo;ll say she could!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Miss Austin&rsquo;s dress that caught every one&rsquo;s eye. Not a person present,  among the visitors, but wanted to say, &ldquo;turn around&mdash;oh, do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the girl sank into a low chair beside Saltonstall Adams and quietly awaited  developments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I present Mr. Trask,&rdquo; Cray said, a little awkwardly, for it was not easy to be  casual under the glance of those pathetic eyes.</p>
  <p>Anita  bowed courteously if coldly, and then there was an embarrassing silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Trask remarked, at last, &ldquo;you people are not very talkative, guess I&rsquo;ll take  the helm myself. Miss Austin, will you be good enough to get up and turn  around?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  request was so simply made, that, almost without thinking of its strangeness,  Anita did exactly as she was asked.</p>
  <p>Sure  enough, there were two rows of buttons down the back of her bodice, and another  row across the sailor collar.</p>
  <p>At  a nod from Trask she sat down again, and then the storm broke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you so!&rdquo; cried Helen Peyton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very dress that made the marks on  that chair back! Dare you deny, Miss Austin, that you were in Doctor Waring&rsquo;s  study that night he died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dark eyes of Miss Mystery opened wide in horror. She seemed fairly paralyzed  with fright, and glanced wildly from one face to another.</p>
  <p>Maurice  Trask&rsquo;s showed only frank admiration. He looked at the girl as if he had never  before seen any one so attractive.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood&rsquo;s face betrayed no emotion of any sort. Had he been indifferent to  Miss Mystery instead of loving her, as he did, he could have shown no less  expressive countenance.</p>
  <p>And  all the others present showed definite and decided suspicion, scorn and hatred.</p>
  <p>Except  one. Old Salt looked kindly at the agitated girl. He even held out a protective  hand, and with a gentle inflection, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  the truth, dear child.<i> Did</i> you know  Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly  Miss Mystery&rsquo;s eyes traveled round the room. Looking at each face in turn, her  own expression became more and more hard and stubborn. Then, seeing the  kindness on the face of Old Salt, she broke down utterly and sobbed out. &ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead! what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    The Truesdell Eyebrows</b></h2>
  <p>Maurice  Trask looked at Miss Mystery with rapidly growing interest and curiosity. She  seemed so young and helpless and she was so pretty and so pathetic that he  immediately decided she could not be mixed up in any wrong-doing. He also  decided, for he was a man of quick conclusions, that this was the girl for him.  Having his new fortune, he wanted a wife to help him enjoy it, and where could  he find a more utterly desirable girl than Miss Austin?</p>
  <p>Straightforwardly  he asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Doctor Waring make love to you? Did you love him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  others looked aghast at these suggestions, and then Mrs. Adams said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she did! I saw her one night, kissing Doctor Waring&rsquo;s picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cray  turned on Anita.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you love that man?&rdquo; he asked, sternly. &ldquo;If you did, you surely didn&rsquo;t kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she didn&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo; Old Salt put in. &ldquo;Impossible to imagine such a  thing! Speak up, little girl. Why did you kiss the picture of a man you had  never seen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Several  of those listening waited breathlessly for a response.</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood, for one, could scarce control his impatience to hear the answer. For,  only too well he remembered the letter he had found in the Doctor&rsquo;s  waste-basket. The words were graven in his brain.</p>
  <p>Darling  Anita: At the first glance of your brown eyes love was born in my heart. Life  is worth living&mdash;with you in the world.</p>
  <p>If  love at first sight had been born in the man&rsquo;s heart, must it not have found  response in the girl&rsquo;s? Or, even if not, could she have killed a man who felt  thus toward her? Truly she was a mystery. For, the very fact that Waring had  fallen in love with her, made possible, even plausible, her clandestine visit  to him, and her possession of the money and jewel.</p>
  <p>Could  it be that the pretty little thing was merely a sly adventuress? That she  cajoled Waring into giving her the valuables, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>No,  Gordon Lockwood could not and would not believe any evil of the girl he loved.  Even though she should admit her love for Waring, he would not lose faith in  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Answer  me,&rdquo; Cray demanded. &ldquo;Answer this direct question directly. Did you love Doctor  Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Almost  like one hypnotized, Miss Mystery gave a helpless glance at her inquisitor and  murmured a low, almost inaudible &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did you kill him?&rdquo; Cray stormed at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were there, in his study the night he&mdash;he died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,  I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were! It&rsquo;s been proved. You went over from this house, across the snow field,  and you went in the study and you sat on the plush chair, near the desk. Didn&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  great dark eyes seemed unable to tear themselves from Cray&rsquo;s face, and again  the half-breathed whisper was, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  protest!&rdquo; said Trask. &ldquo;That girl shall not be tortured. Whether she&rsquo;s guilty or  not, she&rsquo;s entitled to fairer treatment. You can&rsquo;t make her say those things  that may be used against her! Quit it, Cray. I forbid it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Cray,&rdquo; Lockwood said, quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to bait Miss Austin&mdash;you  make her admit things through sheer fright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  it was true. Miss Mystery was trembling, and her face was white, save for the  delicate flush on her cheeks and lips that she had placed there herself.</p>
  <p>Her  great eyes, beneath their heavy dark brows flew from one face to another, and  she did not fail to notice the fact that every man in the room, Cray perhaps  excepted, was in sympathy with her, while every woman was against her.</p>
  <p>This  must have comforted her, for she looked about, a faint smile dawning in her  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that true?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may I be excused from this questioning until I can get  counsel? I don&rsquo;t know what to say&mdash;myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  pretty distress and helplessness again appealed to the masculine sympathy, and,  realizing this, she ignored the other sex.</p>
  <p>A  puzzled expression crossed the face of Maurice Trask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  in the world can she be?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That last flash of those eyes, as she  drew her heavy eyebrows into a straight line surely reminded me of somebody. By  heavens! the Truesdell brows!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  he scanned the oval little face. He shook his head in uncertainty, but again  declared to himself, &ldquo;The Truesdell eyebrows!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  look here, all of you,&rdquo; Old Saltonstall Adams said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this child  is guilty of anything really wrong. If she caught the fancy of Doctor Waring,  it may seem pretty awful to us old fogies, but a pretty girl like Miss Austin  can&rsquo;t help charming the menfolks. I don&rsquo;t want to discuss that, but I do say  that it&rsquo;s no crime to go to see a man in the evening, and too, she may have had  some errand we know nothing about. Did Doctor Waring give you that money of his  own free will, Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Anita, involuntarily, and then bit her lip as she added, &ldquo;I told you he  didn&rsquo;t give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there, don&rsquo;t say any more, you only contradict yourself. I had no business to  ask that. Now, Mr. Cray, from now on, I take Miss Austin under my personal  care. I&rsquo;ll be responsible for her appearance when you want her. And,&rdquo; he looked  at his wife, &ldquo;Mrs. Adams will back me up. She too will shelter and care for  Miss Austin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  she is proved guilty,&rdquo; Esther Adams broke in. &ldquo;In that case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  until she is,&rdquo; Old Salt said, in his calm way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t guarantee her  innocence&mdash;I only want to prevent injustice to her. Have you funds to engage a  lawyer, Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that frightened look made the girl seem anything but innocent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  I have to tell a lawyer&mdash;everything?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes&mdash;to be sure,&rdquo; Trask broke in. &ldquo;But what of that? I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve nothing to  tell him incriminating to yourself. You exaggerate your connection with this  matter. I&rsquo;ll bet you were there that night on some perfectly innocent errand&mdash;at  least so far as Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I was!&rdquo; Anita said, and then, as quickly, &ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t there at night&mdash;it was  in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  groaned in spirit. Everything this girl said made her more of a prevaricator,  even though she might be innocent of crime. Surely she was mixed up in the  matter, and must know who gave the fatal stab&mdash;if she didn&rsquo;t do it herself. If  only Nogi could be found. He, of course, was implicated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get a lawyer for you, if you&rsquo;ll let me, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Lockwood said, unable to  resist his impulse to help her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a lawyer,&rdquo; said Maurice Trask, &ldquo;I here and now offer my services to Miss  Austin. If you&rsquo;ll accept, my dear young lady, I promise to use my best efforts  to do all that can be done for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  do I have to tell you&mdash;&rdquo; again Anita began, perplexedly&mdash;her brows straight.</p>
  <p>Trask  gazed at her fixedly, and then he said, &ldquo;That will be between us. You will  decide when we talk things over, what to tell me and what not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke as to a fractious child, and his voice was kind and helpful even though  his inflections were not cultured.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked at him uneasily. Might not this man&rsquo;s kindness and assistance to the  distressed girl lead her to feel such gratitude that it would be no hard matter  for Trask to win more than gratitude? Lockwood was nervously sensitive to the  interest Trask took in Anita, and well knew his state of mind toward the little  beauty.</p>
  <p>And,  instead of being lessened by the trend of suspicion toward Anita, Lockwood&rsquo;s  own infatuation deepened with every glance he allowed himself at the lovely  face.</p>
  <p>The  countenance of Miss Mystery was ever changing. Now, she was a wistful-eyed  child, and in a flash she was an inscrutable young woman&mdash;only to change the  next instant to a wrongly accused and innocent martyr.</p>
  <p>Anyway,  Lockwood told himself, he meant to win her, and if Trask stood in his way,  Trask must be set aside, that was all. An indomitable will ought to be able to  conquer the intents of a self-made, unattractive man of Trask&rsquo;s type. And, too,  a love like his own, surging more fully every moment must appeal to the girl,  once he could get a chance to declare it.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  was by no means a conceited man, but he had a true sense of value and he knew  that he was a fitter mate for Miss Mystery than Trask, if the girl could know  them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know a lawyer,&rdquo; Lockwood began, &ldquo;here in Corinth. Might he not be a better man  for you, Miss Austin, than a stranger in the town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  why?&rdquo; Trask said, his eyes coldly scanning Lockwood&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he would have known Doctor Waring, and&mdash;and all the circumstances,&rdquo; Lockwood  concluded a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much of an argument,&rdquo; Trask dismissed the suggestion. &ldquo;Also, I promise not to  cost the lady as much as any other counsel would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  speech was accompanied by an admiring glance that was so nearly a smirk that  Lockwood with difficulty kept his hands off Trask&rsquo;s throat.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Peyton, who with Helen had sat almost wordless through the whole session, now  rose to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  Helen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are of no use here, and I&rsquo;d rather take you away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  implication that the presence of Miss Mystery was contaminating was too plain  to be mistaken, and mother and daughter left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Cray said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pretty much made up my mind in this matter. I make no arrest  now, since you&rsquo;re going to be responsible, Mr. Adams, for Miss Austin&rsquo;s  presence when desired. But, I think I see it all. I think I can reconstruct the  whole case, and I think there will be decided developments very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do,&rdquo; was Trask&rsquo;s response to this speech, and as one by one all present rose to  go, Trask remained, and asked that he might see Miss Austin alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  I&rsquo;ll stand by,&rdquo; said Old Salt, and something in the grim but kindly old face  made Trask give tacit consent.</p>
  <p>Straightforwardly  the man set about his inquiries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  first of all, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Trask said, &ldquo;where is your home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  obstinate look came into her eyes, and she hesitated a moment. Then, with a  sudden change of expression, she said, &ldquo;Indianapolis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six-twenty-seven  Jackson Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trask&rsquo;s  eyebrows went up at this, and he gave her a searching look, but Miss Mystery  showed no embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  of the number?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know Indianapolis pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure,&rdquo; was the cool reply, and Trask went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know  Doctor Waring before you came here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  saw him before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,  to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita  only shook her head slowly, but Trask did not press her for a verbal answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you were there that night. Now, it&rsquo;s useless to deny it, for the prints of those  doodads on the back of that very frock you have on now were on the plush back  of the chair you sat in. Young Lockwood smoothed them away&mdash;Lord knows why! He  must suspect you, I should say, and tried to shield you that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  he?&rdquo; asked Miss Mystery, hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  he shield you? No, my child, he couldn&rsquo;t, but I can. You just trust yourself to  me, and you&rsquo;ll have no trouble, no trouble at all. You&rsquo;ve got Mr. Saltonstall,  here, and me for friends. Something tells me you won&rsquo;t need anybody else. We&rsquo;ll  pull you through, eh, Old Salt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  accustomed to the nickname from the townspeople, Mr. Adams didn&rsquo;t relish it  from this stranger, and he merely said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Austin&rsquo;s friend, be sure of  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m  I,&rdquo; Trask declared. &ldquo;Now, little lady, you needn&rsquo;t tell all you know, but some  things you must tell me. Anybody among your relatives named Truesdell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Only  a quick eye could have caught a fleeting look of dismay on her face, as Anita  promptly responded, &ldquo;No&mdash;not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Falsehood  number one,&rdquo; said Trask to himself. &ldquo;What the deuce is she up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  aloud, he only said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. Now, why did you come to Corinth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  sketch,&rdquo; said Anita glibly, and smiling at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an artist, you see&mdash;I paint  water-colors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I  see. Now, just why did you hide that stiletto of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was frightened. I was afraid they would think I killed Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you fear that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She was almost flippant now. &ldquo;Those detectives are so queer,  they&rsquo;re likely to suspect anybody. And they said the weapon used was a round,  sharp instrument, so&mdash;so I hid the thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t use that to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Adams,&rdquo; Trask turned to the old man, &ldquo;please leave us two alone for a few  moments. I ask you as a personal favor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word Old Salt left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Trask said, in a determined tone, &ldquo;I know you killed  that man as well as I know you&rsquo;re here. Also, I know why. Or, at least, I don&rsquo;t  know exactly why, but I have knowledge that will lead straight to a revelation  of the whole affair. I know you are related to the Truesdells&mdash;though perhaps  you don&rsquo;t know that yourself. Now, here&rsquo;s my proposition. I&rsquo;m a lawyer, and I&rsquo;m  known as a shrewd one. Many a time I&rsquo;ve made black appear white&mdash;and I can do it  in your case. But&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll marry me, I&rsquo;ll get you off. Wait a minute&mdash;don&rsquo;t  speak yet. I&rsquo;m not bad-looking, I&rsquo;m kind-hearted and, by my cousin&rsquo;s death, I&rsquo;m  a rich man. You may not love me yet&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll guarantee I can win your  affection. I fell in love with you, the very minute I saw you and I want you  for my wife. You needn&rsquo;t marry me now&mdash;wait as long as you say&mdash;but give me your promise,  and I&rsquo;ll clear you of all suspicion in this terrible affair. On the other hand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a pause, and then Anita said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the other hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall tell what I know about you&mdash;and, well, you know yourself what chance you  will have then of getting off scotfree!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  threat?&rdquo; and Miss Mystery flung up her proud little head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  don&rsquo;t misunderstand. Not a threat. But I admit, a bribe. Marry me, and I&rsquo;ll  free you. Say no&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t have to do a thing. The law will do it all. You  simpleton! Do you suppose you can keep your secret once the law really begins  to hound you? Cray is only just opening his eyes to your connections with the  case. Lockwood has realized that you must be guilty, though he&rsquo;s trying hard  not to believe it. Old Salt only befriends you because you&rsquo;re helpless and  pretty&mdash;not because he thinks you&rsquo;re innocent&mdash;any more than his wife does. The  two Peytons hate you&mdash;for reasons of their own&mdash;probably because you snared  Lockwood away from the lovely Helen. But none of those things will matter if  you take up with my offer. I&rsquo;ll carry you through with flying colors. You&rsquo;ll be  not only freed from suspicion but eulogized and beloved by all who know you,  and as my wife, you&rsquo;ll have a proud and enviable position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery gave the speaker a look that not only took him in from head to foot but  seemed to penetrate his very soul, and in a quiet, even tone, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  than marry you&mdash;I would face the electric chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  scorn in her voice, even more than the scathing words themselves, enraged  Trask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  he said, with ill-repressed fury, &ldquo;you would, would you? Have your own way,  then, Miss Mystery&mdash;and soon your mystery will be known and you may have your  desire, and&mdash;face the electric chair!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl rose, and stood, waiting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo;  she said, without glance or gesture.</p>
  <p>And  in a white heat of anger, Trask went.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  dearie,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams said, coming in, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to tell me anything. My  husband bids me befriend you&mdash;and I will, so long as your case is uncertain. But  if you&rsquo;re proved to be guilty, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t fail me,&rdquo; and Miss Mystery threw herself into the other&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;I am so  lonely and so friendless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you? Where&rsquo;s your folks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Miss Mystery drew herself up, with a forlorn little attempt at dignity, and  said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go to my room now, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Upstairs  she went, slowly, and as she neared her own room Lockwood met her in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Count  me your friend,&rdquo; he said, simply, and held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; she replied, putting her little hand in his, and then, with one deep  glance, each knew of the other&rsquo;s love.</p>
  <p>Lockwood&rsquo;s  was written plain on his face, and his eyes, usually so calm and cold, were  lighted with the intensity of his passion.</p>
  <p>This  Anita read, and her own response was quick and involuntary.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  it was a rebound from the awful proposals of Maurice Trask; perhaps it was a  heart finding its mate&mdash;perhaps, remembering Miss Mystery&rsquo;s ways, it was mere  coquetry, but the glances were exchanged and they knew.</p>
  <p>Anita  went on to her room, and throwing herself into a chair, sat long in thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall I do?&rdquo; she asked herself over and over again. &ldquo;What can I do? If only I  hadn&rsquo;t taken the money&mdash;and the pin. Why did I do it? And he said Truesdell! How  did he know? My eyebrows, I suppose. That awful man! And he&rsquo;ll tell&mdash;oh, yes, he&rsquo;ll  surely tell&mdash;and that will poison Gordon&rsquo;s mind against me&mdash;oh, was anybody ever  in such trouble as I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  tap at her door announced the maid with a note.</p>
  <p>Alone  again, Anita read it. It was from Lockwood and begged an interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  let me see you alone,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how best to manage it. Will you  go for a walk with me now? There&rsquo;s time for a short stroll before dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hurriedly  Anita flung on hat and coat, and opened her door.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  was on the stair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  out?&rdquo; he said, casually, &ldquo;may I walk with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  do,&rdquo; said Anita, and they started out together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry enough to do anything that seems clandestine,&rdquo; said Lockwood as they  walked, &ldquo;but that feline lady, Miss Bascom, is watching your every move, and I  can&rsquo;t let her get anything to criticise you for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  grateful look rewarded him, and then Gordon went on: &ldquo;Tell me, did I read your  eyes aright? Do you, can you care to know how I love you? How I have loved you  from the moment I first saw you. Do you care, Anita? May I love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; she said, in a soft little voice. &ldquo;And you do know dreadful  things about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care for any of those things. If they&rsquo;re dreadful, they&rsquo;re not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;they  are true&mdash;some of them. And there are more dreadful things to know&mdash;that you don&rsquo;t  even suspect&mdash;Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last word, spoken in the lowest, tenderest of voices, completed Lockwood&rsquo;s  infatuation. Had she not said that, he might have been deterred by her  statements, but that softly-breathed name, stirred his pulses, and in the  deepening dusk he found her hand and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita,  I want you&mdash;I love you&mdash;none of these things count. I know you are in no way  guiltily connected with this crime&mdash;if you are mixed up with it, it is through  force of circumstances, and anyway, I don&rsquo;t care who or what you are&mdash;I love you,  I believe in you and I want you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s all so dreadful&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell anything you don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that man will tell. That terrible Trask man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  didn&rsquo;t waver in his fealty or loyalty but it was a blow to learn that Trask  knew something of Anita&rsquo;s secrets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he said, firmly, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    A Proposal</b></h2>
  <p>Maurice  Trask took up his reins of government with a firm hand. He left all  housekeeping and domestic matters to Mrs. Peyton, but the business affairs of  Doctor Waring, he concluded to clean up as rapidly as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  astonishing,&rdquo; he said to Lockwood, &ldquo;what a lot of varied interests my cousin  had. This morning&rsquo;s mail brings all sorts of things from Rare Book Catalogues  to Mining Prospectuses. By the way, I think I shall have an auction of his rare  books. Such things don&rsquo;t interest me, and I believe they have a big money  value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of them have,&rdquo; Lockwood returned, indifferently.</p>
  <p>He  could not bring himself to like his new employer, but as he had agreed to stay  with him for a time, he did his best to meet requirements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  this lot, now,&rdquo; and Trask indicated a bookcase full of old volumes of the  classics. &ldquo;They mean nothing to me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t read Latin or Greek, and wouldn&rsquo;t if  I could. My good heavens! Look at this one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trask  had taken down the volume that had been on Doctor Waring&rsquo;s desk the night of  his death. As he flipped over the pages, two were stuck together, and the  ghastly red stains showed only too clearly that they were the spilled blood of  the dying man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  he said, holding out the volume to Lockwood, &ldquo;burn that up. How could anyone  have put it back on the shelf? Never let me see it again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  secretary took it, noting that it was a copy of Martial, to which Doctor Waring  had been greatly attached. Indeed, it had, to Lockwood&rsquo;s knowledge, been lying  on the Doctor&rsquo;s desk for a week or more before his death.</p>
  <p>Laying  the stained volume aside in his own desk, Lockwood proceeded to assist in the  examination of the books.</p>
  <p>He  was not at all surprised to find Trask discarding the ones he would have  retained and keeping the most worthless&mdash;though there was little that could  really be called trash in the Waring library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the story books?&rdquo; the new owner grumbled. &ldquo;No detective stories? No spicy  novels? No joke-books?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Waring was serious-minded,&rdquo; Lockwood reminded him. &ldquo;He cared little for lighter  reading. He was a scholar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sure was&mdash;to judge from these old dry-as-dust tomes. But, I&rsquo;ll fire a lot of the  poky old stuff, and so make room for more entertaining books. You see,  Lockwood, I hope&mdash;and I expect to get me a wife before long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon&rsquo;s  heart seemed to contract, for he divined what was coming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yeppy,  that&rsquo;s so. Little Old Maurice wants a wifie&mdash;and&mdash;who do you suppose has caught  my fancy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  was the mechanical response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  none other than the little Miss Mystery. Oh, yes, I know she is under a  cloud&mdash;but I can get her off&mdash;I&rsquo;m a bird of a lawyer, you know&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll fix up  all that. Then, I&rsquo;ll elevate that little nonentity to the elevated position of  the missus of Maurice Trask. Hey, my boy, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  Lockwood&rsquo;s calm not been habitual with him, he could scarcely have maintained  it through this scene. As it was, he was a boiling, seething furnace inside  him, but his judgment told him that any exhibition of surprise or annoyance  would only irritate the other man without doing any good.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  if Trask were really a shrewd lawyer, and if he knew something that would make  any trouble for Anita&mdash;and she had hinted that he did&mdash;then, Lockwood argued, he  must keep friendly with Trask, at least until he found out more of the matter.</p>
  <p>So  he said, lightly, &ldquo;Has the lady agreed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;not  yet; but&mdash;I say, Lockwood, you&rsquo;re hit in that same direction, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admire Miss Austin very much, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you  keep off&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear,&rdquo; said Lockwood, in his imperturbable way, but when Trask looked up and  caught the cold stare of his secretary, he dropped the subject and returned to  the books.</p>
  <p>Since  Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death, Lockwood had formed the habit of going back to the Adams  house for his luncheon. This, of course, in the hope of seeing something of  Anita, and also, because his new employer preferred it that way.</p>
  <p>At  luncheon, Trask took occasion to eulogize Miss Austin.</p>
  <p>Helen  Peyton stood it as long as she could, and then broke out with: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see  what you can find to admire in that thin, sallow little thing! And, beside, she  is a wicked girl. I think she killed Doctor Waring, but even if she didn&rsquo;t, she  came over here to see him, secretly, late at night, and if that isn&rsquo;t  wrong-doing, I don&rsquo;t know what is! But just because she puts up a helpless  bluff, all the men fall for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealous,  Miss Peyton?&rdquo; and Trask looked at her shrewdly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Helen tossed her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no reason to be. That girl is nothing to me, and  the sooner she gets out of Corinth the better. If the police will let her go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  then, Miss Peyton,&rdquo; Trask began, in his most emphatic manner, &ldquo;and Mrs. Peyton,  too, once for all, I will hear no word against Miss Austin in my house. Put any  meaning you like into that, but remember it. One word against Anita Austin, and  the speaker of it goes out of my door never to return. Am I clear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear?  Yes; but I can tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Helen,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;We want to stay here, don&rsquo;t we? Well, then, as Mr.  Trask is evidently much in earnest, I insist that you obey his wishes&mdash;as I  shall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Mrs. Peyton. And if your daughter forgets my hints I trust to you to  keep her reminded. That&rsquo;s all about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In this  fashion Maurice Trask settled every question that arose. His word was law, and  he spoke no unnecessary words.</p>
  <p>The  servants could obey or leave. The housekeeper had been told the same, and the  secretary understood it, too.</p>
  <p>Returning  to the library after luncheon, Trask sat at the desk in deep thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  to get the girl,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Plenty to hold over her head&mdash;but she&rsquo;s  skittish, that&rsquo;s plain to be seen. Also, she&rsquo;s in love with Lockwood. Got to  get him out of town. Nothing doing while he&rsquo;s around. Now, how? Morton hinted  of his being deeply in debt. If so, he&rsquo;s got some past history, guess I can get  something on him&mdash;got to, whether I can or not. H&rsquo;m. Wonder if the little girl  did do the sticking. Hard to believe it, and yet that kid&rsquo;s got it in her. She  sure has! And she&rsquo;s a Truesdell all right. Nobody ever had those beetling  brows, almost joining above those dark eyes, in that level line&mdash;why, if she&rsquo;s a  Truesdell&mdash;! Good Lord, I&rsquo;ve got to marry her! I&rsquo;ll have to scare her into it!  Now, Maurice, my boy, get in some of your finest work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clapping  on his hat, he started for the Adams house.</p>
  <p>As  luck would have it, he met Anita and his secretary walking toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Playing  truant?&rdquo; he called out gaily to Lockwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  just on my way to your house,&rdquo; Gordon returned, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  too, Miss Mystery?&rdquo; and Trask gave her a wide smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;m going to the post-office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I see. Then, on your way, Lockwood&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll step along with Miss Austin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no good way out of this arrangement, so it obtained, and Trask fell into  step with the girl, as Lockwood turned off toward the Waring house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  my dear young lady,&rdquo; Trask began, unheeding her look of aversion, &ldquo;you may as  well understand me first as last. I&rsquo;ve got the whip hand&mdash;or, as that isn&rsquo;t a very  graceful expression, let us say, I hold the trumps. I know all about you, you  see. I know why you went to the doctor&rsquo;s library that night, and&mdash;I know what  happened there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anita, coolly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bluffing, and I know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m not bluffing&mdash;not entirely, anyway. True, there are some things I don&rsquo;t know  yet, but&mdash;I soon will! Don&rsquo;t think you can keep anything from me! I&rsquo;m going to  take a week for investigation. Also, to give you your chance. If I find out  what I fully expect to find out I shall make it all public&mdash;how will you like  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  great fear showed in Anita&rsquo;s eyes, and she murmured, brokenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh,  Mr. Trask, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hah!  Scared, are you? I thought you&rsquo;d be! Now, you know my price. You marry  me&mdash;promise to marry me, that is, and I&rsquo;ll get you through this thing with bells  on. No shadow of suspicion shall remain attached to you&mdash;or, to any one you care  for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard you were not going to rest until you learned who killed Doctor Waring,&rdquo;  Anita temporized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; but that was before I saw you. Now, I don&rsquo;t care if you have killed half  the people in Corinth, I want you all the same. You&rsquo;ve bewitched me. You, a  silly little slip of a girl, with no particular claim to beauty, except your  big, mournful eyes, and your peach of a mouth! I&rsquo;ll bring the smiles to that  sad little face. Oh, Anita, I&rsquo;m not a brute, and I do love you so. Give up your  foolish fancy for Lockwood, for it is only a passing attraction. And he hasn&rsquo;t  any money, and he&rsquo;s deeply in debt, and oh, I&rsquo;m a thousand times a better  catch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you knew how you damaged your cause by talking like that&mdash;&rdquo; the girl began, her  eyes cold with scorn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I won&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; Trask said, humbly. &ldquo;Only take me, Anita, and you can  make me over to suit yourself. I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say. I&rsquo;ll read the books  you want me to, I&rsquo;ll get cultured and refined&mdash;and all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita  almost laughed. &ldquo;You are so funny,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>But  this was a little too much for Trask&rsquo;s self-love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Funny,  am I?&rdquo; he stormed. &ldquo;Funny! You&rsquo;ll see how funny I am when I tell the police why  you killed that man! You&rsquo;ll see if I&rsquo;m funny when I refuse the evidence that  might help you out. When I keep still instead of speakin&rsquo; out in meetin&rsquo;! You  look here, Anita Austin, I hold you in the hollow of my hand, and don&rsquo;t you  forget it! You&rsquo;ve got a deep dark secret&mdash;and though I don&rsquo;t know quite all of  it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll know it soon. What M. Trask sets out to find out, he finds out. See?  Now, do you want to tell me who you are&mdash;or not? Want to tell me who your father  was? Your mother was a Truesdell&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bet on that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery&rsquo;s face fell. Abject despair was written on every line of it. She  glanced at Trask, and his own determined expression showed her that she could  hope for nothing from him save on his own terms.</p>
  <p>And  those terms were too hard for her. Just aware of loving Lockwood, just learning  to know what love meant and how sweet it could be, just realizing, too, the  awfulness of her own position, the dire necessity for secrecy, the terrible  result of Trask&rsquo;s revelations, should they be made, altogether Miss Mystery  faced a dangerous crisis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say you&rsquo;ll give me a week?&rdquo; she said, at last, grasping at a hope of reprieve.</p>
  <p>Trask  looked at her with curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  good&rsquo;ll that do you? Better put yourself under my protection at once. Every day  you lose is that much nearer discovery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, I&rsquo;ll dare it! They won&rsquo;t&mdash;won&rsquo;t condemn me, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho,  ho. Banking on your sex to save you! Well, honestly, I don&rsquo;t really think they&rsquo;d  send a pretty girl like you to the chair, but a trial would convict you in the  eyes of the world, even if twelve men were too soft-hearted to see you  electrocuted. And there&rsquo;d be imprisonment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hush! Mr. Trask, have you no pity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty  for the girl that is to be my wife. None for any other. And especially none for  a girl who scorns me and throws me over for my own secretary. I&rsquo;m a red-blooded  man, I am, and you can&rsquo;t play fast and loose with me and get away with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean to play fast and loose with you, if by that you mean changing my mind.  But, I do ask for a few days to think it over. That&rsquo;s not unreasonable, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery&rsquo;s little smile was cajoling, and Trask couldn&rsquo;t resist it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; he said, as he looked hungrily at her bewitching face, &ldquo;take a coupla  days, then. But, only on condition that you don&rsquo;t let Lockwood make love to  you. Promise me that for the forty-eight hours, you won&rsquo;t see that man alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I promise that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to, whether you can or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked at her sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ll keep that promise, or you&rsquo;ll be sorry! I haven&rsquo;t much opinion of your  promises, you&rsquo;re not the sort to keep faith. But, remember I&rsquo;m a power. Maurice  Trask can do whatever he sets out to do. And if you forget that, you&rsquo;re mighty  apt to regret it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gave you a promise,&rdquo; Anita said, looking at him coldly, &ldquo;and I fully intend to  keep it. It&rsquo;s not such a very hard one to keep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  lip curled, and though he guessed the tumult in her heart, there was no sign of  it on her face.</p>
  <p>Trask  accompanied her to the postoffice, and then, bidding him a careless good  afternoon, Anita went into a large drygoods shop and he made no attempt to  follow her.</p>
  <p>He  would have been interested, however, had he noted her proceedings. For she went  straight to a telephone booth, and called up the Waring house. Ito answered and  when she asked to be connected with Mr. Lockwood, the butler gave the  connection without question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gordon?&rdquo;  came the soft little voice. &ldquo;This is Anita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then she told him quickly but fully all that had passed between her and Trask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you see,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I do want these two days to think things out, and I  mustn&rsquo;t see you alone, for he&rsquo;s sure to know of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; Lockwood said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our courting over the telephone. Let me see, I&rsquo;ll  go down town this evening and telephone you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that won&rsquo;t do. I can&rsquo;t talk to you in the Adams front hall! Here&rsquo;s a better  plan. Tomorrow, when Mr. Trask goes out, you call me up there, and I&rsquo;ll go out  to a pay station and call you up where you are now. And the day after tomorrow  the time will be up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and what are you going to do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the girl, her voice suddenly losing its brightness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to think it out. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll see you at dinner, shan&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; and this evening, I suppose, but only with others present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  after a few more words Anita left the booth and walked slowly home.</p>
  <p>When  Trask returned to his library he said to Lockwood, &ldquo;Get busy on those old books  at once, will you? I want the shelves cleared for some of my own books that I&rsquo;ve  sent for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; returned the secretary, thinking of the probable difference between the  expected books and those they would replace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind, Mr Trask, if I take a few of these old ones myself? I&rsquo;ll pay you  whatever price a first class dealer sets on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  take what you want, without pay. I&rsquo;m in a good humor today, Lockwood, better  take advantage of it. Help yourself from the shelves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, I&rsquo;ll not impose on your kindness and generosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor  did he, but among the few volumes he chose was the crimson stained copy of  Martial&rsquo;s Epigrams.</p>
  <p>Distasteful  though it was, Lockwood looked at the book with a feeling of reverence and  opened the volume at the page that had last held the interest of its owner&rsquo;s  scholarly mind.</p>
  <p>The  crimson stain completely obscured the print, but Lockwood gazed long at the  defaced page.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;if a crack detective could get anything from  this. There&rsquo;s that Stone, Mercer is always raving over&mdash;I suppose he&rsquo;s terribly  expensive&mdash;yet this strange case might intrigue him&mdash;and yet&mdash;there&rsquo;s Anita to be  considered. If it should turn the tide against her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later  that afternoon, Trask went out again and Lockwood seized his chance.</p>
  <p>Calling  Anita at the Adams house, he said, &ldquo;Listen, dear, you needn&rsquo;t say anything but  yes or no, and then no one will understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  just about come to the conclusion I&rsquo;ll get a clever detective and put him on  the case. I mean a real detective&mdash;in fact, Fleming Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo; Anita&rsquo;s voice was one of utter dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t tell you this way! You said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I did. Well, here, I&rsquo;ll ask questions. Don&rsquo;t you want me to do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  very emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  rather I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much rather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you fear ill effects to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure you&rsquo;re not overestimating the danger of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there&rsquo;s no more to be said. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  hung up the receiver, and turned around to see Trask frowning at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that&rsquo;s the way you and Miss Austin whip the devil around the stump!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the way,&rdquo; returned Lockwood, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  promised not to see you alone&mdash;is this how she keeps the letter of her promise  and breaks it in spirit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  her out of this. I called her up, she did not call me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same. Now, I gather from the interesting talk I overheard that Miss Austin  does not wish to have Fleming Stone take up this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are at liberty to gather anything you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here, Lockwood, you make a mistake when you try to antagonize me. I&rsquo;d be a  better friend to you than an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no reason to want you for either.&rdquo; Lockwood was by no means impertinent, he  merely spoke indifferently. Trask noted this, and went on, more suavely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  my dear Lockwood, what I propose to do now, is to employ Fleming Stone myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  was astounded. At first he was glad, for he felt sure Stone could solve the  whole mystery. But, then, suppose it incriminated Anita, and though Lockwood  was sure of her innocence, he was just enough so to realize that his surety was  largely because of his affection for her. Suppose Stone should prove her to be  the criminal!</p>
  <p>It  couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>He  looked up to find Trask smiling broadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  the reputation of being of an impassive countenance, Lockwood, but to me your  face is as an open book! However, it&rsquo;s only because you are up against a  difficult problem. You want Stone to come, yet you&rsquo;re afraid he&rsquo;ll find out  that Miss Austin is pretty deep in this murder mystery. But I&rsquo;ve made up my  mind, and I think you&rsquo;ll see that any attempt on your part to change my  decision would look bad for Miss Austin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  let her name alone, Trask, or I&rsquo;ll reason with you myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any real right to tell me to leave her name alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you and she engaged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I am concerned, we are. Miss Austin prefers to wait until later to  announce it, but I can answer for her to you in confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s in confidence, all right. Don&rsquo;t fear I&rsquo;ll breathe the news. For, you see,  I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to marry Anita Austin myself; and if Fleming Stone proves  that she is a murderess, I&rsquo;ll marry her all the same. She&rsquo;ll escape  punishment&mdash;what woman doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  look here,&rdquo; Lockwood&rsquo;s manner changed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to get Stone anyway,  why can&rsquo;t we work with each other and not at odds? Whatever else we think or  feel we both want to save Miss Austin all the trouble or distress we can. Let&rsquo;s  be friends, then, and talk things over with Stone, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  on! Then if we see things are going against her, shut him off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes, if we can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course we can. I&rsquo;ve money enough for anything&mdash;even to buy off Fleming Stone. No  man&rsquo;s too big to be bought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean all this exactly as you do, but I do mean this: if Stone can solve  the mystery and clear Anita, let him do it. If he finds her implicated, let it  be understood by him beforehand, he is to cease investigations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trask  thought a minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  goes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Fleming Stone Comes</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Terence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  off for New England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;New  England it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Start  this afternoon, stay a few days, maybe a week among the classic shades of  Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Corinth  it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  somewhat laconic conversation was all that was necessary for Fleming Stone&rsquo;s  assistant and general factotum to make preparations for the trip, achieve  tickets, and arrive, with his chief, at the train gate at the proper time.</p>
  <p>Terence  McGuire, sometimes called Fibsy, because of a certain tendency to mendacity,  had begun as Stone&rsquo;s office boy, and, by virtue of his general aptitude for  detective work and his utter devotion to Stone, had become a worthwhile and  much appreciated assistant. Not only did the lad look after all details of  their trips as well as taking care of the offices, but many times his ingenious  mind so stimulated or aided Stone&rsquo;s own, that more often than not they were  practically colleagues.</p>
  <p>They  had a compartment to themselves at the end of the car, and they were no sooner  started than Stone began to discuss the case with the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know all the details, of course,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a setting after my  own heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I can guess it,&rdquo; put in the wise Fibsy. &ldquo;Man found dead in sealed room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a wizard! What made you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause  that&rsquo;s the problem you like best, F. Stone. Wise me up some more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  further interesting, because the victim is a great and good man, in fact, the  President-elect of the University of Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My!  Somebody didn&rsquo;t want him for president? That the idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently  not. Nothing in the letter about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  relative who inherits the whole estate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  do the job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reason as yet to think so. But the criminal mustn&rsquo;t be guessed at. The point  is, the locked room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was the killing done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed.  No weapon found and no way to get in or out of the locked room. Fine problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if  we don&rsquo;t find a secret stairway&mdash;or, a lying servant. Such cases generally  fizzle out that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibs,  you&rsquo;re a Boy Cassandra.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  explained, for it was his habit to supplement McGuire&rsquo;s very scant education by  bits of information now and then, when time served.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  there&rsquo;s a queer clause in the arrangement,&rdquo; Stone went on, &ldquo;if we find the  evidence leading in a certain direction, the chase is to cease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not, and I&rsquo;ll soon make that clear. But I can&rsquo;t think it will lead in  the given direction as that implicates a young girl, and rarely indeed, have I  found a criminal answering to that description.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t  usual&mdash;but, you know, F. Stone, since the war, girls are so independent and so  cocky that there&rsquo;s no telling what they&rsquo;ll do. Me for the girl&mdash;as a suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fibsy,  you&rsquo;re a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I don&rsquo;t admit it. See here, sir, if they&rsquo;re so &lsquo;fraid s&rsquo;picion will turn  to that girl, there&rsquo;s reason for it. Yet, as you can guess, if she didn&rsquo;t do  it, they want her skirts entirely cleared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty  good deduction so far. But we can&rsquo;t judge rationally until we know the facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  facts were told them, when, some hours later, they sat, alone with Maurice  Trask in the room where John Waring breathed his last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a plain man,&rdquo; Trask said, for he didn&rsquo;t care to pose unduly before an astute  detective. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come into this estate of my cousin&rsquo;s&mdash;my second cousin, he was,  and I started out with a firm determination to find the villain who killed him.  But, there is some cause for suspicion of the young lady I expect to marry. And  here&rsquo;s the situation. If you can solve the mystery of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death,  and free that girl from any taint of blame, go ahead. But if your investigation  leads to her&mdash;stop it. I want to marry her just the same, whether she killed  anybody or not. But if she didn&rsquo;t do it, I want to know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you learn the truth from the young lady herself&mdash;if she is your fiancee?&rdquo; asked  Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she says she didn&rsquo;t do it, of course. But there&rsquo;s such an overwhelming mass of  evidence&mdash;or, apparent evidence against her, that it&rsquo;s the deepest sort of a  mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Main  facts first. Where was the body found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that desk chair, seated at his desk, as he often was evenings. Reading in a  Latin book, so you see, he wasn&rsquo;t looking for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Found  dead in the morning? Been dead all night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  to both those questions. And locked in his room. Had to break in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no weapon about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a sign of any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that cuts out all suicide idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does and it doesn&rsquo;t. You may as well say the locked up room cuts out all idea  of a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it must be one or the other. And isn&rsquo;t it more plausible to look for some way  that the murderer could have gone away and left the room locked, than to think  up a way that the suicide could have disposed of this weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s so, but I want you to investigate both possibilities. You see, if you  could prove a suicide, that would free Miss Austin at once. And&mdash;if things go  against her&mdash;I want you to&mdash;oh, hang it, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do that,&rdquo; said Fibsy, &ldquo;if things go against Miss Austin, you want Mr. Stone to  frame up suicide, and declare it the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  that,&rdquo; and Trask looked relieved at the thought all his cards were on the  table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Miss Austin suspected, but I do want to know if she&rsquo;s  innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  other suspects?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  definite ones. There&rsquo;s the Japanese who absconded that same night, and of  course, there&rsquo;s the secretary, Gordon Lockwood. I&rsquo;d like to suspect him, all  right, and he has a round silver penholder that just fits the wound that killed  Waring. But it doesn&rsquo;t look like he did it, he never would have left the penholder  in evidence, and he would have arranged matters to look more like a suicide.  Then, too, how could he lock the door behind him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  question must be answered first of all,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll examine the room, of  course, but after the local police and detectives have done that, I doubt if I  find anything enlightening. So far as I can see, this whole affair is unique,  and I think we will find some surprising evidence and soon. Tell me more of  this Miss Austin. Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  knows. In fact, they call her Miss Mystery, because so little is known of her.  She appeared here in Corinth from nowhere. She knew no one, and as she began to  make acquaintances somebody brought her over here. She met Doctor Waring, and  inside of twenty-four hours had so bewitched him that it would seem he had her  visiting him in his study late at night. She said at first, she wasn&rsquo;t here,  but as she left the impress of her dress trimmings on that chair-back, and as  she has a ruby pin and a lot of money that were in the Doctor&rsquo;s possession, it  looks, one might say, a bit queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t  the valuables planted on her?&rdquo; put in Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what she says&mdash;or rather, that&rsquo;s one of the things she said. The girl  contradicts herself continually. She says one thing one day and another the  next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she pretty?&rdquo; This from Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty  as the devil! And that&rsquo;s not so bad as a description. She has great big dark  eyes, with straight black brows that almost meet. She has a jaunty little face,  that can be roguish or scornful or merry or pathetic as the little rascal  chooses. She has completely bowled me over, and I&rsquo;d be glad to have her on any  terms and whatever her past history. But, there it is. If she has a clean slate  in this murder business, I want to know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if she hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I don&rsquo;t want anybody else to know it. If you find, Mr. Stone, real evidence  that Anita Austin killed John Waring, or if she confesses to the deed, then you  whip around and prove a suicide, and I&rsquo;ll double your charge. You needn&rsquo;t do  anything wrong, you know. Just sum up that all indications point to a suicide,  and let it go at that. Nobody will arrest Miss Austin if you say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must be crazy, Mr. Trask,&rdquo; returned Stone, coldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t conduct my business  on any such principles as those. I can&rsquo;t perjure myself to save your lady love  from a just condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t seen her yet.&rdquo; Trask nodded his sagacious head. &ldquo;Wait till you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me all the points against her,&rdquo; the detective suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will. I&rsquo;d rather you knew them from me. Not that I&rsquo;ll color them&mdash;they&rsquo;re facts  that speak for themselves, but other people might exaggerate them. Well, to  begin with, this girl, a day or so after she arrived here was seen kissing the  picture of Doctor Waring which she had cut from a newspaper. I tell you this, &lsquo;cause  you&rsquo;ll hear it anyway, and the gossips think it shows a previous acquaintance  between the two. But I hold that as girls have matinee idols and Movie heroes,  this girl might easily have adored the scholarly man, though she had never seen  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is possible,&rdquo; Stone agreed, &ldquo;but not very probable. She denies they were  acquainted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Vows she never saw him until one night she went to his lecture, soon after her  arrival here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is she in Corinth for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  sketch&mdash;she&rsquo;s an artist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  as I said, she must have come here that Sunday night, for one of the boarders  at the house she lives in saw her cross the snowy field. Also, the footprints  just fitted her shoes. Also, the tracks led right up on the side porch here to that  long French window. And led right back again to the Adams house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  Fibsy exploded, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you rubbing it in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s what they tell me&mdash;&rdquo; Trask asserted, doggedly, &ldquo;and I want you to know it  all, Mr. Stone, before the other people tell you a garbled version.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  they say, the girl left marks of her dress trimming on that chair, and  Lockwood, the secretary, rubbed them off next morning, as soon as the body was  discovered. We have the word of two witnesses for this episode.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are the witnesses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ito,  the Japanese butler, and Miss Peyton, who lives in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, ever since the tragedy, Miss Austin has acted queer. Queer in all sorts  of ways. She is sad and desolate one minute, and saucy and independent the  next. I can&rsquo;t make her out at all. And she is more than half in love with this  Lockwood. I have to cut him out, you see. And I figure, if you prove the case  against Miss Austin, and if I agree to marry her and hush up the whole matter,  and make it seem a suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  figure that she&rsquo;ll throw over the secretary for you,&rdquo; cried Fibsy, his eyes  aghast at the man&rsquo;s plan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  that. You see, Mr. Stone, I don&rsquo;t try to deceive you. While I have a natural  sorrow at my cousin&rsquo;s death, yet remember that I never knew him in life, and  that, while I want to avenge his death in any case but one, I do not want to if  it implicates Anita Austin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Stone, seemingly not so shocked at the conversation as his  assistant was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  another queer thing,&rdquo; said Trask. &ldquo;They tell me that when the body was found  there was the impress of a ring on the forehead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  seal ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. Not a finger ring, but a circle, about two inches across, a red mark, as if  it had been made as a sign or symbol of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  remained on the flesh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  the embalming process took place. That removed it. I didn&rsquo;t see it, but I&rsquo;m  told it was a clearly defined circle, quite evidently impressed with some  intent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like a sign of a secret society,&rdquo; Fibsy suggested, but Stone paid no heed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  reconstruct the case,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Waring sat at his desk his secretary outside  in that hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the Japanese, the other one, the one that disappeared, brought in water, and  then Doctor Waring closed the door and locked it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that, but anyway, no one that we know of saw him again alive. Nogi  is under no suspicion, for after he came out of the room, the Doctor rose and  locked the door. Lockwood can&rsquo;t be suspected, as he heard the door locked, and  couldn&rsquo;t get in. He <i>is</i> more or less  suspected because of his penholder, but much as I should like to think him the criminal,  I know he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very honest, Mr. Trask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  because I want the truth. Can you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  still eliminate suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see how I can think it, with no weapon. You say that death was instantaneous&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the doctors agree that it was. Positively he had no chance to hide or dispose  of the instrument of death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why should he? Suicides never make their death seem a murder, though often a  murderer tries to simulate a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  that wasn&rsquo;t done in this case, or the murderer would have left the weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be the very point he neglected. Now, how did the murderer get out? Get  busy, Fibs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  nearly half an hour, the three men searched the room. Had there been any secret  exit, or any concealed passage, it must have been found. Fleming Stone&rsquo;s  knowledge of architecture would not let him overlook any thing of the sort, and  Fibsy&rsquo;s alert eyes and quick wits would have found anything out of the  ordinary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  way out,&rdquo; Stone concluded, finally; &ldquo;and no way of locking a door or a window  after departure from the room. Looks as if the murder theory was as untenable  as the other. No chance of a natural death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a round hole in his jugular vein? No, sir. The doctors here won&rsquo;t stand for  that. Try again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall. I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve had such a baffling, intriguing case, as this  appears to be at first sight. It may resolve itself into a simple problem, but  I can&rsquo;t think so now. Even if it were the work of your Miss Austin&mdash;how did she  get in and out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she got in, all right. Waring let her in, at the French window. Probably that&rsquo;s  when he locked his door. But&mdash;say she killed him&mdash;how did she get out and lock  the room behind her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  couldn&rsquo;t. The window locks are bolts, and could not be shot from outside. For  the moment I see no explanation. It is blank, utter mystery. When can I see  Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  late tonight, tomorrow morning will have to do. But she won&rsquo;t run away. The  police won&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  they can&rsquo;t hold her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are doing so. They claim she was the last one to see the victim alive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she admit that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  she! She admits nothing. You&rsquo;ll get nothing out of that little Sphinx!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, then, Mr. Trask, if you&rsquo;ve finished your tale, suppose you leave me here  to ruminate over this thing, and I&rsquo;ll go up to my room when I wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trask  went off to bed, and Stone and his young assistant sat and looked at each  other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  against it, F. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly am, Fibs. And yet, the thing is so absolutely impossible that there  must be a solution within easy reach. It can&rsquo;t be suicide, with the weapon  gone, and it can&rsquo;t be murder with the room locked up. Now, as it must be either  suicide or murder, then it follows, that either the weapon isn&rsquo;t gone, or the  room isn&rsquo;t locked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t,  you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  wasn&rsquo;t. But I don&rsquo;t yet think that any one disturbed the conditions purposely.  For why would the secretary take away the weapon to make it seem a suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  would if he did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t do it. Trask sees that. The man Trask is a sharp one. He sees all there  is to see, and since there&rsquo;s practically nothing to see that solves the  mystery, he sent for me. It would be a good one on me, Terence, if I have to  give the thing up as unsolvable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t happen, F. Stone, but I&rsquo;m free to confess, I can&rsquo;t see any way to look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next morning, Maurice Trask went over to the Adams house, and brought Miss  Mystery back with him.</p>
  <p>She  came willingly enough, and the interview with the detective took place in the  room of the tragedy itself.</p>
  <p>Stone  noticed that the girl showed no horror or distaste of the scene, and even sat  in the chair he placed for her, which was the same plush-covered one that had  received the tell-tale imprints.</p>
  <p>Fleming  Stone regarded Miss Austin curiously. Not only was her beauty all that Trask  had described it, but there was an added quality of fineness, a trace of high  mentality, that naturally enough Maurice Trask quite overlooked.</p>
  <p>At  first glance, Stone&rsquo;s thought was&mdash;&rdquo;That child commit murder? Never!&rdquo; But a few  moments later, he was not quite so sure of his negation.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  just sat and looked at her. He had no occasion to speak, unless addressed, so,  in silence he merely let his eyes feast on the piquant face with its ever  changing expressions.</p>
  <p>After  casual questions, Stone said directly, &ldquo;Did you know Doctor Waring before you  came to Corinth, Miss Austin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she said, a little hesitantly; &ldquo;I had heard of him, but I had never before seen  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  had you heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was much in the papers about his election.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that interested you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  specially,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden accession of hauteur.</p>
  <p>And  thereupon, she became a most unsatisfactory witness. She listened to Stone&rsquo;s  questions with an absent-minded air, answered in monosyllables, or by a  movement of her head. She even gave a side smile to Fibsy, which, though it  amazed him, also filled him with a strange exultant joy, and made him her  abject slave at once.</p>
  <p>Stone  went on, drawling out a string of unimportant questions in a monotonous voice,  and at length, he said, in the same unimportant way,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when you saw Doctor Waring that night, was there a red ring on his forehead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Miss Austin, and then, suddenly awakening to what she had done, she cried  impetuously, &ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  smiled gravely. &ldquo;You were here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now let us talk about what happened  during your visit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  interruption was caused by a tap at the closed door.</p>
  <p>Impatiently,  Trask rose and went to the door. It was Ito, bringing a telegram for Miss  Austin. It had arrived at the Adams house, and had been sent over.</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery read it, with great difficulty controlled her agitation, as she quickly  went to the blazing log fire and dropped the paper in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Skip  over to the Telegraph office and get a copy,&rdquo; said Stone quietly, and Fibsy  obeyed.</p>
  <p>Then  to Miss Austin&rsquo;s continued distress, Stone read the message aloud. It was from  San Francisco, and it said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  own up and tell the whole truth. I have annexed Carl.&rdquo; It was signed merely &ldquo;A&rdquo;  and apparently it was of dire import to its recipient. Miss Mystery sat silent,  and wide-eyed in desperation, as she looked hopelessly from one to another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think,&rdquo; said Stone, not unkindly, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d better follow A&rsquo;s advice and  make a clean breast of the whole matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    Miss Mystery&rsquo;s Testimony</b></h2>
  <p>Miss  Mystery looked from Stone&rsquo;s impassive face to Fibsy&rsquo;s eager boyish countenance.  Then she looked at Maurice Trask.</p>
  <p>The  latter showed deepest sympathy and interest but Trask also had a wary air, as  if ready to interrupt any disclosures that might be damaging to the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  of all,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;who sent you that telegram from San Francisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The calm little face was as expressionless as Stone&rsquo;s own, and she  made her statement as straightforwardly as if it had been true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; Stone spoke severely now, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s to your own advantage to adopt a more  amenable manner. You will not help your cause by prevarication or evasion.  Unless you will answer my questions truly, I must find out these things for  myself. I can do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can find out who sent that telegram, go ahead,&rdquo; she flared at him. &ldquo;I tell  you I don&rsquo;t know who sent it, and I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;A&rsquo; is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know who she is,&rdquo; said Fibsy, and then Anita&rsquo;s quick, startled glance proved to  the boy that his little ruse was successful and he had at least guessed the sex  of the sender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman,&rdquo; the astute lad mused, &ldquo;and she has annexed Carl. Maybe Carl is another  name for that escaped Japanese. But it&rsquo;s all so far away. How can they conduct  operations between here and California!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; Stone tried to win her confidence, &ldquo;believe me I am most anxious to  help you. Please tell me why you came over here that Sunday night. It is  utterly useless to deny that you did come, now tell me why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anita  looked baffled, but after a moment&rsquo;s pause, she said, &ldquo;Do you think I killed  Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in Fibsy, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Now, come across, Miss  Austin, and I&rsquo;ll bet you F. Stone can dope out the whole game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know most of the circumstances already,&rdquo; Stone smiled, and followed up the  small advantage he had gained. &ldquo;You came over here late, secretly, across the  snowy field. Doctor Waring let you in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Anita breathed the word, and her starry eyes never left Stone&rsquo;s face. She  seemed almost hypnotized.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you sat down in the chair you&rsquo;re in now, and he locked the door&mdash;why did he do  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t! Stop! You have no right to torment me like this! I have  counsel&mdash;Mr. Trask here is my lawyer. Let him tell me what to do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  nerves were tense, and her little fingers were continually twisting round  themselves. Her face was agonized, and Stone felt as if he were guilty of utter  cruelty. But he must go on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Trask cannot tell what he does not know,&rdquo; he said, coldly. &ldquo;I am in authority,  you must answer me. Did Doctor Waring give you the money and the ruby pin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  gifts. Why does any one give presents?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he loved you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Anita&rsquo;s voice dropped to a softer tone, her eyes had a faraway look, and her  sensitive little mouth quivered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you had known him but a few days! You had never seen him before you came to  Corinth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that a strange admission? How could he become so infatuated in so short a time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you never heard of such a thing?&rdquo; the face was almost roguish now, and the dark  eyes showed a hint of smile.</p>
  <p>Stone  was baffled. He gazed at this strange young person, who was either fooling him  to the top of her bent or was a helpless, harassed child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Doctor Waring related to you?&rdquo; he asked, with a sudden new idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. He was no relation. I tell you I never met him before I came here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he gave you the valuables?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did. I&rsquo;ll swear to that&mdash;though I have no witness to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you accepted them! Accepted a large sum of money and a pin set with a precious  stone from a man you scarcely knew! A man engaged to be married! A man of twice  your own age! You must admit this calls for explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does it? Hadn&rsquo;t he a right to give me those things if he chose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute, Miss Austin. You loved him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  if you did, do you want his name stained, his memory blotted by an act that is,  to say the least, questionable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he did give them to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  you can say more clearly why he did so I&rsquo;m not sure I can believe you. Did you  ask for them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  disclaimer sounded true, but Stone began to think she was a consummate little  actress as well as a clever falsifier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, after a short pause, &ldquo;I may as well tell you, Miss Austin, that I am  here to solve this mystery. That I am not at all satisfied that you are telling  me the truth; that, therefore, I shall have to seek the truth elsewhere. I will  tell you, too, that I don&rsquo;t want to implicate you, that I should much prefer to  keep your name out of it all, but that you leave me no choice but to go ahead  with my investigations wherever they may lead. A few more questions and you may  go. What was Doctor Waring doing when you came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he  was sitting at his desk.&rdquo; She looked troubled at Stone&rsquo;s speech and seemed half  inclined to be more friendly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw him through the French window, before you came in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the window has a silk curtain, but I saw him between the edge of the silk and  the window sash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he reading?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there were books on the desk, but he was not reading.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  rose and let you in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had sent for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that  is, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  spoke truly the first time. He did not send for you and you came of your own  accord. Was he surprised to see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did he say? What was his first word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know. He said&mdash;&rsquo;Anita! You!&rsquo;&mdash;or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kissed you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  And then a sudden wave of crimson spread over the scared little face. It was  evident she had not voluntarily made the admission. It had slipped out as her  memory was busy with the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it! Mr. Trask, save me from this  terrible man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Maurice  Trask sitting near her, held out his hand, and Miss Mystery took it. It seemed  to reassure her, and she said, &ldquo;Remember, you&rsquo;re my lawyer. Don&rsquo;t let him  question me any more. Tell him things yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he doesn&rsquo;t know things&mdash;&rdquo; said Stone, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let him make them up! I refuse to stand this persecution. I didn&rsquo;t kill that  man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Stone feared if he let her go now, he would lose his  chance, &ldquo;since you are admittedly the last person who is known to have seen  Doctor Waring alive, you cannot avoid, or evade the strictest questioning. You  were here,&rdquo; he spoke very gravely, &ldquo;late at night. Next morning he was found  dead. There are no footprints in the snow but your own. There was no other way  into the room. Therefore, you are responsible for his death or&mdash;you know who is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  I&mdash;must I be convicted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  tone was heartbroken, her strained little face piteous in its appeal. But Stone  did not believe in her. He had concluded she was entirely capable of pulling  wool over her questioners&rsquo; eyes, and he watched her keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say you must,&rdquo; he returned deliberately, &ldquo;but I say you may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  declared Trask. &ldquo;You know what I told you, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you know that I refused to accept your terms. I shall carry this matter through  to the end. I do not say I think Miss Austin guilty of crime, but I do say she  knows all about the death of Doctor Waring and she must be made to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  I say I&mdash;he killed himself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  your stiletto?&rdquo; asked Stone, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then you took the stiletto home and hid it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  shield his memory. Suicide is a coward&rsquo;s act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  Fibsy exploded, unable to keep quiet any longer. &ldquo;I say, Miss Mystery, you <i>are</i> a mystery! Why don&rsquo;t you tell what  you know. It&rsquo;s up to you. Here you were with the victim, shortly before his  death, you probably know all about what happened. By the way, how did you get  out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out  the same way I came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  bolted that window-door behind you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;no&mdash;well,  you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see you are not to say another word, Miss Austin,&rdquo; Trask decreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very  sorry I asked Mr. Stone to take up this case. However, I shall take you home  now, then I&rsquo;ll come back and I hope I can persuade Mr. Stone to discontinue his  work. If I&rsquo;d had any idea of these disclosures you&rsquo;ve made, I never should have  engaged his services. Come, Anita, I will take you home. Mr. Stone, await my  return. I shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two went, and Stone, pacing up and down the long room said musingly, &ldquo;All  centers round that girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo;  said Fibsy, &ldquo;but she didn&rsquo;t kill the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  trouble is, Terence, your saying that doesn&rsquo;t make it so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but its being so makes me say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood came in, his face full of anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to see you alone for a moment, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw Trask taking  Miss Austin home. Now, tell me, please, can you get at the truth about that  girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t as yet. She&rsquo;s as great a mystery as the death of Doctor Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is. But I have every faith in her. She is the victim of some delusion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delusion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I mean she&rsquo;s under a mistaken sense of duty to somebody, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;State  your meaning more definitely, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure that I can. But I&rsquo;m positive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  now, Mr. Lockwood,&rdquo; this from Fibsy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re positive the young lady is an  angel of light, because you&rsquo;re head over heels in love with her. That&rsquo;s all  right, and I don&rsquo;t blame you&mdash;but, take it from me, you&rsquo;ll prove your case  quicker, better and more surely, if you investigate the secret of Miss Mystery,  than if you just go around babbling about her innocence and purity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked at the boy, ready to resent his impudence. But Fibsy&rsquo;s serious face and  honest eyes carried conviction and the secretary at once took him for an ally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, McGuire,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and, I for one am not afraid of the result of a  thorough investigation of Miss Austin&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  reason to be, though,&rdquo; Stone observed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure, of course, but many  stray hints and bits of evidence, to my mind point to Miss Austin&rsquo;s close  connection with the whole matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your theory as to the death, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Lockwood asked. &ldquo;Suicide or murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honestly,  I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m quite ready to form an opinion when I get some real evidence.  I&rsquo;m through questioning Miss Austin&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let her go otherwise. I  want next to do a lot of further questioning. And I&rsquo;d very much like to get  hold of that servant, Nogi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think he&rsquo;s implicated?&rdquo; Lockwood stared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  else would he run away? He must be found. He is probably the key to the whole  situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  and maybe not. If he and Miss Austin were in collusion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon, Mr. Stone, but I cannot have any thing said in my presence  that reflects on that young lady&rsquo;s good name. We are engaged to be married&mdash;that  is, I consider myself bound to her, and hope to win her full consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I understood&mdash;I thought, Trask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Trask wants to marry her, but I hardly think his suit will succeed. The lady  must decide, of course, but I have reason to hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gee,  Mr. Lockwood, &lsquo;course she&rsquo;ll take you,&rdquo; Fibsy informed him, &ldquo;now, let&rsquo;s you and  me get busy to find out Miss Mystery&rsquo;s mystery. You ought to know it, if you&rsquo;re  going to marry her&mdash;and too, you can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s anything that can&rsquo;t stand  the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can it be?&rdquo; Lockwood asked, helplessly. &ldquo;How can a young girl like that have a  real secret that so pervades and surrounds her whole life that she will give no  hint of it? Who is she? What is she? Why is she here? I don&rsquo;t believe she came  here merely to sketch in water colors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  agreed Stone. &ldquo;If that were all, why the mystery about her home and family? I  understand she has given several contradictory statements as to where she  really lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has,&rdquo; assented Lockwood. &ldquo;But may it not be just a twist of her humorous  nature? I assure you she is roguishly inclined&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  it isn&rsquo;t a joke,&rdquo; Fibsy said, frowning at the thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a real  secret, a mystery that means a whole lot to her,&mdash;and prob&rsquo;ly to other people.  Well, F. Stone, I guess it&rsquo;s up to me to go out and seek her people.&rdquo; He sighed  deeply. &ldquo;I hate to leave the seat of war, but I gotta do it. Nobody else could  ever ferret out the antecedents and general family doings of Miss Mystery but  Yours Truly. And this is no idle boast. I&rsquo;m going out for the goods and I&rsquo;ll  fetch home the bacon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked glum at the prospect, for it looked like no easy or simple matter that  he proposed to undertake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that girl is stubborn&mdash;my, but she&rsquo;s stubborn. You&rsquo;ll have a  handful, Mr. Lockwood. But if so be&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re willing to face the revelations, I&rsquo;ll  go and dig &lsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do you think you&rsquo;ll go, Terence?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  California, F. S., of course. Didn&rsquo;t that telegram come from there? All I&rsquo;ve  got to do is to find &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Carl&rsquo; that she &lsquo;annexed&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s your mystery  of the young lady solved. But the death of the Doctor&mdash;that&rsquo;s another thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really mean this?&rdquo; Lockwood said, staring at Fibsy. &ldquo;How can you find a  needle in a haystack, like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve gotta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s so much simpler to get the information from Miss Austin herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  call that simple!&rdquo; Fibsy looked at him. &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s easier to go to  Mars, I should say, than to get any real information out of that little scrap  of waywardness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  nothing can be learned from her,&rdquo; said Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  shall I be off?&rdquo; asked Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  twenty-four hours, my lad, and then if we&rsquo;re no further along, I suppose you&rsquo;ll  have to go. Nogi must be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad Mr. Trask called you in, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Lockwood said, slowly, &ldquo;but I do hope  you won&rsquo;t associate any thought of Miss Austin with the crime. She could no  more commit crime than a small kitten could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancy you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; and Stone, half absent-mindedly, &ldquo;but opinions as to what  people can or can&rsquo;t do, are of not much real use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you a theory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have a theory, but the facts don&rsquo;t fit it&mdash;and it seems as if they could not  be made to. Yet it&rsquo;s a good theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t care to tell it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I&rsquo;m willing to do so. My theory is that John Waring committed suicide, but I  can&rsquo;t make any facts bear me out. You see, it&rsquo;s not only the absence of a  weapon, but all absence of motive, and even of opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  he had opportunity&mdash;in here alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be opportunity if he had no implement handy. And nothing can explain away  the missing weapon, and the locked room, on the suicide theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can explain the locked room, on a murder theory?&rdquo; Lockwood asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t thought of anything as yet. What book was Doctor Waring reading that  night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  were several on his desk, but the one that was found nearest the body, the one  stained with blood, is a copy of Martial&rsquo;s Epigrams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I see it, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  brought the book and Fleming Stone examined it carefully. It was not a rare or  finely bound edition, it seemed more a working copy or a book for reference. It  was printed in Latin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was fond of Martial?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a reader of all the classics. He preferred them, of course, in their  original Latin or Greek. He was also a modern linguist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  opened the volume to the stained page, which was numbered 87. He studied it  closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all Greek to me,&rdquo; he said, frowning, &ldquo;even though it&rsquo;s Latin, but I hoped to  read something on the page beside the printed text.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>However,  the irregularly shaped red blur gave him no clue, and he returned the book to  Lockwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  the Doctor any private accounts?&rdquo; the detective asked suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of,&rdquo; replied the secretary. &ldquo;He was a man of singularly few  secrets, and I was always at liberty to open all letters, and had free access  to his desk and safe. I never knew him to hide or secrete a paper of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  harm in looking,&rdquo; Stone said, and began forthwith to search the desk drawers  and compartments.</p>
  <p>The  search was fruitless, until at length, a small checkbook was found.</p>
  <p>And  a curious revelation it gave them. For of its blank checks but one had been  torn out, and the remaining stub gave the information that it was a check for  ten thousand dollars drawn to the order of Anita Austin.</p>
  <p>Those  who looked at it stared incredulously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is dated,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;the date that Doctor Waring died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was. Had this too, been given to the strange young woman, whom Stone was  beginning to designate to himself by the title of adventuress? Was it possible  that young girl, who seemed scarce more than a child, had some how maneuvered  to get all this from a man whom she had deliberately fascinated and infatuated?</p>
  <p>It  was incredible&mdash;yet what else could be assumed?</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood looked deeply distressed. His lips set in a tight line, and he said,  through his clenched teeth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care! Nothing can shake my faith in that girl! She is blameless, and only  these misleading circumstances make you think otherwise, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective looked at him as one might regard a hopeless lunatic.</p>
  <p>But  young McGuire&rsquo;s face was a study.</p>
  <p>He  looked horror-stricken and then dazed. Then he had an inspiration apparently,  for he smiled broadly&mdash;only to lapse again into a profound gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it ain&rsquo;t the beatin&rsquo;est!&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Whatcha make of it, F. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  completely staggered for the moment. Fibs,&rdquo; the detective returned, &ldquo;but these  cumulative evidences of Miss Mystery&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;acquisitive disposition, seem&mdash;I say <i>seem</i> to lead to a suspicion of her undue  influence over Doctor Waring, at least, as to obtaining money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lockwood fairly groaned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame her! Perhaps Waring fell a  victim to her beauty and grace, and perhaps he urged these gifts upon her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  Fibsy said; &ldquo;perhaps he threatened to kill her if she didn&rsquo;t accept his checks  and coin and rubies!&mdash;and maybe she had to kill him in self-defense&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Self-defense!&rdquo;  Lockwood cried, grasping at any straw. &ldquo;Could it have been that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Stone said; &ldquo;be rational, man, whatever made Anita Austin kill Doctor Waring,  it wasn&rsquo;t a case of self-defense.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    Planning An Elopement</b></h2>
  <p>There  was some sort of telepathy or some subconscious impulse that made Anita Austin  open her bedroom door in response to a light tap, although she had resolved to  talk to nobody just then.</p>
  <p>But  when she saw Gordon Lockwood she was glad she had, and, without waiting for an  invitation he stepped inside the room and closed the door.</p>
  <p>He  looked at her with a face full of compassion and love, but he spoke as one who  must attend to an important business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita,&rdquo;  he said, speaking very low, &ldquo;the crisis has come. They have learned of the  check Doctor Waring gave you that night, and it is the last straw. Stone is  already, I think, convinced of your guilt, and that young chap, McGuire, will  get at the bottom of everything, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Check?  What do you mean?&rdquo; Miss Mystery said, with a blank look on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  equivocate with me, dear.&rdquo; Lockwood laid his hand gently on hers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no  time now to tell you of my love, as I want to tell it. Now, we can only assume  that it is all told, that we are engaged, and that we are to be married at  once. We are going to elope, Anita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Elope!&rdquo;  she stared at him, but her eyes grew soft and her pale cheeks flushed. &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t a pretty word,&rdquo; Gordon smiled, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the only thing to do, you see.  If you stay here, you&rsquo;ll be arrested. If you go, I go with you. So&mdash;we both go,  and that makes it an elopement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Gordon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Anita&mdash;answer me just one question&mdash;do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  with an adorable upward glance and smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  than you loved Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their  eyes met. Lockwood&rsquo;s usually inscrutable face was desperately eager, and his  deep eyes showed smouldering passion. He held her by the shoulders, he looked  steadily at her, awaiting her answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, at last, her lovely lips quivering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all I want to know!&rdquo; he whispered, triumphantly, as he kissed the scarlet lips,  and drew the slender form into his embrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must know more&mdash;&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;and&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t tell you. Oh, Gordon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  hid her face on his broad shoulder, and he gently stroked her hair, as he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell me anything now, dearest. Don&rsquo;t ever tell me, unless you choose. And,  anyway, I know it all. I know you had never known the Doctor before, and I&rsquo;ll  tell you how I know. I found in his scrap basket a note to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  note to me!&rdquo; Fresh terror showed in the dark eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;don&rsquo;t  mind. No one else ever saw it. I burned it. But it said, &lsquo;Darling Anita. Since  you came into my life, life is worth living&rsquo;&mdash;or something like that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When&mdash;when  did he write that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime  on that fatal Sunday. I suppose after he met you in the afternoon, and before  you came that evening. Remember, Sweetheart, if ever you want to tell me all  about that late visit to him, do so. But, if not, I never shall ask or expect  you to. But that&rsquo;s all in the future&mdash;our dear future, which we shall spend  together&mdash;together, Anita! Are you glad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so glad!&rdquo; and the soft arms crept round his neck and Miss Mystery gave him a kiss  that thrilled his very soul. &ldquo;Will you take care of me, Gordon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  care of you, my little love! Take care of you, is it? Just give me the chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have a pretty big chance, right now,&rdquo; a smiling face reached up to his.  &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; she seemed suddenly to recollect something, &ldquo;about a check&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t  give me a check&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  laid a hand over her mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  dearest. Don&rsquo;t tell me things that aren&rsquo;t&mdash;aren&rsquo;t so. I saw the stub&mdash;a check for  ten thousand dollars&mdash;made out to Anita Austin, and dated that very Sunday. Now,  hush&mdash;&rdquo; as she began to speak, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no time to talk these things over. I tell  you the police are on your track. They will come here, they will arrest you&mdash;try  to get that in your head. I am going to save you&mdash;first, for your own sweet  sake, and also for my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Gordon, wait a minute. Do you believe I killed John Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me that, Anita. And, truly, I don&rsquo;t know whether I believe it or not. I  know you have told falsehoods, I know you were there that night, I know of his  letter to you, of the check and of the ruby pin and the money. But I&mdash;no, I do  not know that you killed him. There are many other theories possible&mdash;there&rsquo;s  Nogi&mdash;but, my darling, it all makes no difference. I love you, I want you,  whatever the circumstances or conditions of your life, or your deeds. I love  you so, that I want you even if you are a criminal&mdash;for in that case, I want to  protect and save you. Now, don&rsquo;t tell me you did or didn&rsquo;t kill the man, for&mdash;&rdquo;  he gave her a whimsical smile, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe you in either case! I&rsquo;ve not  much opinion of your veracity, and, too, it&rsquo;s too big a matter to talk about now.  Of course I don&rsquo;t believe you killed him! You, my little love! And yet, the  evidence is so overpowering that I&mdash;believe you did kill him! There, how&rsquo;s that  for a platform? Now, let all those things be, and get ready to go away with me.  I tell you we&rsquo;re going to elope and mighty quickly too. The difficulty is, to  get away unseen. But it must be done. Pack a small handbag&mdash;a very small one. I&rsquo;ll  plan our way out&mdash;and if we can make a getaway under the noses of Stone and his  boy, we&rsquo;ll soon be all right. I&rsquo;ve a friend who will motor us to a nearby town,  where a dear old minister, who has known and loved me from boyhood, will marry  us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  he know about&mdash;about me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  little girl, leave all the details of this thing to me. Don&rsquo;t bother your  lovely head about it. It will be all right&mdash;trust me&mdash;if we can escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it right for me to go? Oughtn&rsquo;t I stay and&mdash;what do they call it? give myself  up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita,  if I didn&rsquo;t love you so, I&rsquo;d scold you, hard! Now, you obey your future lord  and master, and get ready for a hurry-up wedding, I&rsquo;m sorry that you can&rsquo;t have  bridesmaids and choir boys&mdash;but, you&rsquo;ll pardon me, I know, if I remind you that  that isn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery looked up and broke into laughter. Truly, she was a mystery! Her gayety  was as spontaneous and merry as if she had never heard of crime or tragedy.</p>
  <p>Lockwood  gazed at her curiously, and then nodded his handsome head, as he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  do, Anita! You&rsquo;re a little bit of all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  in a moment her mood changed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gordon,  we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;We never can get away from this house&mdash;let alone  the detectives. Miss Bascom is on continual watch and Mrs. Adams&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, dear. That&rsquo;s it. I thought if you could manage that part, I&rsquo;d see to  evading the Stone faction. Can&rsquo;t you think up a plan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  will find a way,&rdquo; she whispered, and unable to resist the inviting smile,  Gordon again caught her in his arms, and held her close in an ecstasy of  possession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are so sweet,&rdquo; he murmured, with an air of saying something important. &ldquo;Oh, my  Little Girl, how I love you! The moment I first saw you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  night at&mdash;at the Doctor&rsquo;s lectures. I sat behind you, I changed my seat to do  so&mdash;and I counted the buttons on your dear little gray frock&mdash;that was one way I  discovered your presence in the study that night.&rdquo; He spoke gravely now. &ldquo;And  there was another way. I heard you talking. Yes, I heard your blessed  voice&mdash;remember, I loved you then&mdash;and I heard Waring talking to you. I could  make out no word&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t try&mdash;but now I wish I had&mdash;for it might help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you had, Gordon,&rdquo; she returned, solemnly, &ldquo;it would have helped me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can tell me, dear, tell me all the conversation. Surely you trust me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust you&mdash;but&mdash;oh, as you say, there&rsquo;s no time. It&rsquo;s a long story&mdash;a dreadful  story&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you shan&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve promised you that, you know. Not until you want to tell me,  will I ask for a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  here&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; and Anita blushed, deeply, &ldquo;if we go away&mdash;as you  say&mdash;what about&mdash;about money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lockwood  stared at her. &ldquo;I have money,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;why do you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but  the awful detective people&mdash;said you&mdash;you were terribly in debt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brave  little girl, to say that. I know you hated to. Well, my darling, those precious  bills that those precious detectives dug up in my desk, are old bills that were  owed by my father&mdash;his name was the same as mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same as yours! How queer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not a unique instance. Anyway, those bills I am paying off as I can. I&rsquo;m not  legally responsible for them, but I want to clear my dad&rsquo;s name, and all that.  Now, all that can wait&mdash;while I take unto me a wife, and arrange for her comfort  and convenience. But, is there&mdash;now remember, I&rsquo;m not prying&mdash;is there any one  whose permission you must ask to marry me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m twenty-one&mdash;that&rsquo;s of age in any state.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you aged person! I deemed you about eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  you goosie! But&mdash;your mother, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;my  mother. She doesn&rsquo;t care what I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your father? Forgive me, but I have to ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  come along. Let&rsquo;s begin to get ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute&mdash;Gordon&mdash;to get married&mdash;must I&mdash;must I tell my real name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  eyes clouded a trifle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear heart,&rdquo; he said, very gently, &ldquo;yes, you must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I can&rsquo;t get married, Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Mystery sat down and folded her little hands in her lap, her whole attitude  that of utter despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Sweetheart, no one need know except the minister and witnesses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t marry you, anyway. I can&rsquo;t marry anybody. I can&rsquo;t tell who I am! Oh,  let them take me away, and let them arrest me and I hope they&rsquo;ll convict  me&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  my precious girl, hush.&rdquo; Lockwood took her in his arms, and let her stifle her  sobs on his breast. He was bewildered. What was the truth about this strange  child? For in her abandonment of grief, Anita seemed a very child, a tortured  irresponsible soul, whose only haven was in the arms now around her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will go with me, anyway, Anita,&rdquo; he said, with an air of authority. &ldquo;I must  take care of you. We will go, as I planned. The minister I told you of, is a  great and good man, he will advise you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I don&rsquo;t want to talk to a minister!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do. And his wife is a dear good woman. They will take you into their hearts  and home&mdash;and then we can all decide what to do. At any rate, you must get away  from here. Come, now, pack your bag&mdash;and would you mind&mdash;Anita&mdash;if I ask you not  to take the&mdash;the money and the ruby pin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he gave them to me! I tell you, Gordon, John Waring gave me those of his own  free will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of his affection for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  for no other reason! I will keep the pin, anyway&mdash;I will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita,  have you any idea how you puzzle me? how you torture me? Well, take what you  like. Will you get ready now, and I will let you know as soon as I can, how and  when we can start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  loud rap was followed by an immediate opening of the door, and Mrs. Adams came  into the room.</p>
  <p>She  stared at Lockwood, but made no comment on his presence there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Austin,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I do not wish you to stay in my house any longer. I have  kept you until now, because my husband was so sorry for you, and refused to  turn you out. Nor am I turning you out, but&mdash;I wish you would leave us alone,  Mr. Lockwood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  started to speak, but Anita interrupted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,  please,&rdquo; she said, quietly, and Lockwood obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot blame you, Mrs. Adams,&rdquo; Miss Mystery said; &ldquo;I daresay you have to  consider your other boarders, and I thank you for your kindness and forbearance  you have shown me so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  tears were in the big dark eyes, and even as they moved Mrs. Adams to sympathy,  she also wondered if they were real. &ldquo;A girl who would redden her lips would be  capable of any deceit and duplicity,&rdquo; Esther Adams reasoned.</p>
  <p>But  she went on, calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  come now, Miss Austin, to tell you that Mr. Trask is down stairs and wants to  see you. He wants you to go to his house to stay. The Peytons are there, of  course, and he offers you the shelter of his roof and protection until this  dreadful matter is settled up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Trask!&rdquo; Anita looked her amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  now don&rsquo;t be silly. You very well know he is mad about you, and he hopes to get  you freed and then marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he does!&rdquo; It was the old, scornful Miss Mystery who spoke. &ldquo;Well, will you  please tell him from me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  don&rsquo;t you be too hoity-toity, miss! You&rsquo;re mighty lucky to have a home offered  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s quite true. Well, Mrs. Adams, will you go down, then and say I&rsquo;ll be  down in a moment or two. Give me time to freshen my appearance a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  with paints and powders and cosmetics!&rdquo; Esther Adams grumbled to herself, as  she went down the stairs.</p>
  <p>As  a matter of fact she quite misjudged the girl. Very rarely did Anita resort to  artificial aid of that sort, but when she so desired, she used it as she would  any other personal adornment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  coming down,&rdquo; Mrs. Adams announced, as she returned to Trask and they waited.</p>
  <p>But  when the minutes grew to a quarter of an hour, and then nearly to a half, Mrs.  Adams again climbed the stairs to hasten proceedings.</p>
  <p>This  time she found the room empty.</p>
  <p>The  absence, too, of brushes and combs, the disappearance of a small suitcase, and  the fact that her hat and coat were gone all pointed unmistakably to the  assumption that the girl had fled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  Mrs. Adams reported, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s lit out, bag and baggage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;  exclaimed Trask in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she isn&rsquo;t in her room. Her trunk is locked and strapped and her suitcase is  missing. Her hat and coat&rsquo;s gone, too, so you can make your own guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Maurice Trask didn&rsquo;t stay there to make his guess.</p>
  <p>He  went back home as fast as he could and told Fleming Stone the news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run  away, has she?&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;I rather looked for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did! And took no steps to prevent it! You&rsquo;re a nice detective, you are. Well,  if you&rsquo;re so smart, where&rsquo;d she go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Lockwood?&rdquo; was Stone&rsquo;s laconic response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lockwood!&rdquo;  exclaimed Trask. &ldquo;Wherever he is, he hasn&rsquo;t run off with Anita Austin! If he  has&mdash;by Jove, I&rsquo;ll break every bone in his body!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to catch him first,&rdquo; smiled the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  catch him! I&rsquo;ll set you to do it. And, looky here, if she&rsquo;s gone off with that  man, you can go ahead and catch her, catch them both, and then go ahead and  prove her guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she? You bet she is! And I know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you. I know her eyebrows!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I know her eyebrows. But they don&rsquo;t tell me she&rsquo;s a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  they tell me that! It&rsquo;s this way. Her eyebrows, are not only heavy and dark,  but they almost meet over the bridge of her nose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Darling  nose!&rdquo; put in Fibsy, who was interested in Anita but not in Trask&rsquo;s deductions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  your knowledge of physiognomy tell you that those meeting eyebrows are a sign  of a criminal?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of that sort. But they are the Truesdell brows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Truesdell brows?&rdquo; Stone raised his own. &ldquo;Sounds like a proprietary article. Not  artificial, are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  see here, Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;m in no mood to be guyed. Those eyebrows are frequently  seen in the Truesdell family. My grandfather&rsquo;s brother married a Truesdell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  grandfather&rsquo;s brother married a Truesdell. And your own grandfather didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I haven&rsquo;t those brows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you&rsquo;re not entitled to them, having no Truesdell blood in your veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that girl has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Interesting, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw,  come off that line o&rsquo; talk, F. S.,&rdquo; said Fibsy, knitting his brows, which were  not Truesdellian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seein&rsquo; a chink o&rsquo; light. The brother of your  grandfather, now, Mr. Trask, he was named&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waring,  of course. Henry Waring. My grandfather was James Waring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this Henry Waring&mdash;he was the father of Doctor John Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Fibsy said this, Stone sat upright, and gazed hard at Trask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  John Waring&rsquo;s father was Henry, and my grandfather was Henry&rsquo;s brother James.  That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m related. And being the only one, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m the heir here.  But, don&rsquo;t you see, Doctor Waring&rsquo;s mother was a Truesdell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Austin is a relative of hers&mdash;a connection of the Truesdell family somehow&mdash;&rdquo;  exclaimed the now excited Fibsy, &ldquo;and she found out about it, and came here  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Trask said, &ldquo;and tried to get some money from John Waring on the ground of  relationship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  relation could she be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  a niece of Doctor Waring&mdash;or a cousin. Maybe the same relation to Doctor Waring&rsquo;s  mother that I am to his father. Then, that would explain his giving her money  and the pin&mdash;and maybe she burnt the will! and then she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it complicates everything,&rdquo; said Stone, who was thinking quickly. &ldquo;However, if  Miss Austin is connected with the Truesdell family it gives us a way to look to  learn her history.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  learn it,&rdquo; said Trask, abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of losing my inheritance for I&rsquo;m  in the direct Waring line and she can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    Miss Mystery No Longer</b></h2>
  <p>Trask,  helped along by Fleming Stone, investigated the family tree of the Warings. But  they ran up against a blank wall. As far as they could learn Doctor Waring  never had brother or sister. His mother, who was a Truesdell, had also been an  only child. But of course, Miss Mystery could be of the Truesdell family, and  could, as Trask observed, be the same relation to John Waring&rsquo;s mother that  Trask was to John Waring&rsquo;s father. Which relation was that of second cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  gives a reason for the girl&rsquo;s presence here,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;and as it&rsquo;s the only  reason we can think of, it must be followed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I&rsquo;ll follow it up,&rdquo; Trask said, &ldquo;if I once get hold of that girl. Where can she  be, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very far away, I think, as all the stations and routes out of town are watched.  She&rsquo;d have trouble to leave Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  could get out in a motor car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d  take her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lockwood,  of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  just then, Gordon Lockwood came into the Waring study. His usual calm was  entirely gone, his eyes wildly staring and his voice quivered as he said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  gone! Anita&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it&mdash;I thought you went with her!&rdquo; and Stone stared in turn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lockwood said, quite unnecessarily. &ldquo;Find her, Mr. Stone&mdash;you can,  can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can find her,&rdquo; said Fibsy, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll tell me one thing, Mr. Lockwood, right  straight out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it? I&rsquo;ll tell you anything. I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  afraid she&rsquo;s killed herself,&rdquo; said Fibsy, calmly. &ldquo;Well you tell me this. Are  you two&mdash;aw&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy blushed, and Stone smiled a little as he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;McGuire  is a bit shy of romantic matters. He means are you and Miss Austin lovers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are,&rdquo; said Lockwood, emphatically. &ldquo;She is my fiancee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Fibsy, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll find her. She hasn&rsquo;t done anything rash, in that  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  wagged his wise little head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she?&rdquo; Stone asked, confident that the boy could tell. He knew of Fibsy&rsquo;s  almost clairvoyant powers of divining truth in certain situations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Want  her here?&rdquo; he asked, laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Snatching  his cap, he darted from the house, but he was closely followed by Maurice  Trask. Lockwood would have stopped Trask, but Stone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  him go. This thing is coming to a crisis&mdash;Trask will help it along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  went toward the Adams house, but stopped at the house next door to it. This was  the home of Emily Bates.</p>
  <p>Ringing  that lady&rsquo;s doorbell, Fibsy asked to see her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Bates,&rdquo; he said, politely, while Trask listened, &ldquo;we want to see Miss Austin,  please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita!&rdquo;  said Mrs. Bates, flurriedly; &ldquo;why&mdash;she&mdash;she isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, she is here,&rdquo; said the boy, patiently, rather than rudely. &ldquo;We have to see  her, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am,&rdquo; said Miss Mystery, coming in from the next room. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said  turning to Mrs. Bates, &ldquo;I think, as you advised me, I&rsquo;ll tell all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell it here!&rdquo; cried Fibsy. &ldquo;Please, Miss Austin&mdash;don&rsquo;t spill your yarn here&mdash;oh,  I mean, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t divulge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  unusual word nearly choked the excited boy, who always in moments of strong  emotion lapsed into careless English, but who tried not to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here,&rdquo; Maurice Trask put in. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I take hold. Miss Austin, you  have told your story to Mrs. Bates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said, Anita, looking very sad, but determined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you tell it to me. I&rsquo;m heir to the Waring estate, and so I have a right to know  all you know about&mdash;the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  knowing look proved to Anita that he assumed also her right to be classed with &ldquo;the  family&rdquo; and she looked at him in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I  know,&rdquo; he spoke very sternly. &ldquo;And I insist upon a private interview with you,  before you tell your story to any one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall have it, then,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes grew grave. &ldquo;Mrs. Bates, will you  and Terence leave us alone for ten minutes. That will be long enough, and then,  I&rsquo;ll go to see Mr. Stone&mdash;if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here,&rdquo; Trask said, as the door closed after the others, &ldquo;I know who you  are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; and Miss Mystery looked at him straight from beneath the &ldquo;Truesdell  brows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  anyway, I know you are a Truesdell connection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know just what branch,&rdquo; he went on, a little lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s a branch strong enough to hold me&mdash;and also to interfere with this heirship  of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  be. There&rsquo;s no Truesdell so close to John Waring as I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think so? Then listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Miss Mystery told him her story, the man&rsquo;s face fell, he sat, almost petrified  with astonishment, and when she had finished the short but amazing recital, he  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  heavens! What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you tell&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if you don&rsquo;t tell&mdash;then John Waring&rsquo;s name is left unstained&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no shadow of stain on John Waring&rsquo;s name! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Miss Austin, you keep quiet about all this, will you? I&rsquo;ll call off  those sleuths and I&rsquo;ll arrange to close up and cover up the whole matter. Then,  you marry me&mdash;there&rsquo;s only a distant cousinship between us&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll put up the  biggest memorial to Waring you ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Omit  the clause about my marrying you,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;and I may agree to your  plans. I haven&rsquo;t quite decided what to do&mdash;and beside, Mr. Trask, who killed  my&mdash;Doctor Waring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind who killed him. Call it suicide&mdash;it must have been anyway&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m  not sure it was&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s  up,&rdquo; called Fibsy through the closed door. &ldquo;And, I say, Miss Austin, you take  my tip, and come along and tell your story to F. Stone. It&rsquo;ll be your best bet  in the long run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps  it was the boy&rsquo;s speech, perhaps it was the gleam of disappointed greed that  Anita saw in Trask&rsquo;s eyes, but she rose, with a sudden decision, and said, as  she opened the door:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I&rsquo;ll do. Come with me, Mrs. Bates&mdash;or, would you rather not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Emily Bates, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask me, Anita, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you stay here. I&rsquo;ll come back soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so Miss Mystery again walked across the snow-covered field to the Waring house,  this time to remove all occasion for using her nickname.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  found her?&rdquo; said Stone, as the trio came into the study, where he and Lockwood  still sat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Fibsy. &ldquo;I just thought where would a poor, hunted kid go? And I said to  myself, she&rsquo;d go to the nearest and nicest lady&rsquo;s house she knew of. And of  course, that was Mrs. Bates&rsquo; and sure enough there she was. And&mdash;she&rsquo;s going to  tell all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  was melodramatic by nature, and his gesture indicated an important revelation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; said Anita, quietly.</p>
  <p>She  went straight to Lockwood&rsquo;s side, and he took her hand calmly, and led her to a  seat on the wide davenport, then sat beside her.</p>
  <p>Her  hand still in his, she told her story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am of Truesdell blood,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;as Mr. Trask surmised. But, also, I am of  Waring blood. Doctor John Waring was my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No  one spoke. The surprise was too great. In his wildest theories, Fleming Stone  had never thought of this.</p>
  <p>Fibsy&rsquo;s  great astonishment was permeated with the quick conviction, &ldquo;then she didn&rsquo;t  kill him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood was conscious of a rapturous reassurance that he had no rival as a  lover.</p>
  <p>Trask,  already knowing the truth, sat gloomily realizing he was not the heir.</p>
  <p>Anita,  her beautiful face sad, yet proud to acknowledge her ancestry, went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is his story. When John Waring was twenty years old, he met a young woman&mdash;an  actress&mdash;who so infatuated him that he married her. They were absolutely  uncongenial and unfitted for one another, and after a few weeks, they agreed to  separate. There was no question of divorce, they merely preferred to live  apart. He sent her money at stated intervals but he pursued his quiet, studious  life, and she her life of gayety and sport. She was a good woman&mdash;she <i>is</i> a good woman&mdash;she is my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  silence followed this disclosure. Is, she had said&mdash;not was. And John Waring her  father!</p>
  <p>Gordon  Lockwood held her hand closely. He was content to listen. Whatever she could  say could not lessen his love and adoration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you this, for her sake and&mdash;my father&rsquo;s also. There is no stigma to be  attached to either, they were merely so utterly opposite in character and  disposition that they could not live together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said, after a few weeks they separated, and&mdash;my father did not know of my  birth. My mother would not let him know, lest he come back to her. She was a  light-hearted, carefree girl, and while she loved me, she did not love my  father. Later on&mdash;when I was about four, I think, she caused a notice of her  death to be sent to my father. This was because she wanted to sever all  connection, and take no chance of ever meeting him again. She was at that time  a successful actress, and earned all the money she wanted. She adored me, she  had no love affairs, she lived only for me and her art. Though a good actress,  she was not widely renowned, and in California, where she had chosen to make  her home, she was liked and respected. The climate just suited her love of  ease, freedom and indolence&mdash;as a New England life of busy activity would have  been impossible to her. I want you to understand my mother. She was&mdash;she is, a mere  butterfly, caring only for trifles and simple gayety. Her home is charming, her  personality, that of a delightful child. But her temperament is one that cannot  stand responsibilities and chafes at demands. However, all that matters little.  The facts are that John Waring, learning of his wife&rsquo;s death, devoted himself  utterly to his books and his study.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  my mother saw in the papers he was about to marry, she was appalled. She didn&rsquo;t  know what to do. She couldn&rsquo;t let him marry another woman, unaware of her  existence. She couldn&rsquo;t raise a question of divorce for she knew that would  tend to reflect unpleasantly on his past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  too, at last, she was beginning to feel as if she might like to resume her  position as his wife, now that he was prominent and wealthy. She told me the  whole story&mdash;of which I had been utterly ignorant, and she sent me here. I was  to see Doctor Waring and use my own judgment as to when and how I should tell  him all this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came here, with a feeling of dislike and resentment toward a father who had been  no father to me. Mother exonerated him, to be sure, but it was all such a  surprise to me, that I accepted the errand in a spirit of bravado and was  prepared to make trouble if necessary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  when I saw John Waring&mdash;when I realized that splendid man was my father&mdash;I knew  that all my love, all my allegiance was his, and that my mother was as nothing  to me, compared with my wonderful father!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  for what Mr. Trask calls the Truesdell brows, I look exactly like my mother.  Also she resumed her maiden name of Anita Austin after they separated. So you  may imagine the shock when Doctor Waring first heard the name, and first saw  the living image of his wife, whom, you must remember, he supposed dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I had my mission to perform&mdash;and so, I came here, that Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  audience sat motionless. Lockwood, holding her hand, felt every tremor of her  emotion as the girl told her story. Fleming Stone, realizing that he was  hearing the most dramatic revelation of his career, listened avidly. Fibsy,  with staring eyes and open mouth, clenched his fists in enthralled interest,  and Maurice Trask heard it all with ever growing conviction that he must give  up his supposed inheritance.</p>
  <p>As  Anita began to tell of that Sunday night, the situation became even more tense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came to the French window, and tapped lightly. Doctor Waring let me in, and I  sat by him in that plush chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  conversation I had with my father I shall not detail. It is my most sacred and  beloved memory. We were as one in every way. We loved each other from the first  word. We proved to be alike in our tastes and pursuits. Oh, if he could have  lived! I told him of my mother and myself, and he was crushed. I wanted to  spare him, but what could I do? He had to know&mdash;although the knowing meant the  ruining of his career. He said, at once, he could not take the Presidency of  the College, with the story of his past made public, nor could he honorably  suppress it. He couldn&rsquo;t marry Mrs. Bates&mdash;nor could he instal my mother as  mistress here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had done no real wrong, in making that early and ill-advised marriage, but it  seemed to him a blot on his scutcheon, and an indelible one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  would sit and brood over these fearful conditions, then, suddenly he would  realize my existence afresh, and rejoice in it. He loved me at once and  deeply&mdash;and I adored him. Never father and daughter, I am sure, crowded a  lifetime of affection into such a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bravely  Anita went on, not daring to pause to think. Her hand, tightly clasped in  Lockwood&rsquo;s, trembled, but her voice was steady, for it was her opportunity to  clear her father&rsquo;s name, and she must neglect no slightest point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  last, he told me I must go away, and he would think out what he could do. He  gave me the money, for he was afraid I hadn&rsquo;t sufficient cash with me, and he  gave me the ruby pin, saying I must keep it forever as my father&rsquo;s first gift  to me. With infinite gentleness he bade me good-by, and softly opened the glass  door for me. I went away and he closed the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went home to the Adams house, making, of course, those footprints in the snow.  It was a very cold night, I remember the clear shining stars, but I thought of  nothing but my father&mdash;my splendid, wonderful father. And I hoped, oh, how I  hoped, that some way would be found that he and I could spend our lives  together. I didn&rsquo;t know what he would do&mdash;but I prayed to God that some way out  might be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rest you know. Of the manner of my father&rsquo;s death, I know nothing at all. Of  Nogi, I have no knowledge. I kept all this secret at first, because I hoped to  shield my father&rsquo;s name better that way. But I think now, it&rsquo;s better told. I  couldn&rsquo;t live under the weight of such a secret.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  more word as to my mother. She has had an admirer for many years, named Carl  Melrose. She has kept him at a distance, but, as you know from the telegram she  sent me, she has already either married him or promised to. Also, she advised  me to tell the whole truth. I have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unheeding  the others, Lockwood put his arm round the exhausted girl as she fell over  toward him. His wonderful calm helped her, and his gentle yet firm embrace gave  her fresh courage to endure the strain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Miss Austin,&rdquo; and Stone spoke almost reverently. &ldquo;You have shown marvelous  wisdom and bravery and I congratulate you on your entire procedure. You are an  exceptional girl, and I am proud to know you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a great deal for Fleming Stone to say, and Anita acknowledged it with a  grateful glance.</p>
  <p>Fibsy,  his eyes streaming with unchecked tears, came over and knelt before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Miss Austin!&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;Oh, Miss Anita!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trask  alone remained unmoved, and sat with folded arms and frowning face.</p>
  <p>But  little attention was paid him, and Stone said, thoughtfully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  problem of the mystery of Doctor Waring&rsquo;s death is as great as ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&rdquo; agreed Lockwood, &ldquo;but I am sure now, Mr. Stone, that it was a suicide. The  motive is supplied, for I knew Doctor Waring so well, I knew the workings of  his great and good mind, and I am sure that he felt there was no other course  for him. I can see just how he decided that the exposure of all this would  react against the reputation of the College. That the sensation and scandal  that would fill the papers would harm the standing of the University of  Corinth, and that&mdash;and that alone&mdash;caused his decision. I know him so well, that  I can tell you that never, never would he take his life to save himself trouble  or sorrow, but for others&rsquo; sake&mdash;and I include Mrs. Bates&mdash;he made the sacrifice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can see&mdash;and I am sure of what I say&mdash;how he realized that the press and the  public would forgive and condone a dead man, when, if he lived, the brunt of  the whole matter would fall on his beloved College and on the woman he loved  and respected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;as  I feel sure he foresaw&mdash;such of this story as must be made public will have far  less weight and prominence, than if he were alive. <i>I</i> know all this is so&mdash;for, I knew John Waring as few people knew  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  grateful glance from John Waring&rsquo;s daughter thanked him for this tribute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  ten thousand dollar check?&rdquo; Trask said, suddenly, for his mind was still  concerned with the financial side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that must have been sent to my mother,&rdquo; said Anita. &ldquo;She, as I told you,  returned to the use of her maiden name, and during our interview, my father  told me he should write her at once and send her money. I feel sure he did do  so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt,&rdquo; Lockwood said; &ldquo;and if so, the letter would have been mailed with the  collection next morning. The returning voucher will show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also  the letter he wrote my mother will corroborate all I have told you,&rdquo; said  Anita, and both her assertion and Gordon&rsquo;s, later came true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  felt,&rdquo; Anita said, by way of further explanation, &ldquo;that Mrs. Bates ought to  know all. So, when Mrs. Adams practically put me out of her house, and I had no  wish to accept Mr. Trask&rsquo;s invitation to come over here, nor,&rdquo; she smiled  affectionately at Lockwood, &ldquo;could I fall in with your crazy plans&mdash;I just went  next door and told Mrs. Bates all about it. She was very dear and sweet to me,  and now, if you please, I will go back there. I am weary and exhausted&mdash;I cannot  stand any more. But when you want me, I can be found at Mrs. Bates&rsquo;. I leave  all matters to be decided or settled, in the hands of Mr. Lockwood and Mr.  Stone. Fibsy, dear, will you escort me home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a suddenly acquired dignity, Fibsy rose, and stood by her side, and in a moment  the two went away together.</p>
  <p>When  the boy returned the others were absorbed in the discussion of the mysterious  death of John Waring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  inclined to give it up,&rdquo; Fleming Stone said, thinking deeply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  do it, F. Stone,&rdquo; Fibsy said, earnestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to find out. You never  have gave up a case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Well, Fibs, which way shall we look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  strange embarrassment came over the boy&rsquo;s face, and then he said, diffidently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,  gentlemen, could I be left alone in this room for a little while? I don&rsquo;t say I  kin find out anythin&rsquo;&mdash;but I do wanta try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lapse into careless enunciation told Stone how much in earnest his young  colleague was, and he rose, saying, &ldquo;You certainly may, my boy. The rest of us  will have a conference in some other room, as to what part of Miss Austin&rsquo;s  story must be made public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Left  to himself, Fibsy went at once to the bookcase that held the defaced copy of  Martial, that John Waring had been reading the night he died.</p>
  <p>Opening  the volume at the blood-stained page, the unlettered boy eagerly read the  lines. Tried to read them, rather, and groaned in spirit because he knew no  Latin.</p>
  <p>Small  wonder that he was nonplused, for this was all he read:</p>
  <p>MARTIAL&rsquo;S  EPIGRAMS</p>
  <p>Liber  IV, Epigram XVIII</p>
  <p>Qua  vicina pluit Vipsanis porta columnis Et madet assiduo lubricus imbre lapis, In  iugulum pueri, qui roscida tecta subibat, Decidit hiberno praegravis unda gelu:  Cumque peregisset miseri crudelia fata, Tabuit in calido vulnere mucro tener. Quid  non saeva sibi voluit Fortuna licere? Aut ubi non mors est, si iugulatis aquae?</p>
  <p>His  chin in his hands, he pored over the Latin in utter despair, and rising,  started for the door.</p>
  <p>Then  he paused; &ldquo;I must do it myself&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured: &ldquo;<i>I must.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  he hunted the shelves until he found a Latin Dictionary.</p>
  <p>He  was not entirely unversed in the rudiments of the language, for Stone had  directed his education at such odd hours as he could find time for study.</p>
  <p>And  so after some hard and laborious digging, Fibsy at last gathered the gist of  the Latin stanza.</p>
  <p>His  eyes shone, and he stared about the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  ain&rsquo;t possible&mdash;&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and yet&mdash;gee, there ain&rsquo;t nothing else  possible!&rdquo; He rose and looked out at every window, he noted carefully the catches&mdash;he  paced from the desk to the small rear windows of the room, and back again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the only thing,&rdquo; he reiterated, &ldquo;the <i>only</i> thing. Oh, gee! <i>what</i> a thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went in search of Stone, and found the three men shut in the living room and  with them was Nogi.</p>
  <p>Stone&rsquo;s  persevering efforts, by advertisements and circulars had at last succeeded, and  the impassive and non-committal Japanese was there, and quite willing to tell  all he knew.</p>
  <p>Fibsy  interrupted his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;to the beginning. Let me hear it all. It&rsquo;s O. K., F. S.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was attending to my dining-room duties,&rdquo; Nogi said, &ldquo;and I had taken the water  tray to the study. I was weary and hoped the master would soon retire. So, I  occasionally peeped through the small window from the dining-room. I saw a lady  come and make a visit, and then I saw her and I heard her go away. Then I hoped  the master would go to bed. But, no&mdash;he was very busy. He wrote letters, he  burned some papers, he moved about much. He was restless, disturbed. Then he  sat at his desk and read his book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  one?&rdquo; cried Fibsy, excitedly waving the Martial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so&mdash;one like that, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was the one! Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;oh,  it was strange! Then the master got up, went to the small window at the back of  the room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  one by the big globe, and he opened it. But for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he put his hand out?&rdquo; Fibsy cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose to see if it rained. Yes, he put his hand out for a moment, then he  closed the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  locked it?&rdquo; asked Fibsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  locks itself, with a snap catch. Then&mdash;ah, here is the strange thing! Then he  went back, sat at his desk, and in a moment he fell over and the blood spurted  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  he stab himself?&rdquo; Fibsy asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. He didn&rsquo;t seem to do anything but scratch his ear, and over he  fell! Such a sight! I was afraid, and I ran away&mdash;fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  very well,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;but what became of the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; Fibsy almost screamed, in his excitement. &ldquo;Oh, F. Stone&mdash;I know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  tell us, Terence&mdash;but steady, now, my boy. Don&rsquo;t get too excited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; and the lad grew suddenly quiet. &ldquo;But I know. Wait just a minute, sir.  Where are the photographs of the house that the detectives took the day after?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  get them,&rdquo; Lockwood said, and left the room.</p>
  <p>He  returned, and Fibsy found a magnifying glass and looked carefully at certain  pictures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  proves,&rdquo; he said, solemnly. &ldquo;F. Stone, you have solved your greatest case!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was characteristic of the boy, that although the solution was his own, his  deference to Stone was sincere and un-self-conscious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Latin, but you will find the explanation of Doctor  Waring&rsquo;s death on that red stained page. He was reading Martial, as we know,  and&mdash;&rdquo; he pointed to the Epigram on the page in question, &ldquo;as he read that, he  found a way out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  grave statement was impressive, and Stone took the book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I translate, or read the Latin aloud?&rdquo; he asked the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute, I&rsquo;ll get a Martial in English,&rdquo; Lockwood said, out of consideration  for Trask&rsquo;s possible ignorance of the dead language.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  number is the Epigram?&rdquo; he asked, returning.</p>
  <p>Stone  told him, and Lockwood found the place, and passed the English version to  Stone. Aloud, the detective read this:</p>
  <p>TRANSLATION</p>
  <p>Book  IV, Epigram 18</p>
  <p>On  a youth killed by the fall of a piece of ice.</p>
  <p>Just  where the gate near the portico of Agrippa is always dripping with water, and  the slippery pavement is wet with constant showers, a mass of water, congealed  by winter&rsquo;s cold, fell upon the neck of a youth who was entering the damp  temple, and, when it had inflicted a cruel death on the unfortunate boy, the  weapon melted in the warm wound it had made. What cruelties does not Fortune  permit? Or where is not death to be found, if you, the waters, turn  cut-throats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so you see,&rdquo; Fibsy broke the ensuing silence, &ldquo;he decided to stab himself with  an icicle, and he did. He did!&rdquo; he repeated, triumphantly, &ldquo;he went to that  window back by the big globe and got one&mdash;and here&rsquo;s the proof! Look through the  glass, F. S.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stone  did so, and without doubt, the fringe of icicles that hung from that particular  window sash showed one missing! It was the very window that Nogi stated Waring  had opened, and had put his hand out of for a moment.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  he had broken off an icicle, strong and firm on that freezing night, had  returned to his chair, and inspired by the story of the youth under the portico  of Agrippa, had stabbed his own jugular vein with the sharp, round point, and  had fallen unconscious.</p>
  <p>The  icicle, melting in the wound, had disappeared, and death had followed in a  moment or two.</p>
  <p>They  went to the study, and Nogi was made to imitate the movements he saw Doctor  Waring make. It left no doubt of the exact facts and the mystery was solved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you suppose he meant to make it seem a murder?&rdquo; asked Stone, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not!&rdquo; defended Lockwood. &ldquo;That is he did not mean to implicate anybody. He  was a man amenable to sudden suggestion, and apt to follow it. I am certain the  idea came to him, as he read his book, and in the impulse of the moment he  rose, got the implement and did the deed. It was like him to read that book  after his talk with his daughter. He often resorted to reading for a time to  clear his mind for some important decision. Had he not read that very page, he  would in all probability not have taken his life at that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  can be no doubt of it all,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;Fibsy, the credit of the discovery is  yours. You did a great piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fibsy  blushed with delight at Stone&rsquo;s praise, which he cared for more than anything  else in life, but he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw,  I just chanced on it. But I found out another thing! While I was workin&rsquo; on  that translatin&rsquo; business, the telephone rang. I answered, but somebody took it  on an extension, so I hung up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I was waitin&rsquo; quite a few minutes, and, what do you think? I happened to rest  my forehead on the telephone transmitter, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  red ring!&rdquo; cried Stone. &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; Fibsy repeated. &ldquo;Pokin&rsquo; around for a Latin Dictionary, I passed a  lookin&rsquo; glass, and there on me noble forehead I saw a red ring, about two  inches across. It&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Stone said. &ldquo;Without doubt, Doctor Waring was telephoning&mdash;or perhaps was  answering a call and he rested his head on the instrument.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  often did that,&rdquo; said Lockwood, &ldquo;but I never noticed a ring left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  life,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;it would disappear quickly. But if it happened just before  he died, rigor mortis would preserve the mark. Any way it must have been that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  solution of the mystery, so indubitably the true one, was accepted by the  police.</p>
  <p>The  matter was given as little publicity as possible, for Anita and Mrs. Bates, the  two most deeply concerned both wished it so. No stigma of cowardice rested on  John Waring&rsquo;s name, for all who knew him knew that his act was the deed of a  martyr to circumstances and was prompted by a spirit of loyalty to his College  and unwillingness to let his own misfortunes in any way redound to its  disparagement.</p>
  <p>He  trusted, they felt sure, that the truth would never be discovered and that the  tragedy of his death would preclude blame or censure.</p>
  <p>Himself,  he never thought of, in his unselfish life or equally unselfish death.</p>
  <p>Trask,  perforce, resigned all claim to the estate, and Anita and her mother arranged  matters between themselves.</p>
  <p>The  assumption was that John Waring&rsquo;s will, which he burned, had been made in Mrs.  Bates&rsquo; favor, but on learning of his nearer heirs, he destroyed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anita  Waring,&rdquo; Lockwood murmured softly when at last they were alone together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love the name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it is really mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it will be yours so short a time, it&rsquo;s scarcely worth while to use it,&rdquo; Gordon  returned. &ldquo;It will be a short time, won&rsquo;t it, sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed! I want to go away from Corinth forever. I love my father&rsquo;s memory, but  I can&rsquo;t stand these scenes. I am tired of mystery in name and in deed. I just  want to be&mdash;Anita Lockwood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon  Gordon lost his head entirely.</p>
