<h2 align="center"><a name="I"></a><b>Chapter  I<br>
    Doctor Fell</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit thick, I call it,&rdquo; Pollard looked round the  group; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Mellen been dead six weeks now, and the mystery of his  taking-off still unsolved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And always will be,&rdquo; Doctor Davenport nodded. &ldquo;Mighty  few murders are brought home to the villains who commit them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; drawled Phil Barry, an artist,  whose dress and demeanor coincided with the popular idea of his class. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no  head for statistics,&rdquo; he went on, idly drawing caricatures on the margin of his  evening paper as he talked, &ldquo;but I think they say that only one-tenth of one  per cent, of the murderers in this great and glorious country of ours are ever  discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your head for statistics is defective, as you admit,&rdquo;  Doctor Davenport said, his tone scornful; &ldquo;but percentages mean little in these  matters. The greater part of the murders committed are not brought prominently  before public notice. It&rsquo;s only when the victim is rich or influential, or the  circumstances of some especial interest that a murder occupies the front pages  of the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Mellen&rsquo;s been on those same front pages for  several weeks&mdash;off and on, that is,&rdquo; Pollard insisted; &ldquo;of course, he was a  well-known man and his exit was dramatic. But all the same, they ought to have  caught his murderer&mdash;or slayer, as the papers call him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; asked Barry, remembering the details of the  case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impersonal pronoun,&rdquo; Pollard returned, &ldquo;and probably  a man anyway. &lsquo;Cherchez la femme,&rsquo; is the trite advice, and always sounds well,  but really, a woman seldom has nerve enough for the fatal deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Davenport agreed. &ldquo;I know lots of  women who have all the intent of murder in their hearts, but who never could  pull it off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good thing, too,&rdquo; Barry observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to  think any woman I know capable of murder! Ugh!&rdquo; His long, delicate white hand  waved away the distasteful idea with a gesture that seemed to dismiss it  entirely.</p>
  <p>There were not many in the Club lounge, the group of  men had it mostly to themselves, and as the afternoon dusk grew deeper and the  lights were turned on, several more went away, and finally Fred Lane rose to  go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frightfully interesting, you fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but  it&rsquo;s after five, and I&rsquo;ve a date. Anybody I can drop anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me, please,&rdquo; accepted Dean Monroe. &ldquo;That is, if  you&rsquo;re going my way. I want to go downtown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was going up,&rdquo; returned Lane, &ldquo;but delighted to  change my route. Come along, Monroe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Monroe had heard a chance word from Doctor  Davenport that arrested his attention, and he sat still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess I won&rsquo;t go quite yet&mdash;thanks all the same,&rdquo; he  nodded at Lane, and lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>
  <p>Dean Monroe was a younger man than the others, an  artist, but not yet in the class with Barry. His square, firm-set jaw, and his  Wedgwood blue eyes gave his face a look of power and determination quite in  contrast with Philip Barry&rsquo;s pale, sensitive countenance. Yet the two were  friends&mdash;chums, almost, and though differing in their views on art, each  respected the other&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; Lane returned, indifferently,  and went off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crime detection is not the simple process many  suppose,&rdquo; Davenport was saying, and Monroe gave his whole attention. &ldquo;So much  depends on chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Doctor,&rdquo; Monroe objected, &ldquo;I hold it&rsquo;s one of  the most exact sciences, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Davenport looked at him, as an old dog might look at  an impertinent kitten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being an exact science doesn&rsquo;t interfere with  dependence on chance,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;also, young man, are you sure you know what  an exact science is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yeppy,&rdquo; Monroe defended himself, as the others smiled  a little. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s a science that&rsquo;s exact&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His gay smile disarmed his opponent, and Davenport,  mounted on his hobby, went on: &ldquo;You may have skill, intuition, deductive powers  and all that, but to discover a criminal, the prime element is chance. Now, in  the Mellen case, the chances were all against the detectives from the first.  They didn&rsquo;t get there till the evidences were, or might have been destroyed.  They couldn&rsquo;t find Mrs Gresham, the most important witness until after she had  had time to prepare her string of falsehoods. Oh, well, you know how the case  was messed up, and now, there&rsquo;s not a chance in a hundred of the truth ever  being known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does chance play any part in your profession,  Doctor?&rdquo; asked Monroe, with the expectation of flooring him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet it does!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Why, be I never so  careful in my diagnosis or treatment, a chance deviation from my orders on the  part of patient or attendant, a chance draught of wind, or upset nerves&mdash;oh,  Lord, yes! as the Good Book says, &lsquo;Time and Chance happeneth to us all.&rsquo; And no  line of work is more precarious than establishing a theory or running down a  clew in a murder case. For the criminal, ever on the alert, has all the odds on  his side, and can block or divert the detective&rsquo;s course at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor Ely Davenport was, without being pompous, a man  who was at all times conscious of his own personality and sure of his own  importance. He was important, too, being one of the most highly thought of  doctors in New York City, and his self-esteem, if a trifle annoying, was  founded on his real worth.</p>
  <p>He often said that his profession brought him in  contact with the souls of men and women quite as much as with their bodies, and  he was fond of theorizing what human nature might do or not do in crucial  moments.</p>
  <p>The detection of crime he held to be a matter  requiring the highest intelligence and rarest skill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Detection!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in the course of the  present conversation, &ldquo;why detection is as hard to work out as the Fourth  Dimension! As difficult to understand as the Einstein theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Doctor,&rdquo; Pollard said, smiling, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s  going a bit too far. I admit, though, it requires a superior brain. But any  real work does. However, I say, first catch your motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; broke in Monroe, eagerly. &ldquo;It all depends  on the motive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The crime does,&rdquo; Davenport assented, drily, &ldquo;but not  the detection. You youngsters don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;you&rsquo;d better  shut up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know a lot,&rdquo; returned Monroe, unabashed. &ldquo;Youth is  no barrier to knowledge these days. And I hold that the clever detective seeks  first the motive. You can&rsquo;t have a murder without a motive, any more than an  omelette without eggs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, oh, Solomon,&rdquo; granted the doctor. &ldquo;But the  motive may be known only to the murderer, and not to be discovered by any  effort of the investigator.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the murder mystery remains unsolved,&rdquo; returned  Monroe, promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your saying so doesn&rsquo;t make it so, you know,&rdquo; drawled  Phil Barry, in his impertinent way. &ldquo;Now, to me it would seem that a nice lot  of circumstantial evidence, and a few good clews would expedite matters just as  well as a knowledge of the villain&rsquo;s motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Circumstantial evidence!&rdquo; scoffed Monroe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; rejoined Barry; &ldquo;Give me a smoking revolver  with initials on it, a dropped handkerchief, monogrammed, of course, half a  broken cuff-link, and a few fingerprints, and I care not who knows the motive.  And if you can add a piece&mdash;no, a fragment of tweed, clutched in the victim&rsquo;s  rigid hand&mdash;why&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not ask for wine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What rubbish you all talk,&rdquo; said Pollard, smiling  superciliously; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see these things all count? If you have motive you  don&rsquo;t need evidence, and <i>vice versa</i>. That is, if both motive and  evidence are the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are only three motives,&rdquo; Monroe informed.  &ldquo;Love, hate and money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all the jargon by heart, little one,&rdquo; and  Pollard grinned at him. &ldquo;Been reading some new Detective Fiction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always doing that,&rdquo; Monroe stated, &ldquo;but I hold  that a detective who can&rsquo;t tell which of those three is the motive, isn&rsquo;t worth  his salt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Salt is one commodity that has remained fairly  inexpensive,&rdquo; said Barry, speaking slowly, and with his eyes on his cigarette,  from which he was carefully amputating the ash, &ldquo;and a detective who could  truly diagnose motive is not to be sneezed at. Besides, revenge is often a  reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That comes under the head of hate,&rdquo; promptly  responded Monroe. &ldquo;The three motives include all the gamut of human emotion,  and some of their ramifications will include every murder motive that ever  existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear?&rdquo; quietly suggested Doctor Davenport.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Part of hate,&rdquo; said Monroe, but he was challenged by  Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. A man may fear a person whom he does  not hate at all. But there&rsquo;s another motive, that doesn&rsquo;t quite fit your  classification, Monroe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before the inevitable question could be put another  man joined the group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, folks,&rdquo; said Robert Gleason, as he sat down;  &ldquo;hope I don&rsquo;t intrude&mdash;and all that. What you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;Murder as a Fine Art, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the subject. Let&rsquo;s change it. Talk about  the ladies, or something pleasant, you know. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or Shakespeare and the musical glasses,&rdquo; said  Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No musical glasses, nowadays,&rdquo; bewailed Gleason. &ldquo;No  more clink the canakin, clink. It&rsquo;s drink to me only with thine eyes. Hence,  the preponderance of women and song in our lives, since the third of the trio  is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gleason was the sort of Westerner usually described as  breezy. He was on intimate terms with everybody, whether everybody reciprocated  or not. Not a large man, not a young man, he possessed a restless vitality, a  wiry energy that gave him an effect of youth. About forty, he was nearer the  age of Doctor Davenport than the others, who were all in their earliest  thirties.</p>
  <p>Nobody liked Gleason much, yet no one really disliked  him. He was a bit forward, a little intrusive, but it was clear to be seen that  those mannerisms were due to ignorance and not to any intent to be  objectionable. He was put up at the Club by a friend, and had never really  overstepped his privileges, though it was observable that his ways were not  club ways.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep, the Ladies&mdash;God bless &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;What  could be a better subject for gentlemen&rsquo;s discussion? No personalities, of  course; that goes without saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why say it?&rdquo; murmured Pollard, without looking  at the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! Why, indeed?&rdquo; was the genial response.  &ldquo;Now, you know, out in Seattle, where I hail from, there&rsquo;s more&mdash;oh, what do you  call it, sociability like, among men. I go into a club there and everybody  sings out something gay; I come in here, and you all shut up like clams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You objected to the subject we were discussing,&rdquo;  began Monroe, indignantly, but Barry interrupted, with a wave of his hand, &ldquo;The  effete East, my dear Gleason. Doubtless you&rsquo;ve heard that expression? Yes, you  would. Well, it&rsquo;s our renowned effeteness that prevents our falling on your  neck more effusively.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guying me?&rdquo; asked Gleason, with a quiet smile. &ldquo;You  see, boys, before I went to Seattle, I was born in New England. I can take a  little chaff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell us of your ancestry?&rdquo; said  Pollard, and though his words were polite his tone held a trace of sarcastic  intent.</p>
  <p>Gleason turned a sudden look on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might, if you really want me to,&rdquo; he said, slowly.  &ldquo;I might give you the story of my life from my infancy, spent in Coggs&rsquo; Hollow,  New Hampshire, to the present day, when I may call myself one of the leading  citizens of Seattle, Wash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What or whom do you lead?&rdquo; asked Pollard, and again  the only trace of unpleasantness was a slight inflection in his really fine  voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I lead the procession,&rdquo; and Gleason smiled, as one  who positively refuses to take offense whether meant or not. &ldquo;But, I can tell  you I don&rsquo;t lead it here in New York! Your pace is rather swift for me! I&rsquo;m  having a good time and all that, but soon, it&rsquo;s me for the wildness and  woolliness of the good old West again! Why, looky here, I&rsquo;m living in a hole in  the wall&mdash;yes, sir, a hole in the wall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like that!&rdquo; laughed Doctor Davenport. &ldquo;Why, man,  you&rsquo;re in that apartment of McIlvaine&rsquo;s&mdash;one of the best put-ups in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so Mac said,&rdquo; Gleason exploded. &ldquo;Why, out home,  we&rsquo;d call that a coop. But what could I do? This old town of yours, spilling  over full, couldn&rsquo;t fix me out at any hotel, so when my friend offered his  palatial home, I took it&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised at the result!&rdquo; Barry broke in.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a Western millionaire, Mr Gleason. Now we poor,  struggling young artists think that apartment you&rsquo;re in, one of the finest  diggings around Washington Square.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, man, there&rsquo;s no service!&rdquo; Gleason went on,  complainingly. &ldquo;Not even a hall porter! Nobody to announce a caller!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you have that more efficient service, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! the contraption that lets a caller push a button  and have the door open in his face!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just what he wants?&rdquo; said Barry, laughing  outright at Gleason&rsquo;s disgusted look. &ldquo;Then, you see, Friend Caller walks  upstairs, and there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>walks</i> upstairs. Not even an elevator!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But your friends don&rsquo;t need one,&rdquo; expostulated  Davenport. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only one flight up. You don&rsquo;t seem to realize how lucky you  are to get that place, in these days of housing problems!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, &rsquo;tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as  a church door, but it will serve,&rdquo; said Gleason, with one of his sudden,  pleasant smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see your point, though, Mr Gleason,&rdquo; said Dean  Monroe. &ldquo;And if I were a plutocrat from Seattle, sojourning in this busy mart,  I confess I, too, should like a little more of the dazzling light in my halls  than you get down there. I know the place, used to go there to see McIlvaine.  And while it&rsquo;s a decent size, and jolly well furnished, I can see how you&rsquo;d  prefer more gilt on your ginger bread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do, and I&rsquo;d have it, too, if I were staying here  much longer. But I&rsquo;m going to settle up things soon now, and go back to home,  sweet home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you, a New Englander, chance to make Seattle  your home?&rdquo; asked Monroe, always of a curious bent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had a chance to go out there and get rich. You see,  Coggs&rsquo; Hollow, as one might gather from its name, was a small hamlet. I lived  there till I was twenty-five, then, getting a chance to go West and blow up  with the country, I did. Glad of it, too. Now, I&rsquo;m going back there, and&mdash;I hope  to take with me a specimen of your fair feminine. Yes, sir, I hope and expect  to take along, under my wing, one of these little moppy-haired, brief-skirted  lassies, that will grace my Seattle home something fine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does she know it yet?&rdquo; drawled Barry and Gleason stared  at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t quite sure of it, but I am!&rdquo; he returned  with a comical air of determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know her pretty well, then,&rdquo; chaffed Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet I do! I ought to. She&rsquo;s my sister&rsquo;s  stepdaughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phyllis Lindsay!&rdquo; cried Barry, involuntarily speaking  the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Gleason, smiling; &ldquo;and as I&rsquo;m due  there for dinner, I&rsquo;ll be toddling now to make myself fine for the event.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a general beaming smile of good nature that  included all the group, Gleason went away.</p>
  <p>For a few moments no one spoke, and then Monroe began,  &ldquo;As I was saying, there are only three motives for murder&mdash;and I stick to that.  But you were about to say, Pollard&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was about to say that you have omitted the most  frequent and most impelling motive. It doesn&rsquo;t always result in the fatal  stroke, but as a motive, it can&rsquo;t be beat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just plain dislike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hate,&rdquo; said Monroe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. Hate implies a reason, a grievance. But I  mean an ineradicable, and unreasonable dislike&mdash;why, simply a case of:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I  do not like you, Doctor Fell,</p>
  <p>The  reason why I cannot tell;</p>
  <p>But  this I know and know full well,</p>
  <p>I  do not like you, Doctor Fell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>One Tom Brown wrote that, and it&rsquo;s a bit of truth, all  right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One Martial said it before your friend Brown,&rdquo;  informed Doctor Davenport. &ldquo;He wrote:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Non  amo, te, Sabidi,</p>
  <p>nec  possum dicere quore;</p>
  <p>Hoc  tantum possum dicere,</p>
  <p>non  amo te.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which is, being translated for the benefit of you  unlettered ones, &lsquo;I do not love thee, Sabidius, nor can I say why; this only  can I say, I do not love thee.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a French version, also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Doc,&rdquo; Pollard interrupted, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want  your erudition, but your opinion. You say you know psychology as well as  physiology; will you agree that a strong motive for murder might be just that  unreasonable dislike&mdash;that distaste of seeing a certain person around?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not a strong motive,&rdquo; said Davenport, after a  short pause for thought. &ldquo;A slight motive, perhaps, by which I mean a fleeting  impulse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; persisted Pollard, &ldquo;an impelling&mdash;a compelling  motive. Why, there&rsquo;s Gleason now. I can&rsquo;t bear that man. Yet I scarcely know  him. I&rsquo;ve met him but a few times&mdash;had little or no personal conversation with  him&mdash;yet I dislike him. Not detest or hate or despise&mdash;merely dislike him. And,  some day I&rsquo;m going to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going to kill all the folks you dislike?&rdquo; asked  Barry, indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe. If I dislike them enough. But that Gleason  offends my taste. I can&rsquo;t stand him about. So, as I say, I&rsquo;m going to kill him.  And I hold that the impulse that drives me to the deed is the strongest murder  motive a man can have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rubbish, Manning,&rdquo; and young Monroe gave  him a frightened glance, as if he thought Pollard in earnest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t altogether rubbish,&rdquo; said Doctor Davenport,  as he rose to go, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a grain of truth in Pollard&rsquo;s contention. A rooted  dislike of another is a bad thing to have in your system. Have it cut out,  Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean it, did you, Manning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monroe spoke diffidently, almost shyly, with a scared  glance at Pollard.</p>
  <p>The latter turned and looked at him with a smile.  Then, glaring ferociously, he growled, &ldquo;Of course I did! And if you get  yourself disliked, I&rsquo;ll kill you, too! <i>Booh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all laughed at Monroe&rsquo;s frightened jump, as  Pollard Booh&rsquo;d into his face, and Doctor Davenport said, &ldquo;Look out, Pollard,  don&rsquo;t scare our young friend into fits! And, remember, Monroe, &lsquo;Threatened men  live long?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve my car&mdash;anybody want a lift anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take me, will you?&rdquo; said Dean Monroe, and willingly  enough, Doctor Davenport carried the younger man off in his car.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to do it, Pol, you know,&rdquo; Barry gently  remonstrated. &ldquo;Poor little Monroe thinks you&rsquo;re a gory villain, and he&rsquo;ll mull  over your fool remarks till he&rsquo;s crazy&mdash;more crazy than he is already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; said Pollard, smiling indifferently. &ldquo;I  only spoke the truth&mdash;as to that motive, I mean. Don&rsquo;t you want to kill that  Gleason every time you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make him seem like a cat&mdash;with nine or more lives!  How <i>can</i> you kill a man every time you see him? It isn&rsquo;t done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men left the Club together, and walked briskly  down Fifth Avenue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going to the Lindsays&rsquo; to-night, of course?&rdquo; asked  Barry, as they reached Forty-fifth Street, where he turned off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. See you later, then. You gather that Gleason has  annexed the pretty Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks like it, doesn&rsquo;t it? I suppose the announcement  will be made to-night at the dinner or the dance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose so. How I hate to see it that way. I&rsquo;m in  love with that little beauty myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; returned Pollard, smiling, and then Barry  turned off in his own street, and Pollard went on down toward his home, a small  hotel on West Fortieth.</p>
  <p>Held up for a few moments by the great tide of traffic  at Forty-second Street, he glanced at his wrist watch and found it was ten  minutes after six. And then, a taxicab passed him, and in it he saw Phyllis  Lindsay. She did not see him, however, so, the traffic signal being given, he  went on his way.</p>

    The Telephone Call</b></h2>
  <p>Every hour of every twenty-four is filled with amazing  occurrences and startling episodes. Astonishing incidents and even more  startling coincidences are happening every minute of every sixty minutes, but  the fact that those most interested are unaware of these deeds is what makes  the great cases of mystery.</p>
  <p>Only an omniscient eye that could see all the  activities of the few hours following the events just related could pierce the  veil of doubt and uncertainty that overhung the ensuing tragedy.</p>
  <p>The first human being to receive news of it was Miss  Hester Jordan.</p>
  <p>This capable and efficient young woman was the office  nurse of Doctor Davenport, and her position was no sinecure.</p>
  <p>Of a highly nervous temperament, she yet managed to  preserve the proper calm and poise that nurses should always show, except when,  at the end of a long, hard day, she became mentally and physically exhausted.</p>
  <p>Though supposed to be off duty at six o&rsquo;clock, her  relief was frequently late in arriving and in this instance had not yet put in  an appearance, though it was half past the hour.</p>
  <p>Wearily, Miss Jordan answered telephone calls,  striving to keep her tired voice pleasant and amiable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she would answer the anxious speakers, &ldquo;Doctor  Davenport is not in.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I expect him soon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you leave a message?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yes, I will tell him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will surely be in by seven.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, he left no  message for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know exactly where he is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will let you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Replies of this sort, over and over, strained her  nerves to their furthest tension, and when at six-forty the telephone bell jangled  again she took the receiver from its hook with what was almost a jerk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said, unable to keep utter exasperation  out of her voice.</p>
  <p>But instead of a summons from some impatient patient,  she heard a faint voice say, &ldquo;Come, Doctor&mdash;oh, come quick&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m done for&mdash;shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were more incoherent words, but Nurse Jordan  couldn&rsquo;t catch them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she cried, alert now. &ldquo;Who is  speaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gleason,&rdquo; came back the faint voice. &ldquo;Wash&rsquo;&mdash;t&rsquo;n  Square&mdash;come&mdash;can&rsquo;t you come quick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could get no more. The voice ceased, and only  blank silence met her frantic queries.</p>
  <p>She hung up her receiver, and a sudden realization of  the situation came to her. She seemed to see the scene&mdash;somebody shot&mdash;somebody  telephoning that he was shot&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s voice getting weaker and ceasing to  sound at all&mdash;the picture was too much for her tired brain, and she buried her  face in her hands and sobbed hysterically from sheer nervous excitement.</p>
  <p>Only for a moment did she give way. Nurse Jordan&rsquo;s  training and personality was not to be conquered by a sudden shock of any sort.</p>
  <p>Pulling herself together, she set to work to find the  doctor.</p>
  <p>This meant telephoning to two or three places where  she knew there was a chance of locating him.</p>
  <p>And at the third call she found him at Mrs Ballard&rsquo;s,  and, though still shaken and quivering, she controlled her voice and told him  distinctly of the tragic telephone call she had taken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gleason!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, &ldquo;Washington Square? What  number?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Nurse Jordan didn&rsquo;t know, and Doctor Davenport had  to call up somebody to inquire.</p>
  <p>He tried Mrs Lindsay, who was Gleason&rsquo;s sister, but  her wire was busy and after an impatient moment, Davenport called Pollard, at  his hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he cried, handing the receiver to a staring  butler, &ldquo;take this and when the gentleman answers, ask him the address of  Robert Gleason. Tell him Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s inquiring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He then returned to the prescription he had been  writing, and gave it to Mrs Ballard, who was indignant at having her interview  with her doctor intruded upon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call to-morrow,&rdquo; he soothed her; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be  better in the morning. Let fish alone, and stick to simple diet for a few days.  Get that address, Jenkins?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the butler gave him a slip of paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;near Washington Square, not on it,&rdquo; he murmured,  looking at the written number, and then he ran down the Ballard front steps,  and jumping into his waiting car, gave his chauffeur Gleason&rsquo;s address.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he thought, as his car rolled down  Fifth Avenue. &ldquo;Accident, I suppose. Jordan is always on edge this time of  night. Have to take her excitement with a grain of salt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But when he reached the house, and pushed the button  that indicated McIlvaine&rsquo;s apartment, there was no response from the closed  street door.</p>
  <p>He rang again, long and insistently, then, still  getting no encouragement, he pushed another button.</p>
  <p>The door gave a grudging grunt, and, unwillingly, as  it seemed, moved slowly inward.</p>
  <p>Doctor Davenport was half way up the first flight of  stairs, when a woman&rsquo;s head appeared through a doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she inquired, a little crisply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr McIlvaine&rsquo;s apartment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, opposite,&rdquo; she returned, more affable as  she caught sight of the good-looking man. &ldquo;Mr Gleason&rsquo;s in there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the man I want. Thank you, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She still stood, watching, as he rang the doorbell of  the designated apartment.</p>
  <p>There was no answer, nor any sound from inside. The  doctor looked apprehensively at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your key wouldn&rsquo;t let me in, I suppose,&rdquo; he said,  turning back to the now frankly curious spectator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, no! We don&rsquo;t have interchangeable keys!  He&rsquo;s out, I expect. He&rsquo;s mostly out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I want to get into his place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do! And he not there! You a friend of his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes; I&rsquo;m his doctor&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;that. But look here&mdash;if you&rsquo;re his doctor, why  didn&rsquo;t you know which was his place? You&rsquo;re pretty slick, mister, but it&rsquo;s a  bit fishy&mdash;I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She half withdrew back into her own doorway, but  curiosity still detained her, and, too, Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s demeanor impressed  her as being quite all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong&mdash;is there?&rdquo; she whispered, coming across  the small hall, and peering into the doctor&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;I think not. But he may be helpless, and I  must get in. I&rsquo;ve never been here before, but I&rsquo;ve been called by him just now.  I <i>must</i> get in. Where&rsquo;s the janitor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where, indeed? If you can find him, I&rsquo;ll bless you  forever. I&rsquo;ve wanted him all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he on duty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning of duty. It&rsquo;s something  he&rsquo;s never on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled at him, and noticing her for the first  time, Davenport saw that she was handsome, in a careless, rather blatant way.</p>
  <p>Her ash-blonde hair was loosely pinned up, and her  dress&mdash;negligee or tea-gown&mdash;was fussy with lace, and not quite immaculate.</p>
  <p>Her wide, light blue eyes returned his scrutiny, and  for an instant each studied the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is something wrong,&rdquo; she nodded, at last, &ldquo;What  you going to do, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get in. I&rsquo;ve wasted precious time  already.&rdquo; He ran down the stairs and opening the front door summoned his  chauffeur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come up here, Chris,&rdquo; he ordered, and the two  returned together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can we break in that door?&rdquo; he said, ignoring the  woman now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; she volunteered, but Chris was  already delivering effective blows.</p>
  <p>However, the lock held, and turning to her, Doctor  Davenport said, &ldquo;Do ask your husband to help us, please. I assure you it&rsquo;s an  emergency. I&rsquo;m Doctor Ely Davenport.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come here, Jim,&rdquo; she obeyed orders. &ldquo;This is Doctor  Davenport.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of you,&rdquo; said a big, commonplace looking  man, appearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mansfield. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have reason to think Mr Gleason is very ill. He  just telephoned for me. I must get in. These old doors are strongly built, so  I&rsquo;d like your help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mansfield looked at him sharply, and seeming  satisfied, put his shoulder to the door.</p>
  <p>United effort succeeded, and the three men entered,  the woman hanging back in fear.</p>
  <p>Gleason lay on the floor, in a crumpled heap, and the  first glance proclaimed him dead.</p>
  <p>Stooping quickly, Doctor Davenport felt for his heart,  and shook his head as he rose again to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Shot through the  temple. Suicide, apparently, as the door was locked on the inside. Better take  your wife away, Mr Mansfield. She&rsquo;ll be getting hysterical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared the lady referred to, but she  was quite evidently pulling herself together. &ldquo;Let me come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; forbade Davenport. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no call in here. Go  back home, both of you. I shall send for the police and wait till they come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the doctor hesitated as he was about to touch the  telephone.</p>
  <p>The matter was mysterious. &ldquo;Suicide, of course,&rdquo; he  ruminated, as he remembered the message received by Nurse Jordan. &ldquo;Shot  himself, then, still living, cried to me for help. Wish I knew exactly what he  said to Jordan. But, anyway, I&rsquo;m not going to disturb things&mdash;there may be  trouble ahead. Guess I&rsquo;ll leave the telephone alone&mdash;and everything else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit right here, Chris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t move or  stir. Look around all you like&mdash;note anything and everything that strikes you.  I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Closing the broken door behind him, he went to the  Mansfield&rsquo;s apartment and asked to use their telephone. On this, he called the  police, while the two listened eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did he do it?&rdquo; broke out Mrs Mansfield, as the  receiver was hung up. &ldquo;Oh, Doctor, tell us something about it! I&rsquo;m eaten alive  with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her big blue eyes shone with excitement, which her  husband tried to suppress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, be quiet, Dottie,&rdquo; he said, laying a hand on her  shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be quiet,&rdquo; and she shook off the hand.  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a great big mystery right in my own house&mdash;on my own floor&mdash;and you say,  &lsquo;be quiet!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got a right to know all about it, and I&rsquo;m going to! I&rsquo;m going  up now, to tell Mrs Conway!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her husband held her back forcibly, but Doctor  Davenport said, &ldquo;Of course, it must become known, and if Mrs Mansfield enjoys  spreading the news, I suppose she has a right to do so. No one may enter the  Gleason rooms, though&mdash;understand that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, then, Dottie,&rdquo; Mansfield said; &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;d  better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very excitable,&rdquo; he sighed, as his wife ran up  the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s better off, unburdening her news, than being  thwarted,&rdquo; said the doctor, indifferently. &ldquo;Let her do what she likes. What can  you tell me, Mr Mansfield, of your neighbor, Gleason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much, Doctor. He kept to himself, as far as the  people in this house were concerned. We didn&rsquo;t know him socially&mdash;no one in the  house did&mdash;and though he said good-day, if we met in the halls, it was with a  short and unsocial manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody actively disliked him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody knew him well enough for that&mdash;unless&mdash;well, no,  I may say none of us knew him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you hesitated,&rdquo; the doctor looked at him keenly;  &ldquo;why did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A mere passing thought&mdash;better left unspoken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Mr Mansfield&mdash;perhaps you are wise. But, if  asked to, you&rsquo;d better speak your thought to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. I&rsquo;m a law-abiding citizen&mdash;I hope. Will they  be here soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing happens soon in matters like this. It&rsquo;s  delay, linger and wait on the part of everybody. I&rsquo;m bothered&mdash;I&rsquo;ve important  affairs on hand&mdash;but here I must stick, till the arm of the law gets ready to  strike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Davenport returned to Gleason&rsquo;s apartment, where the  stolid Chris kept guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the doctor, glancing at his man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks like a suicide to me, sir. Looks like he shot  himself&mdash;there&rsquo;s the revolver&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t touched it. And then he fell over all in  a heap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems he telephoned after he shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did? How could he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look again at his position. Near the desk, on which  the telephone sits. He might have shot, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that shot in his temple!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but there may be another. I haven&rsquo;t looked  carefully yet. Ah, yes&mdash;see, Chris, here&rsquo;s another bullet hole, in his left  shoulder. Say, he fired that shot, then, getting cold feet, called off the  suicide idea and telephoned for me. Then, getting desperate again, fired a  second shot through his temple, which, of course, did for him&mdash;oh, a fanciful  tale, I know&mdash;but, you see, the detective work isn&rsquo;t up to me. When the police  come they&rsquo;ll look after that and I can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the police, arriving, were very much interested in  this theory of Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Prescott, an alert young detective, who came with the  inspector especially interested the physician by his keen-witted and clearly  put questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know this man?&rdquo; he asked among his first  queries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Davenport, &ldquo;but not well. I&rsquo;ve never  been here before. He&rsquo;s Robert Gleason, a very rich man, from Seattle. Staying  here this winter, in this apartment which belongs to McIlvaine, a friend of  Gleason&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s McIlvaine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In California. Gleason took over the place, furnished  and all, for the winter months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any relatives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; Davenport hated to drag in the Lindsays, but it  had to be done. &ldquo;His sister, Mrs Lindsay, lives in upper Park Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you called her up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I thought wiser to do nothing, until you people  came. Also, I&rsquo;m a very busy man, and outside my actual duty here, I can&rsquo;t  afford to spend much time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. Then the sister is the only relative in New  York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so. There are two Lindsay children, but  they&rsquo;re not hers. She married a widower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. And the address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor Davenport gave it, and then started to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, please,&rdquo; urged Prescott. &ldquo;Had the dead  man any friends, that you know of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Many of them. He was put up at the  Camberwell Club, by McIlvaine himself. And he had many friends among the  members.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Names?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor Davenport thought quickly, and decided to give  no names of the group that had been with Gleason that same afternoon.</p>
  <p>He gave the names of three other Club members, and  sending Chris down ahead, again endeavored to depart himself.</p>
  <p>Again Prescott detained him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, Doc,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re here  now, and something tells me it&rsquo;ll be hard to get hold of you again, once I lose  you. Inspector Gale, here, is putting through the necessary red tape and all  that, and he&rsquo;ll see to notifying relatives and friends, and he&rsquo;ll take charge  of the premises&mdash;but&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve a hunch, this isn&rsquo;t a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, murder?&rdquo; cried the doctor, his quick acceptance  of the suggestion proving the thought had been in his own mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you never can tell. And I want to get all the  sidelight on the case I can. Was Mr Gleason happy&mdash;and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; so far as I know. I tell you I was not an  intimate&mdash;scarcely enough to be called a friend&mdash;merely an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. Had the man any enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The direct glance that accompanied these words  discomfited Davenport a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me that?&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;How  should I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a thing anybody might know&mdash;even a mere  acquaintance. And your desperate hurry to get away makes me think you don&rsquo;t  take kindly to this catechism.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish! I&rsquo;m a busy man&mdash;a doctor sometimes is. I&rsquo;ve  numerous and important engagements for the evening. Now, if that&rsquo;s  incriminating, make the most of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fie, fie, don&rsquo;t get peeved! Now, tell me once again,  what the injured man said to your nurse and I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the exact words. I&rsquo;ve not seen her. But  he called my office, said he was shot, and for me to come right here and  quickly. That&rsquo;s all I know of the message. Now as to my report&mdash;it&rsquo;s that the  man received two shots&mdash;whether by his own hand or another&rsquo;s. One, in his left  shoulder&mdash;and another&mdash;the fatal one&mdash;through his temple, producing instant death.  You can get me at any time&mdash;if necessary. But I don&rsquo;t want to be hauled over  here, or summoned to headquarters to repeat these facts. I&rsquo;ll send a typed  report, and I&rsquo;ll do anything in reason&mdash;but I know how you detectives mull over  things, and how your slow processes eat up time&mdash;which though it seems of little  account to you, is mighty valuable to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;yes, sir. Now if you&rsquo;ll speak to Inspector  Gale a minute, you can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grunting an assent, Davenport waited for the Inspector  to finish writing a bit of memorandum on which he was busily engaged.</p>
  <p>The doctor was sitting in a big easy chair, and as he  squirmed impatiently, he felt something soft beneath his heavy frame.</p>
  <p>Feeling about the chair cushions, he found it was fur,  and a fleeting thought that he had sat on a cat passed through his mind.</p>
  <p>A second later he knew it was a fur strip, probably a  neck piece, doubtless belonging to some woman.</p>
  <p>Now, the doctor had a very soft place in his heart for  the feminine sex in general, and his mind leaped to the idea of this fur, left  there by some indiscreet girl visitor, and the possibility of its getting the  doubtless innocent young lady into a moil of trouble.</p>
  <p>Also, he had a dim, indistinct notion that he recognized  the fur, at which he had stolen a furtive look.</p>
  <p>At any rate, unseen by the Inspector or either of his  two colleagues present, Davenport adroitly slipped the small fur collar into  his capacious overcoat pocket, and sat, looking as innocent of duplicity as a  canary-fed cat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Doctor,&rdquo; and Inspector Gale frowned importantly,  &ldquo;this may be a simple case of suicide, and again it may not. So, I want your  opinion as to whether it is possible that both those shots were fired by Mr  Gleason himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite possible, Inspector, and, it seems to me,  decidedly probable, as I cannot see how the victim could have telephoned, with  a murderer in the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s apparently true, but we have to think of even  the remotest possibilities. If the murderer&mdash;granting there was one&mdash;had been  merely intending to frighten his victim, maybe a robber, he might have been&mdash;and  if after that call for help, the intruder finished off his victim&mdash;oh, well, all  these ideas must be looked into, you know. The case is not entirely clear to  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor to me,&rdquo; returned Davenport, &ldquo;but I cannot feel  that I can help you in your deductions. Answering your questions, I say it  would have been quite possible for Mr Gleason to have fired those two shots  himself. You see the first one hit his left shoulder, leaving his right arm  available to fire the second shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did he merely maim himself first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens, man! I don&rsquo;t know. Missed aim, perhaps&mdash;or,  just shooting for practice! Such questions make me mad! If you want any more  medical statements, say so&mdash;if not, for goodness&rsquo; sake, let me go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, let him go,&rdquo; repeated Prescott,  and Dr Davenport went.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some mess,&rdquo; Prescott said, after the doctor&rsquo;s angry  footsteps tramped down the stairs.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter  III<br>
    The Lindsays</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure no one in this building knew Mr Gleason  any better than you two did?&rdquo; Prescott asked of the Mansfields, as he put them  through a course of questioning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Mrs Mansfield informed him, volubly, &ldquo;and we  didn&rsquo;t know him much, but being on the same floor&mdash;there are only two apartments  on each floor, we saw him once in a while, going in or out, and he would bow  distantly, and mumble &lsquo;good-morning,&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard no noise from his apartment, during the  last hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I wasn&rsquo;t noticing. It&rsquo;s across the hall, you  know, and the walls are thick in these old houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was he going out, do you think?&rdquo; asked Jim Mansfield,  thoughtfully. &ldquo;He always went out to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably he was, then. It&rsquo;s evident he was  dressing&mdash;he was in his shirtsleeves&mdash;his day shirt&mdash;and his evening clothes were  laid out on the bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As nearly as I can make out, he telephoned for the  doctor about quarter before seven. He must have expired shortly after. As I  figure it&mdash;oh, well, the medical examiner is in there now, and I don&rsquo;t want to  discuss the details until he gets through his examination. It&rsquo;s an interesting  case, but I&rsquo;m only out for side evidence. What about Gleason&rsquo;s visitors? Did he  have many?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; offered Mrs Mansfield, &ldquo;but he had some. I&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;well,  people go in there, and he was mighty glad to see them, judging by the gay  laughter and chatter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;lady friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Mansfield smiled, but her husband said quickly,  &ldquo;Shut up, Dottie! You talk too much! You&rsquo;ll get us involved in this case, and  make a lot of trouble. He had callers occasionally, Mr Prescott, but we never  knew who they were and we&rsquo;ve no call to remark on them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I give you the call. Don&rsquo;t you see, man, your  information may be vitally necessary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here Prescott was recalled to the Gleason apartment.</p>
  <p>The medical examiner had concluded his task. He agreed  with Doctor Davenport that the shots could have been fired by Gleason himself,  though, but for the locked door, he should have thought them the acts of  another person. The presence of powder stains proved that the shots were fired  at close range, but not necessarily by the dead man himself.</p>
  <p>Still, the door being locked on the inside, it looked  like suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Prescott disagreed, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t cut any ice.  You see, it&rsquo;s a spring catch. It fastens itself when closed. If an intruder was  here and went out again, closing that door behind him, it would have locked  itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; assented Gale. &ldquo;So, it may be suicide  or murder. But we&rsquo;ll find out which. We&rsquo;ve hardly begun to investigate yet.  Now, we must let his sister know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty awful to spring it on her over the  telephone,&rdquo; demurred Prescott, as Gale started for the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got to be done,&rdquo; Inspector Gale declared, &ldquo;I mean  we&rsquo;ve got to tell somebody who knew him. How about those men at the Club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; consented Prescott. &ldquo;Just call the  Camberwell Club, and get any one of those Davenport mentioned. But, I say,  Gale, use the Mansfields&rsquo; telephone. I&rsquo;m saving up this one for fingerprint  work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your fingerprint work!&rdquo; Gale grumbled.  &ldquo;You attach too much importance to that, Prescott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, but you let the telephone alone. And the  revolver, too. Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t have those touched for anything! I&rsquo;ll get them  photographed to-morrow. Shall I call the Club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grunted Gale, and Prescott went back to the  opposite apartment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry to trouble you people,&rdquo; he said, with his  winning smile, &ldquo;but if you object, say so, and I&rsquo;ll run out to a drug store.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None around here,&rdquo; vouchsafed Mansfield, looking a  little annoyed at the intrusion, however. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a telephone in the  Gleason rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but I don&rsquo;t want to use that.&rdquo; Prescott had  already taken up the Mansfield receiver. &ldquo;Please let me have this one,&rdquo; and a  bright smile at Dottie Mansfield made her his ally.</p>
  <p>Getting the Club, Prescott asked for the names  Davenport had supplied. Only one man was available, and Mr Harper was finally  connected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Robert Gleason has been found dead in his home,&rdquo;  Prescott stated; &ldquo;and as you&rsquo;re said to be a friend of his, I&rsquo;m asking you to  inform his sister, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t! Why should I be asked to do such an  unpleasant errand? I&rsquo;ve merely a nodding acquaintance with Mr Gleason. Dead,  you say? Apoplexy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! Murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. Murder or suicide. I&rsquo;m Detective  Prescott. I want you to tell his sister, or advise me how best to break the  news to her. She&rsquo;s Mrs Lindsay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I know. Well, now, let me see. Dead! Why,  the man was here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; apparently he returned home safely, and while  dressing for dinner, either shot himself or was shot by some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never shot himself in the world! Robert Gleason? No,  never shot himself. Well, let me see&mdash;let me see. Suppose you call up some  closer friend of his. Really, I knew him but slightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Who was his nearest friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. He wasn&rsquo;t long on intimate  friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little liked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&mdash;but close friends, now&mdash;let me  see; he was talking this afternoon with a bunch&mdash;Doctor Davenport, Phil Barry,  Dean Monroe, Manning Pollard&mdash;oh, yes, Fred Lane. And maybe others. But I know I  saw him in the group I&rsquo;ve just mentioned. Call up Davenport.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me the next best one to call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry&mdash;but wait&mdash;they had a quarrel recently. Try Lane  or Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Addresses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were given and as soon as he could get  connection, Prescott called Pollard.</p>
  <p>But he was out, and Philip Barry was also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t expect to get anybody at the dinner hour,&rdquo;  Prescott said, and looked at his watch. &ldquo;After eight, already. One more throw,  and then I make straight for the sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fred Lane proved available.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed at the news Prescott told. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t mean it! Why I was talking with him yesterday. And only to-night I  heard&mdash;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he pulled himself together. &ldquo;Tell me the details. Can I do  anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sure can. Break it to Mrs Lindsay, Gleason&rsquo;s  sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not that! Don&rsquo;t ask me to. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m no good at  that sort of thing. I say&mdash;let me off it. Get somebody else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to, and I can&rsquo;t. If you won&rsquo;t do it,  I&rsquo;ll have to call up the lady and tell her myself&mdash;or go there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Go there. And, I say, get her son&mdash;her  stepson, you know&mdash;young Lindsay. He&rsquo;s not related to Gleason&mdash;and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Fine idea. I&rsquo;ll see the young man. What&rsquo;s  his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis Lindsay. There&rsquo;s a girl, too. Miss Phyllis.  She&rsquo;s more of a man than her brother&mdash;oh, not a masculine type at all&mdash;I don&rsquo;t  mean that, but she&rsquo;s a whole lot stronger character than the chappie. It might  be better to tell her. But do as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for the information, Mr Lane. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, wait a minute. Do you think Gleason killed  himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno yet. Lots of things to be looked into. I don&rsquo;t  think it will be a difficult case to handle, yet it has its queer points. Did  you say you heard something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out with it, man. Better tell anything you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know anything. You going to the Lindsays&rsquo; now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a dinner party on there. A big  one&mdash;followed by a dance. I mean it was to have been followed by a dance. Your  news will change their plans!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather unconcerned yourself! Didn&rsquo;t you like  Gleason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not overly. Yet he was a big man in many ways. But,  come now, wasn&rsquo;t he bumped off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying. But while you&rsquo;re at the Lindsays&rsquo;,  look out Dean Monroe&mdash;and ask him what he knows about it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dean Monroe! The artist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, he isn&rsquo;t the criminal&mdash;if there <i>is</i> a  criminal. But maybe he can give you a tip. I&rsquo;m mighty interested. How can I  hear the result of your investigations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;ll be in the morning papers. Anyway, I may  want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; call me up or call on me whenever you  like. I&rsquo;m interested&mdash;a whole lot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better go right to the Lindsay house,&rdquo;  Prescott said, going back to the Gleason apartment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big party on  there, and it ought to be stopped. It&rsquo;s an awkward situation. You see, Mrs  Lindsay, Gleason&rsquo;s sister, has two step-children&mdash;they&rsquo;re having the party, as I  make it out. But they&rsquo;ve got to be told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Gale; &ldquo;go along, Prescott. And you&rsquo;d  better have somebody with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at first. Let me handle it alone, and I can call  Briggs if I want him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, then. The sooner we start something the  better. I incline more and more to the murder theory, but if the sister thinks  there was any reason for suicide&mdash;well, run along, Prescott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott ran along, and reached the Lindsay home, on  upper Park Avenue, shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>He was admitted by a smiling maid, and he asked for Mr  Lindsay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still at dinner,&rdquo; she returned, doubtfully,  glancing at Prescott&rsquo;s informal dress. &ldquo;Can you come some other time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the matter is urgent. You must ask him to leave  the table and come to me here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His manner was imperative, and the maid went on her  errand.</p>
  <p>In a moment Louis Lindsay came to Prescott, where the  detective waited, in the reception hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, my man?&rdquo; said Lindsay, looking  superciliously at his visitor. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Mr Lindsay. Listen, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noting the grave face and serious voice of the  speaker, young Lindsay seemed to become panic-stricken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said, in a gasping whisper. &ldquo;Oh, what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you look like that?&rdquo; Prescott said quickly.  &ldquo;What do you <i>think</i> it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure! Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy, for he was little more than a boy, was  ghastly white, his hands trembled and his lips quivered. He took hold of a  chair back to steady himself, and Prescott, remembering what he had been told  of Miss Lindsay, was tempted to ask for her. But he somehow felt he must go on  with this scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your uncle&mdash;or rather your step-uncle&mdash;Mr  Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lindsay slumped into a chair, and raised his wild,  staring black eyes to Prescott&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;what about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you expect him here to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t come&mdash;what is it? Has anything  happened? What has happened? Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did what?&rdquo; Prescott flung the words at him, in a  fierce low tone. &ldquo;What do you know? Out with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His menacing air quite finished the young man, and he  buried his face in his hands, sobbing convulsively.</p>
  <p>A slight rustle was heard, and a lovely vision  appeared in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; said a clear young voice. &ldquo;Louis,  what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis Lindsay faced the stranger as she put her  query.</p>
  <p>The sight nearly dazzled Prescott, for Miss Lindsay  was at her best that night.</p>
  <p>She was a little thing, with soft dark hair, bundled  about her ears, soft, dark eyes, that were now challenging Prescott sternly,  and a slim, dainty little figure, robed in sequin-dripping gauze, from which  her soft neck and shoulders rose like a flower from its sheath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, not rudely, but with her  eyes wide in dismay. &ldquo;What are you doing to my brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lindsay?&rdquo; and Prescott bowed politely. &ldquo;I bring  distressing news. Your uncle&mdash;that is, Mr Robert Gleason, is&mdash;has&mdash;well, perhaps  frankness is best&mdash;he is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robert Gleason!&rdquo; Phyllis turned as pale as her  brother, but preserved her calm. &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She, too, placed her little hand on a chair, as if the  grip of something solid helped, and turned her anxious eyes to Prescott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought better to tell you young people,&rdquo; he began,  &ldquo;and let you tell your mother&mdash;Mr Gleason&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I will tell her,&rdquo; said Phyllis, with dignity.  &ldquo;Go on, Mr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prescott,&rdquo; he supplied. &ldquo;The facts in brief are  these. Mr Gleason called up Doctor Davenport on the telephone, and asked the  doctor to come to him, as he was&mdash;well, hurt. When the doctor reached there, Mr  Gleason was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What killed him?&rdquo; Phyllis spoke very quietly, and  looked Prescott straight in the face. Yet the alert eyes of the detective saw  her fingers clench more tightly on the chair, and noticed her red lips lose a  little color as they set themselves in a firm line.</p>
  <p>He thought her even more beautiful thus, than when she  had first arrived, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Medical Examiner is not quite sure, Miss Lindsay.  It may be that he took his own life&mdash;or it may be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That he was&mdash;murdered,&rdquo; she said, her gaze never  wavering from Prescott&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>It was a bit disconcerting, and the detective oddly  felt himself at a disadvantage. Yet he went on, inexorably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; either deduction is possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how was he killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At last her calm gave way a little. The tremor of her  voice as she asked this question proved her not so self-controlled as she had  seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was shot.&rdquo; Prescott watched both brother and  sister as he spoke. But Louis still kept his face hidden in his hands, and  Phyllis was once more perfectly calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What with?&rdquo; she went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His own revolver. It was found close beside the body,  and so as I said, it might have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what you said.&rdquo; Phyllis interrupted him  impatiently, as if deeming repetition of the theories unnecessary. &ldquo;How shall  we tell Millicent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs Lindsay?&rdquo; asked Prescott respectfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; we have never called her mother, of course.&rdquo; She  looked at Louis. &ldquo;Go to your rooms, if you wish, Buddy,&rdquo; she said, kindly, and  Prescott marveled at this slight, dainty young thing taking the situation into  her own hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stand by,&rdquo; Louis muttered, as he rose  slowly. &ldquo;What shall we do? Call her out here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would do,&rdquo; said Prescott, &ldquo;or take her to some  other room. The guests must be told&mdash;and the party&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The party broken up and the guests sent home&mdash;&rdquo;  Phyllis declared. &ldquo;But first, let&rsquo;s tell Millicent. She&rsquo;ll be terribly upset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At Phyllis&rsquo; dictation, Prescott and young Lindsay went  into the little library. Like the other rooms this was beflowered for the party  and scant of furniture, for dancing purposes. The Lindsay apartment was a fine  one, yet not over large, and sounds of conversation and light laughter came  from the dining room. Phyllis quickly brought Mrs Lindsay from the dinner  table, and they joined the men.</p>
  <p>As the girl had predicted, her stepmother was greatly  shocked and her nerves utterly upset by Prescott&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>The detective said little after outlining the facts,  but listened closely while these members of the family talked. Though there on  the ungracious errand of breaking the sad news, he was also eagerly anxious to  learn any hints as to the solution of the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, he never killed himself!&rdquo; declared the  dead man&rsquo;s sister. &ldquo;Why should he? He had everything life can offer to live  for. He was rich, talented, and engaged to Phyllis, whom he adored&mdash;worshipped!  How can any one think he would kill himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the evidence is uncertain,&rdquo; Prescott began; &ldquo;you  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course the evidence is uncertain,&rdquo; Phyllis broke  in. &ldquo;It always is uncertain! You detectives don&rsquo;t know evidence when you see  it! Or you read it wrongly and make false deductions!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Phyllis,&rdquo; remonstrated her brother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk  like that! You may&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated a long time, &ldquo;you may make trouble,&rdquo; he  concluded, lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble, how?&rdquo; Prescott caught him up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say another word, Louis,&rdquo; Phyllis ordered  him. &ldquo;You keep still. Millicent, you go to your room, and let Martha look after  you. Louis, you either go to your room&mdash;or, if you stay here, don&rsquo;t babble.  Mind, now! Mr Prescott, we must tell the guests. Come with me and we will tell  those at the table. They will go home, and those who come later can be told at  the door and sent away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Lindsay,&rdquo; Prescott replied, feeling  that here was a strength of character he had never seen equaled in such a mere  slip of a girl!</p>
  <p>They went to the dining room, and without preamble,  Phyllis said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, people. I&rsquo;ve very bad news. Mr Gleason&mdash;Robert  Gleason&mdash;has just been found dead in his home. He was shot&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice, steady  till this moment, suddenly broke down, and as her eyes filled with tears,  Philip Barry, who had already risen, hastened to her side.</p>
  <p>There was a general commotion, the ladies rising now,  and with scared faces, whispering to one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; Prescott spoke, as some seemed about  to leave; &ldquo;I must ask you all if you know anything of importance concerning the  movements of Mr Gleason this afternoon or evening. I am a detective, the case  is a little mysterious, and it may be necessary to question some of you. Will  any one volunteer information?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nobody did so, and Prescott, steeling himself against  the entreaties of Phyllis that all be allowed to depart, asked several of their  knowledge of the man.</p>
  <p>Most of these declared they were unacquainted with Mr  Gleason&rsquo;s whereabouts on that day, and some denied knowing the man at all.  These were allowed to go, and at last, Prescott found himself surrounded by the  men who knew Gleason and who had seen him that very day.</p>
  <p>These included Barry, Pollard and Monroe, of the group  that had talked together at the Club in the afternoon, and one or two others  who had seen Gleason during the day.</p>
  <p>Each was questioned as to the probability, in his  opinion, of Robert Gleason having shot himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make a decision,&rdquo; Philip Barry said; &ldquo;to my  mind, Gleason would be quite capable of doing any crazy or impulsive thing. He  may have had a fit of depression, he sometimes did, and feeling extra blue, may  have wanted to end it all. But, also it&rsquo;s quite on the cards that somebody did  for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Mr Barry?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you asked me for my opinion,&rdquo; was the retort.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. I would believe anything of Gleason. I&rsquo;m not knocking him&mdash;but he  was a freak&mdash;eccentric, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not quite that,&rdquo; Dean Monroe spoke very  seriously. &ldquo;Mr Gleason was a Westerner, and had different ideas from some of  ours, but he was a good sort&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good sort!&rdquo; scoffed Barry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what you  call a bad sort, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Phil,&rdquo; Phyllis said, quietly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like  that of a man who is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Phyllis, I forgot myself. Well, Mr  Prescott, I can only say you&rsquo;ll have to solve your mystery on the evidence you  find; for I assure you Mr Gleason would fit into almost any theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott questioned Dean Monroe next, remembering what  Lane had told him over the telephone.</p>
  <p>But, though interested, Monroe told nothing definitely  suggestive, and at last Prescott said, directly, &ldquo;Do you know anything, Mr  Monroe, that makes you suspect that Mr Gleason might have been killed by an intruder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, no,&rdquo; stammered the young artist, quite  palpably prevaricating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you do, and I must remind you that I have a  right to demand the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Monroe looked positively frightened,  &ldquo;then&mdash;I say, Manning, maybe it&rsquo;ll be better for me to speak out&mdash;I heard  somebody say to-day, that he meant to&mdash;to kill Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; and Prescott, accustomed as he was to  surprises, stared wonderingly at the speaker. &ldquo;And who said that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Monroe obstinately shook his head and spoke no  word.</p>
  <p>Philip Barry raised his head with a jerk and looked  straight at Manning Pollard.</p>
  <p>Pollard&rsquo;s face was white, and his voice not quite  steady, but he stated, &ldquo;I said it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Prescott, simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, because&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;didn&rsquo;t like Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so you killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not obliged to incriminate myself, am I?&rdquo;  Pollard looked at him coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where were you between six and seven this evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I refuse to tell,&rdquo; Pollard answered, with a  belligerent look, and Prescott nodded his head, with a satisfied smile.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter  IV<br>
    Pollard&rsquo;s Threat</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, you know, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Prescott said, &ldquo;you  are incriminating yourself by your refusal to answer my question. No one is as  yet under suspicion of crime&mdash;indeed, it is not certain that a crime has been  committed&mdash;but it is my duty to learn all I can of the circumstances of the  case, and I must ask you what you meant by a threat to kill Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly a threat,&rdquo; Pollard returned,  speaking slowly, and looked decidedly uncomfortable; &ldquo;it was merely a&mdash;a  statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A statement that you would like to&mdash;to see him dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, practically that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t like the man. I took a dislike to  him the first time I saw him, and I never got over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not reason enough to kill a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said I killed him. But I hold it is reason  enough. I hold that an utter detestation of seeing a person around, a positive  irritation at his mere presence, is a stronger motive for murder than the more  obvious ones of jealousy or greed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t jealous of Mr Gleason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard started, the detective had scored that time.</p>
  <p>But he replied, quietly. &ldquo;Not jealous, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Envious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your questions are a bit intrusive, but I think I may  safely say many men were envious of Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he was wealthy, important and of a happy,  satisfied disposition. Truly an enviable person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard&rsquo;s manner was indifferent and his tone light  and flippant. Prescott a judge of human nature and an expert detective,  concluded the man was sparring for time, or trying to camouflage his guilt with  an effect of careless unconcern in the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; he said, seriously, &ldquo;I shall  have to insist on knowing your whereabouts at the time of Mr Gleason&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I refuse to tell you. But, look here, Mr  Prescott, as I understand it, Mr Gleason was found dead in his room, with the  door fastened. How do you argue from that a murderer at all? How could he get  out and lock the door behind him? Where was the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spring catch,&rdquo; Prescott returned, shortly. &ldquo;Snapped  shut as he closed the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Pollard,&rdquo; said Philip Barry, &ldquo;say where  you were at that time. Six to seven, was it? Why, Pol, you were walking down  Fifth Avenue with me. We left the Club together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did we?&rdquo; said Pollard. His face was inscrutable. It  seemed as if he had made up his mind that no information should be gathered  from his words or manner. Prescott, watching him closely thought he had never  seen such a strange man, and decided that he was the criminal he sought, and a  mighty clever one at that.</p>
  <p>Manning Pollard was tall and large, and of fine  presence. He would not be called handsome, but he had a well-shaped head, well  set on his broad shoulders. His special charm was his smile, which, though  rare, was spontaneous and illuminated his face with a real radiance whenever he  saw fit to favor his auditors. However, his expression was usually calm and  thoughtful, while occasionally it became supercilious and even cynical.</p>
  <p>When displeased, Pollard was impossible. He shut up  like a clam and preserved a stony silence or blurted out some caustic, almost  rude speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; went on Barry, eagerly. &ldquo;And I left you  at Forty-fourth Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Pollard, in the same colorless voice.</p>
  <p>Now Philip Barry had little love for Manning Pollard.  To begin with, they were both in love with the same girl, and&mdash;as either of them  would have agreed&mdash;there was no use in going further than that.</p>
  <p>Moreover, they were of widely different temperament.  Barry was all artist; dreamy, impractical, full of enthusiasms and a bit  visionary. Pollard was a hard-headed business man, successful, rich and  influential, but not by any means universally liked, by reason of his sarcastic  and cynical outlook. Yet he was polite and courteous of demeanor, and his  imperturbable calm and unshakable poise gave him an air of superiority that  could not be gainsaid.</p>
  <p>Up to a few months ago the two men had been chums&mdash;were  still&mdash;but the advent of Phyllis Lindsay into their circle had made a  difference.</p>
  <p>For, though many men admired the little beauty,  Pollard and Barry were the most favored and each felt an ever-increasing hope  that he might win her.</p>
  <p>Then along had come Robert Gleason, the brother of  Phyllis&rsquo; stepmother. He was at the Lindsay home continually, and by some means  or for some reason he had persuaded the girl to marry him. At least, he implied  that at the Club in the afternoon, and both Pollard and Barry had been greatly  disturbed thereby.</p>
  <p>But others were also greatly disturbed and the news,  which had flown like wildfire, had caused panic in the breasts of several who  were to attend the dinner or the dance.</p>
  <p>Then had come the dinner, and the unexplained absence  of Gleason. They had telephoned his place twice, but could get no response,  Phyllis told the detective in the course of his questioning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Prescott listened; &ldquo;at what time did you call  him up, Miss Lindsay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, about seven o&rsquo;clock, I think. I was dressing for  dinner, and I happened to think of something I wanted to ask Mr Gleason, and I  called his number. But nobody answered, so I concluded to wait till he arrived  to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the next time? You called him twice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; the next time was when dinner was ready&mdash;about  eight. He wasn&rsquo;t here, and I thought it so strange&mdash;I&mdash;telephoned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo; asked Prescott, quickly, scenting  unexpected information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;I asked one of the guests to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo; Pollard smiled at Phyllis. &ldquo;Miss Lindsay asked  me to telephone to Mr Gleason, and I did, but no one answered the call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The speaker turned his calm eyes to Prescott, and met  the detective&rsquo;s suspicious gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you called, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Prescott asked,  his tone plainly indicating his own doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have said so,&rdquo; Pollard replied, and let his own  glance wander indifferently aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo; Prescott was angered at  Pollard&rsquo;s quite evident lack of interest in his inquiries, and he now spoke  sharply. &ldquo;I believe, Mr Pollard, that you know more than you have told regarding  this matter, and unless you see fit to become more communicative, I shall have  to resort to outside inquiry as to your own movements this evening, prior to  your arrival here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is your privilege,&rdquo; Pollard said, with an  exaggerated politeness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my duty also,&rdquo; Prescott retorted, &ldquo;and I shall  begin right now. You say you left Mr Pollard on Fifth Avenue, Mr Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was ten minutes past,&rdquo; Pollard volunteered, still  with the air of superior knowledge that exasperated Prescott almost beyond  bounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did any one present see Mr Pollard between that time  and his arrival here for dinner?&rdquo; Prescott looked about the room.</p>
  <p>No one responded, and the detective said, curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where do you live, Mr Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the Hotel Crosby, Fortieth Street, near Fifth  Avenue,&rdquo; and this time Pollard gave his questioner one of his best smiles,  which had the effect of embarrassing him greatly.</p>
  <p>But with determination, he took up the telephone and  called the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask for the doorman,&rdquo; said Pollard, helpfully.</p>
  <p>Prescott did, and learned that Mr Pollard was out.  &ldquo;Had he been in?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he had come in soon after six o&rsquo;clock, and had left  again, later, in a taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing more definite could be learned, and Prescott  hung up the receiver, conscious only of a great desire to get down to the hotel  and ask questions before Pollard could get there himself.</p>
  <p>But first, he must look into other matters, and he  turned his attention to the guests who sat round, all looking decidedly  uncomfortable and some very much scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now look here, Mr Prescott,&rdquo; said Pollard, with the  air of one humoring a spoiled child, &ldquo;you have your duty to do&mdash;we all  comprehend that. But can&rsquo;t you satisfy yourself regarding the innocence of most  of these men and women, and let them go home? I assume there will be no dance  this evening, and the troublesome circumstance of sending away the guests who  are yet expected will be about all Miss Lindsay&mdash;and her brother,&rdquo; he added,  with a sudden remembrance of the unhelpful Louis&mdash;&ldquo;can cope with. I will await  your pleasure, as you seem to have picked me out for suspicion, but do get  through with these others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Angry at this good advice, coming from the man he was  questioning, and embarrassed because it was really good advice, Prescott began,  a little sulkily, to take the names and addresses of many of them, and inform  them they were free to leave. He detained any he thought might be useful to  him, and among them he held Barry and Dean Monroe.</p>
  <p>This matter took some time, especially as Prescott was  twice interrupted by telephone.</p>
  <p>Mrs Lindsay and Louis had retired to their rooms, and  Phyllis, at the helm of the situation, proved herself a staunch and capable  upholder of the dignity of the Lindsay family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send away all you can, please, Mr Prescott,&rdquo; she  requested. &ldquo;Mr Pollard is right; I have my hands full. I will give the doorman,  who is from the caterer&rsquo;s, instructions to explain the situation and admit none  of the evening guests. But, I daresay some intimate friends will insist on  coming in. Shall I allow it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better not, Miss Lindsay. You see, there&rsquo;s no use  giving the thing more publicity than you have to. The reporters will come, of  course. Will you see them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no! Let some of the men do that. Mr Pollard,  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer Mr Monroe should,&rdquo; interrupted Prescott,  and winced under Pollard&rsquo;s smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Manning,&rdquo; said Dean Monroe, &ldquo;why do you act like  that! You make people suspect you, whether they want to or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspect all you like, Dean,&rdquo; came the quiet reply;  &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m innocent, suspicion can&rsquo;t hurt me. If I&rsquo;m guilty, I ought to be  suspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did say you intended to kill Gleason,&rdquo; Monroe  repeated, staring at Pollard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer he should be killed right afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mighty queer,&rdquo; agreed Pollard. &ldquo;But are you sure he  was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Prescott. &ldquo;Inspector Gale told me over the  telephone just now, that further investigation proves it is a murder case. I  think, Mr Pollard, I&rsquo;ll ask you to go with me right now to your hotel. I want  to check up your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t told you any story,&rdquo; said Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Prescott shrugged impatiently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  check up the story you didn&rsquo;t tell! Come along. Anybody got a car I can  borrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nobody had, as the guests had all expected to remain  the whole evening. So Prescott called a taxicab, and soon the two started for  Pollard&rsquo;s hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer guy,&rdquo; the detective said, the  semi-darkness in the cab giving him greater freedom of speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo; asked Pollard, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, first, saying you proposed to kill a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not unique. I&rsquo;ve often heard people say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d  like to kill him!&rsquo; or &lsquo;I wish he was dead!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know I meant it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, for sure, but I&rsquo;m going to find out. If you  haven&rsquo;t got an air-tight alibi&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be trouble for yours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any alibi. Guilty people prepare alibis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re cute enough to fix an alibi  that don&rsquo;t look to be fixed! But I&rsquo;ll see through it. Here we are. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A little less dictating, please, Mr Prescott.  Remember, I&rsquo;m not under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;but soon!&rdquo; was the retort as the two men  entered the small, but exclusive, hotel where Manning Pollard made his home.</p>
  <p>The doorman bowed, pleasantly, but not obsequiously,  and Prescott went straight to the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to learn,&rdquo; he said, straightforwardly, &ldquo;all  you can tell me of the movements of Mr Pollard tonight between six and seven  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The clerk at the desk smiled at Pollard and gazed  inquiringly at the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better tell him, Simpson,&rdquo; said Pollard; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a  detective, and he&rsquo;s a right to ask. I&rsquo;m under a cloud&mdash;I think I may call it  that&mdash;and he&rsquo;s going to&mdash;well, clear me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard&rsquo;s smile flashed out, and the desk clerk, in  his turn, smiled at the investigator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, sir,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;what do you want to  know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time did Mr Pollard come in this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time, Henry?&rdquo; the clerk asked the doorman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout quarter past six,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I come on at  six, and I&rsquo;d been here a bit before Mr Pollard came along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; went on Prescott, a little less  certain of his convictions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Went up in the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same elevator boy on now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. The car&rsquo;s up. Be down in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was; and the elevator boy related that he had taken  Mr Pollard up as soon as he came into the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Went right to his room, did he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The woolly-headed one rolled his eyes in  enjoyment of his sudden importance. &ldquo;I knows he did, kase I watched after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did you look after him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No reason, p&rsquo;tikler. Only kase he&rsquo;s such a fine  gentleman. I most allus looks at him march down the hall. He marches like a&mdash;a  platoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He does? And he marched straight to his room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yessuh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you bring him down again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout an hour later, all dressed up in his glad  raggses. Just like he is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so. Now, during that hour do you know that Mr  Pollard didn&rsquo;t leave his room? Didn&rsquo;t go down stairs again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in my car, he didn&rsquo;t. And he always uses my car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask the other boy.&rdquo; Prescott gave this order shortly.  The scene was getting on his nerves. Pollard, quiet, calm, but superior. The  clerk, ready to enjoy the detective&rsquo;s discomfiture, if he failed to prove the  point he was evidently trying hard to make. Black Bob, the elevator boy, his  white teeth all in evidence, and his admiration for Pollard equally plain to be  seen. And even the telephone girl, smirking from her switchboard nearby.</p>
  <p>All of these were in sympathy with Pollard, and  Prescott felt himself a rank outsider. But he persevered.</p>
  <p>Joe, the other elevator boy, declared he had not  carried Mr Pollard up or down that evening, and the clerk said there were but  two cars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Mr Prescott,&rdquo; Pollard adjured him. &ldquo;I have  prepared no air-tight alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did any one here see Mr Pollard in his room,&rdquo; the  detective asked in desperation, and to his surprise a bellhop piped out, &ldquo;I  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; and Prescott turned to him. &ldquo;How did you  happen to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He rang, and I went up there, and he gave me a letter  to mail for him. It was a wide letter, too wide to go in the chute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you mail it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I put it with the stuff for the postman to take. He  hasn&rsquo;t been round yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bellhop did so, while the others looked on.</p>
  <p>It was a large, square envelope addressed to a  business firm downtown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your writing, Mr Pollard?&rdquo; said Prescott, not  knowing, in fact, just what to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pollard, glancing at it. &ldquo;Open it, if you  want to. It&rsquo;s not private business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want to. It looks very much as if you  were in your room during the hour between six and seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does have that appearance,&rdquo; said Pollard, &ldquo;but I  make no claims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He telephoned twice,&rdquo; vouchsafed the girl at the  switchboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo; Prescott wheeled on her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once not very long after he came in&mdash;maybe fifteen or  twenty minutes after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To a Cleaning Establishment. I remember, because I  couldn&rsquo;t get them&mdash;the shop was closed. And then, he telephoned again for a  taxi, when he was ready to go out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About half-past seven&mdash;or maybe a little earlier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Earlier,&rdquo; said the doorman, who had drawn near again.  &ldquo;Not more&rsquo;n twenty past. I put him in the taxi myself. And it wasn&rsquo;t as late as  half past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did he drive to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He &rsquo;most always gives the driver a slip  of paper with the numbers on it&mdash;&rsquo;specially if he&rsquo;s going to more than one  address. He did this tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that taxi man?&rdquo; asked Prescott, feeling his  last prop being pulled from under him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s outside now,&rdquo; said the doorman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting  for a man upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The taxi driver looked at Pollard, nodded  respectfully, and replied to Prescott&rsquo;s queries by saying that Mr Pollard did  give him a memorandum of the places he wanted to go to, and that they were,  first, the Hotel Astor, where he went in for a moment, and came back with some  theater tickets which he was putting in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know he had theater tickets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he had a little pink envelope, and he often  does get tickets there. Next, he stopped at Bard&rsquo;s, the Florist&rsquo;s, and brought  out a small square box with him, and next I took him up to a house on Park  Avenue, and he stayed there, and I came back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Mr Pollard, my duty is done.&rdquo; The  detective looked a respectful apology. &ldquo;But I had to find out all this. And  remember you did make a surprising statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surprising to you, perhaps. But my friends, who know  my eccentricities, weren&rsquo;t surprised at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No? Well, if it&rsquo;s your habit to threaten to kill  people you don&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t call it a threat. To my mind, a  threat is spoken to the intended victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Prescott gazed thoughtfully at the  speaker. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you threaten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t threaten. I merely said I should kill  Gleason some day. It&rsquo;s too late, now, to make good my promise, and you&rsquo;ve  satisfied yourself&mdash;or, haven&rsquo;t you?&mdash;that I didn&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m satisfied. You couldn&rsquo;t be here at home and  in a taxicab doing errands, between six-fifteen and seven-forty-five, and have  any chance to get away long enough to get yourself down to Washington Square  and do up that murder business, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does look that way,&rdquo; Pollard agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  checked me up pretty thoroughly. Now do you want me any further? For, though  I&rsquo;m as good-natured and patient as the average man, I <i>have</i> something  else to do with my time when you&rsquo;re through with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, of course. But, I say, Mr Pollard, can you  give me a hint which way to look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two had drawn aside from the hotel desk, and were  by themselves in an alcove of the lobby. Prescott, eagerly trying to learn  something further from his vindicated suspect&mdash;Pollard, calm and polite, but  quite evidently wishing to get away about his business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; you see I knew Mr Gleason but slightly. I didn&rsquo;t  like him, but I assure you I didn&rsquo;t kill him. And I don&rsquo;t know who did.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter  V<br>
    Mrs Mansfield&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Distrust the obvious, Prescott,&rdquo; said Belknap,  didactically. &ldquo;It is the astute detective&rsquo;s weak point that he cannot see  beyond the apparent&mdash;the evident&mdash;the obvious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Prescott sniffed; &ldquo;distrust the obvious is  as hackneyed a phrase as <i>Cherchez la femme!</i> and about as useful in our  every day work. You make a noise like a Detective Story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re the Big Noise, nowadays,&rdquo; Belknap  returned, unruffled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; and Prescott spoke doggedly, &ldquo;when a  guy says he&rsquo;s going to kill somebody, and that somebody is found croaked a few  hours later, seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems to me, your guy is the last person in the world  to suspect. It&rsquo;s the obvious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, an obvious that I sorta hate to distrust!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense! And you&rsquo;ve disposed of Pollard anyway,  haven&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. Half a dozen people were in touch with  him all through the time of the murder. He&rsquo;s out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott looked as disheartened as he felt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve wasted good time tracking him down, when  you might have been investigating the evidence while it was fresh! I&rsquo;m  disappointed in you, Prescott; you oughtn&rsquo;t to have fallen for a steer like  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap was the Assistant District Attorney, and the  Gleason case seemed to him important and absorbing. In his office the morning  after the murder, he was getting all the information Prescott could give him,  and he was really disgusted with the detective for having followed up the wild  goose chase of Manning Pollard&rsquo;s impulsive speech about the Western  millionaire.</p>
  <p>Belknap was an earnest, honest investigator, not so  much brilliant by deduction as clear-sighted, hard-headed and practical.</p>
  <p>He distrusted the obvious, not so much because of the  hackneyed aphorism as because his own experience had proved to him that nine  times out of ten, or oftener, the obvious was wrong. It must be looked into, of  course, but not to the exclusion of other evidence or the neglect of other  lines of investigation. And now, he felt, the trail had cooled somewhat, and  valuable clews might be lost because of Prescott&rsquo;s conviction of Pollard&rsquo;s  guilt.</p>
  <p>Belknap was of a higher mentality than Pollard, and he  also was a man of more education and refinement. He was especially interested  on this case, for the Lindsays were an exclusive family and kept themselves out  of the limelight of publicity.</p>
  <p>But there were rumors that the lovely daughter was a  harum-scarum, that the son of the house was addicted to bright lights and high  stakes, and that the still young stepmother was quite as fond of social life as  her two charges.</p>
  <p>But never were their names seen on the society columns  or in the gossip papers and now, Belknap reflected, they could be approached by  reporters.</p>
  <p>Indeed, he saw himself admitted to that hitherto  inaccessible home, and in imagination he was already preening himself for the  occasion.</p>
  <p>But Belknap was methodical, and he was preparing to go  at once to the Gleason apartment, to begin his line of investigation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How does Mrs Lindsay act?&rdquo; he allowed himself to ask  as he and Prescott started for Washington Square.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Prescott; &ldquo;about like  you&rsquo;d expect a sister to act. She was fond of her brother, I take it, but&mdash;well,  I didn&rsquo;t see much of her; still, I&rsquo;ve a vague impression that she&rsquo;s  revengeful&mdash;anxious to find and punish the murderer&mdash;that struck me more than her  grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell. She may be sorrowing deeply, and also  be desirous of avenging her brother&rsquo;s death. No question of suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not now, no. There was at first. But an autopsy  showed the second shot was fired first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one they thought was second was first. It seems  the first shot&mdash;through the temple&mdash;killed Gleason. And then, for some  unexplained reason, the slayer fired again, through the dead man&rsquo;s shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever for? And how do they know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the doctors could tell, by the blood coagulation  or something. As to why it was done, I&rsquo;ve no idea. What&rsquo;s the obvious&mdash;I want to  distrust it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too funny, Prescott. This is a big case. Not  only because of the prominence of the people involved, but it&rsquo;s pretty  mysterious, I think. We ought to get something out of the other people in the  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance. I tried it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap said nothing, but a close observer might have  thought his silence not altogether an assent to Prescott&rsquo;s corollary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; Prescott went on, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ll find  your murderer among Gleason&rsquo;s own bunch. Not the people in the house he lived  in. You see that place was wished on him by a friend, and Gleason hated it. I  got this from those men who know him. Miss Lindsay agreed to it. Gleason meant  to move out&mdash;only took it because it was represented to him as a bijou  apartment, and he thought it was a luxurious little nest&mdash;and, it isn&rsquo;t. As you  can now see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the house, Prescott pushed the button below  McIlvaine&rsquo;s card, and after a moment the door clicked, and grudgingly, as it  seemed, moved itself a little, and Prescott pushed it open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the murderer got in,&rdquo; he said  positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; demurred Belknap. &ldquo;Maybe he came in with  Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe he came in at the window, or down the  chimney!&rdquo; exclaimed Prescott shortly; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t admit the obvious ever, can  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap chuckled at the other&rsquo;s quick temper, and they  went upstairs.</p>
  <p>They found Policeman Kelly in charge, and he greeted  them gladly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get busy,&rdquo; he said, genially. &ldquo;Sure, there&rsquo;s enough  to engage your attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap, beyond a word of greeting, ignored the  officer, and took a swift, comprehensive survey of the place.</p>
  <p>It was a large front room, apparently library and  cutting room. A bedroom was back of it and a bath room behind that. An old  house, quite evidently remodeled for bachelor or small family apartments.</p>
  <p>Though up to date as to plumbing, lighting and  decoration, the window and door frames proclaimed it an old building. The  furniture was over ornate, and the pictures and ornaments a bit flamboyant. But  it was a comfortable enough place, and the personal belongings of the dead  Gleason were scattered about and gave a homey appearance. A silver framed  photograph of Mrs Lindsay was on a table, and on another were two more  portraits of less distinguished-looking ladies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ivy Hayes, the movie star,&rdquo; Kelly said, as  Belknap looked at one picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; the attorney said, so shortly that Kelly  lapsed into silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing been disturbed?&rdquo; Belknap asked presently, and  receiving a negative answer went on observing.</p>
  <p>Kelly winked at Prescott, with an expression that  said, &ldquo;I like &rsquo;em more sociable, myself!&rdquo; and Prescott nodded acquiescence.</p>
  <p>But at last Belknap began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dressing for dinner, they tell me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Prescott, eagerly, &ldquo;I was here right away,  quick, you know. They took the body to the Funeral Rooms, early this morning.  But he was in his shirt sleeves&mdash;day shirt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, here are all his evening clothes on the bed in  the next room. Was he going to the Lindsay dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he was. I believe he said it was to be the  occasion of the announcement of his engagement to Miss Lindsay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does she say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She does not! She denies it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better keep still. You have no gumption,  Prescott. Don&rsquo;t you see you mustn&rsquo;t say those things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, bother! let up on knocking me, and get down to  business. Don&rsquo;t touch the telephone or revolver. I&rsquo;ve had them photographed for  fingerprints.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Belknap was getting more genial.  &ldquo;Anybody been through his papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; Lane is his lawyer, Fred Lane. He&rsquo;s coming here  to-day to look over them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Belknap was already absorbed in the loose  papers scattered on the desk. &ldquo;Several notes from ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed them. Old Gleason had a few friends in  the chorus, I judge. But, unless they have any bearing on the case, there&rsquo;s no  call to exploit &rsquo;em, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Nor any reason to mention them to  the Lindsays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll know all there is to know. You can&rsquo;t fool  &rsquo;em. Miss Phyllis is as wide-awake as they come, and the Mrs is nobody&rsquo;s fool.  The boy, I don&rsquo;t think much of. Say, aren&rsquo;t you going up there? Don&rsquo;t you want  to see them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later, yes. But me for the other tenants here, first.  Here&rsquo;s where Gleason lay, was it? Near the telephone table&mdash;look here, if the  first shot did for him, how could he telephone to the doctor that he was  wounded?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! I don&rsquo;t believe that dope about the  doctors knowing which shot came first. And, as you say, it couldn&rsquo;t have been  the fatal one first, or how could he have phoned? Anyway he could only have  called the doctor if it was a suicide. You don&rsquo;t think, do you, that the murderer  would stand by and let him call up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely. That&rsquo;s why I haven&rsquo;t given up the idea that  it was a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Oscar, you will. Why, that man was too  happy to kill himself. His friends all say so. No, he was shot, all right, but  the two shots make a mystery that I can&rsquo;t get yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap frowned deeply, and thought for a few moments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great mistake,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;to reason from  insufficient data.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another of your &lsquo;familiar quotations,&rsquo;&rdquo; chaffed  Prescott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another good rule,&rdquo; retorted the attorney, and went  out in the hall.</p>
  <p>Prescott followed and together they went to the  Mansfields&rsquo; apartment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been thinking it over,&rdquo; Mrs Mansfield said,  after she had admitted her callers and taken them to her living room, &ldquo;and my  husband and I feel we ought to tell all we know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly ought to,&rdquo; Belknap assured her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the blonde head nodded mysteriously, &ldquo;that  man, Gleason, he was a gay old bird.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean, Mrs Mansfield? Speak plainly,&rdquo;  adjured Belknap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders pettishly, for  she was the sort of woman who loved innuendo better than statement. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know the girls, of course, I&rsquo;m not in that class of society, but he did have  gay looking girls coming to his apartment now and then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every day?&rdquo; Belknap looked at her sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my land, no, not every day. Just now and then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every other day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; pettishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe once a week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe, you saw one, once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Mansfield laughed out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Mr Belknap,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How you do pin me  down. Well, all I can swear to is one time I did see a fly little piece of  baggage go in at his door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Day or night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daytime.&rdquo; Mrs Mansfield spoke aggrievedly, as if all  the zest had been taken out of her news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph! And she might have been his lawyer&rsquo;s  stenographer, with an important paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She might not!&rdquo; Mrs Mansfield declined to lose her  last shred of excitement. &ldquo;Stenographers are flippy enough, Lord knows! But  this little snipjack, now, she was a real little vamp!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My land! I guess I don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m a respectable married  woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And probably she is a respectable unmarried woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming to see a man in his apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, until we know the circumstances we can&rsquo;t judge  her. I say, Prescott, get that photograph, will you. You know, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; and Prescott went back across the hall. He  returned with the picture of the girl Kelly had called Ivy Hayes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; said Mrs Mansfield, drawing away  from it, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s no lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, you don&rsquo;t know her. She&rsquo;s a little  moving picture actress. She may have had business with Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She may have!&rdquo; and the disdainful lady sniffed. &ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s none of <i>my</i> business, and I don&rsquo;t care to discuss her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say you saw her go in there, yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good land, no! I didn&rsquo;t say yesterday! I said, one  day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m glad you told us about it. It might  mean something and it might not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, it means something!&rdquo; Mrs Mansfield didn&rsquo;t  want her news scorned as naught. &ldquo;An actress calling on a man like that&mdash;of  course it means something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it does we&rsquo;ll find it out,&rdquo; Belknap said. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think this little thing shot Gleason, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she couldn&rsquo;t. Little women have done  such deeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So they have. Now, you&rsquo;ve nothing more to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But though Mrs Mansfield said quite a bit more, she  had really nothing more to tell them that they wanted to hear, and they got  away, though with some difficulty, for the lady was of a garrulous type.</p>
  <p>To the floor above Belknap went, Prescott returning to  the Gleason rooms to look about.</p>
  <p>The apartment above McIlvaine&rsquo;s was occupied by a  spinster named Adams who was, as the attorney deduced, from New England.</p>
  <p>This good lady was even more disgusted than Mrs  Mansfield with the whole matter of Gleason, his life and death. More especially  the last for, it seemed to her, no one had a right to die a violent death under  the same roof with refined and conservative people.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, he was a loud-voiced man,&rdquo; declared Miss Adams,  as if pronouncing the last and worst word of opprobrium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you heard him from up here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes, yes. He had chums visit him, and they  would laugh and talk so loudly, I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could you distinguish what they said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; not words. But I could hear well enough to know  whether he was merry or angry&mdash;for, I assure you, sometimes he was the latter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything from that apartment yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I heard the two shots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did! What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. What should I do? As a matter of fact I  didn&rsquo;t think they were shots. I thought them tire explosions or some noise in  the street. But after I knew about the murder, I realized that I had heard the  fatal shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you said nothing to anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Man alive, what could I say? I had nothing to do with  Mr Gleason or his murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But your duty as a citizen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, what do you mean? Where was any duty? You  people&mdash;you police people knew the shots were fired, didn&rsquo;t you? Then why should  I inform anybody that they were? And that&rsquo;s all I knew&mdash;or know about them. They  were fired. I heard them. No more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sharp-featured, sharp-tongued old maid sat bolt  upright in her chair, and glared at Belknap. Her hair was drawn up in a tight  knot, after the fashion of New England spinsters, and Belknap wondered what it  was about her appearance that seemed so strange.</p>
  <p>Then he realized it was her exposed ears! He had not  seen a woman with bared ears for so long that it looked most peculiar to him.</p>
  <p>For the rest, Miss Adams was angular, even gaunt, and apparently  of a decided and forceful nature. And her testimony might be valuable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your knowledge is of importance,&rdquo; he said, gravely.  &ldquo;To be sure we know the shots were fired, but a witness is always of interest.  What time was it that you heard the shots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea,&rdquo; she returned, carelessly. &ldquo;Oh, I know,  in the story books, the witness always knows, because he was just going to keep  an engagement&mdash;or, setting his watch, or something. But I don&rsquo;t know at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are quite conversant with detective stories,  though!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I read them, since they&rsquo;re getting so popular.  Anything more you want to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, please. I want to try to fix the time of those  shots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you I can&rsquo;t do it. Look here, did you meet  any one you know, on the street yesterday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did&mdash;I met two or three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Mention one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;a Mr Hartley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, what time did you meet him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, about half-past four or five&mdash;no, it was later&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; triumphantly. &ldquo;It is not easy to state the  time, when you paid no special attention to the occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve proved your point, Miss Adams!&rdquo; Belknap  exclaimed, looking at her with new interest. &ldquo;I wish you <i>had</i> noted the  time&mdash;you would have done so accurately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I should have. But I didn&rsquo;t. Now, when I tell  you that&rsquo;s all I know about the whole matter, will you go away and leave me in  peace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; Miss Adams, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; and to Belknap&rsquo;s satisfaction she turned a  shade paler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, I am sure you do know more. You are too cute  to be so ignorant. Your smartness has overreached itself. You&rsquo;re trying to  disarm me by the appearance of absolute frankness, and you almost did  so&mdash;but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that you know something else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Miss Adams set her thin lips in  a tight, straight line. &ldquo;You go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, I&rsquo;ve much to do. But I warn you I shall  return. You know something, Miss Adams, something of importance, but I do not  think you are yourself implicated. Moreover, what you know frightens you a  little, and you don&rsquo;t want to tell it. Now, if I can get all the information I  want, without yours, well and good. If not, I shall come back for yours. And  don&rsquo;t try running away&mdash;for you won&rsquo;t get far!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you going to have me watched!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not quite that. But if you attempt flight, we may  have to follow you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, the astute Belknap had sized up  the old maid pretty carefully, and was convinced that what little she knew was  unimportant to him, though it doubtless seemed vital to her. Also, he had no  time just now, to persuade or wheedle her, and he feared frightening her would  do little good. So, he concluded to wait and see what else he could find out,  before seeing her again. A woman on the floor above could easily know something  definite, yet somehow Miss Adams did not impress him as doing so.</p>
  <p>He went downstairs, and looking in the door, said,  &ldquo;Come on, Prescott, let&rsquo;s go up to the Lindsays&rsquo; and start out right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Wait a minute, come in here, will you?  We&rsquo;ve got word from the photographer, and there are no fingerprints on the  revolver or on the telephone except Gleason&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! Suicide? No, not possible, if the fatal shot  was fired first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was. I just called up Doctor Davenport, and he  hedged at first, but then he acknowledged it was true. The shot in the shoulder  was fired after the man was already dead. Now, what do you make of that! Why,  in heaven&rsquo;s name shoot a dead man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap looked thoughtful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deep game  somebody&rsquo;s playing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our work cut out for us. Come along,  let&rsquo;s get busy. Guard everything mighty carefully, Kelly. Don&rsquo;t let anybody in,  but people who belong. Our criminal is a slick one, and no obvious measures go,  this time. No fingerprints! Some expert, that murderer!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter  VI<br>
    The Fur Collar</b></h2>
  <p>Prescott, absorbed in the fingerprint matter, went off  to see about it, leaving Belknap to take up the trail alone.</p>
  <p>The attorney concluded to go first to Pollard&rsquo;s, and  note for himself the attitude of the man who had threatened Gleason&rsquo;s life.</p>
  <p>He found Manning Pollard in his rooms at the little  hotel, and was greeted with courtesy, though with no great cordiality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr Belknap,&rdquo; Pollard said, &ldquo;I can give you a  short interview, but I&rsquo;ve a piece of important work on hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay only a few minutes,&rdquo; the other said,  ingratiatingly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like your help. I know all about that remark of yours  concerning your dislike of Mr Gleason. That&rsquo;s past history&mdash;though I may say it  will become famous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; broke in Pollard, frowning a little. &ldquo;You  must admit there are lots of people who feel like that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, but they don&rsquo;t put it into words. Just as  there are lots of people who would steal if they were sure they&rsquo;d not be  caught. But they don&rsquo;t, as a rule, advertise this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead. You don&rsquo;t suspect me of the  murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard&rsquo;s frank glance seemed to compel an honest  reply, and Belknap said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;but only because it has been proved that it  was impossible for you to have been in the vicinity of Gleason&rsquo;s place at that  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have much more positive proof, I  suppose,&rdquo; and Pollard smiled. &ldquo;All right, then, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me whom you suspect.&rdquo; Belknap shot out the  words, in an effort to catch Pollard off his guard, for it was the attorney&rsquo;s  belief that the clubman knew more of the matter than he had told.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You give me a difficult question, Mr Belknap,&rdquo;  Pollard said, in a serious tone. &ldquo;I daresay everybody has vague suspicions  floating through his brain, but to put them in words is&mdash;well, might it not  start inquiry in a wrong direction and do ultimate harm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It might, if spoken to the public, but to the  investigators of the case, I think it is your duty to tell all you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> anything. Not anything. I  assure you. But if I were to express an opinion or make a surmise, I should say  look for some incident in Mr Gleason&rsquo;s private life. I know enough of his  character and temperament to feel sure that he had friends among people outside  the social pale, and it seems to me there&rsquo;s the direction in which to look.  It&rsquo;s really no secret that Mr Gleason entertained the sort of young ladies who  are usually classed under the general title of &lsquo;chorus girls&rsquo; whether they are  in the chorus or not. Look that way, I imagine, and you will, at least, find  food for thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know of any particular girl in whom he was  interested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard stared at him. &ldquo;I do not. I knew Mr Gleason  but slightly. I know nothing of his private affairs, and, as I told you, even the  surmise I made is based merely on the man&rsquo;s general characteristics. I have  heard him refer to the girls I spoke of, but only in general conversation, and  seldom at that. Please understand, I was not only no friend of Robert Gleason,  but scarcely an acquaintance. I never met him more than three or four times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you took a positive dislike to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did. I frequently take dislikes at first sight. Or,  I am attracted at first sight. Mine is not a unique nature, Mr Belknap. Many  people like or dislike a stranger at first meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t threaten to kill them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard reached the end of his patience. &ldquo;Mr Belknap,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of having that remark of mine quoted at me. If it had not  chanced that Gleason was killed yesterday, that speech would never have been  remembered. I do not deny the remark; I do not deny that it was spoken in  earnest. But I do deny that I killed Robert Gleason. Now, if you still suspect  me, go to work and bring the crime home to me, if not, let up on your insinuations!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, I will. I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute that  you had a hand in it&mdash;but I hoped you knew something more definite than you&rsquo;ve  told me. And, maybe you do. If for instance, you had suspicion of any friend of  yours, or an acquaintance, you would, doubtless, try to throw me off the track,  and point my attention to Mr Gleason&rsquo;s little lady friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard looked at his visitor with fresh interest.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cleverer than I thought,&rdquo; he said, frankly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you  that if I did suspect a friend, the first thing I should do, would be to try to  throw the police off his track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you no sense of justice&mdash;or duty to the state?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite as much as most people, only I don&rsquo;t pretend to  more than I have&mdash;as most people do. Nine men out of ten would protect a friend,  only they wouldn&rsquo;t be so open-mouthed about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; and in a way I&rsquo;m glad you are so frank.  Now, if I come to suspect any friend of yours, I shall return to you and get  some information&mdash;from the things you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Mr Belknap. I like your shrewdness.  And, truly, if the time comes when I can help, without running a friend&rsquo;s head  into the noose, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, I&rsquo;m going up to the Lindsay house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll go with you. I may be of some help to  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were so terribly busy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard smiled. &ldquo;I am. But, my business is a movable  feast. I&rsquo;m a writer, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know your two books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m just getting out another. I write essays for  the magazines, and when I get enough, I bunch &rsquo;em up and call it a book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the reviewers call it a good book,&rdquo; Belknap  complimented.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of them do. But, I&rsquo;m my own master&mdash;if I neglect  my work it hurts no one but myself, and nothing but my own bank account. And  so, I&rsquo;ll give up doing a bit of writing I planned for this morning, and go up  to the Lindsays&rsquo; with you. If I can do anything for them, in any way, I&rsquo;ll be  glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Lindsay apartment wore the air common to homes  where death has entered, yet not to one of the actual household. The shades were  partly drawn and a few shaded lamps were lighted. A silent maid admitted the  callers and they were shown into the living room where a group of people sat.</p>
  <p>The three Lindsays were there, also Doctor Davenport,  who had been prescribing for Mrs Lindsay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he was telling her, &ldquo;just keep  quiet and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Doctor,&rdquo; her shrill voice responded, &ldquo;how can I  keep quiet, when I&rsquo;m so excited? My nerves are on edge&mdash;I&rsquo;m frightened&mdash;I can&rsquo;t  sleep or eat or rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The medicine I prescribed will help all that; now,  just obey my orders and do the best you can to keep cool and calm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; and Manning Pollard took the seat  next Millicent; &ldquo;sometimes the mere presence of an unexcitable person helps  frazzled nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely that,&rdquo; and Mrs Lindsay smiled a  welcome. &ldquo;I never saw any one less excitable than you are. Do help to calm me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laid her hand in Pollard&rsquo;s and sank back in her  chair, already quieted by his silent sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Doctor,&rdquo; Belknap said, as Davenport  was about to leave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking a few questions, and I want you to tell me as  to those two shots that killed Mr Gleason. You don&rsquo;t mind being present, Mrs  Lindsay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, no. I want to be. I want to know every bit of  evidence, every clew to the murderer of my brother! I am not excited over the  investigation, I only get nervous when I think you will not avenge the crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying our best,&rdquo; returned Belknap. &ldquo;What is  your theory, Doctor Davenport?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; and the doctor looked slightly  embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Belknap thought to himself, &ldquo;all these people  act queer! Are they all shielding the same person? Is it the precious son of  the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in laymen having theories,&rdquo; Davenport  went on. &ldquo;Those are for the police to form and then to prove.&rdquo; He spoke  shortly, but in an even time, as one who was sure of what he wanted to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Belknap, &ldquo;and to form and prove  our theories, we must get all the evidence we can. Now, Doctor, as to those  shots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor became all the professional man again.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt as to the facts,&rdquo; he replied, straightforwardly; &ldquo;the fatal  shot was most certainly fired first, and the shot in the shoulder some minutes  later&mdash;after the man had been dead at least several minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you, then, explain Mr Gleason&rsquo;s ability to  telephone a message that he was shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t explain it&mdash;nor can I conceive of any  explanation. It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I ever heard of!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; Belknap mused, &ldquo;but there must be  some explanation. For he did telephone. Your nurse took the message?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did. And she is a most reliable woman. Whatever  she reported as to that message, you may depend on as absolute truth. Nurse  Jordan has been with me many years, and she is most punctilious in the  repetition of messages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t he have telephoned after the first shot,&rdquo;  Pollard said, his air more that of one thinking aloud, than of one propounding  a theory, &ldquo;and then with a spasmodic gesture or something, have fired the  second shot by accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The second shot was fired after the man was dead,&rdquo;  repeated Doctor Davenport, positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there was a murderer,&rdquo; Belknap said, &ldquo;which fact  we have decided upon anyway. And an unusually clever murderer, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; Millicent Lindsay said, speaking  in a low moaning voice. &ldquo;Why would anybody shoot my brother after he had  already killed him? I can&rsquo;t see any theory that would explain that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; declared the doctor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing  I ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave that point for the moment,&rdquo; Belknap advised,  &ldquo;if we get other facts they may throw light on that. Do any of you think that  Mr Gleason,&rdquo; he glanced furtively at Mrs Lindsay to see if he might go on, &ldquo;was  acquainted with&mdash;with young ladies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in our set?&rdquo; cried Louis; &ldquo;he most assuredly was.  Now you&rsquo;re getting on the right tack! You don&rsquo;t mind this talk, Millicent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; go on,&rdquo; returned Mrs Lindsay. &ldquo;I want to know the  truth. And, of course, my brother was no saint. Moreover, if he chose to  entertain chorus girls or that sort of people he had a perfect right to do so.  I&rsquo;m not surprised or shocked at anything of that kind. But if they were in any  way responsible for his death, I want to know it. Do you know anything  definite, Louis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, but the youth went white.</p>
  <p>Belknap studied his face, feeling sure that to go  white was not absolutely unusual with the young man. He was apparently anaemic,  unstrung, and very emotional. His lips twitched, and he curled and uncurled his  fingers.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, Belknap was looking toward Louis  as a possible suspect. Though, as yet, he had no reason for such a suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Phyllis Lindsay, speaking for the first  time during this discussion. &ldquo;I know he was intimate with some moving picture  actresses. He had their photographs in his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When were you there last?&rdquo; asked Belknap suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;about a week ago, I think. I called in  one day to see a new picture Mr Gleason had just bought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face was slightly flushed, but she was cool and  composed of manner. Belknap despaired of getting any real information here.</p>
  <p>Doctor Davenport looked at Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you leave anything there?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave anything?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; impatiently. &ldquo;Any of your belongings&mdash;wearing  apparel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; the girl smiled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m sure. Unless I dropped a handkerchief,  maybe. I&rsquo;m forever losing those.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t leave a fur collar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t! My fur collars are too valuable  not to keep track of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; and Doctor Davenport drew from his bag a small  fur neckpiece. &ldquo;Then, I guess it&rsquo;s my duty to show up this. It&rsquo;s a thing,&rdquo; he  looked a bit embarrassed, &ldquo;I picked up in Gleason&rsquo;s room when I first went  there last night. I thought it was yours, Phyllis, and I brought it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, of all performances!&rdquo; exclaimed Belknap,  astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; and Davenport smiled, &ldquo;I meant to give  it up sooner, but I forgot it. I only thought, if it should be Phyllis&rsquo;, she&rsquo;d  rather know about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, as long as I have it now,&rdquo; and Belknap reached  for the fur with an air of authority. &ldquo;This may be the clew that will lead us  straight to the murderer&mdash;or murderess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; agreed the doctor, &ldquo;and it may set you off  on the wrong track, hounding some poor little innocent girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it a valuable piece?&rdquo; and Belknap held it out  toward Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to touch it,&rdquo; she shrank back. &ldquo;Please  don&rsquo;t make me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; said Millicent reaching out a hand.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fairly  good fur, and it&rsquo;s the latest style; what they call a choker. It&rsquo;s new this  season, but not worth more than thirty or forty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It might belong to &rsquo;most anybody, then,&rdquo; mused  Belknap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millicent, &ldquo;but you see by the label  inside, it came from a shop patronized more by bargain hunters than by an  exclusive class of customers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pointing to the less aristocratic type,&rdquo; Belknap  nodded. &ldquo;Well, we must trace the owner of the collar. Where was it, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a chair in the room,&rdquo; said Davenport, looking as  sheepish as a censured schoolboy. &ldquo;I was a fool I suppose, to take it, but I  thought if it belonged to Miss Lindsay, it might lead to a lot of unpleasant  notoriety for her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; Belknap shut off his  apologies. &ldquo;Now to find an owner for the fur. Any suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked around the group, with a general survey, but  really scanning Louis&rsquo; face, in hopes the boy might show some sign of  recognition.</p>
  <p>But it was from Pollard that the advice came,  &ldquo;Advertise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I planned to do,&rdquo; Belknap said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take  the fur and advertise for its owner. An adroitly worded advertisement ought to  bring results.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was little more conversation of importance, the  attorney merely taking some notes of certain data he desired, and learning of  the arrangements for the funeral which was to take place next day at the  Funeral Rooms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I probably shan&rsquo;t see you again, Mrs Lindsay, until  after I hear from the advertisement,&rdquo; Belknap told her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come to see me whenever you have any fresh  evidence or any news,&rdquo; she urged him. &ldquo;After the funeral, may be too late.  Follow up all trails&mdash;spare no effort. I may be a peculiar person, Mr Belknap,  but I can&rsquo;t help it. I never thought I was of a revengeful nature, but I think  it is a righteous indignation that I have now. And I will do anything, spend  any amount to find the murderer of my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are his heir?&rdquo; Belknap asked, casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not inquired into that as yet,&rdquo; was the reply,  spoken rather coldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know whether my brother left a will or not.  Mr Lane is his lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My question was not prompted by idle curiosity,&rdquo;  Belknap assured her, &ldquo;but it is of importance to know who will benefit  financially by the death of this rich man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he left no will,&rdquo; Mrs Lindsay informed him, &ldquo;I am  the only heir. If he left a will, I&rsquo;ve no idea as to its contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must inquire of Lane, then; though doubtless he  will see you on the matter very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap departed and first thing he did was to put an  advertisement in the Lost and Found columns of several evening papers.</p>
  <p>And the next afternoon his zeal was rewarded.</p>
  <p>He had instructed the owner of the collar to call at a  small shop on a side street, which had no apparent connection with Mr Robert  Gleason or his affairs.</p>
  <p>By arrangement with the proprietor, Belknap himself  was behind the counter and greeted the sweetly smiling young woman who came for  the fur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; Belknap asked the  fashionably dressed little person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; are you?&rdquo; she replied, saucily. &ldquo;But I can  describe mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a soft, gray fur, squirrel it&rsquo;s called. And it  has <i>a</i> label inside with the name of the store where it was bought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? And the store is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheapman&rsquo;s Department Store.&rdquo; She smiled  triumphantly. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to give up the goods!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; Belknap smiled. &ldquo;Now where did  you lose it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea. Somewhere between starting  out from home and getting back there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Day before yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep. I went to a whole lot of places&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mention some. You see, the store you speak of sells a  good many fur collars, so it all depends on where you left yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;s&rsquo;pose I don&rsquo;t want to tell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I shall think you&rsquo;re putting up a game on me,  and trying to get a fur collar that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t. But it does belong to a friend  of mine&mdash;and I&rsquo;m after it for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she doesn&rsquo;t want to admit where she lost it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she wouldn&rsquo;t. But you see, I don&rsquo;t  know all the places she went to, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Miss&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to give your name, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time the girl looked decidedly frightened. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she said, almost crying. &ldquo;Let the old fur go&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want it! I  wish I&rsquo;d kept out of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me who sent you here, and you can keep out of  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl brightened decidedly, and looked at Belknap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honest,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if I tell you who sent me, can I  go home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly you may. I&rsquo;ve no right to detain you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, it was Mary Morton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a street number in the Longacre district, and  hurried away almost before Belknap finished writing it down.</p>
  <p>Thanking and remunerating the shopkeeper for the use  of his premises, Belknap went directly to the address he had obtained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like as not she&rsquo;ll be out,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but if she  is, I&rsquo;ll go again. I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s one of Gleason&rsquo;s lady friends, and though I&rsquo;ve  no idea she shot him&mdash;yet, she might have. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll get a line on his gay  acquaintances. It&rsquo;s bound to be the owner of the collar, for her friend described  it exactly, and gave the right maker&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Reaching the address given him, Belknap felt a sudden  qualm of suspicion. It did not look at all like a boarding house, theatrical or  any other kind. In fact it was a shop where electrical goods were sold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upstairs, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; Gleason mused, and went in.</p>
  <p>But nobody at that number could tell him anything of  Miss Mary Morton. No one had ever heard of her, and Belknap was confronted with  the sudden conviction that he had been made a fool of!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Idiot! Dunderhead!&rdquo; he called himself, angrily, as he  left the place. &ldquo;I am an ass, I declare! That little snip jack took me in  completely, with her honest gray eyes! Well, let me see; I&rsquo;ve a start. That  girl described that fur too accurately not to be the owner herself, and I&rsquo;ll  track her down again yet. It can&rsquo;t be a hard job. I&rsquo;ll see her picture in some  theatrical office or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it was a hard blow, and Belknap felt pretty sore  at Prescott&rsquo;s jeers when he learned the story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s given us a way to turn,&rdquo; said Belknap.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the fur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grinned Prescott, wickedly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got the fur,  and that&rsquo;s as fur as we have got!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter  VII<br>
    Barry&rsquo;s Suspect</b></h2>
  <p>After the funeral of Robert Gleason, Lane, his lawyer,  went to the Lindsay home, for the purpose of reading to the family the will of  his late client.</p>
  <p>There was no one present except the three Lindsays and  Doctor Davenport. The physician was keeping watch over Millicent Lindsay, for  her volatile nature and nervous condition made him fear a breakdown.</p>
  <p>But Millicent was quiet and composed, only an  occasional quiver of her lip or trembling of her fingers betrayed her  agitation.</p>
  <p>Phyllis&rsquo; eyes were bright with repressed excitement,  but she, too, preserved her poise.</p>
  <p>Louis, however, was in a high state of nervous  tension. He was jumpy and erratic of speech and gesture, and again, he would  relapse into a sulky mood and become perversely silent.</p>
  <p>The little party gathered in the library and Lane read  the will of Robert Gleason.</p>
  <p>The terms were simple. Except for bequests to some  personal friends and some charities, the fortune was equally divided between  Millicent, his sister, and Phyllis, her stepdaughter.</p>
  <p>No mention whatever was made of Louis, and the young  man burst forth into a torrent of angry invective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Louis,&rdquo; Doctor Davenport said, sternly; &ldquo;such  talk can do you no good, and it is a disgrace to yourself to speak so of the  dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Louis stormed, &ldquo;why did he leave a lot  to Phyllis, and nothing to me? I&rsquo;m no relative of his, but neither is Phyl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he was very much in love with Miss Lindsay,&rdquo; Lane  explained the situation, &ldquo;and as he had no expectation of this immediate death,  he hoped to make her his wife. But, he told me this when I drew up his will&mdash;he  provided for Miss Lindsay in case of premature death or accident to himself. I  feel sure he hoped to win Miss Lindsay&rsquo;s promise to be his wife&mdash;if he had not  already done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had not!&rdquo; exclaimed Phyllis, but she looked  thoughtful rather than indignant at the idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he found that he could not do so,&rdquo; Lane went on,  &ldquo;he planned to change his will. It was, I think, tentative, and dependent on  the course of his wooing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind all that,&rdquo; said Phyllis, speaking slowly  and a little hesitantly; &ldquo;the will is valid and final, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned Lane, but he gave her a  searching glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then half the money is mine, and half Millicent&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  Phyllis went on, still with that thoughtful manner. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Buddy, I&rsquo;ll  give you part of my share.&rdquo; She looked at her brother with fond affection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Millicent said, her glance  at Phyllis a little resentful. &ldquo;It would have been quite all right, if Phyllis  had meant to marry my brother&mdash;but she had no such intention!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; began the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; declared Millicent. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more, if  you had any hand in his murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; cried Fred Lane, shocked even more at  Millicent&rsquo;s look than at her words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hush! I&rsquo;m going to find out who killed my  brother! He was the only human being whom I loved. These step-children mean  nothing to me&mdash;although we have always lived harmoniously enough. Now, if  Phyllis is innocent, that&rsquo;s all there is about it. But her innocence must be  proved!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis gave her stepmother a kindly, pitying glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Millicent,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re excited and  nervous, and you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying. Go and lie down, dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go and lie down, dear!&rsquo;&rdquo; Millicent mocked her, eyes  flashing and her voice hard. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;d say, of course! You  fear investigation! No one would dream of suspecting you&mdash;unless they knew what  I know! and you say&mdash;&lsquo;go and lie down!&rsquo; Indeed, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> go and lie down!  Now, look here, Phyllis Lindsay, you knew what was in that will of my  brother&rsquo;s! I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;but you did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, Millicent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did! You led my brother on&mdash;and on&mdash;letting him  think you would marry him&mdash;then, when he&rsquo;d made a will in your favor, you killed  him to get the money! That&rsquo;s what you did! And I&rsquo;ll prove it&mdash;if it costs me all  my share of my poor brother&rsquo;s fortune!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She collapsed then, and sat, huddled in the big chair,  shaking with sobs.</p>
  <p>Without a word, Doctor Davenport went to her, assisted  her to rise, and, summoning a maid to help him, took Millicent Lindsay away to  her own room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What ails her, anyway?&rdquo; Louis growled, looking at  Phyllis, curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s like that when she gets a tantrum,&rdquo; the  girl responded, looking worried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s really good friends with me, but if she  takes a notion she turns against me, and she can&rsquo;t think of anything bad enough  to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her present attitude,&rdquo; Lane said,  abruptly. &ldquo;She may make a lot of trouble for you, Miss Lindsay. <i>Did</i> you  know of contents of the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned, but she did not look at the  lawyer. If, he mused, she were telling an untruth, she would, doubtless, look  just like that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; he followed up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; she flung up her head and  looked at him. Her dark eyes were not flashing, but smoldering with a deep fire  of indignation. &ldquo;How dare you question my statements!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Phyl,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;be careful what you  say. Millicent has it in her power to do you a bad turn, and she&rsquo;s willing to  do it if she thinks you&rsquo;re mixed up in her brother&rsquo;s case. Do you know <i>anything</i> about it, old girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis gave him a look of reproach, but he went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t eat me up with your eyes, Sis. When I ask  if you know anything about the thing, I don&rsquo;t mean did you kill Robert Gleason!  Of course, I know better than that! But&mdash;oh, well, don&rsquo;t you think, Lane, that  Millicent can make trouble for us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Us?&rdquo; and the lawyer raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Where do  you come in, Lindsay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; with an impatient shrug, &ldquo;Phyl&rsquo;s troubles are  mine, of course. And seems to me, Millicent has a very annoying bee in her  bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy enough to settle the matter,&rdquo; Lane said,  briefly. &ldquo;Where were you, Miss Lindsay, when the&mdash;the tragedy took place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Phyllis replied. &ldquo;Here&mdash;at home&mdash;I  think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But a sudden flood of scarlet suffused her face, and  she was quite evidently preserving her composure by a strong effort.</p>
  <p>The small, slight figure, sitting in a tall-backed  chair was a picture of itself. Phyllis&rsquo; bright coloring, her deep, glowing  eyes, scarlet lips and rose-flushed cheeks were accented by the plain black  gown she wore and her graceful little hands moved eloquently as she talked, and  then fluttered to rest on the carved arms of the great chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop saying &lsquo;sure?&rsquo; to me!&rdquo; Phyllis spoke shortly,  and then gave a good-natured laugh. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m not sure, Mr Lane. I&rsquo;ll  have to think back. I haven&rsquo;t a&mdash;what do they call it&mdash;an alibi, but all the same  I didn&rsquo;t kill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Lane interrupted her, &ldquo;nobody for a  minute supposes you killed anybody. Mrs Lindsay herself doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s hysteria  that makes her say so. But, she <i>can</i> make trouble. And, so, I want you to  think carefully, and have your evidence ready. Where were you last Tuesday at  about half-past six or seven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis thought. &ldquo;Here, I think,&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;I  was out&mdash;and I came home and dressed for the dinner party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was the dinner hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you were dressing&mdash;how long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;an hour, probably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That leaves some time yet to be accounted for. Where  were you just before you came home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr Lane,&rdquo; Phyllis&rsquo; eyes flashed now, &ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be quizzed like that! If I&rsquo;m suspected of a crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lane repeated, &ldquo;but if Mrs Lindsay  accuses you of a crime, you must be prepared to defend yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait till she does, then,&rdquo; said Phyllis, curtly, and  lapsed into silence.</p>
  <p>But Louis looked disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can Millicent do, Lane?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t  make up any yarn that will implicate my sister, can she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no; probably not. All she can do, is to show that  Miss Lindsay knew what she would inherit, and, therefore, can be said to have a  motive for the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot! As if Phyllis would shoot a man to get his  money!&rdquo; But Louis Lindsay&rsquo;s looks belied his words. While showing no doubt or  distrust of his sister, he had all the appearance of a man deeply anxious or  alarmed at his thoughts. &ldquo;And, besides, Phyl knew nothing about the will&mdash;did  you, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked at him without replying, for a moment,  then she said, &ldquo;Hush, Louis; don&rsquo;t keep up the subject. I&rsquo;m going straight to  Millicent&mdash;and if she&rsquo;s able to talk to me, I&rsquo;ll find out what she means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis left the room, and his business over, Lane  went away from the house.</p>
  <p>As he walked along the street, he mused deeply on the  matter.</p>
  <p>Of course, Phyllis was in no way concerned in the  crime&mdash;but Lane couldn&rsquo;t help thinking she knew something about it&mdash;or something  bearing on it. What could it be? How could that delicate, exclusive girl be in  any way mixed up with the deed done down in Washington Square?</p>
  <p>Lane made his way to the Club. He knew he&rsquo;d find a lot  of his friends there at this hour, and he wanted to hear their talk.</p>
  <p>He was not surprised to find a group of his intimates  discussing the Gleason case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now the funeral&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; Dean Monroe was saying, &ldquo;the  detectives can get busy, and do some real work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They can get busy,&rdquo; Manning Pollard agreed, &ldquo;but can  they do any real work? I mean, any successful, decisive work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean, discover the murderer,&rdquo; Lane said, joining  in the talk at once, as he took his seat among them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a hard job, to my mind,&rdquo; Dean Monroe said, slowing  inhaling his cigarette&rsquo;s smoke. &ldquo;<i>Cherchez la</i> chorus girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; said Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I know!&rdquo; Monroe came back quickly. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t  mean I know&mdash;but who else could it have been? You may say Pollard, here, because  he announced his intention of killing Gleason. But we all know Pol&rsquo;s little  smarty ways. He didn&rsquo;t even defend himself, because, secure in his innocence,  he let the old detectives themselves find and prove his alibi! A silly  grandstand play, I call it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard smiled. &ldquo;It was silly, I daresay, but if I had  eagerly defended myself, they might have thought me guilty. So, why not let  them find out the truth for themselves? But, as to the chorus kiddies&mdash;I doubt  if the bravest of them would have the nerve to shoot a man. Remember they&rsquo;re  only babies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all of them,&rdquo; offered Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, those who have arrived at years of wisdom  are not the ones Gleason favored,&rdquo; Pollard said. &ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s a  possibility that some man&mdash;some bold, bad man may have done it for the sake of a  girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he must be found through the discovery of the  girl,&rdquo; declared Lane. &ldquo;And with that fur piece to work on, it&rsquo;s a funny thing  if they can&rsquo;t get the lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be coincidence, I think,&rdquo; Pollard said,  seriously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about real detective work, but it seems to me, if  I found a fur collar at the scene of the crime, the owner of that would be the  last person I&rsquo;d look for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You give the collar too much importance, Monroe, and  you, Pollard, give it too little,&rdquo; Lane spoke in his most judicial manner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  no detective myself, but I am a lawyer, and I modestly claim a sort of  knowledge of criminal doings. The fur collar is a clew. It must be  investigated. It may lead to the truth and it may not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried Barry. &ldquo;What wisdom! Oh, what  sagacity! It may and it may not! Lane, you&rsquo;re a wizard at deduction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all laughed, but Fred Lane was in no way  dismayed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, you fellows,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but which of you  can make any better prognostication? Come now, here are four of us; let&rsquo;s make  a bet&mdash;or, no, that&rsquo;s hardly decent&mdash;let&rsquo;s each express an opinion regarding the  murderer of Robert Gleason, and see who comes nearest to the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure we&rsquo;ll ever know the truth?&rdquo; asked Monroe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no harm done. Go ahead, and  let it be understood that these are merely thoughts&mdash;private opinions and  absolutely confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Dean Monroe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak my mind  first. I&rsquo;m all for the chorus girl&mdash;and when I say chorus girl, I use the term  generically. She may be a Movie Star or a Vaudeville artist. But some chicken  of the stage, is my vote. Yet I don&rsquo;t claim but she did the deed herself&mdash;it may  well have been her stalwart gentleman friend, who was jealous of the rich man&rsquo;s  friendship with his girl. There&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good enough, too,&rdquo; appraised Lane. &ldquo;Moreover, you&rsquo;ve  got the fur collar in evidence. You may be right. You next, Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think it was somebody from Gleason&rsquo;s  Seattle home. Seems to me there must have been people out there who felt as I  did about the man&mdash;who really wanted him out of the world; and, too, they may  have had some definite grievance&mdash;some conventional motive&mdash;what are they? Love,  hate, money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenge is one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the same, revenge and hate. Well, doesn&rsquo;t it seem  more like a wild Westerner to come there and shoot up his man than for a New  Yorker to do it? I don&rsquo;t take much stock in the chorus girl theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Pol,&rdquo; put in Barry. &ldquo;Seattle isn&rsquo;t wild  and woolly and cowboyish and bandittish! It&rsquo;s as civilized as our own fair  city, and as little given to deeds of violence as New York itself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your logic is overwhelming,&rdquo; Pollard laughed. &ldquo;Ought  to have been a lawyer instead of an artist, Barry! But I stick to my guns&mdash;which  are the guns of the Westerners who knew Gleason&mdash;the inhabitants of Seattle and  environs. I may be all wrong, but it seems the most plausible theory to me.  Perhaps I&rsquo;m prejudiced, but I think Seattle is mighty well rid of its leading  citizen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush up, Manning,&rdquo; reproved Monroe; &ldquo;your foolish  threat was bad enough when the man was alive, it&rsquo;s horrid to knock him now he&rsquo;s  dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;I&rsquo;ll shut up. But Lane asked for my  opinion, and now he&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yours, Barry?&rdquo; asked Lane, without comment on  Pollard&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to express mine,&rdquo; said Philip Barry,  with such a serious look that nobody smiled. &ldquo;You see, I have a dreadful  suspicion of&mdash;of some one I know&mdash;we all know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked Pollard, cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;; Barry grinned at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just plain idiot!  But, truly, haven&rsquo;t any of you thought of some one in&mdash;in our set?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently no one had, for each man present looked  blankly inquiring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to put it into words,&rdquo; and Barry  gave a shrug of his shoulders. Slightly built, his dark, intense face showing  his artistic temperament, Philip Barry had a strong will and a high temper.</p>
  <p>Moreover, unlike his type, he had a desperate tenacity  of opinion, and once convinced of a thing would stick to it through thick and  thin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just because an idea came into my head,&rdquo; he went on,  &ldquo;is no reason I should give it voice. I might do an innocent man a desperate  injustice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you like, Barry,&rdquo; Lane said, &ldquo;but to my way of  thinking, if you have such an idea it&rsquo;s your duty to give it voice. If your  man&rsquo;s innocent it can&rsquo;t harm him. If he&rsquo;s guilty he ought to be suspected. And,  among us four, your views are an inviolable secret, unless justice requires  them to be told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Barry began, reluctantly, &ldquo;who first heard of  this murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor Davenport,&rdquo; said Monroe, quickly. &ldquo;His nurse  telephoned from the office&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did the nurse tell you that?&rdquo; Barry shot at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, no, of course not. I haven&rsquo;t seen the nurse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose the police have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You suppose! Well, they haven&rsquo;t. I found that out.  No, the police have not thought it worth while to check up Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s  story of his nurse&rsquo;s message to him. They take it as he told it. It was nine  chances out of ten they would do so. I say, fellows, don&rsquo;t you remember that  conversation we had about murder that afternoon&mdash;last Tuesday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Pollard. &ldquo;It was then that I made my  famous speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and that was remembered because it was  unconventional and damn-foolishness besides. But Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s speeches,  though of far greater importance, are all forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten them,&rdquo; said Pollard,  thoughtfully. &ldquo;He said the detection of crime depended largely on chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and he minimized the chances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, good Lord, Barry, you&rsquo;re not hinting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hinting nothing,&rdquo; said Barry, speaking decidedly  now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reminding you what Davenport said; I&rsquo;m reminding you of his whole  attitude toward the matter of murder; I&rsquo;m reminding you of his psychological  mind, and that it might have been swayed in the direction of crime; I&rsquo;m  reminding you that Pollard&rsquo;s fool remark about killing Gleason might have  started a train of thought in the doctor&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Making me accessory before the fact!&rdquo; suggested  Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unconsciously, yes, maybe. Well, there it is. You  asked me for my guess. You have it. It isn&rsquo;t a suspicion, it isn&rsquo;t even a  theory&mdash;it&rsquo;s merely a guess&mdash;but it&rsquo;s at least a possible one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry, you&rsquo;re batty!&rdquo; Dean Monroe declared. &ldquo;Us  artists get that way sometimes.&rdquo; He beamed round upon the group. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind  Phil. He&rsquo;ll come out all right. And for heaven&rsquo;s sake, fellows, forget what he  has said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monroe was always looking out for his fellow artist  and friend.</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s impulsiveness had often been checked or  steadied by Monroe&rsquo;s better judgment and clearer thought. And now, Monroe was  truly distressed at Barry&rsquo;s speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the motive?&rdquo; Lane was asking, interested  in this new suggestion, and determined to look into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea what  his motive could have been. But, for my part, I don&rsquo;t believe in hunting the  motive first. A motive for murder is far more likely to be a secret than to be  something that anybody can deduce or guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guessing is foolishness,&rdquo; Pollard remarked, &ldquo;but  don&rsquo;t you all remember that Davenport mentioned fear as a common motive. I  recollect he did, and while I don&rsquo;t for one minute incline to Barry&rsquo;s  suggestion, yet I can admit the possibility of fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean Doc was afraid of Gleason? Why?&rdquo; Lane spoke  sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why. I don&rsquo;t know that he <i>was</i> afraid&mdash;of Gleason or anybody else. But I do say that he might have been&mdash;there  are a hundred reasons why a man may be secretly afraid of another man. Who  knows the secrets of his neighbor&rsquo;s heart? I&rsquo;m making no claim, educing no  theory, but it&rsquo;s at least a fact that Davenport did speak of fear as a motive.  Now, I merely say, if you&rsquo;re going to suspect him, you may as well use that  tip. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard smoked on in silence, and each of the four  thought over this new idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shocking, that&rsquo;s what it is, shocking!&rdquo; exclaimed  Dean Monroe, at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of you all, ashamed of myself, for harboring  this thought for a minute. Forget it, everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Dean,&rdquo; Barry rebuked him. &ldquo;Any thought  has a right to expression&mdash;at the right time and place. I&rsquo;ve given you this  suggestion for what it&rsquo;s worth. I&rsquo;ve nothing to base a suspicion on&mdash;except that  the first man to hear of a crime or to go to the spot is a fair topic to think  about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a doctor&mdash;called there!&rdquo; Monroe went on, &ldquo;You  might as well suspect the police themselves!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if they gave us a surprising story of a man  killed by a shot and <i>afterward</i> telephoning for help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That story is fishy,&rdquo; admitted Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; assented Barry. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t <i>see</i> that telephoning business at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter  VIII<br>
    Miss Adams&rsquo; Story</b></h2>
  <p>In the offices of the District Attorney, Lane  discussed the case with Belknap. Without giving names or making any definite  accusations, the lawyer asked the Assistant District Attorney what he thought  of Dr Davenport&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True on the face of it,&rdquo; replied Belknap, promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lane reminded him, &ldquo;because it has not occurred  to you to think otherwise about it. But, how can you explain that telephoning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be explained, so far as we know about it  now. But, look here, if Doctor Davenport killed Gleason&mdash;which, by the way, is  the most absurd idea I ever heard of&mdash;the last thing he would do would be to  make up such an unbelievable yarn as that of the man telephoning after he had  been fatally shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor didn&rsquo;t quite say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Circumstances say that. Gleason called up the  doctor&rsquo;s office and said he was shot. The fatal shot was fired first.  Elucidate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m here. We&rsquo;ve got to  find out about it. I&rsquo;m the Lindsays&rsquo; lawyer, and Mrs Lindsay is having  hysterics and all that. She&rsquo;s of a revengeful temperament and wants the  murderer of her brother punished. This is not an unnatural feeling, and I want  to do all I can to push matters along. I don&rsquo;t want the case to drift on and  on, until it&rsquo;s laid on the shelf with lots of other unsolved mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either, Lane,&rdquo; Belknap said, earnestly, &ldquo;and  we&rsquo;re working on it night and day. Any news, Prescott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The query was addressed to the detective, who entered  at the moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr Belknap. But what you folks talking about?  Doctor Davenport?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Guardedly, Lane spoke of the strange story the doctor  had told and Prescott caught the drift at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get that dope?&rdquo; he asked, his shrewd eyes  scanning Lane&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t dope&mdash;if you mean evidence; it&rsquo;s merely scouting  for possible clews.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and it may be a boomerang clew! It may rebound  against the man that started it. Who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody in particular,&rdquo; and Lane looked stubborn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they did, now,&rdquo; persisted Prescott. &ldquo;Somebody  started that lead, and did it on purpose. Who made the suggestion? Manning  Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know who spoke about  it first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> sure you know, and you&rsquo;d better  tell. Unless you&rsquo;re shielding somebody yourself. Better speak up, Mr Lane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, it was Philip Barry. I believe it&rsquo;s  wiser to say so than to conceal it. You can&rsquo;t suspect him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I? I can suspect anybody that can&rsquo;t prove  his innocence. And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Mr Barry myself. Isn&rsquo;t he in love  with the heiress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What heiress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lindsay&mdash;half heiress of Mr Gleason&rsquo;s big  fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What if he is? I could name a dozen young men in love  with Miss Lindsay. She&rsquo;s a belle and has numberless admirers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but Philip Barry&rsquo;s a favored one, I&rsquo;ve heard.  Now, didn&rsquo;t he know Miss Lindsay would inherit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he did or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew it&mdash;you drew up the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you tell anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lane stared at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of babbling  about my clients&rsquo; affairs!&rdquo; he said, coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not. But did it leak out in any way&mdash;say, in  general conversation? Such things often do. It was no real secret, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I treated it as one,&rdquo; said Lane. &ldquo;Of course, I  considered it confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; put in Belknap. &ldquo;Lawyers have to be  close-mouthed people, Prescott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Prescott would not be downed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know all that, Mr Belknap, but listen here. The  news of that inheritance might have leaked out in a dozen ways. Not purposely,  of course, but by chance. Wasn&rsquo;t anybody ever in your office, Mr Lane, when Mr  Gleason was there, talking about it, or didn&rsquo;t you ever mention it in  conversation with some intimate friend, say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lane thought back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, decidedly. &ldquo;Unless&mdash;yes, one day, I  remember, Manning Pollard was in my office when Gleason came in. Gleason only  stayed a few minutes, but he did refer to his will, and after he went, I think  I did speak of it to Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he ask you about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure he didn&rsquo;t. I think I volunteered an  observation on the queerness of the Western man, and, as Pollard didn&rsquo;t like  him, anyway, very little was said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the terms of his will were spoken of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, incidentally. Pollard is a close friend of mine,  and I may have been a bit confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you are, then,&rdquo; and Prescott nodded his  sagacious head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Manning Pollard is a babbling sort of chap. I mean,  he says things to make a sensation&mdash;to shock or astound his audience. Ten  chances to one, he implied a knowledge of Gleason&rsquo;s intentions just to appear  importantly wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lane demurred. &ldquo;Pollard isn&rsquo;t that sort,  exactly. He does like to make startling speeches, but they&rsquo;re usually about  himself, not gossip about others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, say Barry got an idea Pollard knew of  Gleason&rsquo;s will, and got at the truth somehow. Or, maybe Barry found out from  some one else. Didn&rsquo;t Miss Lindsay know of her inheritance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how he found out; say, Barry knew  Miss Lindsay would inherit, say, also, he was jealous of Gleason&mdash;which he  was&mdash;and say&mdash;just for the moment&mdash;he did kill Gleason. Wouldn&rsquo;t he be likely to  try to turn suspicion on some one else&mdash;and who could he select better than  Doctor Davenport himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott beamed with an air of triumph at his  conclusion, and looked at the others for concurrence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; Lane scoffed. &ldquo;You surely have built up a  mountain out of a silly molehill. Try again, Prescott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will try again, but it will be along these same  lines,&rdquo; and the detective shook his head doggedly. &ldquo;What say, Mr Belknap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap looked thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much in it,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;yet there may  be. All you can do, Prescott, is to investigate. Check up the doctor&rsquo;s story,  the nurse&rsquo;s story, and keep a watch on Barry. Your evidence is <i>nil</i>, your  suspicion has but slight foundation, and yet, it&rsquo;s true Philip Barry is a  favored admirer of Miss Lindsay, he was jealous of Robert Gleason, and whether  he knew of the will or not, his name can&rsquo;t be ignored in this connection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Lane, &ldquo;investigate Barry thoroughly,  but for heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t be misled. Don&rsquo;t assume his guilt merely because  he admires Miss Lindsay and was jealous of Gleason! Get some real evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday, Mr Lane,&rdquo; Prescott said,  looking at the lawyer with some irritation. &ldquo;I must find a direction in which  to look, mustn&rsquo;t I? I must look in every direction that seems likely, mustn&rsquo;t  I? I happen to know that there was bad blood between Doctor Davenport and Mr  Barry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by bad blood?&rdquo; asked Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean they didn&rsquo;t like each other&mdash;weren&rsquo;t  friendly&mdash;never chummed. And the reason was that they were in love with the same  girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural enough state of affairs,&rdquo; commented Belknap.  &ldquo;Go ahead, Prescott, look up the doctor&rsquo;s yarn, look up Barry&rsquo;s alibi, but, as  Mr Lane says, go carefully. I fancy, that though you may not get anything on  either of these men, you can&rsquo;t help turning up something in the way of evidence  against somebody! Get all the facts you can, all the information you can, and  then see how it affects the individuals. Of course, you must see the nurse that  took the message from Gleason. I&rsquo;m surprised that hasn&rsquo;t been done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We simply accepted the doctor&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; said  Prescott. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll verify it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But before the detective began his promised  verification, he elected to go again to the Gleason apartments.</p>
  <p>Here he visited Miss Adams, whose story, told him by  Belknap, interested him.</p>
  <p>He used his best powers of persuasion on the spinster,  and his wheedlesome ways, and pleasant smile made her affable and loquacious.</p>
  <p>By roundabout talk, he drew from her at last some descriptions  of the callers or visitors at the Gleason apartment.</p>
  <p>She was loath to admit her curiosity, but she finally  confessed that she occasionally hung over the stairway to watch matters below.</p>
  <p>She defended her deed by explaining that she was  lonely, and a little diversion of any sort was welcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, indeed, why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no  crime to watch a body going or coming along the street, or into a house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Prescott,  sympathetically. &ldquo;Now, whom did you see go into Mr Gleason&rsquo;s apartment on the  day of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two! Both at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the lady came first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she did. Wait a minute&mdash;did you see Mr Gleason  himself come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After five. I don&rsquo;t know any nearer than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, then. A lady came? When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite soon after Mr Gleason himself. I heard a light  step on the stairs and I looked out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was a gay little piece. Big eyes, tomato-colored  cheeks and a nose powdered like a marshmallow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Small? Young?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both; that is, very slim, but about average height. I  looked mainly at her clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mostly fur, and long gray stockings and a little  round cap of gray fur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Squirrel fur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. Gray, anyway. A pert little thing she  was, and yet pretty too, in a sort of way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sort of way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, fly, flippant&mdash;flirtatious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;she just gave me that impression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you know her if you saw her again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;those little trots all look alike. But  I&rsquo;d know the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t squirrel furs all look alike?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;yet I think I&rsquo;d know her. You don&rsquo;t think she  killed Mr Gleason, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gracious, no! Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I never saw her come out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t on watch all the time, were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; of course not.&rdquo; Miss Adams turned thoughtful.  &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t hear her go out&mdash;funny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was the other caller?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the girl came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; soon after. He was a swagger, well-dressed chap;  not very large, but tallish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Derby hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sort of soft felt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;but more like olive green&mdash;dull olive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Overcoat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Dark, plain, but with an air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott looked at the old maid interestedly. How  should she know when men&rsquo;s clothes had an air?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very observant,&rdquo; she said, catching his  expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of clothes, though I never had a smart gown  in my life. But I know when people are well-dressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man went in then, before the girl came out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes; but I never saw or heard the girl come  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see or hear the man come out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but that&rsquo;s not so strange. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you were in the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I was. She&rsquo;s no right to be calling at a man&rsquo;s  apartment! I&rsquo;d no thought of the man visitor, but I&rsquo;d like to catch hold of  that silly young thing and give her a talking to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;d listen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know she wouldn&rsquo;t! But I&rsquo;d like the satisfaction of  giving her a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may get it. I&rsquo;m going to try to find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Well, now, see here; we are assuming  that Mr Gleason died at about quarter to seven. Do you think either or both of  those people stayed as long as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How on earth can I tell? I didn&rsquo;t see them leave, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you saw no one else enter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor heard any one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. After six o&rsquo;clock, there&rsquo;s more  or less trafficking on the stairs anyway. The tenants come home, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; now, you&rsquo;re sure about these two, and that they  came about five o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they came, but I can&rsquo;t say certain about the  time. It was quite some after five, but I&rsquo;ve no idea just how much after.&rdquo;  Concluding he could learn no more from Miss Adams, Prescott went to Doctor  Davenport&rsquo;s office to interview Nurse Jordan.</p>
  <p>He found a calm, placid-faced woman, who, being  interrogated, told the story just as the doctor had told it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Describe the voice that came to you over the  telephone,&rdquo; said Prescott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it was gasping and faint&mdash;just what you would  expect a man&rsquo;s voice to be after he had been shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fatally shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not! But I heard it, and I know what he  said. Now if he spoke, he must have been alive, and if he was alive, he hadn&rsquo;t  yet been fatally shot. Had he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely. Then you assume the second shot was the  fatal one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I, when the doctors say otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, then, do you think about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think. If any other nurse had  taken that message I&rsquo;d say she dreamed the thing. But I took it myself, and I  know. The only possible explanation I can think of, is that the murderer stood  there ready to shoot, but hadn&rsquo;t yet fired. The victim somehow managed to get  the telephone call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could he? Why would the murderer let him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. But, say the murderer  threatened him, and say the victim made some plausible plea that made the  murderer grant him a moment&rsquo;s respite to telephone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Or, say, the murderer was threatening  Gleason&rsquo;s life unless he telephoned a certain party&mdash;not the doctor. Then say,  Gleason called this number as a last hope&mdash;and shouted that he was already shot,  when he was merely anticipating the deed, and in his frenzy of fear, hoped that  to tell the doctor that, would be to stay the murderer&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a way out,&rdquo; Nurse Jordan said, musingly. &ldquo;And  that&rsquo;s all I can think of&mdash;that it was something of that sort. As I say, the  voice was husky and scared, but it would be that if he was threatened. Still,  it certainly sounded like the voice of a suffering, dying man. It was short,  gasping&mdash;as if strangling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that case, if he were already shot when he called  up, I mean&mdash;the death shot was not instantaneous, as is supposed, but the victim  lived a few moments. Might that be so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I&rsquo;ve never known Doctor Davenport to  make a false diagnosis and, too, the other doctors agree the shot in the  shoulder was fired after the man was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That seems to be inexplicable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all inexplicable. There&rsquo;s Doctor Davenport  himself&mdash;talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott blessed his luck that the doctor came in just  then, and eagerly began to question him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was at Mrs Ballard&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the doctor said; &ldquo;up on  Ninetieth Street, near Fifth Avenue. After I got the nurse&rsquo;s message, I hurried  down to the Gleason place as fast as I could. I didn&rsquo;t know the exact number&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Prescott felt sure this was meant as a  blind, to indicate the doctor&rsquo;s slight acquaintance with Gleason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t. I had to telephone some one to find  out. I tried the Lindsays first, but the wire was busy, so I called up Manning  Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I didn&rsquo;t get the call, but the Ballards&rsquo; butler  did, and Pollard gave him the address. Of course, the man told Pollard I wanted  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. Then you went right down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and the rest is public knowledge. Look here,  Prescott, what are you getting at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the truth. Go on, tell the story. I have to get  these details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What details?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of what happened before the police came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know it all. How I got help and broke in the  door, and found Gleason on the floor, dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was dead when you entered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With two shots in his body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; why go over these things with me? I&rsquo;ve made my  report.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know! but I want to find out about the telephoning.  How do you account for a man telling of his own death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the puzzle. It&rsquo;s the queerest thing I ever  knew, Prescott, but it isn&rsquo;t my province to ferret out the truth. My duty in  the case is done, and you know it. Now good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One minute, Doctor. Will you tell me where you were  that afternoon&mdash;the afternoon of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Davenport stared at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning that you suspect me of the crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said so. Are you one of those people who  think every question a detective asks implies an accusation? There might be a  dozen reasons for my asking you that besides suspicion of you as Gleason&rsquo;s  murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I&rsquo;ve no reason for not telling. I  left the Club with Dean Monroe. I set him down at his home, in West Fifty-sixth  Street, and then I made a short round of calls. Not more than three or four,  special cases. And while I was at Mrs Ballard&rsquo;s the message came from Nurse  Jordan. Satisfied of my alibi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Davenport&rsquo;s tone was sarcastic, and his smile was not  pleasant. But, as Prescott reflected, nobody likes to be wrongfully suspected.</p>
  <p>A fleeting thought went through the detective&rsquo;s mind  that if Doctor Davenport had killed Gleason he might have done so when he went  down there at seven o&rsquo;clock. But that would mean that Nurse Jordan told a  string of falsehoods, and the whole affair would have been a most complicated  proceeding. No, if the doctor were the murderer, he would not have called up  Pollard to get that address.</p>
  <p>But did he do that? Prescott went away and went  straight to a telephone booth and called Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Pollard said as he heard the query. &ldquo;Called me  up to ask Gleason&rsquo;s address? Why, no&mdash;oh, yes, he did. I remember now. He did,  and I gave it to him. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell you some other time,&rdquo; said Prescott. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter  IX<br>
    Ivy Hayes</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no faith in the police, no faith in detectives  and no faith in anybody!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This wholesale skepticism was voiced by Millicent Lindsay,  and addressed to her small audience of friends gathered in her library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outrageous,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;nearly a week has  passed since my brother&rsquo;s murder, and no real step has been taken to find his  murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steps have been taken,&rdquo; said Louis, &ldquo;but they all  seem to have been taken in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate they led nowhere,&rdquo; Millicent went on.  &ldquo;Nobody knows anything; nobody can explain the mystery of the two shots. Nobody  knows of any motive for the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ceased to suspect Phyllis, then,&rdquo; Philip Barry  said, his smile a little forced as he eagerly awaited the answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have and I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Millicent returned, speaking  slowly. &ldquo;Of course, it seems absurd to think a young girl like Phyllis would do  such a dreadful thing&mdash;but&mdash;she won&rsquo;t tell where she was, and, too, she didn&rsquo;t  like my brother&mdash;at least, she didn&rsquo;t welcome his offer of marriage, and if she  knew of his will, and I think she did, why shouldn&rsquo;t I suspect her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, quit suspecting her,&rdquo; Louis growled. &ldquo;Phyllis  is as innocent as a baby. You&rsquo;re off your head, Millicent, to dream of such a  thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, why won&rsquo;t she tell where she was at the  time of the crime, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t have to. Nobody really suspects her, and  her affairs have no reason to be inquired into. That right, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I think Phyllis would be wise to say  where she was at the time. But, I say, Millicent, I&rsquo;m going to get busy myself,  and do a little detective work. Like you, I feel the investigations so far have  led nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you a suspicion&mdash;&rdquo; began Louis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a suspicion, exactly, but a pretty strong notion  of which way to look. I won&rsquo;t say what it is, for I had another hunch, that  pretty much fell through; but now I&rsquo;m going to work on a new line, and I think  I may unearth something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Millicent, despondently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all  alike&mdash;dig up a lot of evidence and then never prove anything from it. Do tell  me, Phil, what way your suspicions turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you, for I think you ought to be  kept informed. I can&rsquo;t help leaning to the chorus girl theory. I feel sure that  fur collar was left by the girl at that time, and as I see it, she could have  gone there with some man, a friend of hers who either was jealous of Mr  Gleason, or who had it in for him for some other reason. Then suppose, in a  quarrel, the man shot Gleason&mdash;perhaps Gleason threatened him&mdash;anyway, you can&rsquo;t  tell what occurred, but I&rsquo;m going to find the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wrong,&rdquo; said Louis, and his voice was so  full of concentrated passion that Barry looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wrong,&rdquo; Louis repeated; &ldquo;the idea of a man  shooting another man before a girl! Do have a little sense of probability,  Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have, and it&rsquo;s not an impossibility that the deed  should have been committed before the girl witness. I&rsquo;ve thought it all out. I  don&rsquo;t believe it was premeditated, but suppose the pair went there to settle a  grievance and Mr Gleason lost his temper and threatened his visitor&mdash;the man&mdash;and  in a quarrel, the pistol was flourished about, and the visitor grabbed it and  shot, maybe in self-defense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All theory,&rdquo; scoffed Louis. &ldquo;Nothing at all to back  it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; Barry persisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going  to find the owner of that fur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t, Phil.&rdquo; Louis&rsquo; face was white and  his voice trembled a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Louis,&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?  Do you know anything about this business? Actually, from your agitation you  might be unduly interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t know anything about it, but I think it&rsquo;s  awful to hunt down some poor little innocent girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hunting her&mdash;I&rsquo;m hunting the man who was with  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A purely imaginary man!&rdquo; Louis exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So far. But if he doesn&rsquo;t materialize, there&rsquo;s no  harm done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then, Phyllis came in with Manning Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been for a walk,&rdquo; she said, and the roses in  her cheeks proved the good effects of the exercise. &ldquo;Mr Pollard said I needed  more outdoor air, so we walked forty-five blocks. I wish you&rsquo;d go out,  Millicent, it would do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Mrs Lindsay,&rdquo; Pollard suggested; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take  you next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I may go some other time. Now, we&rsquo;re  discussing the case. Sit down, and tell us what you think, Mr Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My opinion is no secret. I incline to some earlier  acquaintance of Mr Gleason&rsquo;s. Perhaps some one from his Western home, or from  anywhere. I&rsquo;ve heard all the evidence that has been brought forward about any  one of his New York acquaintances, and I must admit there&rsquo;s not a shred of it  worth considering. Indeed, there&rsquo;s practically no evidence&mdash;do you know of any,  Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only the fur collar,&rdquo; said Barry, with a decided nod  of his head. &ldquo;I think, as that is the only piece of real, tangible evidence, it  ought to be run to earth. I believe Prescott tried to do so, but his effort  fell through, somehow. At any rate, I&rsquo;m going to take up that clew, and see if  I can&rsquo;t get a line on the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All rubbish,&rdquo; Louis growled. &ldquo;Tell him not to do it,  Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I do that?&rdquo; Pollard asked. &ldquo;If Barry&rsquo;s  sleuthing leads to anything, I&rsquo;ll be glad of it. Like Mrs Lindsay, I want to  know who did this thing. I don&rsquo;t have much faith in the fur collar sign-board,  myself, for I think the thing was left there by some little girl caller, who  had no connection whatever with the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Barry acquiesced. &ldquo;But in that case, I&rsquo;ll do  no harm. I promise not to bother the little girl&mdash;why do we all assume her to be  little&mdash;if she knows nothing of interest to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are you going about your task?&rdquo; Louis asked. He  was still annoyed about it. His bent brows and frowning face showed a special  interest and a dislike of Barry&rsquo;s plans. He moved uneasily in his chair,  suddenly sitting bolt upright, and then falling back in careless relaxation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do sit still, Louis,&rdquo; said Phyllis; &ldquo;you make me  quite nervous&mdash;acting like that. I wish you&rsquo;d go out for a walk. You sit mewed  up here, brooding, until you&rsquo;re in a perfect state of feverish excitement. Run  out, dear; go for a brisk walk. The air is fine and bracing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked anxiously after her brother.</p>
  <p>He returned her gaze, seemed touched by her concern  for him, and finally rose and followed her advice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had the care of him,&rdquo; Phyllis said, as  she looked fondly after him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a darling, but he has moods. And the best  thing for him is to get away from this eternal discussion of the &lsquo;case.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to get away, too,&rdquo; said Millicent,  tartly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you show any sympathy for me, Phyllis, in my trouble.  But, why should you? You&rsquo;ve got your inheritance and you&rsquo;re rid of a  troublesome suitor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, Millicent,&rdquo; Phyllis begged,  tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Indeed, I do sympathize with you, and I&rsquo;m ready and willing  to do anything I can to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, turn your mind to thinking about who  caused Robert&rsquo;s death. You&rsquo;re a bright girl, you have a really clever mind. Why  can&rsquo;t you ferret out the truth as well as a man? As I&rsquo;ve been saying, I don&rsquo;t  think the police detectives get anywhere. I think friends know much more about  the possibilities and probabilities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;And to prove it, I&rsquo;m going to  start on my search at once. I&rsquo;m going down to the Gleason apartment, I&rsquo;m going  to get that fur and take it with me, and I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ll find somebody in the  house, some busybody or curious woman who has seen a girl there with that fur  on. We all know Mr Gleason had friends among the younger members of the  theatrical profession. There&rsquo;s no use blinking that fact, and I propose to find  out something, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, go on, then,&rdquo; urged Millicent, impatiently;  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sit there and talk about it! Start off, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I go!&rdquo; and with a smiling good-by, Barry departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do a thing,&rdquo; Pollard said, with an indulgent  smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on a wild goose chase. I&rsquo;d like to help you, Mrs Lindsay, but I  confess I don&rsquo;t take any stock in the girls. Now, have you any old letters or  papers of your brother&rsquo;s that you can look over. I feel that in those you might  find a past acquaintance or some old quarrel or altercation that might show you  a way to look. This is only a theory, but it&rsquo;s as plausible as any other I&rsquo;ve  heard put forth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Millicent agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve none of  Robert&rsquo;s papers here&mdash;they&rsquo;re all at his rooms still. And I suppose Mr Lane has  charge of them. But I can get them, and I shall do just as you&rsquo;ve advised. Of  course, there may be something divulged that way, but I doubt if my brother had  an enemy out West. He was a much-liked man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Phyllis interrupted, &ldquo;but you must  admit, Millicent, that even well-liked men may have enemies. There&rsquo;s lots about  a man&rsquo;s private life that would contradict the general impression of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you all over, Phyllis! You never lose a chance  to cast a slur on my brother&rsquo;s memory. I should think you would have a little  gratitude to the man who left you a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have, Millicent. And you must not misconstrue my  words as you do. I am anxious, too, to find your brother&rsquo;s murderer. And if, as  Mr Pollard suggests, it may be some Western acquaintance, we must try to find  him. And Mr Gleason&rsquo;s private letters and papers may reveal much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. Now, with Phil Barry after the  chorus girl, and Mr Pollard&rsquo;s suggestions of hunting among the letters, we, at  least have something to do. I shall send word to Mr Lane at once that I want  all the papers from Robert&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She went away to telephone, leaving Phyllis and  Manning Pollard alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere chance,&rdquo; said Pollard, thoughtfully; &ldquo;it  may well be that Mr Gleason would destroy any letters that are indicative of  the sort of thing we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; the girl returned. &ldquo;I imagine Mr  Gleason would have kept such papers. You see, I knew the man better than you  did. You hardly knew him at all, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I never met him more than two or three times, and  that in the most formal way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you threatened to kill him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it that way, Miss Lindsay&mdash;please. My idle  words have been repeated till I&rsquo;m tired of hearing them! I did say I disliked  the man&mdash;and I did. That&rsquo;s all there was about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I disliked him, too,&rdquo; said Phyllis, slowly. &ldquo;I always  had a nervous dread of him. I don&rsquo;t know why, but he always affected me  unpleasantly, even when he was most kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you know what I mean. That unreasonable,  inexplicable detestation of his presence. So, of course, when the man was  killed, they assumed it was my work. I left it to them to find out where I was  at the time for I knew that would be a surer proof of my innocence than if I  vehemently denied guilt and tried to prove an alibi. But you, too, I&rsquo;m told,  refuse to say where you were at the time of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phyllis whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I don&rsquo;t want  to tell. I have good reasons for my silence, truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And not connected with Mr Gleason&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard did not voice this as a question, but merely  as a statement of fact, and Phyllis gave him a glance of gratitude for his  faith in her.</p>
  <p>But she did not corroborate his assertion and his  inquiring glance that followed met with no definite response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now is there anything I can do?&rdquo; Pollard asked, after  a more or less desultory chat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at your command&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were a very busy man,&rdquo; and Phyllis  smiled at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not when I can be of any assistance to you or Mrs  Lindsay. Though now that you have come into a great fortune, perhaps an humble  pen-pusher will cease to interest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phyllis, seriously; &ldquo;on the contrary, I  shall have more need than ever of friends who can advise me in certain ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely your lawyer will do that. Lane is a most  capable legal adviser&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. I mean in other ways&mdash;things on  which I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of discussing with Mr Lane. Oh, I have awful troubles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; Pollard&rsquo;s serious, kindly manner  carried conviction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to help you, but in important matters you&rsquo;d  better consult some one of sound judgment and special knowledge. If you don&rsquo;t  care to confide in Lane, ask him for the type of adviser you do need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; the girl hesitated, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a  question of special knowledge at all. I just want advice from some man of the  world&mdash;a man of our set, of our interests. Somebody who knows what to do in a  crisis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, Miss Phyllis&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk like that! If you do,  I shall be tempted to offer my own services, and I&rsquo;m sure there are many better  fitted for the position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you would help me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not go to Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phil Barry? He&rsquo;s a dear, and a good friend to me, but  he has what is known as the artistic temperament&mdash;and you know what that means.  No&mdash;the weight on my mind&mdash;the awful quandary I&rsquo;m in, couldn&rsquo;t be helped by him.  He&rsquo;s the last man to help me. Oh, Mr Pollard&mdash;I oughtn&rsquo;t to ask you&mdash;in fact, I  oughtn&rsquo;t to tell anybody&mdash;but I feel so helpless. Perhaps Mr Lane would be the  best one after all. I don&rsquo;t know what I ought to do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard looked at the lovely face, so full of grief  and uncertainty. He wondered what it could be about. Was it the exaggerated  fear of a young girl, that had little or no real foundation. Or&mdash;could it be  possible that she had some knowledge, guilty or evidential, of the Gleason  affair.</p>
  <p>After a pause the man spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Phyllis,&rdquo; he said, with a gentle courtesy, &ldquo;I  want to help you, more than I can tell you&mdash;more than I ought to tell you. But  I&rsquo;m not going to take advantage of what may be merely a mood of confidence. You  think things over; you consider your other friends&mdash;or legal advisers&mdash;and after  careful thought, if you want to make me your confidant, I shall be honored, and  I will advise you to the best of my powers. But don&rsquo;t be hasty. Think it over  well, and&mdash;may I see you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How kind you are!&rdquo; the girl held out her hand with a  pretty impulsive gesture. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want; to think it over a little  and decide whether I want to tell Mr Lane,&mdash;or whether I&rsquo;d rather confide in a&mdash;a  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; was the hearty response. &ldquo;And  Lane, who has wide knowledge, is also a good friend. Consider carefully, and  decide slowly. But depend on me to the last ditch, if I can be of help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime Philip Barry was on his quest.</p>
  <p>He had decided on straightforward measures, and,  gaining an accurate description of the fur piece, had gone directly to the home  of Ivy Hayes, whose picture, he knew, graced the Gleason apartment.</p>
  <p>He found the young lady and obtained an interview  without difficulty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, as she appeared before him.</p>
  <p>He saw a slim young thing, who might have been any one  of thousands of young girls one meets everywhere, in the street or on the  streetcars.</p>
  <p>Muffs of dark hair over her ears; hand-painted cheeks  and lips; saucy, powdered nose, and a slender shape encased in a one-piece  frock, both scant and short.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Hayes?&rdquo; said Barry, bowing politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The same. And you are&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, are you? Hello, Phil, what&rsquo;s the big idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only to learn if you lost your fur collar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. My sable one&mdash;or my chinchilla?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; Barry couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at the  impertinent face; &ldquo;your gray squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that one. Now, s&rsquo;pose I say no?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re out one piece of fur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And s&rsquo;pose I say yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you get your fur back, but you&rsquo;ll be asked a few  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s worth it. Where&rsquo;s the pelt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lordy!&rdquo; Ivy dropped into a chair and pretended to  faint. &ldquo;Now how does that come about?&rdquo; she asked, cocking one eye up at her  caller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I fancy you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;let&rsquo;s put all the cards on the table. You  don&rsquo;t think I had anything to do with the&mdash;the fatal deed, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What fatal deed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I told you to be frank. Old Gleason&rsquo;s  murder, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You left your fur there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yep, I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The day of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure. I was there that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You admit this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;d be found out anyway, and, as I didn&rsquo;t  have anything to do with the shooting, I don&rsquo;t see why I don&rsquo;t get my fur back.  It&rsquo;s an awful nice little collar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it back, Miss Hayes; and now, instead of  waiting for a police detective to interview you, suppose you tell me all you  know about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much, but what I have is yours. I went  round there, that afternoon, on&mdash;an errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was the errand? You may as well tell as to have  me drag it out of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Well, our old gentleman friend said he&rsquo;d  give a party for me and a few friends. Oh, a nice, proper supper party&mdash;after  the theater some night. I&rsquo;m in the chorus now. Used to be in the movies.  Anyway, he promised and promised, and never set the time. So I telephoned and  telephoned and I couldn&rsquo;t get him to make a date, so I just went round there to  try and persuade him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he make the date?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the old fourflusher! He crawled out of it, and  said if I&rsquo;d let him off he&rsquo;d give me a nice present. Said he&rsquo;d take me to any  jewelry shop I chose, to pick it out. Said he&rsquo;d take me the next day. Now, you  don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d croak a guy that was about to give me a bracelet, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not. And you were so excited you came away and  left your fur there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just that! I wasn&rsquo;t sure I did leave it there, for I  was at two or three other places that day. When do I get the squirly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, in a few days, I should say. I&rsquo;ll take your yarn  to headquarters, and they&rsquo;ll do the rest. But, I say, when you came away from  there, Mr Gleason was alive and well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet he was! He fairly shooed me out&mdash;he was in a  hurry to get ready to go to a party or something. Oh, my gracious!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that exclamation for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. A pin stuck into me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry knew better. A sudden thought had come to the  girl, a thought that filled her with dismay for some reason. But Philip Barry  felt the matter was getting too serious for him, and he decided to put it in  the hands of the police.</p>
  <p>He went straight back to the Lindsays&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr Barry,&rdquo; was the first greeting he heard,  as he entered the library, where several people were sitting in conclave.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the man we want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The speaker was Prescott, the detective, and he held  an open letter in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nailed you,&rdquo; he said to Barry. &ldquo;No use your  saying much. This letter speaks for itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mechanically, Barry took the paper the detective  handed to him.</p>
  <p>It was a letter, typewritten, on club paper. In ran  thus:</p>
  <p>Mr Robert Gleason: Sir:</p>
  <p>There is small necessity of words between us. Unless  you see fit to cease your attentions to a lady of our mutual acquaintance, I  shall take matters into my own hands and shall so arrange things that it will  be impossible for you to annoy her further.</p>
  <p align="right">Philip Barry.</p>
  <p>The signature, pen signed, was undoubtedly Barry&rsquo;s  own, and the date was the day before the murder.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter  X<br>
    The Signed Letter</b></h2>
  <p>Philip Barry stood staring at the paper the detective  had handed to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What foolery is this?&rdquo; he said, angrily. &ldquo;I never saw  this before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Prescott, a sarcastic smile on his face.  &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you write it then? Blindfolded?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So it was you!&rdquo; Millicent Lindsay cried. &ldquo;I knew we&rsquo;d  get at the truth, but I didn&rsquo;t think you were the criminal, Philip! Oh, you may  as well own up&mdash;the proof is positive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not positive,&rdquo; Phyllis said, looking at Barry,  kindly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t sure that Mr Barry killed Mr Gleason, just because he wrote  this note&mdash;is it, Mr Prescott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks mighty like it,&rdquo; the detective returned. &ldquo;But  we&rsquo;ll listen to what he has to say. You wrote this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; and Barry&rsquo;s eyes flashed ominously. &ldquo;I  tell you I never saw it before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is your signature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks like it, I admit, but it can&rsquo;t be, for I  never wrote that letter. Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Mr Gleason&rsquo;s desk. At his apartment. As you see,  it&rsquo;s dated the day before the murder took place, it&rsquo;s&mdash;to say the least&mdash;a bit  incriminating. What&rsquo;s your explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Mr Barry.&rdquo; Prescott spoke seriously.  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a threatening note, signed by yourself, written on your Club paper to  Mr Gleason. Unless you can prove that signature forged, I think your denial of  any knowledge of this document cannot be believed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe it or not,&rdquo; Barry stormed, &ldquo;I tell you I  never wrote that. I never saw it! I don&rsquo;t know anything about it! I&rsquo;ve been out  investigating the case, getting evidence and all that, and I came back here  with it and you thrust that thing at me! I tell you it&rsquo;s a forgery! Somebody&rsquo;s  trying to get me into this thing&mdash;but the game can&rsquo;t be worked!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you sign your name, Mr Barry?&rdquo; Prescott asked  quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t! I deny your right to ask it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a refusal is a tacit admission&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No admission at all! I refuse to do a silly thing  like that! The signature does resemble mine&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be mine, for I didn&rsquo;t  write it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you any of Mr Barry&rsquo;s signatures in your  possession?&rdquo; Prescott asked of Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, promptly, and though Prescott doubted  her word, he didn&rsquo;t say so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; Louis exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dead easy to get a  signature of yours, Phil, why not write one now, and have it over with. Of  course the thing is a forgery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently seeing the sense of this, Barry went to the  desk and dashed off his name on a sheet of paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried, angrily, as he flung it at Prescott.</p>
  <p>The detective examined the two, and gave a short  whistle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if I knew of anybody who could  forge as well as that&mdash;I&rsquo;d get him behind bars as quick as possible! Why, man,  the signatures are identical! As to the typing, that is as personal as  penmanship. Have you a typewriter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;; growled Barry, looking like a wild beast at bay.  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you ever use one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis looked up, with such a surprised air, that  Prescott said, &ldquo;Yes, you do. Whose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s,&rdquo; repeated Barry, now furiously incensed.  &ldquo;You quit these absurd questions! I won&rsquo;t answer any more!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Phil,&rdquo; said Phyllis, gently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get so  angry. Mr Prescott is only trying to find out about this letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And an important letter it is,&rdquo; cried Millicent.</p>
  <p>She was greatly excited, her eyes flashed and her lips  trembled, as she fairly glared at Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the criminal,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you killed my  brother! Some need to ask why! Just because you&rsquo;re in love with Phyllis and you  found Robert was cutting you out! A fine way to remedy matter&mdash;to kill your  rival!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Millicent,&rdquo; Phyllis begged, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t jump at  conclusions like that! Even if Phil did write that letter it doesn&rsquo;t prove he  killed Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;; Barry said, as if struck with a new view of it  all; &ldquo;even if I did write that, it proves nothing further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Prescott, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re admitting that you wrote  it, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I admit nothing. I deny nothing. I only say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything, Phil,&rdquo; Louis warned him. &ldquo;You say  too much, anyway. Prescott&rsquo;s on the job, let him find out who wrote the letter,  and who signed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if there was any doubt;&rdquo; the detective scoffed.  &ldquo;But, laying aside the question for the moment, did you say, Mr Barry, that you  have been doing some investigating on your own account?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On my own account, and on account of my friends  here,&rdquo; Barry replied, but his tone and expression betrayed agitation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  found out who owns the fur collar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Prescott asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ivy Hayes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The effect of his announcement was slight on all  present, except Louis Lindsay. He started, looked frightened, began to speak  and then checked himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Louis,&rdquo; Barry said, &ldquo;out with it! I know you&rsquo;re  interested in Miss Hayes&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is the word,&rdquo; said Louis, and his low voice was  intense and incisive, &ldquo;if you or anybody else undertakes to drag Ivy Hayes&rsquo;  name into this muddle, you&rsquo;ll have to reckon with me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now,&rdquo; Prescott smiled, &ldquo;in the first place,  I won&rsquo;t have my case called a muddle&mdash;next, if Miss Hayes or anybody else is  connected with it in any way, she&rsquo;s in it already, without having to be dragged  in&mdash;as you call it. Go on, Mr Barry, what did you learn from or about Miss  Hayes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I learned that she was in Mr Gleason&rsquo;s apartment the  afternoon of the murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Louis exclaimed, &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, Louis,&rdquo; Barry said, contemptuously, &ldquo;she  told me herself she was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Prescott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She left Mr Gleason alive and well, when she  departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t remember exactly&mdash;it&rsquo;s the hardest thing  in the world to make people assert a time. But I gathered it was not far from  six o&rsquo;clock when she left Gleason&rsquo;s rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s getting pretty close to the time of the  murder,&rdquo; Prescott said thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she didn&rsquo;t kill Gleason,&rdquo; Barry put in, &ldquo;He was  planning to take her next day to buy a bracelet&mdash;as Ivy said, why would she kill  a man who was about to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You innocent!&rdquo; exclaimed Millicent; &ldquo;of course, she  said that to pull the wool over your eyes! I don&rsquo;t believe you did it after  all, Phil! I believe it was that Ivy person! A girl like that wouldn&rsquo;t leave  her fur collar, unless she went away in a fearful hurry or trepidation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A point, Mrs Lindsay,&rdquo; and Prescott looked at her  admiringly. &ldquo;It would indeed denote a preoccupied mind, to leave a fur collar.  And she was there about six, you say. But the man wasn&rsquo;t killed till nearly  seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she didn&rsquo;t tell the truth about the time,&rdquo; said  Millicent, nodding her head sagaciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised she admitted being  there at all&mdash;but, I&rsquo;m told they always slip up on some details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, there are several matters to be  looked into,&rdquo; Prescott said, rising to go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in your story of the  Hayes girl, Mr Barry, but I&rsquo;m even more interested in this letter you wrote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write it, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you tell me so, but I can&rsquo;t take your word for  that. I&rsquo;m going to consult a penmanship expert. And, if you&rsquo;ll take my advice  you won&rsquo;t try to leave town&mdash;for, you&rsquo;d find it difficult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning I&rsquo;m to be under surveillance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, the matter has to be cleared up,&rdquo; Prescott  shrugged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly ridiculous!&rdquo; Barry stormed on, after the  detective had gone; &ldquo;you know, don&rsquo;t you, Phyllis, I had nothing to do with the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Phyllis replied, but her voice was  disinterested and her gaze was far off. &ldquo;But, look here, Phil, tell me  something. When can I get my money&mdash;or some of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew! What do you want of all that? Are you  mercenary, Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I want it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she does!&rdquo; cried Millicent. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been harping  on that all day. I think it&rsquo;s disgraceful! She thinks of nothing but that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Millicent,&rdquo; and Phyllis&rsquo; face flushed  painfully&mdash;&ldquo;I do want some ready cash, for an important purpose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And sometimes I go back to my first idea that you  killed my brother,&rdquo; Mrs Lindsay glared at her stepdaughter.</p>
  <p>Millicent Lindsay was becoming more and more nervously  unstrung about her brother&rsquo;s death. Hers was a super-emotional nature, and  combined with a desperate spirit of revenge, she grew excited every time the  subject was discussed. And as she never lost a possible chance to discuss it,  the state of her nerves was becoming permanently affected. Not content to leave  the matter to detectives, she continually discovered, or thought she did, new  evidence, and promptly changed her suspicions to correspond. She transferred  her accusations from one suspect to another with remarkable speed and often  unjustifiable assurance.</p>
  <p>At present she was quite willing to believe in the  guilt of Ivy Hayes or Philip Barry, or, as she just stated, to turn back to her  original suspicion of Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; Barry groaned, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the limit,  Millicent! You are quite capable of believing every one of us killed Gleason!  Why do you except old Pollard from your mind? He said he was going to do it,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s why I know he didn&rsquo;t! If he had intended  it, he wouldn&rsquo;t have said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Mill, you do have flashes of insight,&rdquo; Louis  said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way I look at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I saw Pollard down in the vicinity of Gleason&rsquo;s  place today,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;Now, what was he doing down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drawn back to the scene of his crime!&rdquo; Louis chaffed.  &ldquo;They say that&rsquo;s always done. No; Phil, you can&rsquo;t hang anything on Pollard.  Prescott checked up his movements at once. Also, I want you to drop Ivy Hayes&rsquo;  name. For my sake, old chap, do let up on that. Now, what about yourself?  Explain that letter, boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Barry looked troubled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh. Why not own up you wrote it, but you didn&rsquo;t  mean murder and didn&rsquo;t commit murder. That&rsquo;s the truth, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Louis&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t write it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me, but your tone and look are not those of a  man telling the pure unvarnished. Now, I know that nobody on this green earth  could have written that signature but Philip Barry himself. And I also  recognize the typewriter you used. As Prescott says, typing is as traceable as  penmanship, and that note was written on the machine in the writing room at the  Club. It&rsquo;s been there for years, and we all write on it now and then. So you see,  Phil, you&rsquo;d better be careful what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Phyllis warned them; &ldquo;here comes Mr  Pollard; I don&rsquo;t suppose you want him to hear this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Louis, but Barry checked him with a  look as Pollard came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I come?&rdquo; he said, as he greeted the women. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  starving for a cup of tea, and you asked me to come informally and unbidden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course we did,&rdquo; Phyllis smiled; &ldquo;sit down, tea is  imminent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing my head off all day,&rdquo; Pollard went  on, as he took an easy chair. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t even been out for a breath of air&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Phyllis was about to say that Barry had seen  him down near the Gleason home, but she stopped herself in time. She had no  wish to trip up Phil Barry&mdash;indeed, her feelings prompted her to shield him&mdash;but  surely, surely, he had falsified in this instance! Why?</p>
  <p>There was but one answer. Barry was trying to make  Pollard again suspected. Notwithstanding Barry&rsquo;s insistence on Pollard&rsquo;s alibi,  a stray hint, such as he had given about seeing him down town, made things  questionable again.</p>
  <p>Quickly changing the subject, Phyllis made the  conversation general, and though the Gleason matter cropped up now and then,  other topics were mentioned.</p>
  <p>Also, Phyllis returned to her great desire to get some  of her inheritance at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, surely you can,&rdquo; Pollard said; &ldquo;how much do you  want? Can&rsquo;t I advance you some?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I want twenty thousand dollars, and I don&rsquo;t want  to say what for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like a flash, Pollard&rsquo;s mind went back to that  afternoon&mdash;the day of the murder&mdash;when he saw Phyllis pass him in a taxicab. He  had been standing, he remembered, in the corner of Fifth Avenue and  Forty-second Street, and he distinctly saw Phyllis, and a strange man with her.  She had not seen him&mdash;of that he was sure&mdash;and now, as she voiced this strange  desire, he wondered what in the world she had been up to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking what you want all that for,&rdquo; he said,  with a kindly smile, &ldquo;but maybe you&rsquo;d care to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Her face was pink, but her voice was  calm and her glance at him steady. &ldquo;I will say, however, that it is for a  purpose which no one could disapprove of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why not tell?&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  Phyllis all over, Mr Pollard; she&rsquo;d make a mystery out of nothing! If her  purpose is a good one, why keep it so secret? I&rsquo;ll tell you why; only because  Phyllis loves to create a sensation! She loves to be wondered at and thought  important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Millicent, what nonsense!&rdquo; Phyllis blushed  painfully now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let up, Mill,&rdquo; Louis said; &ldquo;my sister is not like  that. I can easily understand why she might want a round sum of money, for a  perfectly good reason, yet not want to tell everybody all about it. And she  ought to have it, too. Lane could give it to her, if he chose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says he can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Phyllis said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to lend it to you,&rdquo; Pollard told her,  &ldquo;as soon as I can get it together. I&rsquo;ve stocks I can sell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; said Millicent.  &ldquo;Phyllis can wait. There&rsquo;s no such desperate haste&mdash;or, if there is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Millicent!&rdquo; Louis spoke sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going  to insinuate something about Phyllis and the&mdash;the affair&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Millicent broke forth, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t  heard about Phil Barry&rsquo;s note, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Barry, looking daggers at  Millicent; &ldquo;but, of course, he soon will, so I&rsquo;ll tell it myself. Why, Pol, a  note has been discovered among Gleason&rsquo;s papers, signed by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, did you sign it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never! But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t sign it, why bother? Experts nowadays  can tell positively a forgery from a real signature. You&rsquo;re all right. But what  was the note? Of any importance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it contained what might be looked upon as a  threat against Gleason&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard smiled involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the same boat, then, Phil. You know I&rsquo;m  accused of threatening the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but you did threaten it&mdash;I heard you. And you  were just talking foolishly. But this written matter is different. The thing  said if Gleason didn&rsquo;t let Phyllis alone, I&rsquo;d do for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, internal evidence, then, proves you never wrote  it. You wouldn&rsquo;t express yourself in that way in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quoted it verbatim. That&rsquo;s only the gist of  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well; tell me more. Is it all written by  you&mdash;apparently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but it&rsquo;s on that typewriter&mdash;over at the Club&mdash;you  know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Pollard looked serious now. &ldquo;A note written  on that old junk-heap, and signed by you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t get it, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t, Pol, I don&rsquo;t myself! There&rsquo;s a  conspiracy against me, I believe! Somebody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, Barry, what sort of talk is that? You  had no animosity against Gleason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, then, I did&mdash;very much so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phil, stop!&rdquo; cried Phyllis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see you  oughtn&rsquo;t to say such things? Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, here among ourselves,&rdquo; said  Pollard, &ldquo;but speak out, Phil; say where you were at the time of the murder.  Quash all possibility of suspicion at once. I used that bravado stunt, and  though it&rsquo;s all right now&mdash;yet it made him a lot of bother. I wouldn&rsquo;t do it  again, nor advise any one else to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do what again?&rdquo; asked Millicent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that smarty-cat business of not telling where I  was at the hour of the crime. Of course, being right there at home, I knew  they&rsquo;d have to prove it, but it was sheer, silly bravado that made me refuse to  speak plainly and tell my own story. And, now, that the case is farther along,  I&rsquo;ll tell you, Phil, you make a mistake if you try that fool game. Speak up,  man, where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Barry spoke slowly, &ldquo;I left the Club with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you did. We walked together down to your  street, Forty-fourth&mdash;and then you turned off and I went on down home. What did  you do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. Just dressed for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, there was a long time in there. We parted  about six, and dinner was at eight. Dressing all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I think so. Or in my room, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anybody see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Let up Pollard, I won&rsquo;t be  quizzed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quizzing you, old chap, but I&rsquo;m warning you  that others will. What you tell me about this letter, doesn&rsquo;t sound good to me.  I don&rsquo;t say you wrote it, but I do say the experts will know&mdash;and if they prove  it on you&mdash;the letter I mean&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be questioned, and mighty closely, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t do anything&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid of being  questioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, son. Neither was I. And when they  questioned my hotel people they were satisfied of my innocence. If you&rsquo;re fixed  like that, you&rsquo;re all right, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry looked thoughtful. Pollard watched him, though  not seeming to do so. This letter business sounded queer to them all.</p>
  <p>Phyllis and Louis watched Barry in silence, but  Millicent exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you do it, Phil? Oh, say you didn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t  stand suspense&mdash;tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Millicent, of course, I didn&rsquo;t kill your  brother,&rdquo; Barry said; &ldquo;nor did I write him a letter saying I would do anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Barry,&rdquo; Pollard said, cordially. &ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t ask you myself, but since you make that statement, that&rsquo;s all I want  to know. Now, about that money, Miss Phyllis. I&rsquo;m sure I can get it for you  inside of forty-eight hours. Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Phyllis gave him a grateful look. &ldquo;I hate  to ask you, but Mr Lane only laughs when I talk to him, and tells me not to be  impatient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most girls are impatient,&rdquo; Pollard smiled. &ldquo;Very  well, then, I&rsquo;ll bring it to you day after tomorrow&mdash;or tomorrow, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, to their surprise, Prescott returned, and  asked Barry to go with him to the District Attorney&rsquo;s office, which, perforce,  and with a bad grace, Philip Barry did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, say you think he is innocent,&rdquo; Phyllis begged of  Pollard, after Barry&rsquo;s departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would say so,&rdquo; Pollard returned, &ldquo;but if that note  is proved to be from him, it looks a little dubious.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter  XI<br>
    Miss Adams Again</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything looks dubious!&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed. &ldquo;I do  think it&rsquo;s a shame! Here the days are flying by and absolutely nothing done  toward discovering who killed my brother! Unless the police achieve something  soon, I shall get a private detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re no good,&rdquo; Louis advised her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  terribly expensive and they make a lot of trouble and never get any results,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You speak largely, Louis,&rdquo; Pollard said, smiling at  the boy. &ldquo;Do you know all that from experience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not exactly; but I&rsquo;ve gathered some such  convictions from what I&rsquo;ve heard of private detectives as a class.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about Phil Barry and that letter?&rdquo; Phyllis  asked, her great eyes full of a troubled uncertainty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must have written it,&rdquo; Louis declared. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that  right, Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any way out of it. It is most surely his  signature, and he often writes on that old machine. Also, he did have a grouch  about Mr Gleason&rsquo;s attentions to Miss Lindsay&mdash;that I know. But, I don&rsquo;t for a  minute think he meant to kill Gleason and I don&rsquo;t think he did. But the note  will make him a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You still suspect some Western friend?&rdquo; said  Millicent, looking earnestly at Pollard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely a friend! But I do think that&rsquo;s a reasonable  supposition, for I can&rsquo;t see any real indication anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point Lane arrived, and joined in the  wonderment about Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most surely his signature,&rdquo; Lane said, &ldquo;I know  it as well as I know my own&mdash;and it&rsquo;s no forgery. Why should it be a forgery,  anyway? Supposing the murderer to be a Western man, or a chorus girl, or even  Doctor Davenport, who has most foolishly been mentioned in this connection, why  should he write a note and forge Barry&rsquo;s name to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To throw suspicion on Phil,&rdquo; said Louis, simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, but, I mean, how could it be done?  Your Western stranger or your chorus girl can&rsquo;t get into the Club to use that  machine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you positive the note was written on that  typewriter?&rdquo; asked Pollard, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I looked it up. There are some broken letters  that don&rsquo;t print well, and that makes it unmistakable. Now Davenport could get  access to the typewriter, of course, but I can&rsquo;t see old Doc sitting down and  writing that note and forging Barry&rsquo;s name! Can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;; and Pollard smiled at the idea. &ldquo;But Davenport  and Barry hate each other like poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve an old quarrel, something about a  Picture Exhibition where Doc is a director, and didn&rsquo;t fall down and worship  Barry&rsquo;s pictures. But that&rsquo;s not enough to make a man kill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Yet it was a deep full-fledged quarrel&mdash;rather  more than you represent it. However, I say, grant Barry wrote the note&mdash;which he  must have done, but don&rsquo;t hold it as proof positive of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What else could he have meant by it?&rdquo; Millicent  asked, her eager face demanding reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as we are assuming he meant Miss Lindsay&mdash;and  we&rsquo;ve no real right to assume that,&rdquo; Pollard smiled at the girl, &ldquo;we may say he  only meant to cut Gleason out, and gaining the lady&rsquo;s hand himself, make it  impossible for Gleason to hope any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; Lane said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d hardly think  if that was in Barry&rsquo;s mind he would have worded his note just as he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes he would,&rdquo; put in Louis. &ldquo;Barry&rsquo;s a temperamental  chap, and he&rsquo;d say anything. I know him&mdash;I like him, but he does do and say  queer things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All artists do,&rdquo; Pollard observed.</p>
  <p>Millicent and Lane went off to another room to discuss  some business matters and Louis followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t mention that money before Lane,&rdquo;  Pollard said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s wiser not to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and Phyllis looked at him curiously. But her  eyes fell before his gaze, and a faint blush rose to her cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;forgive me if I seem intrusive&mdash;because I  think you want it for a purpose you don&rsquo;t care to talk about. And if so, the  least said the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; and Phyllis looked  troubled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything said about it. Also, I don&rsquo;t want it in a  check&mdash;that I should have to endorse. Can&rsquo;t I have cash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;if necessary. But it is wiser to have a  check for your own safety and security. Shall you get a receipt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose so&mdash;I never thought of that.&rdquo; The lovely  face was so anxious and worried that Pollard&rsquo;s deepest sympathy was roused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me help you further,&rdquo; he said, impulsively. &ldquo;Oh,  Phyllis, confide the whole story to me. I&rsquo;m sure I can help&mdash;and you can trust  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The frank glance that accompanied these words was also  tender and appealing. Phyllis knew at once that here was a friend&mdash;even more  than a friend&mdash;but at any rate, a man she could trust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;for it  isn&rsquo;t all my secret. I wish I could speak plainly&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; don&rsquo;t tell me anything you&rsquo;re in  honor bound not to. But let me know what you can of the circumstances and let  me advise you. Can&rsquo;t I pay the money whenever it is due, and bring you a  receipt&mdash;and so save you unnecessary embarrassment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if you could do that!&rdquo; Phyllis&rsquo; eyes shone with  gratitude and pleasure at the thought of thus having her burden shared.</p>
  <p>But Lane&rsquo;s return to the room precluded further  planning just then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pollard,&rdquo; Lane said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think things  look a bit dark for Phil Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not only that letter business, which is, to my mind  very serious, but other things. Merely straws, perhaps, but they show the  direction of the wind. Mrs Lindsay told me that Barry said he saw you, Pollard,  to-day, down in the vicinity of the Gleason house. Then, Mrs Lindsay said, you  came in here and said you had been at home all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; Pollard returned, staring at Lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the funny thing. Only yesterday, Barry  told me that he had seen you over in Brooklyn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brooklyn! I never go there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Barry said he saw you there. Now, it&rsquo;s quite  evident to me, Barry is lying, and it must be in some endeavor to get you mixed  up in the Gleason matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks a little like that&mdash;but, how absurd! Why  should he say he saw me in Brooklyn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You weren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I almost never go to Brooklyn, and I certainly  was not there yesterday. I haven&rsquo;t been there for a year, at least!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite on to Barry&rsquo;s game, but there&rsquo;s two  cases where he falsified in the matter of seeing you. Now, why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say why, too. I can&rsquo;t see any reason for the  Brooklyn yarn. I suppose I can see a reason for his saying he saw me down in  Washington Square, if he means to try to fasten the crime on me. But, the  Brooklyn story I see no sense in. What do you think, Lane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I begin to think Barry&rsquo;s the guilty man, though up to  now, I had quite another suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A definite one? A person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, decidedly so. And I&rsquo;ve no reason to give up my  suspicion&mdash;except that Barry has loomed up more prominently than my suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak out&mdash;who&rsquo;s your man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr Lane, tell us,&rdquo; Phyllis urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; not at present. It&rsquo;s some one whose name has not  even been breathed in connection with the case, and if I suspect him wrongly it  would be a fearful thing to say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, if that&rsquo;s the way of it, better keep it  quiet.&rdquo; Pollard nodded his head. &ldquo;Been all through Gleason&rsquo;s papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and I can&rsquo;t find any letters from any one out  West or anywhere else who would seem a likely suspect. No old time feuds, or  present-day quarrels. If we except Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a quarrel with him, Pollard&mdash;or had you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had not. I never saw him more than three times, I  think. And when I said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what you said, and why. Don&rsquo;t harp on  that, Pol, but try to help me out in this Barry business. Can you see Barry  going down there and shooting Gleason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard was still for a minute; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean, can I visualize Barry doing the  thing. No, I can&rsquo;t. To begin with, he hasn&rsquo;t the nerve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, some quiet, inoffensive men pick up nerve on  occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, he hadn&rsquo;t sufficient motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A lady in the case is frequently the motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay. Well, here&rsquo;s a final disclaimer. I was  with Barry myself until about six o&rsquo;clock that night. I hold he wouldn&rsquo;t have  had time to go down to Gleason&rsquo;s after I left him, and get back and appear at  Miss Lindsay&rsquo;s at dinner time, quite unruffled and correct in dress and  demeanor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure he did do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly; I was there myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he left you, say, at six. Dinner was at eight.  Seems to me that was time for all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if he rushed matters. It would, of course, imply  premeditation. He would have had to get down to Gleason&rsquo;s quickly&mdash;hold on, the  telephone message was received at Doctor Davenport&rsquo;s office at about a quarter  to seven&mdash;I remember the detective harped on that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Say he did commit the crime at about  six-thirty, or quarter to seven, that would give him time to get home and to  the dinner at eight. It all fits in, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it does,&rdquo; Pollard agreed, slowly. &ldquo;But,  that would mean that when he left me that afternoon, or evening&mdash;about six  o&rsquo;clock, anyway, he had this thing all planned, and rushed it through. I submit  that if that were so, he would have been excited, or preoccupied, or something.  On the contrary, Lane, he was as calm and casual as we are this minute. I can&rsquo;t  see it&mdash;as I said in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Phyllis spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Mr Lane,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I happen to know  that Phil Barry told two untruths&mdash;or else, Mr Pollard did. I mean, Phil said,  he saw Mr Pollard twice, in places where he himself says he was not. Now shall  I believe the one or the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Choose,&rdquo; said Pollard, smiling at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Miss Lindsay,&rdquo; Lane said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t choose because  of your faith in one man or the other. Choose by rational deduction from  circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to do,&rdquo; Phyllis replied. &ldquo;And  here&rsquo;s how it looks to me. Phil Barry didn&rsquo;t tell the truth or else Mr Pollard  didn&rsquo;t. Now, Mr Pollard has no reason to prevaricate, and Phil, if guilty, has.  Therefore&mdash;and yet, I can&rsquo;t believe Phil shot Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed. &ldquo;I see it all now.  Phil&rsquo;s madly in love with you, Phyllis&mdash;as who isn&rsquo;t? I don&rsquo;t know what it is,  child, but you seem to set all men wild, and you so demure and sweet! Well,  it&rsquo;s common knowledge that Phil adores you. And we all know my brother did. Now  the theory or hypothesis or whatever you call it, that Phil was jealous of  Robert and killed him&mdash;after sending him that warning letter&mdash;is, to my mind the  only tenable theory and one that proves in every detail. For, granting Phil  Barry is the criminal, the letter is explainable, the stories he told about Mr  Pollard are explainable, and the whole thing becomes clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millicent,&rdquo; Phyllis said, looking at her seriously, &ldquo;you  are only too ready to assume the guilt of any one you suspect at the moment. I  admit your theory, but&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe Phil did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Millicent, &ldquo;because you are in love with  Phil! That&rsquo;s the reason you won&rsquo;t look facts in the face! I declare, Phyllis,  you have more interest in your foolish love affairs than in discovering the  murderer of my brother! But I am determined to find the villain who shot Robert  Gleason! I shall find him&mdash;I promise you that! I am not mercenary, I shall  devote every last cent of my money&mdash;or my brother&rsquo;s money to tracking down the  murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Pollard, quietly, &ldquo;it seems to me  that we all look at this thing too close by. I mean, too much from a personal  viewpoint. You, Mrs Lindsay, want to find your brother&rsquo;s murderer, but you,  Phyllis, and you, Louis, are more interested in whether friends of yours are  implicated or not. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Lane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Fred Lane. &ldquo;But, see here, Pollard, I&rsquo;m  laying aside this personal interest you speak of, and I&rsquo;m trying to go merely  and solely by evidence. Now, I think that the evidence against Phil Barry is  pretty positive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&rdquo; Pollard disagreed with him. &ldquo;It is,  in a way&mdash;but, good Lord, man, lots of people may write to a person without  intending to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a letter like Barry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, just that. Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, use a little  intelligence! If Barry had meant to kill Gleason, do you suppose he would have  written that letter? Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think he would.&rdquo; Lane spoke slowly and thoughtfully.  &ldquo;You see, Pol, you&rsquo;re tarred with the same brush&mdash;I mean the artistic  temperament, and you ought to see that a man&rsquo;s mind works spasmodically. Barry  had the impulse to kill, I hold, and he wrote that warning letter as&mdash;well, as a  salve to his conscience, and there it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime, Detective Prescott was on the job. He had  taken Barry down to the Washington Square house, but not to Robert Gleason&rsquo;s  apartment.</p>
  <p>It was Miss Adams&rsquo; doorbell he rang, and to her home  he escorted Philip Barry.</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s anger had subsided from belligerent  altercation to a subdued sullenness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this,&rdquo; he told Prescott, but as  that worthy had often been similarly warned, he paid little attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Adams,&rdquo; said Prescott, when they were in  the presence of the spinster. &ldquo;I want you to tell me whether this is the man  whom you saw go into Mr Gleason&rsquo;s apartment that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Adams scanned Barry carefully.</p>
  <p>They were all standing, and as the lady looked him  over, Barry turned slowly round, as if to give her every opportunity for  correct judgment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, quite alive to his sarcastic  intent. &ldquo;No, Mr Prescott, this is not the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Prescott was disappointed, not because  he wanted to prove Barry guilty of the crime, but because Miss Adams&rsquo; negative  made it imperative for him to hunt up another man. For the caller of that  afternoon must be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m pretty sure. Though, of course, clothes  might make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said the man who came wore a soft hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but it was a different color from Mr Barry&rsquo;s. It  was a dull green&mdash;olive, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was after dark when he came, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but the hall was lighted and I saw him clearly.  But a man may have two hats, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Barry, shortly. &ldquo;That is, I haven&rsquo;t  two hats that I wear in the afternoon. This is the only soft felt I possess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hat he wore was of a medium shade of gray, an  inconspicuous soft hat of the latest, but in no way, extreme fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Prescott said. &ldquo;A man can buy and  give away a lot of hats in a week. Size him up carefully, Miss Adams; your  opinion may mean a lot. Never mind the hat. How does Mr Barry&rsquo;s size and shape  compare with the man you saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Barry is a heavier man,&rdquo; the lady said, decidedly;  &ldquo;also I feel sure, an older man. The man I saw was slighter and younger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see his face?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;re sure he was younger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. He was of slighter build, and a little  taller, and he walked with a jauntier step, almost a run, as he came up the  stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very observant, Miss Adams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so very. I took him in at a glance, and he  impressed me as I have stated. I have a retentive memory, that&rsquo;s all. I can see  him now&mdash;as he bounded up the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a merry mood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as to that. But the impression he gave  me was more that of a man in haste. He tapped impatiently at the door of Mr  Gleason&rsquo;s apartment, and when it was not opened instantly, he rapped again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then Mr Gleason opened it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then somebody opened it. I couldn&rsquo;t see who. The man  went in quickly and the door was closed. That&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Adams sat down then, and folded her hands in her  lap. She was quite serene, and apparently not much interested in the matter.</p>
  <p>A fleeting thought went through the detective&rsquo;s mind  that possibly Barry had interviewed her before and had persuaded or bribed her  to say all this. But it seemed improbable.</p>
  <p>Barry, too, was serene. He seemed satisfied at the  turn events had taken, and appeared to think that Miss Adams&rsquo; decision had  cleared him from suspicion.</p>
  <p>Not so the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr Barry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to find another  man to fit that olive green hat, it appears. But that doesn&rsquo;t preclude the  possibility of your having been here that day, too. You didn&rsquo;t hang over the  balusters all the afternoon, I suppose, Miss Adams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Offended at his mode of expression, the lady drew  herself up haughtily, and said, &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you saw no one come in who might have been Mr  Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could he have come and you not have known it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Adams was about to make a short reply, and then  thought better of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to help you all I can,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am  answering your questions carefully. I suppose any one could have gone into Mr  Gleason&rsquo;s apartment that day without my knowing it, but it is not likely. For I  was listening for the arrival of my niece, who, however, did not come. I kept  watch, therefore, until about six o&rsquo;clock, or a little after, then as I gave up  all hope of my niece&rsquo;s coming, I also ceased to watch or listen. Anybody may  have come after that. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott ruminated. Whoever killed Robert Gleason may  well have arrived after six o&rsquo;clock. For the telephone call didn&rsquo;t reach the  doctor until about quarter of seven, and if it were Barry, it must be  remembered he didn&rsquo;t part company with Pollard until six or after.</p>
  <p>It would seem then, that Miss Adams&rsquo; testimony  amounted to little, after all. However, the man with the green hat ought to be  found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell us again of the young man,&rdquo; Prescott said. &ldquo;See  if you can describe him so we can recognize some one we know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Adams thought a moment, and then said: &ldquo;No, I  can&rsquo;t. He just seemed to me like a young chap, an impulsive sort, who ran in to  see a friend. He came upstairs hastily, yet not in any merriment&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m  sure. Rather, he gave me the effect of a man anxious for the interview&mdash;whatever  it might be about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he ring the lower bell? Why wasn&rsquo;t Mr Gleason  at his own door when the chap came up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think he must have rung Mr Gleason&rsquo;s  bell down stairs, for the front door opened to admit him. But Mr Gleason didn&rsquo;t  open his own door until the visitor had rapped twice. Of that I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think the girl who came before the young man  did was still in Mr Gleason&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Miss Adams seemed suddenly more  interested. &ldquo;Maybe she was. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t want to be seen there. Maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, and sat silent. Prescott gave her a minute  or two, to collect herself, for he felt sure there would be some further  disclosure.</p>
  <p>Meantime Barry had taken an envelope from his pocket,  and was rapidly sketching on it. A very few lines gave a distinct picture of a  young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does that look like the man you saw?&rdquo; he asked,  holding it so that Miss Adams could see it, but Prescott could not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man himself!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes wide  with astonishment.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter  XII<br>
    Louis&rsquo; Confession</b></h2>
  <p>Before Prescott could snatch at the paper picture to  do so, Barry had torn the paper into bits and thrown them into the fire in the  old-fashioned grate.</p>
  <p>He laughed at the detective&rsquo;s chagrin, and said,  &ldquo;Nothing doing, Prescott. If the man I sketched is the criminal, you must find  it out for yourself. If not, I&rsquo;d be mighty sorry to drag his name into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I deduce, then, that his name is not already in it,&rdquo;  Prescott returned; &ldquo;in that case, I can guess who it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess away,&rdquo; Barry said, not believing the statement.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only tell you the man I drew on that paper bore no ill will toward  Gleason, so far as I know. And, moreover, the fact of his coming here, and  running upstairs, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily prove him a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more of his appearance, Miss Adams,&rdquo; urged  Prescott, hoping Barry&rsquo;s sketch had refreshed her memory.</p>
  <p>For Philip Barry had a knack of characterization, and  with a few lines could give an unmistakable likeness.</p>
  <p>But the spinster could tell no more in words than she  had already done and Prescott was forced to be content with a vague idea of a  young man who ran lightly upstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it Louis Lindsay?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly, but the  non-committal smile on Barry&rsquo;s face gave him an impression that this was a  wrong assumption.</p>
  <p>At Prescott&rsquo;s request, Barry accompanied him to  Gleason&rsquo;s rooms.</p>
  <p>The detective had a key and they went in. Except for  some tidying up, nothing had been disturbed since the day of the crime. The  rather commonplace furnishings were in direct contrast to the personal  belongings which were still in evidence.</p>
  <p>There were pictures and ornaments, books and smoking  paraphernalia that had been selected with taste and good judgment.</p>
  <p>The desk, too, was a valuable piece of furniture, and  fitted with the best of writing appointments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any more letters from you here?&rdquo; Prescott said, as if  casually, while he took a bundle of papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Barry returned, shortly; &ldquo;if one could be  forged, more could be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr Barry,&rdquo; the detective said, seriously,  &ldquo;just explain, will you, how that letter could have been forged? Experts have  concluded that the signature is yours. They say it is impossible that your very  distinctive autograph could have been written freehand, as it evidently is, by  any one but yourself. If it were traced or copied, some deviation would appear.  Now, granting that, there is still a possibility that some one, evilly  disposed, might have written the typed message above your signature. But how do  you explain that? Did you ever sign a blank sheet of paper? Club paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Barry declared. &ldquo;Why should I do such a  thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, indeed! Yet, if you didn&rsquo;t, the letter must be  all yours. Why not admit it? The admission, to my mind, would be less  incriminating than the denial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t write it,&rdquo; Barry insisted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t  type it, or sign it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the murderer did,&rdquo; Prescott nodded his head,  sagaciously. &ldquo;Can you make it out? I mean, can you suggest how it could be  done? If you had ever signed a blank sheet, it would be easy for him to write  on it, you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I never did! If I had done such an  inexplicable thing I should remember it! No; I can&rsquo;t suggest how it was done.  It is to me an insoluble problem, and I admit I&rsquo;m curious. But I never saw that  letter until you showed it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s straightforward gaze went far toward  convincing Prescott of his truthfulness, but he only said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re the criminal, you&rsquo;d be smart enough to  throw that very bluff. I don&rsquo;t believe you are&mdash;but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. You see, if  you&rsquo;d admit the letter, you could more easily establish your innocence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; Prescott, I couldn&rsquo;t establish my innocence by  telling a lie. I am innocent, and I know nothing about that letter. Now, work  from those facts and see where you come out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just here,&rdquo; and Prescott faced him. &ldquo;If those are  facts, then the murderer forged that letter to hang the crime on you. Never  mind now, how he forged it, merely assume he did so. Then, we must infer, the  murderer is one who has access to the Club typewriter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Barry was thinking quickly, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a  suggestion&mdash;if, as you say, the impossible was accomplished, and that letter was  forged by some one with Club privileges, why not Gleason himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott stared. &ldquo;Robert Gleason? Forge the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As well as any one else. He hated me&mdash;suppose it was  suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, bah! it wasn&rsquo;t suicide! That man had all there is  of it to live for! He had wealth, and he hoped to win Miss Lindsay for his  bride. Don&rsquo;t tell me he thought of suicide! Absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; and Barry dismissed the idea, &ldquo;But say he  knew he was doomed and wrote the letter to get me in bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flubdub! Though, wait&mdash;if Mr Pollard&rsquo;s idea is  correct, and the murderer should be some Western friend&mdash;or foe&mdash;and, just  suppose, say, that he threatened Gleason&rsquo;s life so definitely that Gleason knew  he was doomed, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so he manufactured evidence that he hoped would  incriminate me?&rdquo; Barry spoke thoughtfully. &ldquo;Ingenious, on your part, Prescott,  but I can&rsquo;t think it. The letter is too elaborate, too difficult of  achievement. In fact, I can&rsquo;t see how anybody did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor can I!&rdquo; Prescott turned on him. &ldquo;And nobody could  do it, Mr Barry, except yourself. You&rsquo;ve overreached the mark in denying it.  The forgery of that letter is an impossibility! Therefore, you wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does that argue me the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not positively. But your denial of the letter helps  to do so! If you wrote it, and denied it at first, through fear, you are now,  of course, obliged to stick to your denial. But, criminal or not, that letter  was written and sent by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, Mr Prescott; but as I can&rsquo;t even  imagine who did it or who could have done it, there&rsquo;s small use in our arguing  the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there was something in his tone of finality that  helped to convince Prescott of his entire innocence.</p>
  <p>The poor detective was at his wits&rsquo; end. Every way he  looked, he seemed to be peering into a blind alley. Conferences with his  colleagues or his superiors helped him not at all. Lack of evidence brought all  their theories to naught. Unless something more could be discovered the case  seemed likely to go unsolved. Or, and this troubled Prescott, unless something  was discovered soon, the impulsive and impatient Mrs Lindsay would employ a  private detective. And that would be small credit to the work of the force. So  Prescott worked away at his job. He went over the letters and papers in the  desk, but these gave him no further clew. There was no other communication from  Barry, though that, in itself, proved nothing. Yet had there been another it  would have been edifying to compare the two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No clews,&rdquo; Prescott lamented, looking hopelessly  about the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barry agreed. &ldquo;This detective work is queer, isn&rsquo;t  it?&mdash; Now in story-books, the obliging criminals leave all sorts of interesting  bits of evidence or indications of their presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but real criminals are too canny for that. Not  even a fingerprint on the telephone or revolver, except Gleason&rsquo;s own. And  that, though meant to indicate a suicide, proved only a diabolically clever  criminal!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you explain the telephone call after the man  was fatally shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott grunted. &ldquo;An impossibility like that can be  explained only by the discovery of facts not yet known. Maybe the doctors  diagnosed wrong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not Ely Davenport!&rdquo; Barry declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, maybe the man telephoned before he was  shot, but was positive the shot was coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Telephoned in the presence of the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you nothing could  explain that but to discover some <i>new</i> facts? I haven&rsquo;t got &rsquo;em yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you expect to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honest, Mr Barry, I don&rsquo;t know. A case like this&mdash;so  full of queer and unexplainable conditions may suddenly become clear&mdash;or, it may  never do so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that true of every case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I mean some unexpected clew may drop from the  skies and clear it all up at once, or it may never be solved at all. Most cases  can be worked out piece by piece, and require only patience and perseverance;  but when you strike the work of a super-criminal, as this certainly is, then  you have to wait for chance to help you. And that&rsquo;s mighty uncertain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll help you, Prescott, to this extent. I  won&rsquo;t leave town and I&rsquo;ll always be where you can find me. If you believe me,  you can call off your shadowers&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t, let them keep on my trail. But as  to any startling clew or evidence I can&rsquo;t promise to give you any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even if you get it yourself?&rdquo; said the detective,  quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have uncanny intuition!&rdquo; exclaimed Barry. &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be careful about compounding a felony, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be careful about suspecting an innocent man,&rdquo;  returned Barry, and went away.</p>
  <p>The artist went to the Lindsay home, but not finding  Louis there, followed his trail to the Club.</p>
  <p>Getting him into a secluded corner, Barry asked him  abruptly: &ldquo;Were you at Gleason&rsquo;s the afternoon of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; why?&rdquo; was the reply, but the nervous agitation  the boy showed seemed not to corroborate his statement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been told you were. Come across, Louis.  Take my advice&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained from falsification. Own up, now.  You were there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Phil, I was. But don&rsquo;t let it be known&mdash;for I  didn&rsquo;t do for old Gleason&mdash;truly I didn&rsquo;t! Any more than you did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, Louis&mdash;neither of us killed that man. But I  tell you it&rsquo;s better to tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t be believed&mdash;&rdquo; Louis whimpered like a  child. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell on me, Phil. Who said I was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were seen to go in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tenant on another floor. Better come clean, boy.  What were you there for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old reason. I wanted money.&rdquo; Louis spoke  sullenly, and his dark eyes showed a smoldering fire. &ldquo;I was in bad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Louis, gambling again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quit that tone, Barry. You&rsquo;re not my father  confessor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have one. Don&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re ruining  your life&mdash;and breaking your sister&rsquo;s heart&mdash;not that you&rsquo;d care! You are a  selfish little beast, Louis! I&rsquo;ve no use for you! But, listen, unless you tell  the truth when you&rsquo;re questioned, I warn you, it&rsquo;ll go hard with you. Promise  me this; if you&rsquo;re asked, admit you were there. If you&rsquo;re not asked, do as you  like about withholding the information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as I like, anyway,&rdquo; and young Lindsay&rsquo;s eyes  showed an ugly light, though his glance at Barry was furtive rather than  belligerent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you will, pighead!&rdquo; Barry was thoroughly  angry. &ldquo;Now, tell me this; were you at Gleason&rsquo;s at the time Ivy Hayes was  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! What do you mean?&rdquo; the astonishment was real.  &ldquo;When was she there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she didn&rsquo;t kill Gleason. Don&rsquo;t worry about that.  But it does seem as if a great many people chose that day to call on the  Western millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all for the same purpose!&rdquo; Louis shot out, with a  sudden incisive perception.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Barry said, contemptuously; &ldquo;I dare say  I&rsquo;m the only suspect who can&rsquo;t be accused of killing the old man for lucre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t so awful old&mdash;and, I say, Barry, who else is  suspected <i>but</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Barry flashed back. &ldquo;Or you will be! I meant to  warn you in kindness, Louis, but you&rsquo;re so ungrateful, I&rsquo;ll let you alone.  Better be careful, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis sulked, so Barry left him, and went away. He  went to Fred Lane&rsquo;s office, and demanded an interview alone with the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Lane asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. That&rsquo;s the worst of it. I don&rsquo;t believe,  Lane, that they&rsquo;ll ever get at the truth of the Gleason murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll railroad you to the chair,&rdquo; said Lane,  cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about the letter, Lane? Can you see through it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. You wrote that signature, Phil; now  think back and see how or when you could have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd! I couldn&rsquo;t have done it, except as a  signature to that very letter, and I didn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, look here, Lane&mdash;just supposing somebody wanted  to blacken my name&mdash;in this connection. What a roundabout way to take! Imagine  some one writing that screed on the Club typewriter, and managing somehow to  get my signature on it&mdash;could it be done with a transfer paper, or something of  that sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;it would be backward, then, wouldn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But did nobody ever persuade you to sign a sheet of  blank paper? Wanted your autograph, or that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never! I&rsquo;m not a celebrity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s an idea! Did anybody ever get you to  sign a paper written in pencil? Then, he could rub out the pencil marks and  type in the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, smarty! Why, that has been suggested by some one.  But the expert said that the pencil marks would show, even if carefully  erased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean the erasure would leave its traces. That&rsquo;s  right, it would. And if ever there was a genuine looking letter that&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the surface, yes. But if I were a detective, I  would note at once that the letter itself is not in a phraseology that I would  use&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I were a detective, I should note that, too, and  set it down as a further proof of your cleverness!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Lane, are <i>you</i> convinced of my guilt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, but I am frankly puzzled about that  letter. It&rsquo;s so positively Club paper, Club typewriter, your signature&mdash;what&rsquo;s  the answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out&mdash;I swear I will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, old chap, it&rsquo;ll go hard with you, I  fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As a starter, I&rsquo;m going to see that Hayes girl. No, I  don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s implicated, but I may be able to get something new.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead. Sound her and you may, at least, find some  new way to look. Louis Lindsay never did it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I know that! He&rsquo;d hardly have nerve to kill a  fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To the home of Ivy Hayes Barry went next.</p>
  <p>The girl willingly saw him, and seemed glad to discuss  the matter.</p>
  <p>After some preliminary conversation and as Barry grew  more definite in his queries, she began to be a little frightened, and was less  frank in her responses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You came to see me before, Mr Barry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and  I told you then all I knew about this thing. Now, I&rsquo;ve no more to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you have. I remember the other time I was  here, you had a sudden recollection, or thought, and you gave a startled  exclamation. What was that thought?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if I could recall! I suppose I was nervous&mdash;I often  jump like that. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s temperament, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was more than that. You did think of something  that gave you a new idea regarding Mr Gleason&rsquo;s murder or murderer. Now, don&rsquo;t  say you didn&rsquo;t, for I know it. Come across, Ivy, tell me what it was&mdash;or you may  get in deep yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me this, Mr Barry,&rdquo; and the girl spoke quietly  and earnestly; &ldquo;is there any danger of my being suspected? For, if so, I&rsquo;ll  tell something. It&rsquo;s awful mean to tell it&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got myself to look out  for&mdash;oh, no&mdash;no! I don&rsquo;t know anything! Not anything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do. You&rsquo;ve already proved it. Now, Ivy, I won&rsquo;t  exaggerate your danger, but I&rsquo;ll tell you that I think the only real suspects  they have, as yet, are you and me. As I&rsquo;m not the criminal, and as I shall do  my very best to prove that, suspicion may come back on you. I don&rsquo;t say this to  frighten you. I merely state the fact. So, don&rsquo;t you think yourself that you&rsquo;d  better tell me what you know, and I assure you that I will use the knowledge  with discretion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; and the girl burst into tears. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell anybody, and you least of all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry stared. What could such a speech mean?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please go away,&rdquo; Ivy moaned. &ldquo;Go away now, and come  tomorrow. Then I&rsquo;ll decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barry said sternly; &ldquo;you know something, and you  must tell me. If you refuse I&rsquo;ll go away, but I&rsquo;ll send Mr Prescott here&mdash;and  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d rather tell me&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you, Ivy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s tone was ingratiating, and too, his words  carried conviction. Ivy wiped her eyes and looked at him dolefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. You see, for me to tell what  I know would be mean&mdash;oh, worse than mean&mdash;it would be too low down for words!  And yet&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to be arrested!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell&mdash;tell me, my girl&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel better to tell  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry sensed the psychological moment, and knew he  must get the story out of Ivy, while she was frightened. If she really knew how  little she was suspected, she might never tell. And Barry felt it imperative  that her knowledge be revealed.</p>
  <p>Persuaded by his urgency, Ivy began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I went there about half past five&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know the time so well&mdash;most people don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know how I know it, but I just happen to.  I was due home at six, so I went there at five-thirty, or within a few minutes  of that time. Does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I rang the bell, you know, and the door clicked  open and I went up and Mr Gleason let me in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I hadn&rsquo;t been there hardly any time at all&mdash;not  ten minutes, anyhow, when Mr Gleason&rsquo;s bell rang again. And I said, &lsquo;Who is  it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What made you think he would know who it was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know as I did. Guess I just said it&mdash;but,  anyway&mdash;he said&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Lindsay&mdash;I expect her&mdash;she mustn&rsquo;t see you here!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, he pushed me through into the dining-room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never used the dining-room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he did sometimes. Well, anyway, the room was  there&mdash;and he pushed me in, and told me to go through the pantry and down the  back stairs and out that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did he push you? Weren&rsquo;t you willing to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I was rattled&mdash;bewildered. And, I&rsquo;ve never  seen Miss Lindsay, and I was curious to see her. I didn&rsquo;t mind being found in  Mr Gleason&rsquo;s rooms, but he minded very much. And so he hurried me off, and  that&rsquo;s when he told me he&rsquo;d give me the bracelet, if I&rsquo;d sneak off without  making a sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but I waited a minute to try to see Miss  Lindsay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the door opened the wrong way. I peaked through  the crack, but I couldn&rsquo;t see her. I heard her, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Barry&rsquo;s nerves were pounding, his heart  beat fast, as he listened for, yet dreaded her further speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and I couldn&rsquo;t make out a word she said, her  voice was so low. But they were quarreling&mdash;or at least discussing something on  which they didn&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Barry controlled himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Mr Gleason walked up and down the room  as he talked&mdash;he often did that&mdash;but it kept me from pushing the door a speck  wider open. In fact, he pushed it tight shut as he passed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he suspect you were there listening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think so. He just closed it on general  principles. Maybe he thought I was there. But after that I couldn&rsquo;t hear a  word, so I went through the pantry and down the back way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anybody see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it was Miss Lindsay who was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I heard Mr Gleason say &lsquo;my sister is your  stepmother, I know,&rsquo; and again he said, &lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re Lindsay&mdash;you&rsquo;re both  Lindsays&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve made my will&mdash;&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all I heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time did you leave there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must have been about quarter to six, for I was  home at six.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Miss Lindsay was there when you left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she was there when I left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, Philip Barry&rsquo;s secret fear was confirmed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter  XIII<br>
    Philip and Phyllis</b></h2>
  <p>Philip Barry, though of the artistic temperament  common to his calling, had also a businesslike instinct that prompted him to  straight-forward measures in any case where he was specially interested.</p>
  <p>And he was deeply interested in learning that Phyllis  had been at Gleason&rsquo;s rooms the afternoon of the murder, and he wanted the  matter cleared up to his own satisfaction.</p>
  <p>Wherefore, he went to Phyllis herself and inquired  concerning it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were you at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s that day?&rdquo; was his somewhat  direct way of opening the conversation.</p>
  <p>They were alone, in the Lindsays&rsquo; library, and  Phyllis, looking demure enough in a little white house gown, was in perverse  mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Phil, are <i>you</i> beginning to  suspect me? Go to Millicent with your theories? She has thought from the first  that I shot her brother. Go over to her side, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like! It isn&rsquo;t a question of &lsquo;sides&rsquo;! And if  it is, of course, I&rsquo;m on your side. You know that, don&rsquo;t you, Phyllis? You know  I&rsquo;m for you, first, last and all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then help me, Phil, and sympathize, and don&rsquo;t come  rushing in here and screaming out, &lsquo;Was I at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s when he was killed?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did, practically. Now, what do you mean by it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Barry hesitated, &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ve been to see that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ivy Hayes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And she said you were there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ivy Hayes said I was there! She must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you? Tell me you weren&rsquo;t, Phyllis. I&rsquo;ll be so  glad to know it. Where were you that afternoon, late? You never would say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I? I won&rsquo;t say now, either, but I was not  at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Barry&rsquo;s tense expression  relaxed, and he smiled. &ldquo;Then that youngster made it all up. I fancied she  did&mdash;just to make a sensation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what did she say, exactly?&rdquo; Phyllis looked ill at  ease.</p>
  <p>Barry couldn&rsquo;t suspect her sincerity, but he watched  her as he told of his interview with Miss Hayes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said I was there! That she was hidden in another  room while I was there! Why, I wasn&rsquo;t there at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to Mr Gleason&rsquo;s the day of&mdash;the day he  died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never been there! Why should I go? It isn&rsquo;t  my custom to go to the homes of men I know. They call on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, Phyllis&mdash;don&rsquo;t get angry, dear. I didn&rsquo;t  think you&rsquo;d go there&mdash;but there might have been a reason&mdash;an errand, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there wasn&rsquo;t. I wish you&rsquo;d all stop trying to  find out who killed that man! What difference does it make? He&rsquo;s dead, and it  won&rsquo;t bring him to life to punish his murderer. I think Millicent is foolish  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural, Phyllis, dear. It isn&rsquo;t exactly  revenge, but more an avenging spirit. It&rsquo;s human nature to demand a life for a  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be found out. If they do arrest  somebody, it&rsquo;ll most likely be the wrong person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked very lovely as she drew her brows  together in a perplexed frown and then smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, make them stop, Phil. If you advise Millicent, she&rsquo;ll  stop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my sense of justice is too strong&mdash;&rdquo; Barry  began, but Phyllis interrupted him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> too strong if it&rsquo;s stronger than your  wish to please me,&rdquo; and she pouted like a scolded child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing in my heart is stronger than my wish to please  you,&rdquo; Barry said, gravely, &ldquo;and you know it, Phyllis. If you make it a  condition, I will most certainly suggest to Mrs Lindsay that she give up her  quest. But, such advice would be against my own better judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why, Phil?&rdquo; Phyllis was coaxing now. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  feel sure they&rsquo;ll never find the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t, Phyllis, they&rsquo;ll always suspect me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you care&mdash;since you are innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I care very much! Why, my dear girl, do you suppose I  could carry that burden all my life? Always go about, knowing that many  people&mdash;or even a few people suspected me of Robert Gleason&rsquo;s murder? No; when I  think about it, I&rsquo;m ready to move heaven and earth, if that were possible, to  find the true criminal!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis shuddered and her face went white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you forget in time?&rdquo; she said, bravely  struggling to speak steadily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never! Why, Phyllis, that letter is enough to condemn  me&mdash;only I didn&rsquo;t write it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you, really, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl leaned forward, and looked into his eyes so  earnestly that Barry recoiled in amazement. Did she suspect him? Phyllis!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look as if you thought  me guilty! You, of all people!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, quickly, &ldquo;but I thought you  might have written the letter, meaning something else. The fact of your writing  it doesn&rsquo;t make you the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t. Listen, Phyllis&mdash;I love you&mdash;oh,  sweetheart, how I love you! but I&rsquo;ve resolved not to ask you for love, until I  can offer you an unstained name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your name isn&rsquo;t stained! I won&rsquo;t have you say such  things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her sweet smile was encouraging, but Barry shook his  head:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear, you mustn&rsquo;t even be kind to me. I can&rsquo;t  stand it! You know my name <i>is</i> affected until the mystery of that letter  is explained. It&rsquo;s the most inexplicable thing! Why, look at it! We fellows all  discussed murder, and discussed Gleason and that very day he was killed and  that letter was found in his desk! It was a piece of diabolical cleverness on  somebody&rsquo;s part!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Phil, just as an argument. How could anybody  write that letter but you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, myself. But somebody did do it. I&rsquo;ve  thought it over and over. I&rsquo;ve looked at this letter through a lens, but  there&rsquo;s no trace of erased writing, nor any possibility of my signature having  been pasted into another sheet, or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen wonderful inlay work, where one piece of  paper is joined to another actually invisibly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So have I, and I thought of that. But it wasn&rsquo;t done  in this case. That sheet of paper&mdash;Club paper, is absolutely intact, it is typed  just as I type things-a little carelessly&mdash;and the signature is like mine. I  would say it is mine, only&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t write it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe somebody hypnotized you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve never been hypnotized&mdash;nor has any one ever  attempted such a thing with me. It&rsquo;s diabolical, as I said. But I&rsquo;ll find out  if it takes my life time! Now, you see, dear, why I don&rsquo;t want you to urge me  to stop investigation on the part of anybody. Besides, Mrs Lindsay isn&rsquo;t the  only one eager to solve the mystery. The detectives, the police, are as anxious  as she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I think they&rsquo;re getting tired of  having no results. I think, if Millicent gave up the search, they soon would do  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why? Why, Phyllis, are you desirous of having it  given up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! I&rsquo;m tired of it, that&rsquo;s all. And  now, you&rsquo;re dragging me into it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phyllis, as you said to me&mdash;if you&rsquo;re innocent, your  name can&rsquo;t be harmed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;suppose I&rsquo;m not innocent&mdash;would you stop then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry stared at her. He thought at first her speech  was merely an outburst of the perversity which now and then showed in her  volatile nature. But her face was drawn and white and her eyes dark with a sort  of terror he had never before seen her show.</p>
  <p>However, he saw no choice but to treat her speech  lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course! But until you tell me you&rsquo;re the  villain of the piece, I shan&rsquo;t be able to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did? Check up, now. If we&rsquo;re to suspect all who  didn&rsquo;t like the man, there&rsquo;s Pollard, Davenport, you, me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Mr Pollard&rsquo;s mythical Westerner. Oh, Phil, I wish <i>he</i> could be found!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who? Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the man he thinks came from the West&mdash;an old  acquaintance of Mr Gleason&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a fine suspect, but a bit intangible.  Perhaps he wrote the note I signed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jest, Philip. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m so miserable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis bowed her face in her hands and cried softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t, Phyllis, darling. For heaven&rsquo;s sake,  keep out of the muddle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you dragged me into it! You came here checking up  on my movements. Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you why. Because Ivy Hayes said you were  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;so she did. I forgot that. Well&mdash;maybe I  was&mdash;maybe I was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phyllis, hush. You&rsquo;re talking wildly. And here&rsquo;s  another thing. Where was Louis that afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phil Barry, you stop! Are you going to accuse the  whole family? Why don&rsquo;t you ask where Millicent was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ask about Louis because I&rsquo;ve been told he was  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I was there! And Ivy Hayes was there! And the man  from the West was there! Quite a party!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis laughed shrilly&mdash;not at all like her usual  gentle laugh, and Barry watched her in alarm, lest she grow hysterical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, divining his fear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  hysterical, but I&rsquo;m distracted. Oh, Phil, do help me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will, little girl,&rdquo; Barry held out his  arms. &ldquo;Come to me, Phyllis, let&rsquo;s forget all the horrible things of life and  just love each other&mdash;and belong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she drew away from him. &ldquo;Not yet. If your name  must be cleared&mdash;so must mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But your name isn&rsquo;t even mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Phyllis said, speaking in a dull, slow  way, &ldquo;yes, it is&mdash;and the worst of it is, my name can&rsquo;t be cleared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Barry cautioned, &ldquo;somebody&rsquo;s coming in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The street door closed, and a moment later, Manning  Pollard made an appearance.</p>
  <p>The conversation, though general, was not spontaneous,  and after a short time, Barry took his leave. Though he did not consider  Pollard an actual rival of his in Phyllis&rsquo; favor, yet he felt disgruntled when  the other was present. And, too, he wanted to go off by himself to think over  what Phyllis had said.</p>
  <p>He knew her too well to imagine for a moment that she  was merely upset by the whole situation and wanted the investigation to be  stopped.</p>
  <p>He knew she had some definite and imperative reason  for begging him to quit searching and also that she meant something when she  said her own name could not be cleared.</p>
  <p>That remark, of course, could not be taken at its face  value, but all the same, it meant something&mdash;and he must find out what.</p>
  <p>Manning Pollard was confronted with the same question.</p>
  <p>Apparently unable to control her nervous fear, Phyllis  said, at once:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Pollard, can&rsquo;t you help me? I&rsquo;m in such  trouble. That Miss Hayes says I was at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s the day of the murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&mdash;or, well, maybe I was. But that has nothing to do  with it. Can&rsquo;t you hush up the Hayes girl? Must she tell of it, if I <i>was</i> there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be a pretty difficult matter to stop her  mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if I paid her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, then you would get yourself in trouble! Don&rsquo;t do  anything of that sort, I beg of you! Tell me all about it, Miss Lindsay. I&rsquo;m  sure I can help&mdash;and if not, won&rsquo;t it relieve you to talk it over? What is the  new development?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, only that probably I shall next be suspected of  the Gleason murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Manning Pollard didn&rsquo;t look so intensely  surprised as Phyllis had anticipated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know Millicent has foolishly said that I did  it&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t mean it. She&rsquo;d suspect anybody from the mayor to the cook!  But, now, that little chorus girl&mdash;or whatever she is&mdash;has said that I was in the  room with Mr Gleason, when he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he was killed! Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, she practically says that. It seems she was  there herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was there! When Mr Gleason was shot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she couldn&rsquo;t have been&mdash;could she? But&mdash;you see I  don&rsquo;t know exactly what she said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t try to quote her, but tell me what you do  know. Did she try to implicate you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; only she said I was there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lindsay, don&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell anybody! If  you were there keep it to yourself&mdash;and if not&mdash;there&rsquo;s no occasion to say so. I  understand what you&rsquo;re trying to do. Keep it up. That&rsquo;s why I invented the  Western man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Invented him! You don&rsquo;t really believe in him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose invented isn&rsquo;t the right word. But&mdash;of  course, I&rsquo;ve no proof of his existence. He <i>may</i> well be a fact&mdash;or, again,  he may not be. I only say that there&rsquo;s a possibility&mdash;even a probability that  Gleason <i>may</i> have known somebody out there who came after him here and  killed him. Nobody can deny the possibility, at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea of the identity of any such person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I? Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be a good thing if you could remember Mr  Gleason&rsquo;s having told you of such a one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked up suddenly, and caught Pollard&rsquo;s  meaning glance. Could it be? Was he hinting that she should make up some such  story. It couldn&rsquo;t be!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she said, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; he spoke gently, &ldquo;but if you want  me to put it into words, I will. The Hayes girl has told several people&mdash;Mr  Prescott among them, that you were at the Gleason rooms about six o&rsquo;clock that  night. Now, you know, you have refused to say where you were at that time&mdash;and  it is not surprising that their suspicions are aroused. For you to deny being  there would not be half so efficacious as for you to turn the thoughts of the  detectives in some other direction. Suppose, for instance, you were to remember  some man Mr Gleason told you of. Some name&mdash;let us say&mdash;and suppose the  detectives set themselves to work to find the individual. If they can&rsquo;t find  him, you harm nobody, and&mdash;you divert attention from yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis did not pretend to misunderstand. Nor did she  treat the matter lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think I am in danger, then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say danger&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like the word. But, your  name will be bandied about&mdash;will be in the papers&mdash;unless you quash the thing in  the beginning. You haven&rsquo;t admitted you were there, but, suppose it is proved  that you were, and suppose you tell of this man, of whom Mr Gleason spoke to  you&mdash;spoke to you at that very time&mdash;and suppose your story is that you were  there about six&mdash;that you left soon after&mdash;and that Mr Gleason was even then  fearing the arrival of this enemy of his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Phyllis looked him in the eyes.</p>
  <p>Pollard was a magnetic man, his face inspired  confidence, but more than that, the girl read in the deep, dark eyes a troubled  care for herself&mdash;for her own safety and well-being.</p>
  <p>She knew Pollard admired her&mdash;most of her men friends  did, but only now was she aware of his passionate love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing that I&rsquo;m advising,&rdquo; he said, in  a whisper, &ldquo;but I realize the gravity of the situation. Phyllis&mdash;I care so  much&mdash;so much&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t help seeing how things are tending. You know I have no  shadow of suspicion of you&mdash;my beautiful&mdash;my darling&mdash;but others will&mdash;others will  be swayed by the Hayes story, and&mdash;though you left the place before Mr Gleason  was killed&mdash;yet it must have been only shortly before&mdash;and somebody did come in  and kill him&mdash;so, why not say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see your point, I see how I am endangered&mdash;even if  I&rsquo;m innocent. If I&rsquo;m innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; Pollard looked at her  wonderingly. &ldquo;At least, don&rsquo;t say it to me! And forgive my abruptness, but I  must tell you how I love you. I must ask you if you can&rsquo;t love me&mdash;oh, Phyllis,  even a little? Do you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, Mr Pollard&mdash;please don&rsquo;t say those things  now&mdash;I&rsquo;m so-worried&mdash;&rdquo; The soft eyes filled with unshed tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it, my little girl&mdash;I know it&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why&mdash;I  want to be in a position to help you&mdash;I mean I want to have a right&mdash;to let the  world know I have the right, to protect you. Will you give it to  me&mdash;Phyllis&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The big man leaned toward her, his attitude reverently  affectionate, and Phyllis felt wonderfully drawn to him. He was so capable, so  efficient, and though she felt a sense of potential mastery in his manner, she  did not resent it, but rather rejoiced in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed, looking at him, with startled,  shining eyes, &ldquo;oh&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;now. Don&rsquo;t ask me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall&mdash;now&mdash;my beloved, my queen! Oh, you  beautiful girl, you may not love me yet, but I&rsquo;ll make you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The smile that accompanied the words took away any  hint of tyranny, and the pleading in Manning Pollard&rsquo;s eyes was hard to resist.</p>
  <p>But Phyllis hesitated. She didn&rsquo;t know him so very  well, and, too, she had a feminine notion that to say yes at once would make  her seem too willing. Moreover, she wanted to think it over, alone, by herself.</p>
  <p>She had always thought she loved Phil Barry&mdash;but  somehow, in a moment this insistent wooer had pushed Phil to the background.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she said, softly, as she gave him her hand,  &ldquo;I will think about what you&rsquo;ve said&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t promise now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear, I understand,&rdquo; and as Pollard&rsquo;s strong  fingers closed over her own, Phyllis was almost certain what her eventual answer  to him would be. He was so gentle in his strength, so tender in his  manliness&mdash;and he seemed a real refuge for her in her uncertainties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, here&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I hate to  tell you, but the question of your having been in Gleason&rsquo;s room is bound to be  raised&mdash;and I want to say that I saw you&mdash;that afternoon at about six o&rsquo;clock. I  tell you, so you won&rsquo;t try any prevarication on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last was said with a good-natured smile, that gave  a feeling of camaraderie which delighted Phyllis&rsquo; heart. She didn&rsquo;t want to  give herself irrevocably to Pollard&mdash;yet&mdash;but she was glad to have him for a  friend&mdash;and his frank, pleasant friendliness cheered her very soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where in the world did you see me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the crowded corner of Fifth Avenue and  Forty-second Street. I had just left Phil Barry&mdash;we came down from the Club  together&mdash;and I saw you, in a cab&mdash;with a strange man. Who was he, Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The assured manner of his query was not lost on the  girl, but she did not resent it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must I tell you?&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, dear. But I wish you wanted to be frank with  me&mdash;to confide in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I will&mdash;I do&mdash;but&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you needn&rsquo;t&mdash;and, don&rsquo;t look so distressed, my  poor little girl. Tell me only what you want to&mdash;just let me help in any way  that you want me to. And, Phyllis&mdash;I hate to make this proposition, but I must.  If anything happens&mdash;if anything is said that frightens you, or troubles you  deeply&mdash;will you&mdash;if you feel it would help you in any way&mdash;will you say that you  are engaged to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may consider that you are or not, as you wish;  but I have an idea that occasion might arise, when it would help you to  announce the engagement&mdash;to assert that you have some one to look after you. If  you want to break it later&mdash;that is, of course, your privilege.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Phyllis, looking at him, admiringly, &ldquo;how  good you are! Nobody else would have thought of that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I want you&mdash;I want you to say  yes to me for keeps, some day. But in the meantime, if it ever should serve  your purpose, claim me as your fiance.&rdquo;</p>

    Hester&rsquo;s Statement</b></h2>
  <p>Pollard and Lane, sitting talking in the Club Lounge,  were joined by Dean Monroe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing,&rdquo; Monroe said, &ldquo;that nobody gets  any forrader in the Gleason matter. What are police for? What are detectives  for? And most of all, what are we chaps for, if we can&rsquo;t solve a mystery right  in our own set?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it matters, being in our own set,&rdquo;  Pollard began, but Monroe interrupted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it does. We know all the principals&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Lane said; &ldquo;what do you mean, principals?  There&rsquo;s the principal character, the victim, himself, but further than that we  know no &lsquo;principal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t! Well, I should say we know most of the  suspects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspects don&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo; Pollard observed,  &ldquo;unless you can hang more evidence on them than has been attached to anybody so  far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidence!&rdquo; Monroe exclaimed; &ldquo;what further evidence  do you want than that letter of Phil Barry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; said Lane; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re out for Barry, are you? But,  Pol, here threatened to kill Gleason. That&rsquo;s far more incriminating evidence to  my mind than Barry&rsquo;s letter. For the letter may have been forged, but Pollard  said his words himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, but Manning was home in his rooms all the  time, and nobody knows where Phil was. Why don&rsquo;t they find out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they find out anything?&rdquo; Lane smiled.  &ldquo;Because they don&rsquo;t go to work with any intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could solve the mystery, I suppose?&rdquo; Monroe flung  at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be afraid to try,&rdquo; and Lane looked serious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo; Pollard asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That investigation of a determined sort might lead to  awful conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; Pollard cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help knowing  what you mean, but don&rsquo;t breathe it, Lane. You know how a word&mdash;a hint&mdash;may start  suspicion. And there&rsquo;s not a word of truth in it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who? Miss Lindsay?&rdquo; Monroe asked, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush up, Dean,&rdquo; Pollard growled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. And it&rsquo;s silly to evade an issue. If there&rsquo;s  nothing in it, drag it out into the light and prove there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lane said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t wise to drag  out anything concerning the Lindsays&mdash;any of them. Not even Mrs Lindsay. They&rsquo;re  an emotional lot, and if they get excited, they say all sorts of things. If  they must be questioned, it would better be by somebody with their interests at  heart, and the thing should be done quietly and with few listeners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you go and do it, Lane,&rdquo; Monroe suggested. &ldquo;I  feel sure unless you do, the police will get ahead of you, and they&rsquo;ll put Miss  Lindsay through the third degree&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense. The police are hot on Barry&rsquo;s trail.  That chap&rsquo;ll be arrested very soon, I believe. Why, that letter is damning. How  do you explain it, except at its face value?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what is its face value?&rdquo; asked Pollard. &ldquo;The  letter doesn&rsquo;t threaten violent measures at all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It implies something of the sort. And Barry has no  alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Pollard said; &ldquo;an innocent man  doesn&rsquo;t have. I mean, an innocent man is very likely not to know where he was  at any given time. It&rsquo;s your criminal who has his alibi at his tongue&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to the Lindsay house now,&rdquo; Lane said,  rising. &ldquo;Want to go along, Pol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not this time. If you&rsquo;re going to quiz Miss  Lindsay I&rsquo;d rather not be there. And you said yourself you&rsquo;d rather be alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right. But I&rsquo;m going to ask Mrs Lindsay a few  questions, too. After all, she and Miss Phyllis are the only heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning one of them is doubtless the criminal!&rdquo; Dean  Monroe spoke scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Lane returned, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s  lots to see about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Others than Lane were of this mind, for when the  lawyer reached the Lindsay home, he found Belknap and Prescott both there, and  the Lindsay ladies, as a result of their visitors&rsquo; questions, both in a highly  excited state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Mr Lane,&rdquo; Millicent cried, as  Lane entered; &ldquo;do help Phyllis and me. These men are saying awful things to  us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; Phyllis corrected. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve nothing against  you, Millicent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked exhausted. Apparently, she had had all  she could stand of the detectives&rsquo; grilling, and she was at the end of her  self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must excuse me a few minutes,&rdquo; she exclaimed,  starting up, and without another word she left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were rather blunt, Prescott,&rdquo; Belknap said. &ldquo;You  must remember Miss Lindsay is a delicate, sheltered young lady, and  unaccustomed to hear such rough speech as you gave her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Prescott, doggedly. &ldquo;If she killed  Gleason, such talk is none too bad for her. And if she didn&rsquo;t, it can&rsquo;t hurt  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Lane. &ldquo;Miss Lindsay kill Mr Gleason!  Man, you must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not that,&rdquo; Prescott said, quietly. &ldquo;But when  a young lady goes to a man&rsquo;s rooms half an hour before he is killed, when she  at that interview learns for the first time that she is heiress to half his  fortune, when she is overheard in altercation with the man a very short time  before he is shot, when no other person is seen there at the time or anywhere  near it, when the young lady doesn&rsquo;t care much for the man, when he wants to  marry her&mdash;and she knows if she refuses she&rsquo;ll lose the inheritance&mdash;well, isn&rsquo;t  that about enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; asked Lane, &ldquo;are your statements all proved  facts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Facts don&rsquo;t have to be proved,&rdquo; Prescott flared back.  &ldquo;But my statements are facts, as you mostly know, yourself. We have Miss Hayes&rsquo;  word for it that Miss Lindsay was at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s about six.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She says she wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Millicent broke in, angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Mrs Lindsay,&rdquo; said Belknap, &ldquo;the very  day of the crime you accused Miss Lindsay. Why do you now try to defend her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she never did it,&rdquo; wailed Millicent. &ldquo;Never!  Never! When I said she did, I was out of my head. Just at first, you know, I  was so stunned I scarcely knew what I was saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you know now. Was Miss Lindsay here at home at  six o&rsquo;clock that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do know. Answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, she wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t prove she was  down in Washington Square!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave us to do the proving. You answer questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t frighten the lady,&rdquo; Lane advised, frowning  at the detective&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;She will answer your questions&mdash;or I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, you answer. What does Miss Lindsay  want twenty thousand dollars for&mdash;and in a hurry, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does she want that sum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She does; and she&rsquo;s bound to get it. Wants her  inheritance right off. What for, I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I say, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Lane replied. &ldquo;But there  are lots of things the modern young woman wants money for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but if they&rsquo;re right and proper things, why  won&rsquo;t she tell what they are? No matter if they&rsquo;re extravagances or foolish  luxuries, why not say so? But if the destination of that twenty thousand can&rsquo;t  be told&mdash;it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s something wrong about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning nothing but that. Something wrong&mdash;something  shady&mdash;something that must be covered up. Therefore, she had to have the money  at once. Therefore, she went to Robert Gleason for it. Therefore, he told her  he would give it to her on one condition&mdash;marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Prescott, do you know this?&rdquo; Lane demanded.</p>
  <p>Prescott jerked a finger toward Millicent Lindsay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She knows it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She knows that for weeks  Miss Lindsay had kept Gleason dangling&mdash;waiting for her answer. Then, when the  young lady discovers she can get the money by the man&rsquo;s death&mdash;and as she really  abhors him and doesn&rsquo;t want to marry him&mdash;and as the opportunity offers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What opportunity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact that she&rsquo;s there alone with him in his  rooms, his pistol conveniently at hand, and nobody about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re romancing! That girl! She couldn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know she could, Mr Lane,&rdquo; Belknap interposed.  &ldquo;You say that because you don&rsquo;t want to think it. But the only thing that would  positively disprove it would be for Miss Lindsay to tell where she was at the  time. This she refuses to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and Manning Pollard refused to tell where he was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we found out where he was, without his telling  us. To prove where a man was by outside witnesses, many of them, is proof, when  his own statement is far from proof. Now if we could check up Miss Lindsay as  we did Mr Pollard, that would settle her question. But we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo; Lane asked of Millicent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. She came home just in time to  dress for the dinner-party. But I don&rsquo;t know what time it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; Prescott said, despairingly.  &ldquo;Nobody ever knows what time anything happened. The only thing we are sure of  is that Gleason was still alive and telephoning at quarter to seven, and even  at that, that nurse may have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not she,&rdquo; said Lane. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s most accurate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, we&rsquo;re fairly sure of Miss Hayes&rsquo; evidence, for  the simple reason that we&rsquo;ve no cause for doubt in her case. She says she left  the Gleason place, by the back entrance, at six o&rsquo;clock. And, she says Miss  Lindsay was with Gleason at that time. Now, the puzzle fits into place. Miss  Lindsay remained for a time, trying to persuade Gleason to give her this large  sum of money, and when he refused&mdash;that is, unless she would marry him, she  became desperate, and the tragedy resulted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Straight story,&rdquo; said Lane, &ldquo;but little to back it  save your imagination. What&rsquo;s to prevent Miss Lindsay going away and somebody  else coming and committing the deed? Plenty of time between six and quarter of  seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely. The people of the house were coming in  then, and an arriving man would have been noticed. Oh, I don&rsquo;t say it would  have been impossible&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve no shadow of evidence for it. And, if so, where  did Miss Lindsay go from there at six o&rsquo;clock, that she didn&rsquo;t get home until  seven or thereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that it was as late as seven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I tell you I can&rsquo;t fix the time of anything.  Nobody seems to have had a timepiece going that night&mdash;which is suspicious in  itself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about Philip Barry?&rdquo; Lane asked this quietly. &ldquo;I  thought you were sure of his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It all fits in,&rdquo; said Prescott, slowly. &ldquo;Mr Barry and  Miss Lindsay are in love with each other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now how do you know that?&rdquo; and Lane looked at the  detective sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gathered it from lots of sources. Barry&rsquo;s letter to  Gleason for one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that only proves that Mr Barry admired Miss  Lindsay. Not that his regard was returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Say they were friends,  then. Say they were in cahoots. Say the money was wanted by Mr Barry, and  together they planned to get it from Gleason&mdash;in one way or another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lane laughed shortly, and again remarked on the  detective&rsquo;s fertile imagination, but in truth he was decidedly uncomfortable.  He had been afraid some one would evolve a theory that included Phyllis and  Barry both, and this was the thought that had haunted Lane&rsquo;s mind. It was  incredible, but it was at least possible, that Barry&rsquo;s threatening letter and  Phyllis&rsquo; desire for a large sum of money and the liking of the girl for the  artist and her detestation of Robert Gleason, all tended toward a theory that  included the two, and that had much to be said for it.</p>
  <p>And then a strange thing happened. One of the maids  employed in the Lindsay household came into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Hester?&rdquo; asked Millicent, in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, please, madam&mdash;please, Mrs Lindsay, I think I know  something I ought to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo; Prescott pounced on her. &ldquo;Well, tell it,  then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;you see&mdash;I heard you talking about where Miss  Phyllis was&mdash;on the night of&mdash;of, you know&mdash;at six o&rsquo;clock. And I can tell you  where she was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap looked at the girl without much interest. She  was as emotional as the people she worked for. Her fingers twisted nervously,  and she picked at her apron, and swayed from side to side as she talked.</p>
  <p>Probably, Belknap thought, she&rsquo;s devoted to Miss  Lindsay, and is making up a yarn to save her.</p>
  <p>But Hester went on, speaking softly, but steadily  enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And this is what I know. At six o&rsquo;clock,  Miss Phyllis was in a taxicab with a man driving up Fifth Avenue. She was near  Forty-second Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott laughed outright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a kind heart, and doubtless you love Miss  Lindsay, but your story is a little crude. Wants verisimilitude,&mdash;if you know  what that means. You may go, Hester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; wait a minute,&rdquo; directed Belknap. &ldquo;Were you out  that afternoon, Hester?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then how do you know this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard Mr Pollard say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait! This grows interesting. To whom did he say it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Miss Phyllis herself, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he did! And when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it was yesterday or day before. Anyhow,  he was here a talking to Miss Phyllis, and I heard him tell her he saw her then  and there and he asked her who was the man with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Phyllis wouldn&rsquo;t tell him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, Hester, you listen at doors, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, that I don&rsquo;t. I came into the library to  mend the fire and to turn on the lights as is my duty at twilight. And Miss  Phyllis was talking with Mr Pollard, and they said what I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And just why are you repeating it to us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;to-day I <i>was</i> listening at the door. I  love Miss Phyllis and when I saw her rush out of the room here, and run up to  her own room and throw herself on the bed and cry as if her heart would break,  I didn&rsquo;t know what to do! And she wouldn&rsquo;t let me do anything for her, but said  she wanted to be alone. So I left her and I came down, and when I heard you  gentleman talking against my young lady, I thought maybe if I told that, it  might help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hester&rsquo;s honest blue eyes, tear-filled and sad, left  no doubt of her sincerity and her loyalty to her beloved young mistress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you have helped, Hester,&rdquo; said Belknap, not  unkindly. &ldquo;Now will you go and tell Miss Lindsay that we wish to see her. That  she must come at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hester went, and it was several moments before she  returned.</p>
  <p>The group waited in silence.</p>
  <p>Millicent wept softly, and though Lane spoke to her  once or twice she paid no attention. The volatile little woman was deeply sorry  now that she had accused Phyllis in the first place. As she said, and she did  not really mean it&mdash;or at least, she was so stunned and bewildered that she  scarcely knew what she did mean. But when she became calmer, she knew she  didn&rsquo;t suspect Phyllis&mdash;and yet, so susceptible is human nature to suggestion  that when the detectives put the matter as they did, she began to think they  might be right.</p>
  <p>While they were waiting for Phyllis&rsquo; reappearance,  Barry came.</p>
  <p>He was surprised at the presence of the Assistant  District Attorney and the detective, but as he noted their reception of himself  he was even more surprised. For they did not regard him as hostilely as usual,  and he immediately concluded they were on another track.</p>
  <p>But conversation was a bit constrained, and finally  Barry blurted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea? Why are you all sitting here as if  looking for something or somebody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; and Belknap looked grave. &ldquo;We are waiting  for Miss Lindsay to reappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; Barry asked, suddenly alert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We want her to answer a few questions.&rdquo; Belknap kept  a wary eye on the artist, for he was becoming more and more convinced that the  secret of the murder was in the keeping of the two. His theory strengthened in  his mind every moment and he wished Phyllis would come. Yet, something might be  gained from Barry in the meantime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were you in a taxicab with Miss Lindsay on the day of  Mr Gleason&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; Belknap sprang suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Barry, angrily. &ldquo;Of course I  wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. I don&rsquo;t know that anybody  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, some man was. At about six o&rsquo;clock. At Fifth  Avenue and Forty-second Street. Where were you at that hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I was almost right there myself. I walked down  from the Club with Pollard about that time, and I left him at Forty-fourth and  he went on down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Belknap nodded.</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s air had been honest, his thinking back  evidently real and his statement quite in accordance with the known facts.  Pollard had said Barry walked down with him, and had left him at Forty-fourth.  Now, from that time, Pollard&rsquo;s every movement had been checked up, but not so  Barry&rsquo;s. Nobody seemed to have seen him from that moment until he arrived at  the Lindsay dinner party.</p>
  <p>To ask him as to this was sure to anger him, yet  Belknap tried it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Barry stormed, in answer to his query, &ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t an alibi. I mean I&rsquo;ve nobody who can swear to one. As a matter of fact,  I went directly home after leaving Pollard. I went into my hotel, a small one  on West Forty-fourth Street, and I went to my rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meeting nobody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I passed the doorman and the desk people.  I don&rsquo;t remember whether I spoke to them or not. I usually nod if they&rsquo;re  looking my way. But I can&rsquo;t remember what happens every single night! I&rsquo;m not  trying to establish an alibi, because I didn&rsquo;t kill Mr Gleason. But I&rsquo;m ready  to help you find out who did. I&rsquo;ve not done much so far, because I thought the  matter was in capable hands. But those capable hands have accomplished just  nothing&mdash;nothing at all! Now, I&rsquo;m going to put my finger in this pie&mdash;and I&rsquo;m  going to discover something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Mr Barry,&rdquo; Belknap said, &ldquo;what about that  letter signed by you, yet which you say you didn&rsquo;t write. Suppose you explain  that first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I intend to do! I haven&rsquo;t quite proved it,  but I have found out a possible solution of that matter. If I can prove I  didn&rsquo;t write it, and can show who did and how and why, it&rsquo;ll help some&mdash;won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet it will!&rdquo; cried Prescott. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of  talk. But have you some real information, or merely a supposition that doesn&rsquo;t  mean anything definite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; and Barry shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not  telling it all now. But I came to see Miss Lindsay. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here in a minute,&rdquo; Millicent said, eyeing  Barry closely.</p>
  <p>But in a minute, instead of Phyllis, Hester returned.</p>
  <p>Excitedly, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Miss Phyllis is gone.  Nobody saw her go and nobody knows where she is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; said Millicent contemptuously; &ldquo;how absurd! If  you mean she has run away! Phyllis wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, madam, she&rsquo;s not in the apartment. Her moleskin  coat is gone from her wardrobe, and her little taupe hat. She has certainly  gone out, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And gone Phyllis surely had. It was foolish to look  for her in the rooms, for her hat and coat were missing, of course she had gone  out into the street; whether for some ordinary errand, or to disappear who  could tell?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; said Prescott, and clapping on his  hat he hurried away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter  XV<br>
    Phyllis and Ivy</b></h2>
  <p>And where <i>was</i> Phyllis?</p>
  <p>Why, sitting in the small, but pretty, little bedroom  of Ivy Hayes, in that young woman&rsquo;s boarding-house home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re Phyllis Lindsay,&rdquo; said the other girl,  looking admiringly at Phyllis&rsquo; smart, inconspicuous costume. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jolly glad to  see you. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The frank, pleasant manner of the hostess pleased the  guest and Phyllis said, impulsively, &ldquo;Oh, I hope you can help me. I&rsquo;m in a  quandary. Will you tell me frankly just why you said I was at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s the  day he died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, how did you know I said that? I declare those  detectives tell everything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought it was Mr Barry whom you told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same. Why, I said you were there,  because you were there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, you weren&rsquo;t. I like you, Miss  Lindsay, and I&rsquo;ll stand by you. Now, you tell me what you want me to say, and  I&rsquo;ll say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I don&rsquo;t want you to say anything that isn&rsquo;t  true. Why did you think I was there, if you didn&rsquo;t see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard me talking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were asking Mr Gleason for money&mdash;a big sum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you heard me ask him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly hear you, you spoke very low, and I  was behind a closed door. But I heard all Mr Gleason said&mdash;so I could tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;twenty thousand dollars! I should say not!  Not unless&mdash;well, you know my conditions.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s exactly what he said. And then  you murmured something, and he said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a Lindsay&mdash;you&rsquo;re both Lindsays,&rsquo;  but I don&rsquo;t know whether he meant you and his sister, or you and your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has my brother to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but when he spoke of the two of you  together, like that, I thought he meant you and Louis. But afterward, I thought  he might have meant you and his sister, Mrs Lindsay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know my brother? You call him Louis!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him&mdash;not awfully well, but enough to call  him anything I like. You don&rsquo;t have to know anybody so very long to call him  pet names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pet names!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Miss Lindsay, don&rsquo;t be so shocked.  You&rsquo;re probably more conventional than I am, but you must know a few things.  Well, anyhow, I didn&rsquo;t hear any more, because Mr Gleason shut the door, and I  just scooted down the back way and home. I never knew whether you got the money  you wanted or not. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis gasped. She was annoyed at the girl&rsquo;s  rudeness, but, after all, Ivy Hayes had a charm of her own, and it was  impossible to feel deep resentment toward the flippant little thing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get it from Mr Gleason, because I didn&rsquo;t ask  him for it. I didn&rsquo;t ask him for it, because I wasn&rsquo;t there. I&rsquo;ve never been  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Lindsay&mdash;what you say goes. You&rsquo;ve  never been there. Is that what you came to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ivy cocked her foolish little curly head on one side,  and gave Phyllis such a humorous wink that she couldn&rsquo;t help smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder Louis likes you,&rdquo; she said,  impulsively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an adorable little piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Ivy, gravely. &ldquo;Pile it on thick.  I just lap it up. Do you think I&rsquo;m pretty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phyllis returned, simply. &ldquo;Now, tell me again,  why did you think the&mdash;the person Mr Gleason said those things to was myself,  when you never had seen me&mdash;and you say you couldn&rsquo;t hear me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, when the bell rang, Mr Gleason said it was you.  That he expected you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis turned pale. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. He said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Lindsay coming up.  You go.&rsquo; So I went. I hung around a few moments, trying to get a glimpse of  you, but I couldn&rsquo;t. I heard you speak, but you spoke so low, and the door was  almost shut, so I couldn&rsquo;t hear a word you said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Phyllis drew a long breath. &ldquo;If I was there&mdash;I  didn&rsquo;t kill Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Ivy exclaimed. Then, with a  look deep into Phyllis&rsquo; eyes, she added, &ldquo;And you weren&rsquo;t there. I know it  now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s come to me. You were not there that day at  all, Miss Lindsay. As you say, you&rsquo;ve never been there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ivy looked very grave. She gazed at Phyllis with a  strange look of divination, and added, &ldquo;I know you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have,&rdquo; Phyllis cried quickly. &ldquo;I <i>was</i> there that day&mdash;I was, really. I just said I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; Ivy smiled a little but she did not  laugh. &ldquo;What am I to think? You were there and you weren&rsquo;t there! You&rsquo;ve never  been there and you were there that day! My goodness gracious!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; Phyllis said, looking at her coldly. &ldquo;I  said at first I wasn&rsquo;t, for&mdash;for reasons of my own&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; and Ivy nodded a sagacious head. &ldquo;What  are we going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis stared. &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About the&mdash;the reason you said&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t look like that! You&rsquo;re uncanny. What do  you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About who killed Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time Ivy looked directly at Phyllis, and that  with a meaning glance.</p>
  <p>Phyllis covered her face with her hands, and at once  Ivy ran to her side and threw her arms around her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no time for that.  Let&rsquo;s see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do about what? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I speak out? Shall I put it into words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phyllis, but she shrank as from a sudden  blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, here&rsquo;s how I dope it out. It wasn&rsquo;t you who  were there&mdash;but it was Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no! It was I. It wasn&rsquo;t Buddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes it was. You&rsquo;re trying to shield him. I see it.  Now, don&rsquo;t take that tack with me. Own up&mdash;tell me all you know&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll help  you.&rdquo; Phyllis thought a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might as well,&rdquo; Ivy urged. &ldquo;I know too much to be  ignored, and I truly think it would be better for you in every way, to take me  into your confidence. Let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, quite. But I do know that if you stick  to your story of having been there yourself, when you were not, you&rsquo;ll get a  whole lot of unpleasant notoriety, if nothing worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspicion. Accusation. Maybe arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis jumped. &ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo; she whispered, and her eyes  stared in horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, maybe not that,&rdquo; Ivy soothed her, &ldquo;but, you  tell me all about it. Look here, Miss Lindsay, I&rsquo;m a better detective than half  the men on the force. And, say, I know a little girl&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t suppose  you&rsquo;d want her&mdash;but start straight now&mdash;tell me everything you know. Let me be  your father confessor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve nothing to confess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t! How about that story&mdash;fib you just told  about going to Mr Gleason&rsquo;s house&mdash;when you didn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how I know. It was Louis  who went there&mdash;not you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, and I didn&rsquo;t hear him&mdash;or I should have known at  once. But it was Louis, of course, and when Mr Gleason said &lsquo;You&rsquo;re both  Lindsays,&rsquo; and referred to the stepmother, of course it fitted Louis as well as  you. Louis wanted money&mdash;you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has he got it&mdash;yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will have it to-morrow. A&mdash;a friend is going to let  me have it for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be able to get money easily!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Pollard is my fiance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis remembered suddenly that Pollard had told her  she might want to say that, and just now, in the presence of this girl of a  lower class and of a lesser degree of refinement, Phyllis felt a sudden impulse  to justify her position. To her mind, to take money from one&rsquo;s fiance made  correct what would otherwise be a questionable thing to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho! I see! Why, I thought you and Mr Barry were  pals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are. Good pals. But I am engaged to Mr Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re to get the money for Louis&mdash;in time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in time. You know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;ll be jailed if he doesn&rsquo;t fork over about  twenty thousand to that old shark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind details. Now, truly, Ivy, do you think  Buddy was at Mr Gleason&rsquo;s that day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it, I know it. And, Phyllis&mdash;he&mdash;he  killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the gravity of the moment neither noticed the  intimate use of the name. Phyllis looked at the other, her eyes full of a dumb  agony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better face it, dear. I am positive. You see it all  hangs together. That old maid person on the floor above, saw a young man come  in, and I know it was Louis. Where was he at that time? I mean, where does he  say he was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t asked him. Oh, Ivy, he  didn&rsquo;t?&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe he could. Louis is not much on the strong-arm  work, but he has desperate determination, and if he went there to get that  money&mdash;and if Mr Gleason wouldn&rsquo;t give it to him&mdash;let me see&mdash;I suppose Gleason  must have said that his condition was your acceptance of his suit!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Phyllis agreed. &ldquo;He knew how I love  Louis, and he often tried to get him to persuade me to do various things. Louis  is my idol. I&rsquo;ve always adored him. I really brought him up, for mother died  when he was so little. We&rsquo;re far closer to one another than most brothers and  sisters. Oh, Ivy, what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, let me think. I wish I wasn&rsquo;t so sure Louis did  the thing. But, you see, he was right there&mdash;johnny-on-the-spot! And he was  mad&mdash;and he was desperate&mdash;and Mr Gleason&rsquo;s pistol was handy-by&mdash;and he was at the  end of his rope&mdash;alone with him there&mdash;oh, of course, it was inevitable. How has  he acted since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queerly,&rdquo; Phyllis admitted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nervous and jumpy,  and afraid of everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he is. Well, Phyllis, he&rsquo;ll have to run  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he will. It&rsquo;s all very well to be shocked at the  idea, and to prefer to have him face the music&mdash;but the risk is too great! Even  if he should be innocent&mdash;and he can&rsquo;t be&mdash;they&rsquo;d put him through with bells on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean as soon as the police get Louis in their mind  as a suspect, they&rsquo;ll pounce on him, and they&rsquo;ll fasten it on him, no matter  what he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Railroad him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not quite the word. You don&rsquo;t know much about  these things, do you? Railroad is a term they use about innocent suspects, and  Louis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ivy, how can you? Stop! Don&rsquo;t you love him, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, in a way. But it&rsquo;s enough of a way to want him to  get off! I tell you he must vanish&mdash;disappear. And that big money must be paid,  or those people will be after him. You know all about that deal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and I may as well tell you, I was out that  afternoon, in a taxicab with&mdash;with Bill Halsey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halsey! You! Oh, you poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he was respectful&mdash;very decent, in fact. He was to  go with me to Mr Gleason&mdash;I was expected, you see&mdash;and I was to try to persuade  Mr Gleason to pay that debt and free Louis from the sharks. I knew Mr Gleason&rsquo;s  price would be my promise to marry him&mdash;and&mdash;I expected to pay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you go to Gleason&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;as we neared there, we saw Louis going in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s all a horrid nightmare. I  turned around and went right home. No, not right home; we drove around a bit,  trying to decide what to do. Mr Halsey was nice; he said for me to follow up my  brother or to wait developments, just as I chose. Of course, I said I&rsquo;d wait  and learn the result of Louis&rsquo; visit&mdash;I knew what he went for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And since&mdash;since we know the result of Louis&rsquo; visit,  has Mr Halsey been after you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but I told him that now the inheritance was  mine, I&rsquo;d pay him all Louis owes him just as soon as I could arrange it. He  seemed satisfied, only he wants the money at once. So Mr Pollard is getting it  for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, Bill Halsey won&rsquo;t bother Louis about  that. Now, I tell you, Phyllis, it&rsquo;s necessary that we get the boy away&mdash;smuggle  him out of the country&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out of the country!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Canada, Europe&mdash;anywhere. Or maybe it would be  easier to hide him. Do you know of any country place&mdash;some friend&rsquo;s house&mdash;no,  they&rsquo;d find him. Oh, what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too big a question for us to handle. Two girls  can&rsquo;t take care of a case like this. I&rsquo;ll ask Mr Pollard what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s good. Mr Barry wouldn&rsquo;t be very  capable&mdash;but Mr Pollard is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not personally. But I know he&rsquo;s a powerful and a wise  man. He&rsquo;ll know just what to do. And as you&rsquo;re engaged to him&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want to  tell him about Louis&mdash;or, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;I suppose so. But how you take things for  granted! I must see Louis first of all. Oh, Buddy, Buddy dear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meantime, Phyllis&rsquo; mysterious disappearance was  causing dismay and consternation in many hearts and minds.</p>
  <p>Prescott, who had started out to find her, was looking  everywhere, except in the home of Ivy Hayes.</p>
  <p>Belknap, still at the Lindsay house, talked it over  with Mrs Lindsay and Philip Barry and concluded that at last they were on the  right track. He had no fears about finding the girl, for she could not  disappear permanently. But it was a shock, and he was a little bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;disappearance is practically  confession. Miss Lindsay must be found&mdash;can, probably, easily be found. But I am  sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; cried Millicent, &ldquo;how you talk! You don&rsquo;t  mean you think Phyllis killed my brother, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said that yourself, at first, Mrs Lindsay,&rdquo;  Belknap reminded her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only in the excitement of my first shock. Really, I  was not quite responsible for what I said that night. Now, I know Phyllis  couldn&rsquo;t have done it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A girl like that! Incredible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been done. It may be she was under great  provocation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, hold on, Belknap,&rdquo; Barry cried; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go too  fast. What have you by way of evidence? Only that Miss Lindsay was seen in a  taxicab with some man. What does that prove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there are some questions for Miss Lindsay to  answer. I am not accusing her unheard. I want to hear her, to see her, to  question her. And she has run away&mdash;which is, to say the least, a strange thing  for her to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she hasn&rsquo;t run away. There are dozens of  plausible reasons for her sudden departure. And see here, Belknap, don&rsquo;t let  your suspicions turn toward that girl. It&rsquo;s too ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will bear investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not even that. Since you&rsquo;ve taken this attitude, I&rsquo;ve  decided to come through myself. I killed Robert Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap looked at him. &ldquo;Now, Mr Barry, that&rsquo;s too  transparent. You&rsquo;re saying that to shield Miss Lindsay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;d better not jump at conclusions too  continuously. And are you logical? You suspect Miss Lindsay with no  evidence&mdash;only because she chanced to go out when you wanted to see her. Yet  when I come and give myself up, you refuse to believe my confession. Can you  not say, at least, that it needs investigation? Isn&rsquo;t it your habit to look  into the matter of a serious confession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Belknap stared at him.</p>
  <p>But Millicent Lindsay cried out: &ldquo;Oh, Phil, I&rsquo;m so  sorry! Do you know, I felt it was you all along. And I like you so much! But  when I learned about the letter you wrote to Robert&mdash;you did write it, didn&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as soon as I heard about that, I knew you did  it. You never liked Robert, but that was mostly because you thought he would  get Phyllis away from you. But to kill him! I can hardly believe it&mdash;and yet,  I&rsquo;ve felt sure of it for some time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doorbell rang, and in a flurry of tears and  agitation Millicent ran away to her own room.</p>
  <p>The newcomer was Pollard, and as he entered he  observed the serious attitude of the two men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just confessed to the Gleason murder,&rdquo; said  Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you confess for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I did it. What does any one confess for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Usually because he didn&rsquo;t do it. The real murderer  rarely confesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I think,&rdquo; Belknap said; &ldquo;Mr Barry has an  idea that Miss Lindsay will be accused, and he has confessed to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That it, Phil?&rdquo; and Manning Pollard looked Barry  squarely in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take it any way you like, Pol,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;I make  my confession, I give myself up&mdash;now let the law&mdash;if such a thing exists&mdash;take its  course. And there&rsquo;s that letter. You know I wrote it, Pollard. You know I must  have written it. There&rsquo;s no other possible theory. You know I left you about  six&mdash;or a little before. You know I&rsquo;ve no alibi&mdash;and there was time enough for me  to go down to the Gleason place and get back for the dinner party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You rattle it off like a lesson, Phil. How did you go  down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry stared, but quickly said, &ldquo;Taxi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did no one see you go in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. Shut up, Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard shut up, and Belknap asked a long string of  questions. These Barry answered, but even then, Belknap did not arrest him. The  attorney went away, leaving the matter in abeyance, for, as a matter of fact,  he had no idea Barry was telling the truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shielding somebody?&rdquo; Pollard asked as soon as Belknap  had gone.</p>
  <p>Barry look at him. &ldquo;I confessed,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know. To shield Phyllis&mdash;or Louis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Pol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Own up, old chap. Or perhaps you suspect them both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do! How did you know? They were there together.  There was trouble. Louis sent that telephone message&mdash;after the shooting&mdash;and he  muddled it. It&rsquo;s all been a muddle ever since!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It surely has,&rdquo; agreed Pollard. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure  you&rsquo;ve chosen the best way to clear it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I had to. I can&rsquo;t see Phyllis dragged through a  trial&mdash;and she would say or do anything to shield Louis. So I thought I&rsquo;d throw  myself into the breach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly done so&mdash;whether for good or ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter  XVI<br>
    Buddy</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Now that the money is paid, Phyllis, dear, and the  whole matter is hushed up, Louis will never be suspected of having had anything  to do with that Bill Halsey gang. It was a narrow escape&mdash;if the story had come  out, it would have stained the boy&rsquo;s reputation badly. But, thanks to your  quick action and watchful care, your brother is released from their clutches  and you need worry about that no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, too, to your kindness in letting me have the  money. I will repay you just as soon as Mr Lane settles financial matters  enough to give it to me out of my inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No hurry about it. Instead of that, let&rsquo;s talk about  ourselves. When are you going to let me give you a ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, not yet,&rdquo; and Phyllis looked distressed. &ldquo;Wait  till this awful matter of the Gleason death is explained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will it ever be?&rdquo; Pollard spoke gravely, and added,  &ldquo;Do you want it to be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look like that! Do <i>you</i> suspect Louis, too? Buddy never did it! Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course he didn&rsquo;t. Do you sometimes think Phil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip Barry! No! He says he did, to shield my  brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Let&rsquo;s speak frankly, Phyllis. I can&rsquo;t bear to  fence or quibble with you. Now, you know, you and Louis were there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we weren&rsquo;t&mdash;well&mdash;maybe we were&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t  know what I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor little girl. Don&rsquo;t try to make up stories to me.  Tell me just how it was&mdash;or, don&rsquo;t tell me anything&mdash;as you wish, but don&rsquo;t tell  me what isn&rsquo;t so. I can&rsquo;t help you if you do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis looked at him searchingly. She trusted him&mdash;and  yet, she hesitated to put into words her own suspicions of Louis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Phil Barry is shielding some one else,&rdquo; she  began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, dear, that letter&mdash;how could that have been  written, except by Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you prevaricate to me!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you  know whatever is the explanation of the letter, Phil Barry isn&rsquo;t guilty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any such thing! If Barry wrote the  letter, he must have meant something by it, and until he is proved innocent,  there&rsquo;s good reason for suspecting him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suspect Louis?&rdquo; Phyllis asked directly,  facing Pollard with a straightforward gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, dear. If I did&mdash;if I do&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t say  so, because&mdash;because I love you. Confide in me&mdash;please do, darling. If you  suspect your brother, tell me so, and I&rsquo;ll do all I can to divert suspicion  from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even if you think him guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly. If Louis did it&mdash;he was blinded by rage,  or, moved by a sudden homicidal impulse born of desperation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t excuse him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to the law&mdash;but to me, he is excused because he is  your brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my brother&mdash;my little Buddy&mdash;oh, Manning, I can&rsquo;t  face it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t there, too&mdash;at the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the time of the murder? Oh, no!&rdquo; Phyllis&rsquo; eyes  were wide with horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know that Louis was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard pressed the question, glad that Phyllis had  abandoned pretense, and was telling truths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; The pained eyes looked beseechingly into  his. &ldquo;I have the evidence of an eye-witness&mdash;or, nearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by nearly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, somebody else was there, who didn&rsquo;t see Louis,  but who heard him&mdash;or, rather, heard Mr Gleason talking to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all? Phyllis, that isn&rsquo;t enough to convict  Louis!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? But, if they accuse him&mdash;he&rsquo;ll break down  and confess. I know Buddy; as soon as a breath of suspicion touches him he&rsquo;ll  go all to pieces&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether he&rsquo;s guilty or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis stared. &ldquo;Why, no, of course not if he isn&rsquo;t  guilty. Oh, Manning, do you think he isn&rsquo;t? Tell me you do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could, darling. But, I do say, there&rsquo;s no  real evidence and we may be able to prevent any from coming to light. Even if  Louis was there, didn&rsquo;t he leave before the time of the attack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t find out. I daren&rsquo;t mention it  to him. Oh, Buddy, dear&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you never did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, too,&rdquo; said Pollard, decidedly, and,  whatever was in his mind there was conviction in his tone. &ldquo;Now, see here,  Phyllis, let&rsquo;s do nothing in the matter. As near as I can make out, Barry&rsquo;s  confession is not believed at all by the police. They are sure he&rsquo;s shielding  some one, but they don&rsquo;t know who it is. Of course, Barry won&rsquo;t tell, so Louis  is safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But suppose they do come to believe Phil, and he is  arrested!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if they should?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you care so much?&rdquo; Pollard spoke softly, and  tenderly. &ldquo;If it should mean Louis&rsquo; safety&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the expense of an innocent man? Oh, impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you love Buddy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do, yes&mdash;but if he is guilty&mdash;nobody else can be  allowed to suffer in his place. Least of all, Phil Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis said the name, with a gentler light in her  eyes, a softer inflection of her voice, and Pollard felt a sudden chill at his  heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; he asked, quietly,  &ldquo;anything especial?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no,&rdquo; but Phyllis blushed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, dear, you&rsquo;re engaged to me,&rdquo; Pollard said,  smiling at her. &ldquo;I resent such implications of any other interest of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You resent my interest in Phil Barry! Why, I thought  he was your best friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is. But he can&rsquo;t be yours. Not your best  friend&mdash;only second-best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s too dear a friend for me to let any undeserved  suspicion fall on him,&rdquo; and Phyllis&rsquo; eyes shone with righteous indignation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First, we must be sure it is undeserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, I will make sure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a determined gesture, Phyllis pushed a bell  button and a maid responded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask Mr Lindsay to come here,&rdquo; Phyllis directed, and  then turning to Pollard with a pretty gesture of confidence, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work together, Manning. You see what you think  of the way Louis meets my questions. I&rsquo;ve decided to meet the issue straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Sis?&rdquo; asked Louis, coming into the room.  &ldquo;What do you want of me? Hello, Pollard, how are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Buddy, dear,&rdquo; Phyllis began, &ldquo;where were you the day  Mr Gleason died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out with it Phyl. Do you think I killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis looked at his sister. The boy was haggard, pale  and worried looking, but he met her eye and awaited her answer to his question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Louis, I can&rsquo;t think so&mdash;but there are  circumstances that make it appear possible, and I want your word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Phyllis, I didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Calmly the brother gazed at the sister. Anxiously,  Phyllis scanned the well-known face, the affectionate eyes, the sensitive,  quivering mouth, but though agitated, Louis had himself well in hand, and his  frank speech carried conviction.</p>
  <p>Phyllis drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe you, Buddy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Pollard was quiet for a moment, and then observed,  &ldquo;All right, Lindsay. And, in that case, you&rsquo;re probably willing to tell all  about your presence there that afternoon. Why haven&rsquo;t you done so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pollard&rsquo;s tone was not accusing so much as one of  friendly inquiry, and Louis, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Pol, I suppose I was a coward. I was afraid, if  I admitted I was in Gleason&rsquo;s place that afternoon, I might be suspected of the  crime&mdash;and I&rsquo;m innocent&mdash;before God, I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The solemn voice rang true, and Phyllis clasped his  hand as she said, &ldquo;I know it, Buddy, I know you never did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, if it comes out I was there, I can&rsquo;t help being  suspected,&rdquo; Louis went on, a look of terror coming to his face. &ldquo;I&mdash;oh, I hate  to confess it, but I <i>am</i> afraid. Not afraid of justice&mdash;but afraid I&rsquo;ll be  accused of something I didn&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would, too, Louis,&rdquo; Pollard said. &ldquo;Better keep  still about the whole matter, I think. You see, Louis, except for the murderer,  you are probably the last one who saw Gleason alive. Now, that, in itself is  troublesome evidence, especially if the murderer doesn&rsquo;t turn up. That is why,  I think, my theory of the stranger from the West is undoubtedly the true one.  You see, none of the people hereabouts&mdash;I mean you, Barry, Davenport, myself, or  any of us Club men could have been down there so late, and then turned up here  for the dinner party. Of course, that would have been possible, but highly  improbable. While an outsider, a man known to Gleason but not to any of use,  could have come and gone at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had to reach the Gleason apartment soon after  Buddy left,&rdquo; Phyllis mused, thinking it out. &ldquo;Well, Manning, I&rsquo;m convinced of  Buddy&rsquo;s innocence. My boy can&rsquo;t lie to me! I know him too well. He is worried  and anxious about the suspicions that may attach to him, but he&rsquo;s absolutely  innocent of crime, aren&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Louis looked into his sister&rsquo;s face, and quietly  replied, &ldquo;Yes, Phyllis,&rdquo; and she believed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to free Phil Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Pollard. &ldquo;Are you going to turn  detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help the detectives work,&rdquo; she declared.  &ldquo;Or, rather, I&rsquo;m going to get a detective that can work. I don&rsquo;t think much of  what has been accomplished so far. I&rsquo;m going to get another detective&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A private detective?&rdquo; asked Pollard. &ldquo;Better be  careful, dear. Don&rsquo;t get mixed up in this thing too deeply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not going to do anything myself.  But, I want to tell you something. Ivy Hayes knows of a girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ivy Hayes!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, while Pollard raising  his eyebrows, murmured, &ldquo;A girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seem to have exploded two bombshells!&rdquo; said  Phyllis, smiling.</p>
  <p>She was in better spirits now, since the assurance of  Louis that he was not guilty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it is the truth. Ivy Hayes knows of a girl  detective&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Phyllis, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Pollard. &ldquo;A private  detective is bad enough&mdash;but a girl one! Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a wonder&mdash;Ivy says so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sister, for goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t tell me you know  Ivy Hayes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I do, Louis. If you may know her why can&rsquo;t  I? And I like her, too. And she&rsquo;ll get this person for me, and I know Millicent  will agree&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite a feminine bunch,&rdquo; Pollard laughed. &ldquo;Do you  think you and Mrs Lindsay and Miss Hayes and the girl sleuth can succeed where  several men have failed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do think,&rdquo; cried Phyllis,  triumphantly. &ldquo;This is the era of feminine achievement, and why not in  detection as well as in other lines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; said Pollard, looking at her  fondly. &ldquo;I must go now, but if I can help you&mdash;though, being a mere man, I  suppose I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can,&rdquo; Phyllis smiled at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be  only too glad to call upon you for assistance.&rdquo; Pollard left, and Phyllis at  once called Ivy on the telephone to get more information about the girl detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t a girl!&rdquo; Ivy replied; &ldquo;that is, it is a  girl, but it&rsquo;s a man, too. They&rsquo;re associated, you see. Of course, the man is  the head of the firm&mdash;but the girl, who is his assistant, does quite as much of  the work as he does. And, she&rsquo;s my friend, that&rsquo;s why I spoke of her as the  detective. But he&rsquo;s the one to call on. He&rsquo;s Pennington Wise&mdash;they call him  Penny Wise&mdash;how could they help it! Well, he&rsquo;s your man, and she&rsquo;s your girl. I  used to know her, when we were both kids, and I don&rsquo;t see her often nowadays,  but we&rsquo;re good friends, and she&rsquo;s a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, too, Ivy,&rdquo; Phyllis said; &ldquo;thank you  lots and heaps. Give me the address, and I&rsquo;ll excuse you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ivy gave the number, and Phyllis went at once and told  the story to Millicent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, do get him!&rdquo; cried Mrs Lindsay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of  Penny Wise&mdash;he&rsquo;s a wizard! I don&rsquo;t know anything about his girl assistant&mdash;but  that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Penny Wise is great! I&rsquo;ve often heard of him. He&rsquo;s  frightfully expensive, but they say he never loses a case. But, Phyllis, I  never suspected Louis! How could you think I did! But&mdash;don&rsquo;t faint now&mdash;I do  suspect Phil Barry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter much whom you suspect to-day,  Millicent, it will be somebody else to-morrow! Aren&rsquo;t you about due to suspect  me again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You! oh, Phyllis, don&rsquo;t remind me of the foolish  things I said, when I was hysterical and almost crazy! You know how you&rsquo;d feel  if Louis had been killed! You&rsquo;d suspect anybody!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Millicent, I&rsquo;ll forget it. But I don&rsquo;t  believe for one minute that Philip Barry is the guilty man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t! Why, Phyllis, I thought you did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what I think,&rdquo; and Phyllis broke  down and sobbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, there, dear child,&rdquo; Millicent soothed her.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. You&rsquo;re all worried to pieces. Now, let&rsquo;s get the Wise man, and then  you shift all care and anxiety on to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Millicent, suppose he should prove it to be  Phil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it is Phil, he ought to be shown up. We can&rsquo;t stop  now, for sentiment or preference. We must go ahead and prove positively who is  the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Millicent took the tone of an avenging justice,  she was almost humorous, so ill did the role fit her. But she was in earnest,  and she immediately set to work to engage the services of Pennington Wise.</p>
  <p>Her efforts were vain, however, as the detective  politely informed her that his press of business would not permit him to take  on another case at present.</p>
  <p>Greatly disappointed, she told Phyllis, who at once  told Ivy Hayes, over the telephone, of her defeat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; said the young woman, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t come, won&rsquo;t he?  Well, I guess he will. Expect him this evening, to talk over the  preliminaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the sanguine Ivy felt sure her childhood friend  could somehow persuade the great detective to meet the engagement she had just  committed him to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zizi,&rdquo; Miss Hayes later remarked, to her friend, &ldquo;You  just simply got to take on the Gleason case. You hear me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear you perfectly,&rdquo; Zizi&rsquo;s engaging little voice  replied. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No buts. You just do it. Why, Ziz, it&rsquo;s all mixed up  with friends of mine. And say, dearie, I want you to do it for old times&rsquo;  sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Ivy, truly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truly you will? All right, Ziz. You make Penny Wise  stand around&mdash;you fix it somehow&mdash;and you send him or go yourself to the Lindsay  home this evening at eight o&rsquo;clock. Love and kisses. Your own Ivy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ivy hung up the receiver, satisfied that if her friend  didn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t meet her wishes, she would call her up and tell her so. Not  hearing from Zizi, Ivy concluded all was going well.</p>
  <p>And it was. Zizi, the wonderful little assistant of the  great detective, coaxed and finally persuaded him to take the case, assuring  him that she, herself, would do most of the work. She put it on the grounds of  a personal favor to herself, and as this was so unusual a condition as to be  almost unique, Pennington Wise gave in.</p>
  <p>And so, promptly at eight, he presented himself at the  Lindsays&rsquo; and was received with welcome.</p>
  <p>For an hour Wise listened to the accounts of the case  from the three Lindsays. No one else was present, and Wise asked them to tell  him all they could, both of direct evidence or their own leanings or  suspicions.</p>
  <p>The detective was a man of great personal magnetism.  Tall and strong, his very bearing inspired confidence and hope. His face was  fine and mobile, his wavy chestnut hair, brushed over back, was fine and thick,  and his keen blue eyes took in everything without any undue curiosity.</p>
  <p>He was both receptive and responsive, and in an hour  he had the history of the case, clearly and definitely in his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can admit of several  suspects already. There was a motive, let us say, for any one who benefited by  Mr Gleason&rsquo;s will. That includes Mr and Miss as well as Mrs Lindsay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millicent frowned at him. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; she cried,  explosively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only say you benefited by the will,&rdquo; said Wise,  mildly. &ldquo;I have as much right to mention your name as those of the other two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis didn&rsquo;t get anything from the will,&rdquo; said  Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did, in a way,&rdquo; the detective returned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so  fond of your brother, that whatever is yours, is pretty much the same as  belonging to him. Now, I&rsquo;m not going to consider you two ladies as suspects at  all. But Mr Lindsay&rsquo;s cause I shall look into.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis colored, angrily, and was about to make a sharp  retort, when the kindness of Wise&rsquo;s expression caught his notice, and he  suddenly decided he&rsquo;d like to be friends with the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look into it all you like,&rdquo; he said, with an air of  relief at giving his troubles over to this capable person. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have  you. You see, Mr Wise, I was there so fearfully close to the time of the crime,  that I&rsquo;ve been afraid to have it known how close.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my boy. If you&rsquo;re guilty I&rsquo;ll find  it out, anyway; and if not, you&rsquo;ve more to gain than lose by being frank and  honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are your other suspects?&rdquo; Phyllis asked,  anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; said Wise, smiling at her. &ldquo;First, Doctor  Davenport&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First, Doctor Davenport, because, he first raised the  alarm. Next, Mr Pollard, because he declared an intention of killing Mr  Gleason. Next, Mr Monroe, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dean Monroe!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis, &ldquo;why he has never been  thought of!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the answer!&rdquo; said Wise. &ldquo;He was in that group  who discussed murder that afternoon, he went away, his subsequent movements  have not been traced, and, as you say, he&rsquo;s never been questioned or even  thought of in the matter. Therefore, I investigate his case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Philip Barry?&rdquo; Phyllis could hold back the  question no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Mr Barry.&rdquo; Pennington Wise looked at her.  &ldquo;You are interested in him? Especially? Forgive me if I seem intrusive. I am  not really, but I have to know some things to know how to go about others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lindsay is engaged to Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Millicent  informed the inquirer. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a firm friend of Mr Barry&rsquo;s, but, I think you  ought to know that Manning Pollard is her fiance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phyllis said, as Wise asked the question by a  glance. &ldquo;I am engaged to Mr Pollard, but I don&rsquo;t want Mr Barry suspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if he did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the letter? He wrote that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; he did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says he did. It is signed by him. It is in keeping  with his nature and his attitude toward Mr Gleason. Why do you say he didn&rsquo;t  write it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr Wise. I have a feeling, a conviction  that somebody forged that letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how would that be possible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t tell you. But I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the letter yet, Miss Lindsay,&rdquo;  Pennington Wise looked at her reflectively. &ldquo;And until I do, I can&rsquo;t speak  positively. But I&rsquo;ve read up this case, more or less, and I can&rsquo;t see how a  forgery could pass the experts as this has done. I incline to think it is  genuine. But it need not have implied murder at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; repeated Phyllis, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t write it. I know he  didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t, trust me to find it out,&rdquo; Wise  reassured her. And, as they heard the bell ring, &ldquo;I dare say that&rsquo;s my little  assistant. She agreed to come later. I want you to like her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I shall,&rdquo; said Phyllis, enthusiastically;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about her from Miss Hayes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in another moment Zizi appeared in the doorway.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter  XVII<br>
    Zizi</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs Lindsay?&rdquo; Zizi said, by way of interrogative  greeting, and, with a second nod to Louis, she crossed the room and sat down by  Phyllis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lindsay,&rdquo; and the visitor took both Phyllis&rsquo;  hands in her own. &ldquo;I am so glad to know you. May I help you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope you can,&rdquo; Phyllis said, fascinated by the  strange child.</p>
  <p>For Zizi looked like a child. Little, slim, and of a  lithe, nervous personality, her big, dark eyes gazed into Phyllis&rsquo; with an  expression of intense interest in her and her affairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re troubled,&rdquo; she went on, as Phyllis responded  to her evident friendliness. &ldquo;But it will be all right; Pennington Wise will  clear up the mystery and you will be glad again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You queer little thing!&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed. &ldquo;Turn  around here and let me look at you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi, turned, smiling, her white teeth just showing  between her scarlet lips, her eyes dancing, cheeks glowing, and her black hair  muffed over her ears&mdash;a highly-colored picture of vivid, restless vitality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Lindsay,&rdquo; she responded in her low, yet  clear voice, &ldquo;and please like me, for I&rsquo;m going to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, please, during the investigation. Mr Wise will  come and go, but I have to be here all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, certainly&mdash;of course, if you wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Louis cried; &ldquo;glad to have you stay, Miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zizi,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;just Zizi.&rdquo; And the smile she  flashed on Louis was the complete undoing of that impressionable young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now to business,&rdquo; Zizi went on, her manner  changing subtly from the witch-like, fascinating child to the energetic young  woman. &ldquo;Tell me things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already told Mr Wise about the case&mdash;&rdquo; Millicent  began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not the kind of things you tell him&mdash;other things.  About this Mr Barry, now. Has he a high temper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis stared-What had Phil Barry&rsquo;s temper to do with  the murder of Robert Gleason?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Zizi explained, &ldquo;if he had, the note might  have meant he&rsquo;d kill his rival&mdash;if not it might have meant a lesser threat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has a high temper,&rdquo; Phyllis admitted, reluctantly;  &ldquo;I may as well say so, for others would tell you that. He&rsquo;s a mild, equable  nature as long as things go his way. But if he&rsquo;s thwarted or crossed, even in  trifles, he flies in a rage at once. I oughtn&rsquo;t to say this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because it seems to incriminate him,&rdquo; Zizi nodded her  little head; &ldquo;but I compel the truth&mdash;don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she smiled at Phyllis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet  you wouldn&rsquo;t have said that to any other detective. Well, now, with the  knowledge that Mr Barry is quick tempered, that he was jealous of Mr Gleason  and that he wrote the threatening letter, and that he has given no positive  account of what he was doing at the critical moment&mdash;shall we suspect him?  Answer, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Phyllis spoke breathlessly, relieved but  anxious to know more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, principally for the reason that he has  confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t murderers ever confess?&rdquo; Louis asked, his eyes  on the beautiful young thing that was of a type hitherto unknown in his  experience.</p>
  <p>Zizi was not really beautiful, but her magnetic charm  was so great, her ways so winsome, and her mysterious eyes so full of changing  expression and half-veiled witchery that she enthralled them all.</p>
  <p>Wise watched her. He was accustomed to have his  clients surprised at his strange little assistant, but oftener they were  critical than wholly admiring. Tonight, however, Zizi was at her best&mdash;she was  more than usually attractive, and her manner was gentler than she often chose  to make it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, in reply to Louis&rsquo; query, &ldquo;but  you have to know why they confess. You see Mr Barry confessed to shield some  one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Louis asked, but he flushed and looked  embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know who,&rdquo; Zizi returned, &ldquo;and maybe it wasn&rsquo;t  only yourself, but Phyllis, too. You see&mdash;you must see, all of you, that the  situation is serious. Louis was there very shortly before the crime took place.  Phyllis is said to have been there&mdash;whether she was or not&mdash;no one can be found  who saw or spoke to Mr Gleason after that&mdash;so it would be just like the  detectives to fasten the crime on one or both of the Lindsays. Anyway, that&rsquo;s  the way it looked to Mr Barry, and in his quick tempered&mdash;which means impulsive  way&mdash;he gave himself up. Although he is as innocent of the crime as you two  are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Millicent exclaimed, &ldquo;you start out by  clearing all those who have been suspected!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all. There still remain several of the Club  men&mdash;also the possibility of a stranger&mdash;I mean a stranger to you people who are  interested. Mrs Lindsay, where did your brother live before he went to  Seattle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a little village in New Hampshire&mdash;Coggs&rsquo; Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely name! Did you live there, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I lived in Ohio with my parents. An uncle, my  mother&rsquo;s brother, took Robert to live with him, in New Hampshire, when the boy  was quite small. That&rsquo;s why Robert and I never saw much of each other. We were  affectionate enough when we met, but living apart, we were not really intimate.  I was surprised when he came East, and we renewed our family relations. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he fell in love with Phyllis&rdquo;&mdash;Zizi interrupted.  &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t reciprocated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; Phyllis said, calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Millicent agreed, &ldquo;it was really love at first  sight. And as Phyllis had any number of suitors, Robert tried to cut them out  by promises of such luxuries and dazzling prospects as his wealth could offer.  But Phyllis couldn&rsquo;t seem to bring herself to say yes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she had, hadn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Zizi didn&rsquo;t look at  Phyllis. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the dinner party to be an announcement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millicent shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;ask her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi turned. &ldquo;How about it, Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either,&rdquo; Phyllis said, slowly. &ldquo;I had  half promised&mdash;because&mdash;oh, why not tell? because Mr Gleason had promised me a  lot of money&mdash;which I very much needed&mdash;at once&mdash;if I would make the announcement  that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, tell it all,&rdquo; Pennington Wise put in; &ldquo;you  wanted that money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To pull me out of a desperate hole,&rdquo; Louis burst  forth. &ldquo;I got in bad&mdash;very bad&mdash;with some gamblers and some loan sharks&mdash;and Sis  was good enough to try to get me out of it. She&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t have to marry old  Gleason&mdash;even if she did announce an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Buddy,&rdquo; said Phyllis, looking at him  reprovingly; &ldquo;I never thought of saying yes to him, and backing out afterward.  I wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing. But I planned to go there that afternoon and try  once more to persuade him to give me the money, without a definite promise on  my part. I hoped that for the sake of Louis&rsquo; good name I could persuade him.  But&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind all that,&rdquo; Zizi said, impatiently, &ldquo;it  won&rsquo;t get us anywhere to mull over that. Now, Penny Wise, here&rsquo;s where I stand.  All people here present are innocent of this crime. Philip Barry&mdash;I think&mdash;is  also innocent. I&rsquo;ve no reason to suspect a stranger&mdash;an acquaintance of Mr  Gleason&rsquo;s&mdash;and I think if there were such an individual, there must have been  some trace of him. People don&rsquo;t glide in and out of a situation like shadows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go slow, Ziz,&rdquo; cautioned the detective, looking at  her thoughtfully. &ldquo;Keep your imagination in leash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and she bowed with mock docility. &ldquo;Now, if  you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I have to go to Coggs&rsquo; Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; gasped Millicent, as Zizi rose, and began  pulling on her gloves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s a train at midnight, I can easily catch  it. Good-by, all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew her cloak together and fastened it, and held  out her hand to Wise with a demanding gesture.</p>
  <p>Understandingly, he took out his pocketbook, and gave  it to her without a word.</p>
  <p>She tucked it into her roomy handbag, and turned to  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Louis cried, already in the hall,  and getting into his overcoat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the station? Thank you,&rdquo; Zizi smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; all the way. To New Hampshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nixy!&rdquo; she laughed, flashing her white teeth. &ldquo;He  travels the fastest who travels alone. But I&rsquo;ll be glad to have you entrain  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two went out together, and hailing a taxicab,  Louis delightedly put Zizi in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll have you to myself for an hour,&rdquo; he  exulted. &ldquo;What are you, I can&rsquo;t make you out. A sprite, a witch, an elf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, all those things, and a girl beside. And you  needn&rsquo;t fall in love with me&mdash;it would be a foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve already fallen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all right. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; Zizi was  absorbed in thought, and seemed really to care nothing at all for Louis&rsquo; state  of mind.</p>
  <p>Meantime, Millicent was demanding of Pennington Wise  an explanation of the astonishing Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about her,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think about her. She never does a wrong thing&mdash;in detective work, I mean. She  will some day&mdash;I daresay&mdash;and it may be she has now. But she acts on impulse, on  intuition, on what some people call a hunch. And I&rsquo;ve never known her to slip  up. She is a wonder&mdash;but don&rsquo;t try to understand her&mdash;for you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But will she go to New Hampshire&mdash;all alone by  herself? At night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and she&rsquo;ll take care of herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis will go with her,&rdquo; Phyllis said, &ldquo;I know he  will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Miss Lindsay, you&rsquo;re mistaken there. Zizi won&rsquo;t  let your brother accompany her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it would be all right,&rdquo; Millicent observed;  &ldquo;at work on a case, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right enough, but Zizi won&rsquo;t let him go because she  doesn&rsquo;t want him to. Now, as to Mr Gleason&rsquo;s will. Did you two ladies know  about its terms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t certain,&rdquo; Millicent said, &ldquo;for my brother  changed it quite often. He was ready to settle a large amount on Phyllis at  once if she would consent to marry him, but he had already made a will leaving  his fortune equally divided between us two. He never liked Louis, rather, he  disapproved of him. Of late, Louis has run wild&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; Phyllis defended; &ldquo;he has been  duped and deluded by a lot of men with whom he had no business to associate at  all. But let&rsquo;s leave Louis out of it, for Mr Wise has declared he doesn&rsquo;t  suspect him, and he is in no other way concerned in this business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Miss Lindsay. Now, tell me, did Mr  Gleason contemplate changing his will again in case Miss Lindsay refused him  definitely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; Phyllis stated; &ldquo;he told me unless I  made the announcement at the dinner party, he would change his will and cut me  out of it entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he, then, assume that you could be bought in that  fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Phyllis colored, but she replied, &ldquo;Yes, he did. But,  mostly because he knew how desperately I wanted money for my brother. And, too,  it isn&rsquo;t a gracious thing to say&mdash;but Mr Gleason was not such an attractive man  that he had much reason for being accepted outside of his wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see; and he had made the existing will recently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within a month or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who knew of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one, I believe,&rdquo; Millicent said, &ldquo;but Phyllis and  Louis and myself&mdash;except, of course, the lawyer who drew it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Fred Lane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he one of that group of men who were  discussing murder at the Club that day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Millicent looked inquiringly at him; &ldquo;but you  don&rsquo;t dream that Mr Lane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Fred Lane and my brother were good  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, it is to the men of that group that I  shall first direct my investigations. Few of them really liked Mr Gleason.  Forgive me, if I seem unkind, Mrs Lindsay, but I cannot work if trammeled by  too great consideration for your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop for that, Mr Wise. I quite understand. And  I know my brother was not a favorite with the Club men. He was too different.  He was out of the picture. They had little in common. Now, in so far as that is  of assistance to you in forming your theories, use it, for it is quite true. My  brother was a far better and worthier man than most of them, but his ways were  different and he did not show to advantage when among them. If Phyllis could  have cared for Robert he could have made her very happy, I know. But that&rsquo;s all  past. What I want now, is to avenge my brother&rsquo;s death. To discover and punish  his murderer, no matter who he may be. I beg of you, Mr Wise, spare no time,  pains or expense to ferret him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I shall not. Can you think of any grievance or  reason for enmity toward Mr Gleason on the part of those men I refer to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only one reason, Mr Wise, and that applies to  several. They were jealous of his attentions to Miss Lindsay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Millicent!&rdquo; Phyllis cried, in protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true. Miss Lindsay is a belle, and all the men  of that group were her admirers&mdash;or almost all. Doctor Davenport, is, of course,  excepted, and Mr Lane. They are married men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaving Mr Barry, Mr Pollard and Mr Monroe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and they surely cannot be suspected. You have  declared Mr Barry innocent, Mr Pollard was in his own home at the time of the  crime, and Dean Monroe&mdash;why, he hasn&rsquo;t even been thought of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has he been inquired of as to his whereabouts at the  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. Has he, Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s silly to think of Dean! Why,  he scarcely knew Mr Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he is devoted to you?&rdquo; Wise asked the question so  casually that Phyllis answered, frankly, &ldquo;Yes, he is. That is, he has asked me  to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you refused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did. But, Mr Wise, is it necessary to tell you such  things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is, Miss Lindsay. I fully believe that you are the  innocent cause of this murder. This attaches no blame to you, in any way, but  it makes it imperative for me to learn these details. Probably nine crimes out  of ten are committed because of a woman&mdash;so don&rsquo;t let it disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not disturb me!&rdquo; Phyllis cried; &ldquo;of course it  disturbs me! If there are women so foolishly vain as to enjoy stirring up  strife among their admirers, I am not of that sort. I wish I were dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now, Phyllis,&rdquo; Millicent said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t act like  that. I, too, believe the murderer was somebody who was jealous of Robert  because of you, but you can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;m sure my brother had no enemy who  would come from the West to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure of such a thing as that, but we can  prove up where the people were who might be suspected here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Methodically Wise went about the job.</p>
  <p>Although he had told the Lindsays he was sure of  Philip Barry&rsquo;s innocence, none the less did he look into his alibi.</p>
  <p>And it seemed to be all right. The doorman and the  desk clerk at the small hotel where he lived were almost certain that he had  came in that afternoon, just about six, as he said he did. They were not  willing to swear to it, but they were reasonably certain, and Wise felt pretty  sure they were right.</p>
  <p>Next he went to the nearby hotel where Pollard lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; declared the doorman there, &ldquo;I saw Mr  Pollard come in&mdash;he nodded to me just like he always does. And later, I saw him  when he went out again. I put him into his taxi myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time, about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No about about it. It was just twenty-five minutes to  seven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how I know. Mr Pollard glanced at his  wrist watch as he got into the cab. It had a radium dial, and I saw it plain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Pollard wears a wrist watch, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s worn it ever since the war. Got used to it  over there, I s&rsquo;pose. Well, anyway, that&rsquo;s what happened, so&mdash;if the watch was  correct&mdash;it was seven-twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Wise. &ldquo;And, as I understand it, one or  two people saw Mr Pollard in his room, or heard him telephone during the hour  or so he was here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the desk clerk rehearsed the story a  little wearily. The employees of the hotel had told the tale often, for owing  to Manning Pollard&rsquo;s threat&mdash;which had passed into history&mdash;he was frequently  being suspected by somebody, detective or amateur, and the hotel people had  been called upon to rehearse the story until they were letter perfect in their  parts.</p>
  <p>Next, Pennington Wise investigated the doings of Dean  Monroe.</p>
  <p>And the result was that he learned that Monroe had  gone from the Club that day straight to the home of his mother, and had  remained with her until so late that he had to make great haste dressing for  dinner in order to reach the Lindsay house on time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Penny Wise, profoundly, to himself; &ldquo;h&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Three days later, Zizi returned. She went to Wise&rsquo;s  apartment before going to the Lindsay house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find out much?&rdquo; he asked her, as she flung off her  wraps, and deposited her small person in a very large easy chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sure did! But I&rsquo;m glad to get back! New England is  no paradise in winter. Get me something to eat, there&rsquo;s a bright Penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Wise rang a bell. &ldquo;Take your time,  Ziz, but have a little pity on a mere man, consumed with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will. Coggs&rsquo; Hollow is exactly what its name sounds  like. A tiny, primitive village, just the same now as it was a quarter of a  century ago, when Robert Gleason lived there, with his uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You found people who knew him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could they throw any light on the murder&mdash;or its  cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not light&mdash;but a sort of a glimmer of a glow of a hint  of dawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s enough. You succeeded, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; and, Penny Wise, whom do you suppose I saw  up there, also nosing about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr Manning Pollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ziz, you&rsquo;re crazy. He wasn&rsquo;t there. I&rsquo;ve seen him  myself every day you&rsquo;ve been gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seen him! Seen Manning Pollard? Penny, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    The Luminous Face</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Zizi, my child, I&rsquo;m not crazy. And, as a matter  of fact, I suppose you&rsquo;re not, either. Now, what do you mean by thinking you  saw Pollard in New Hampshire when I know he was here in New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First, you tell me what you mean by thinking he was  here in New York when I saw him in Coggs&rsquo; Hollow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saw him? and talked with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t see him to speak to&mdash;but I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walking along the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he speak to you, or bow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no; he doesn&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve seen his picture&mdash;both in the paper  and at Miss Lindsay&rsquo;s, and, as you know yourself, he&rsquo;s unmistakable. Nobody  could take any one else for Manning Pollard! Why, that face is of a type not  often seen. And his physique, and his big, square shoulders&mdash;why, Penny, I know it  was he.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Ziz, I don&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t, but we must puzzle  out how he got up there and why he went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have you done here while I was away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out all about the Barry letter for one  thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A cleverly contrived thing. It was originally written  in vanishing ink and Barry signed it in real ink. Then, when the vanishing ink  vanished, the perpetrator of the precious scheme filled in the typed letter  above the signature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever! What was the original document?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a testimonial or something of the sort to a  Club servant. Head Steward, or somebody, and this testimonial was arranged for  him. Barry remembers being asked to sign and remembers signing. Then he forgot  all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t others to sign?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry thought so, but the matter was never carried  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. Who asked Barry to sign?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dean Monroe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How he continues to crop up! Is he the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Zizi, we&rsquo;re up against an enormously  interesting case. It&rsquo;s simple up to a certain point, and then it&rsquo;s inexplicable.  The murderer is one of the cleverest men on this planet. For, look. He arranged  that letter deliberately, fixed up the Club servant scheme, to get Philip  Barry&rsquo;s signature on a blank sheet of paper. Having that, he later wrote in  whatever he chose. His cleverness consisted, at this point, in not overdoing.  Had he made the letter a threat of murder, it would have looked false on the  face of it, for Barry is not like that. Well, he had this letter ready to plant  in Gleason&rsquo;s desk after he had committed his crime&mdash;and he did so. Next, he left  no fingerprints on the telephone or on the revolver, save those of Gleason  himself. Was that clever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, it was! And he made the prints on the  telephone with Mr Gleason&rsquo;s fingers after Mr Gleason was dead! And he did the  telephoning himself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; how quick you are, Zizi! That&rsquo;s exactly what  happened, because that&rsquo;s the only way it could have been. Now, a man clever  enough for all that is clever enough for anything. Yet I can&rsquo;t see how he did  it. Nor do I grasp his motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealous of Phyllis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t enough to account for the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t! He had another motive, and I&rsquo;ve found  it out. I found out up in Coggs&rsquo; Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet I am! Right away. How did you guess the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t guess. I deduced from his alibi. Such a  clever villain&mdash;what would he naturally choose by way of alibi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what he did do. Pretend not to have any&mdash;but when  they investigate, they find he has a cast-iron one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly, and Manning Pollard&rsquo;s was all that. But I  can&rsquo;t see how he managed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way. He must have had a confederate  who did the killing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; a clever criminal doesn&rsquo;t have a confederate. No;  Pollard killed Gleason himself. By the way, Zizi, I found Pollard&rsquo;s fingerprints  on the Barry letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Dean Monroe did that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dean Monroe asked Barry to sign it, but&mdash;he told me  himself&mdash;Pollard gave him the paper and asked him to get Barry&rsquo;s signature.  This, Monroe did, and gave the paper back to Pollard. Later, Pollard told  Monroe the plan had been given up. I dug that all out, without speaking to  Barry about it. I don&rsquo;t want Pollard to imagine we suspect him. Now, my child,  what was his motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A pretty strong one. It seems that Manning Pollard is  an illegitimate child. He was born in Coggs&rsquo; Hollow, of unmarried parents.  Later, his father and mother married, so he was legally legitimized. But of  course, a stigma remains. Now, Mr Pollard is several years younger than Robert  Gleason, so the assumption is that Robert Gleason, who lived all his boyhood in  Coggs&rsquo; Hollow, knew this secret of Pollard&rsquo;s birth, and had threatened to  expose him, unless he desisted from trying to win Phyllis away from Gleason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pennington Wise thought a few moments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said, at last; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it, Zizi.  You&rsquo;re a wonderful child for sure! How did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went straight to the town clerk, and he not only  showed me his books, but he told me the story. He knows nothing of the Gleason  murder, and I didn&rsquo;t tell him. Up in that little dot of a village they don&rsquo;t  know the news of New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they must know of Gleason&rsquo;s death. He was a  foremost citizen, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of Seattle, yes. But when he left Coggs&rsquo; Hollow he  was a young man of twenty-five or so, and I suppose they&rsquo;ve forgotten all about  him. Anyway, the town clerk didn&rsquo;t remember him very clearly, but he remembered  all about the Pollard family. Of course, it was a celebrated case up there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact of the couple&rsquo;s marriage, five or six years  after Manning Pollard&rsquo;s birth, was a sensational affair, and though nobody  could blame Mr Pollard, the fact remains that he was really an illegitimate  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, knowing this, Gleason probably was quite ready  to tell it, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, Pollard made it impossible for him to tell.  Now, Penny Wise, that&rsquo;s a fine theory, a noble deduction&mdash;but, how did Pollard  commit that murder when he was at home in his hotel? Like you, I can&rsquo;t see him  employing a gunman. Rather, I see him going there to plead with Gleason to  spare him. Then, when Gleason refused, in the heat of passion, Pollard shot  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the carefully prepared letter from Barry proves  premeditation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. And, remember his threat to kill Gleason.  Would he have said that, if he had really intended to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so. I&rsquo;ve thought all along, that Pollard&rsquo;s  bravado was his hope of escape. He would argue that a man who made such a  threat would not be suspected. And, quite as he calculated, everybody said,  &lsquo;oh, if he had meant to kill Gleason, he never would have advertised his intention.&rsquo;  That was a bold stroke, but an efficacious one. Yet, we can&rsquo;t be right, Zizi,  for he was at home. I&rsquo;ve been to the hotel again. I&rsquo;ve tabulated all his  movements. He did go home at six, he did go out again at seven-twenty-five, and  during that time he was in his room, because he telephoned twice, and he talked  to the bellboy. And these three circumstances were at intervals of twenty  minutes or so, therefore, he couldn&rsquo;t have been down in Washington Square at  all. After he got into his taxi, the driver accounts for his every movement  until he reached the Lindsay house at dinner time. So, there&rsquo;s his alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;distrust the perfect alibi,&rsquo; Penny,  for that&rsquo;s a platitude and a silly one, too. Your innocent man has a perfect  alibi. He may or may not remember it, but it&rsquo;s perfect all the same. Now, this  alibi of Pollard&rsquo;s is, to all appearances, the alibi of an innocent man. He has  that secret of his past, Gleason did know it, that makes a motive. He did, as  you say, fix up the Barry letter&mdash;though that may not be quite true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Ziz?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean perhaps somebody else worked the vanishing  ink, and all that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But who would want to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The murderer&mdash;if it turns out to be not Pollard. Look  here, Penny, Pollard is either innocent or guilty. If guilty, all your  deductions are correct, but if innocent they must be transferred to some one  else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely. But to whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno yet. Me, I think it is Pollard&mdash;but how, <i>how</i>,  how did he manage it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only by a confederate who did the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which is not the solution! I don&rsquo;t know how I know  it, but I know that didn&rsquo;t happen. Why, a villain might get a gunman to shoot  somebody, but not to put up all that elaboration. The fingerprints, the  telephoning stunt&mdash;all that was the work of an artist in crime, the cleverest  criminal in the world, as you&rsquo;ve admitted. Not a hireling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A hireling might be clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in that way. No, a wizard like that is not  anybody&rsquo;s hireling. He&rsquo;s in business for himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have it your own way. And I think you&rsquo;re right. Well,  then, how did Pollard get down there? Aeroplane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s a simple explanation, only we haven&rsquo;t got  it yet. Incidentally, how did he get up to New Hampshire and back without being  missed here in New York. Aeroplane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have done it at all. You&rsquo;re mistaken  about seeing him there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; Zizi knitted her pretty brows. &ldquo;What time did  he leave the hotel in that taxi to go to Phyllis&rsquo; dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven twenty-five. He had two errands on the way. He  stopped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know. For theater tickets and for flowers. How do  they know so positively the exact time he left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a coincidence. The doorman happened to catch  sight of Pollard&rsquo;s wrist watch as he got into the cab. It has a luminous  face&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen him wear it&mdash;and the doorman noticed it was just twenty-five  minutes after seven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! Oh, oh, Penny! That explains it all! Oh, me,  oh, my! To think of the simple solution! Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when  first we practise to deceive! Oh, gracious goodness sakes! Be sure your sin  will find you out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Zizi, don&rsquo;t act like a wild woman!  When you begin to quote things I know you&rsquo;re luny! Sit down and tell me what  you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this a dagger that I see before me? Oh, what a  noble mind was here o&rsquo;erthrown!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your Shakespeare mixed up. That first  quotation is from Macbeth, but the other is from Hamlet. You look more like one  of the witches!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am! I am! Double, double, toil and trouble!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zizi, behave! Stop your foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl was dancing up and down the room like a  veritable witch-elf. She flung her long, thin arms about, and was really  excited, her brain teeming with the sudden revelation that had come to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember the Macbeth witches?&rdquo; she demanded,  pausing before him, poised on one foot, and looking like a Sibyl herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do! Double, double, toil and trouble;  fire burn and cauldron bubble!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the answer! Oh, Penny Wise, it&rsquo;s as  plain as day&mdash;as Day! I see it all&mdash;all&mdash;<i>all</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might I inquire what enlightened you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The radium watch! The luminous face! Oh, I&rsquo;m onto the  watch! I&rsquo;m on the watch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zizi, you are crazy. I refuse to talk to you as long  as you act so foolishly. Will you be quiet and tell me things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Penny, I&rsquo;m so excited. Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you, after I  prove my case to myself. I&rsquo;ve got to go to the hotel&mdash;to Pollard&rsquo;s hotel&mdash;and see  about something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in a moment she was gone, and in the shortest  possible time she was at the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; groaned the telephone girl, as Zizi earnestly  began to whisper her questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, again&mdash;and yet.&rdquo; Zizi said: &ldquo;Now, listen, and  tell me this. What did Mr Pollard say when he called his cab that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a funny thing. Why do you ask that? He  said &lsquo;Will you call me a cab, please.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was that funny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because he always says, &lsquo;Call me a taxi.&rsquo; I remember,  because I&rsquo;m afraid some time I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a taxi!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Funny girl! Well, I&rsquo;m trying to prove that Mr Pollard  was not himself that night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Mr Pollard never drinks anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just happen to know. You&rsquo;re wrong, he was perfectly  sober.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why did he telephone to the cleaner&rsquo;s when he  knew it was past their closing time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose he didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not like Manning Pollard&rsquo;s way. One more thing. Isn&rsquo;t  Mr Pollard a careful dresser?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is he! The finest ever. He&rsquo;s so particular, he&rsquo;s an  old fuss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know a lot about him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. A telephone operator gets  side-lights on people who are continually discussing their affairs over her  lines. I don&rsquo;t have to listen in, but I can&rsquo;t help knowing how often Mr Pollard  telephones to cleaners and tailors and haberdashers and all that. Can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, honey, of course you can&rsquo;t. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as Zizi left the hotel she met Manning Pollard  coming in. He looked at her curiously, for though they had never met, Phyllis  had told him of the queer girl, and he felt sure this was she.</p>
  <p>To confirm it he went directly to the telephone girl  and inquired of her, and the obliging young woman repeated to him the whole of  her conversation with Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Pollard observed to himself, &ldquo;h&rsquo;m&mdash;exactly so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he turned on his heel and went out again.</p>
  <p>Absorbed in his thoughts, he paid no attention to a  slim little figure that slipped out from a protecting doorway and followed him.  Nor did he notice that the determined little person kept on following him as he  boarded a Fifth Avenue Bus and went southward.</p>
  <p>Zizi, who could make herself as inconspicuous as a  schoolgirl when she chose, sat in the rear seat, looking out of the window.</p>
  <p>Pollard got out at the Washington Square terminus, and  walked briskly westward. This was away from the Gleason apartments, though Zizi  had not expected him to go there.</p>
  <p>She followed, unnoticed, until Pollard entered what  seemed to be a second-rate boarding house.</p>
  <p>Nodding her head contentedly, Zizi waited until her  quarry again made an appearance.</p>
  <p>Then as the man went over and took a North-bound Bus,  Zizi found a taxicab and gave the order to fly back to Penny Wise.</p>
  <p>It was after fifteen or twenty minutes of the excited  girl&rsquo;s conversation and explanations that Wise was in possession of all the  facts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can we get him?&rdquo; he asked, and then the telephone  rang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Wise, and received this astonishing  response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Manning Pollard speaking. You have been too many for  me, Mr Wise. I give myself up. I don&rsquo;t know how you discovered so much, but I  see there&rsquo;s no use in further effort to hide my crime. I confess, and you may  come and take me. I am in my rooms at the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a bit astonishing, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Wise said.  &ldquo;But I accept your invitation and I will go at once to you. Will you stay there  till I come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly. When I perceive the game is up, what else  is there for me to do? Moreover, would I call you up and surrender, if I were  not sincere about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you should. At your hotel, then? All  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens, Zizi, what a man! I&rsquo;ll start right off. You  call Prescott, and tell him just what Pollard said, and tell him to go to the  hotel with two policemen&mdash;or enough to take the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise went and Zizi did as he had bade her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Prescott cried, over the wire, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say  so! Well, wonders will never cease! I don&rsquo;t altogether believe in it, but I&rsquo;ll  hurry to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Zizi herself hurried to the hotel, more excited  than ever.</p>
  <p>She calmed herself a little on the way, for she knew  she must be cool and collected to take her part in the scene.</p>
  <p>She reached the hotel a moment or two before Prescott  got there.</p>
  <p>But he came, as she waited, and, seeing her,  exclaimed, &ldquo;Are you sure? Where&rsquo;s Mr Wise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; she said, a little unnecessarily.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come if you like,&rdquo; said Prescott, carelessly, and  with his two husky companions he entered the elevator.</p>
  <p>At Pollard&rsquo;s door the group paused, and Prescott  knocked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; they heard, and went in.</p>
  <p>The man sitting in an easy chair sprang up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy now, Mr Pollard,&rdquo; Prescott said, &ldquo;you told us to  come and get you, and we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told you&mdash;come and get me&mdash; Get out, I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott stared. Was this Manning Pollard? Talking so  unlike himself! Clearly, it was not!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Prescott said, curiously; and then,  illogically, &ldquo;Mr Pollard, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Manning Pollard. If you&rsquo;ve come to arrest  him, you&rsquo;ve got the wrong man.&rdquo; But though blustering, the speaker was white  with fear. Overcome with surprise and terror, he fell back into his chair and  began to swear fluently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None of that, now,&rdquo; said Prescott, dumfounded, but  vigilant. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not Manning Pollard you&rsquo;re his twin brother! Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;oh, hang it all&mdash;I&rsquo;m Horace Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And just what are you doing in Pollard&rsquo;s rooms? And  why do you look so much like him? You&rsquo;re his very double!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Double, double, toil and trouble!&rdquo; Zizi chanted  softly, to herself, but no one noticed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Taylor, bitterly, &ldquo;and he has betrayed  me. I&rsquo;ll make a clean breast of it. I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t know  he was going to. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well I&rsquo;m his half-brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the exact image of him in form and feature,  but your manner is utterly different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, because he has had education and culture&mdash;and  I&rsquo;ve had none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, out with your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Manning Pollard is the son of the man who was also my  father. We are exactly alike, though I&rsquo;m a couple of years older.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you a legitimate son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not&mdash;but neither is Manning, though he was  legally made so, by his parents&rsquo; marriage some years after he was born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know all that?&rdquo; cried Zizi. &ldquo;You were up in  Coggs&rsquo; Hollow day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss. I saw you there, at the clerk&rsquo;s office. I  knew then there was trouble brewing for Manning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Double, double, toil and trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, exactly that! Manning hired me to  personate him here in his rooms the night of&mdash;well, you know that night, Mr  Prescott. He&mdash;oh, thunder! shall I tell it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, tell it all,&rdquo; Prescott was breathless with  curiosity and interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he paid me heaps to meet him at a certain  spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, in the crowd. He had supplied me with clothes  just like his own, and given me full instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were the instructions?&rdquo; Prescott demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was to meet him there, at about six, and I was to  assume his identity for a time. I was to come here, come up to his rooms, here,  dress for dinner, take a taxi and go away at exactly twenty-five past seven.  While here I was to telephone once or twice, also to call a bellhop and see  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a plot!&rdquo; exclaimed Prescott, &ldquo;oh, <i>what</i> a  plot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did all this, and then, later, when I went into the  Astor for the theater tickets, Manning met me there, and in the crowd, we  changed identities again, he got into the cab I had got out of, and he went on  to the dinner and I went home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew what his object in all this was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not! Before God I never would have consented if  I had. He told me it was to play a joke on some of his friends, and the price  he offered was so great I consented.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you telephoned to the cleaner&rsquo;s and all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and called the bellboy to take the letter&mdash;which  Manning had prepared. Then afterward, when I read the papers I felt sure that  Manning had killed Robert Gleason. I never taxed him with it, for it was none  of my business and if it was true I didn&rsquo;t want to know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This explains Mr Barry seeing Pollard over in  Brooklyn&mdash;it was you, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so. What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold you for the present, but if your story is true,  you&rsquo;re merely a dupe. How come you here now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Manning came down to my place about an hour ago, and  said for me to come right up here and personate him again for an hour or so,  and then he said he&rsquo;d never trouble me again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You came willingly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the poor chap was so upset, seemed in danger, and  said I could save his life by doing this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have. Of course he&rsquo;s miles away by now. What a  mess&mdash;oh, <i>what</i> a mess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Prescott was disgusted. First that such a gigantic  hoax had been put over on him, and second that he had utterly lost all chance  to catch the perpetrator thereof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You put it over neatly enough,&rdquo; Prescott growled,  looking at the man, Taylor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I nearly muffed it. While I was dressing  here that night, some guy called up to know Robert Gleason&rsquo;s address. I hadn&rsquo;t  a notion, but I chanced to see a little address book on the desk, and I soon  found it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the butler of Davenport&rsquo;s patient,&rdquo;  Prescott remembered. &ldquo;Well, it was one great game. And we&rsquo;ve lost our man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Pennington Wise came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taylor?&rdquo; he said, looking curiously at the double.  &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> an exact duplicate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you know about this?&rdquo; cried Prescott,  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; replied Wise, gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just left your  place, Taylor, and your precious half-brother shot himself there fifteen  minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spill it,&rdquo; commanded Prescott.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew when I got the message from Pollard that the  dupe would be here so I sent you, Prescott, while I went down to Taylor&rsquo;s home.  As I expected, Pollard was there. He made a full confession, seeing the game  was up, and then eluding my watchfulness, he shot himself. I called the police  in and I came up here to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over it,&rdquo; said Prescott, his eyes wide  with wonder. &ldquo;What a scheme!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simple in the main,&rdquo; said Wise, &ldquo;but elaborate as to  details. He left nothing unprovided for. He foresaw every condition and met it.  The only thing, and the thing that proved his undoing was his forgetting that  Mr Taylor had not enjoyed the same social advantages that he himself had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; growled Taylor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had evening clothes ready for you here. He planned  for every item of your conduct, but he couldn&rsquo;t know that you would wear a  wrist watch with evening dress! That little incident caught the attention of  Zizi, and from that she instantly deduced that the man that got into that taxi  with a wrist watch on in the evening, could not have been Manning Pollard  himself! Moreover, he drew the attention of the doorman to the time on its  illuminated dial, and so, the luminous face fixed the time, but Pollard would  have had on no wrist watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Prescott, &ldquo;Pollard&rsquo;s a perfect  dresser, I happen to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He confessed it all,&rdquo; went on Wise. &ldquo;He was game,  I&rsquo;ll say, and he told me frankly that Gleason had threatened to tell of his  shameful birth. He was very sensitive about the matter. Gleason told him he  would disclose the secret unless Pollard ceased his attentions to Miss Lindsay.  Also, Pollard knew, from Lane, of Gleason&rsquo;s will. Therefore, rid of Gleason,  Pollard figured he could win Miss Lindsay and the fortune. So he set about to  get rid of Gleason&mdash;and did. His threat that day was, of course, with the idea  that such a remark would tend to divert suspicion from him&mdash;which it did. His  alibi, so perfectly prepared, he scorned to declare, knowing that when it was  learned by inquiry it would be satisfactory, which it was. That&rsquo;s all, except  to credit my assistant, Zizi, with the acumen which found out the truth. Her  suspicion of a double was roused by the wrist watch episode. She came over  here, and learned that the exact doings of the man here that fatal evening were  not precisely in Pollard&rsquo;s usual manner. She watched Pollard come in and go out  again. She followed him, and when he went into a house, she felt sure it was  the home of his double. It was! She saw a man come out, and though it was like  Pollard, her newly attentive eyes showed her it was not really he. Off guard,  Taylor has many dissimilarities from his brother. She flew back to me with the  story, not knowing how soon the denouncements was to come. And then, when  Pollard telephoned he would give himself up, I knew at once he meant to have  Taylor here in his place. So I went to Taylor&rsquo;s place, and a more surprised man  than Manning Pollard I never saw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As my reward,&rdquo; Zizi said quietly, &ldquo;I want to be  allowed to go and tell Phyllis Lindsay the truth. I love her so, and I don&rsquo;t  want her shocked at hearing about it from a lot of policemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no objection on the part of anybody, and  Zizi went on her errand.</p>
  <p>An hour later, when all three of the Lindsays had been  told, and had indeed been shocked and horrified, Philip Barry came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phyllis,&rdquo; he said, scarcely seeing any one else.</p>
  <p>Phyllis rose and went straight to him. He held out his  arms, and she clung to him as they closed round her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never doubted you for a minute, Phil,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;but that man had a sort of power over me&mdash;a&mdash;oh, almost an hypnotic power, I  think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget him,&rdquo; Zizi advised, smiling at the pair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, you two talk over things, while I go in the  library and flirt with Louis, with Mrs Lindsay for chaperon. Forget everybody  else, and think there are only you two in the whole wide world.&rdquo;</p>
