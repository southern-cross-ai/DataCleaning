    Headland Harbor</b></h2>
  <p>It  is, of course, possible, perhaps even probable, that somewhere on this green  earth there may be finer golf links or a more attractive clubhouse than those  at Headland Harbor, but never hope to wring such an admission from any one of  the summer colony who spend their mid-year at that particular portion of the Maine  coast.</p>
  <p>Far  up above the York cliffs are more great crags and among the steepest and  wildest of these localities, a few venturesome spirits saw fit to pitch their  tents.</p>
  <p>Others  joined them from time to time until now, the summer population occupied nearly  a hundred cottages and bungalows and there was, moreover, a fair sized and  fairly appointed inn.</p>
  <p>Many  of the regulars were artists, of one sort or another, but also came the less  talented in search of good fishing or merely good idling. And they found it,  for the majority of the householders were people of brains as well as talent  and by some mysterious management the tone of the social side of things was  kept pretty much as it should be.</p>
  <p>Wealth  counted for what it was worth, and no more. Genius counted in the same way, and  was never overrated. Good nature and an amusing personality were perhaps the  best assets one could bring to the conservative little community, and most of  the shining lights possessed those in abundance.</p>
  <p>To  many, the word harbor connotes a peaceful, serene bit of blue water, sheltered  from rough winds and basking in the sunlight.</p>
  <p>This  is far from a description of Headland Harbor, whose rocky shores and deep black  waters were usually wind-swept and often storm-swept to a wild picturesqueness  beloved of the picture painters.</p>
  <p>But  there were some midsummer days, as now, one in late July, when the harbor  waters lay serene and the sunlight dipped and danced on the tiny wavelets that  broke into spray over the nearby rocks.</p>
  <p>Because  it was about the hour of noon, the clubhouse verandah was crowded with members  and guests waiting for the mail, which, as always, was late.</p>
  <p>The  clubhouse, a big, low building, with lots of shiny paint and weathering  shingles, was at the nearest spot consistent with safety to the shore. From it  could be had a magnificent view of the great headland that named the place.</p>
  <p>This  gigantic cliff jutted out into the sea, and rising to a height of three hundred  feet, the mighty crag showed a slight overhang which rendered it unscalable.  The wet black rock glistened in the sunlight, as spray from the dashing  breakers broke half way up its sides.</p>
  <p>The  top was a long and narrow tableland, not much more than large enough to  accommodate the house that crowned the summit. There was a strip of sparse lawn  on either side the old mansion, and a futile attempt at a garden, but  vegetation was mostly confined to the weird, one-sided pine trees that waved  the branches of their lee sides in mournful, eerie motions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  see how any one wants to live up there in that God-forsaken shack,&rdquo; said John  Clark, settling more comfortably in his porch rocker and lighting a fresh  cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think it&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Mrs Blackwood disagreed with him. &ldquo;So picturesque&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, if you say &lsquo;picturesque&rsquo; up here, you&rsquo;ll be excommunicated. The thing is  all right, but the word is taboo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, then, chromoesque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; Clark objected; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more like an old steel engraving&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not with all that color,&rdquo; said Lawrence North. &ldquo;It is like an engraving on a  gray, cloudy day,&mdash;but today, with the bright water and vivid sunshine, it&rsquo;s  like a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  it right out!&rdquo; cried Ted Landon, irrepressibly, &ldquo;like a picture postcard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t help being like that,&rdquo; Mrs Blackwood agreed, &ldquo;for the postcards for sale  in the office of the club are more like the reality than any picture an artist  has ever made of the Headland House.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, photographs are truer than drawings,&rdquo; North said, &ldquo;and that card that  shows the cliff in a storm comes pretty near being a work of art.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  difficulty would be,&rdquo; Clark observed, &ldquo;to get any kind of a picture of that  place that wouldn&rsquo;t be a work of art. Why, the architect&rsquo;s blueprints of that  house would come a good deal nearer art than lots of watercolors I&rsquo;ve seen in  exhibitions. I&rsquo;m keen on the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; growled Landon, for most of the Headlanders resented the faintest  disparagement of their cherished masterpiece, a joint work of nature and man.</p>
  <p>The  promontory was joined to the mainland by a mere narrow neck of rocky land, and  from that point a rough road descended, over and between steep hills, reaching  at last the tiny village and scattered settlement of Headland Harbor.</p>
  <p>Headland  House itself was a modified type of old world architecture. Built of rough gray  stone, equipped with a few towers and turrets, pierced by deep and narrow  windows, it had some effects of a French chateau and others that suggested an  old English castle.</p>
  <p>It  was true to no school, it followed no definite type, yet perched on its lonely  height, sharply outlined against the sky, its majestic rock foundations  sweeping away from beneath it, it showed the grandeur and sublimity of a  well-planned monument.</p>
  <p>And,  partly because of their real admiration, partly because of a spirit of  ownership, the artist colony loved and cherished their Headland House with a  jealous sensitiveness to criticism.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stunning  thing,&mdash;from here,&rdquo; John Clark said, after a few moments of further smoking and  gazing; &ldquo;all the same, as I stated, I shouldn&rsquo;t care to live up there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  difficult of access,&rdquo; Claire Blackwood said, &ldquo;but, otherwise all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Blackwood was a widow, young, attractive, and of a psychic turn of mind. Not  enough of an occultist to make her a bore, but possessing quick and sure  intuitions and claiming some slight clairvoyant powers. She dabbled in water  colors, and did an occasional oil. She was long-limbed, with long fingers and  long feet, and usually had a long scarf of some gauzy texture trailing about  her. Of an evening or even on a dressy afternoon, she had a long panel or  sash-end hanging below her short skirt, and which was frequently trodden on by  blundering, inattentive feet.</p>
  <p>Good-looking,  of course, Claire Blackwood was,&mdash;she took care to be that,&mdash;but her utmost care  could not make her beautiful,&mdash;much to her own chagrin. Her scarlet lips were  too thin, and the angle of her jaw too hard. Yet she was handsome, and by  virtue of her personality and her implicit belief in her own importance, she  was the leader socially, notwithstanding the fact that the colony disclaimed  any society element in its life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  us about the Headland House people, Claire. You&rsquo;ve called, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  from Ted Landon, who by reason of his sheer impudence was forgiven any  unconventionality. No other man at the Harbor would have dreamed of addressing  Mrs Blackwood by her first name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I&rsquo;ve called. They&rsquo;re delightful people.&rdquo; The words said more than the tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  reservations?&rdquo; asked North.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  in a way. They&rsquo;re quite all right,&mdash;it&rsquo;s only that they&rsquo;re not picture mad,&mdash;as  we all are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ignorant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&mdash;not that. Well, I&rsquo;ll sketch them for you. Mr Varian is a Wall Street man,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Magnate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I daresay. Wealthy, anyway. He&rsquo;s big and Vandyke-bearded. Well mannered,&mdash;but a  bit preoccupied,&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we get what you mean,&rdquo; said the irrepressible Ted. &ldquo;Go on,&mdash;what about the  daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t come to her yet. The mother is due first. Mrs Varian is the clingingest  vine I ever saw. I only saw her on parade, of course, but I&rsquo;m positive that in  curl-papers, she can whine and fret and fly into nervous spasms! Her husband  spoils her,&mdash;he&rsquo;s far too good to her,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a lot you gathered at one interview,&rdquo; murmured Lawrence North.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I went for,&rdquo; Mrs Blackwood returned, coolly. &ldquo;Well. Mother Varian is wrapped  up in her blossom-child. Betty is a peach,&mdash;as I know you boys will agree,&mdash;but I  never saw greater idolatry in any mother than Mrs Varian shows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  worth it?&rdquo; asked John Clark, idly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;  Mrs Blackwood assured him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear thing. I don&rsquo;t often enthuse over  young girls, but Betty Varian is unusual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prettier  than most girls, more charm, better manners, and,&mdash;a suspicion of brains. Not  enough to hurt her, but enough to make it a pleasure to talk to her. Moreover,  she&rsquo;s a wilful, spoiled, petted darling of two worshipping parents, and it&rsquo;s  greatly to her credit that she isn&rsquo;t an arrogant, impossible chit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  good to me,&rdquo; commented Ted; &ldquo;when can I meet her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  introduce you soon. They want to meet some of our best people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. That lets me in at once. When will you take me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tomorrow  afternoon. They&rsquo;re having a small picnic and they asked me to bring two amusing  young men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I go?&rdquo; asked Lawrence North.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Young</i> men, I said,&rdquo; and Mrs Blackwood  looked at him calmly. &ldquo;You are old enough to be Betty Varian&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  since I&rsquo;m not, that needn&rsquo;t prevent my meeting her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you shall, some time. But I&rsquo;m to take two tomorrow, and,&mdash;what do you think? I  said I would bring Rodney Granniss, and Mr Varian said, &lsquo;No, he&rsquo;d rather I  asked some one in his place!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  for heaven&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; cried Landon. &ldquo;Rod&rsquo;s our star performer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, they know him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the more reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s this way. Rod Granniss is already a beau of Betty&rsquo;s,&mdash;and her father  doesn&rsquo;t approve of the acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  approve of Granniss!&rdquo; John Clark looked his amazement. &ldquo;Mr Varian must be an  old fuss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that&rsquo;s just what he is,&rdquo; assented Claire Blackwood, and then Ted Landon  urged,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t described the siren yet. What&rsquo;s she like to look at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little thing, sylphish, rather,&mdash;dainty ways, quick, alert motions, and with the  biggest gray eyes you ever saw,&mdash;edged with black.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Raving  tresses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  very dark brown, I think. But the liveliest coloring. Red-under-brown cheeks, scarlet  lips and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&mdash;teeth like pearls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  good, sound, white teeth, and fluttering hands that emphasize and illustrate  all she says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, she&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; and Ted looked satisfied. &ldquo;I can cut out old John here, and  if Granniss is barred, I&rsquo;ll have a cinch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must behave yourself,&mdash;at first, anyway, because I am responsible for you. Be  ready to go up there with me at four tomorrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  here at four?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we&rsquo;ll walk up. A bit of a climb, but motors can go only to the lodge, you know,  and that&rsquo;s not worth while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  porter&rsquo;s lodge belonging to Headland House was partly visible from the  clubhouse, and it guarded the gates that gave ingress to the estate. There was  no other mode of entrance, for a high wall ran completely across the narrow  neck that joined the headland to the main shore, and all other sides of the  precipitous cliff ran straight down to the sea.</p>
  <p>From  where they sat the group could discern the motor road as far as the lodge; and  here and there above that could be glimpsed the narrow, tortuous path that led  on to the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grim  old pile,&rdquo; Landon said, looking at Headland House. &ldquo;Any spook connected with  its history?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard of any,&rdquo; said Mrs Blackwood. &ldquo;Did you, Mr North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  definitely, but I&rsquo;ve heard vague rumors of old legends or traditions of dark  deeds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  pshaw, I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; and Mrs Blackwood shook her head at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  making that up to lend an added interest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but if there isn&rsquo;t any legend there  surely ought to be. Let&rsquo;s make one up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t have it. I hate haunted houses, and I shan&rsquo;t allow a ghost to be  invented. The place is too beautiful to have a foolish, hackneyed old ghost  yarn attached to it. Just because you were up here last summer and this is the  first year for most of us, you needn&rsquo;t think you can rule the roost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; Lawrence North smiled good-naturedly, &ldquo;have it your own way. But, truly,  I heard rumors last year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  them to yourself, then, and when you meet the Varians, as of course you will,  don&rsquo;t say anything to them about such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  word is law,&rdquo; and North bowed, submissively. &ldquo;Here comes the mail at last, and  also, here comes Granniss,&mdash;the disapproved one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  tall outdoorsy-looking young man appeared, and throwing himself into a piazza  swing, asked breezily, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s disapproving of me, now? Somebody with absolute  lack of fine perception!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  here,&rdquo; began Landon, and then a warning glance from Claire Blackwood prevented  his further disclosures on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  make a secret of it,&rdquo; went on Granniss, &ldquo;own up now, who&rsquo;s been knocking poor  little me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo;  said Mrs Blackwood, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nixy,  Madame Claire! You may disapprove of me, but you&rsquo;re not the one I mean. Who  else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  let&rsquo;s tell him,&rdquo; North laughed; &ldquo;he can stand the shock. They say, Granniss,  you&rsquo;re <i>persona non grata</i> up at the  house on the headland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rodney  Granniss&rsquo; eyes darkened and he looked annoyed. But he only said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a  disapproval any one may obtain by the simple process of admiring Miss Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;  asked Claire Blackwood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  really. To call twice is to incur the displeasure of one or both parents; to  venture a third time is to be crossed out of the guest book entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  look here, old man,&rdquo; Landon said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve only been in that house about a  week. Haven&rsquo;t you been rushing things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew them before,&rdquo; said Granniss, simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met them in New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, then their dislike of you is evidently well-founded!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this impudence of Landon&rsquo;s brought forth no expression of resentment from its  victim. Granniss only winked at Ted, and proceeded to look over his letters.</p>
  <p>It  was the first time in the memory of any of the present <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of Headland Harbor, that the house on the rocks had been  occupied. Built long ago, it was so difficult of access and so high priced of  rental that no one had cared to live in it. But, suddenly, and for no known  reason, this summer it had been rented, late, and now, toward the end of July, the  new tenants were only fairly settled.</p>
  <p>That  their name was Varian was about all that was known of them, until Mrs  Blackwood&rsquo;s call had been hospitably received and she brought back favorable  reports of the family.</p>
  <p>It  seems Betty was anxious to meet some young people and Mrs Varian was glad to  learn from her caller that small picnics were among the favored modes of  entertainment, and she decided to begin that way.</p>
  <p>Next  day, she explained, a few house guests would arrive, and if Mrs Blackwood would  bring two or three young men and come herself, perhaps that would be enough for  a first attempt at sociability.</p>
  <p>This  met Mrs Blackwood&rsquo;s entire approval, and she proposed Rodney Granniss&rsquo; name,  all unsuspecting that he would not be welcomed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  all right, you understand,&rdquo; Mrs Varian had said,&mdash;Betty not being then  present,&mdash;&ldquo;but he&rsquo;s too fond of my daughter. You can tell,&mdash;you know,&mdash;and I want  the child to have a good time, but I want her to have a lot of young  acquaintances, and be friendly with all, but not specially interested in any  one. Her father feels the same way,&mdash;in fact, he feels more strongly about it  even than I do. So, this time, please leave Mr Granniss out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was all plausible enough, and no real disparagement to Rodney, so Mrs Blackwood  agreed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I do anything for you?&rdquo; she asked her hostess at parting. &ldquo;Have you everything  you want? Are your servants satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in every respect,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs Varian frowned. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re lucky to keep them at all.  Only by the most outrageous concessions, I assure you. If they get too overbearing,  I may have to let some of them go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me know, in that case, and I may be able to help you,&rdquo; and with a few further  amenities, Claire Blackwood went away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if I were one of her servants I shouldn&rsquo;t stay with her!&rdquo; she confided later to  a trusted friend. &ldquo;I never saw a more foolishly emotional woman. She almost  wept when she told me about her cook&rsquo;s ingratitude! As if any one looked for  appreciation of favors in a cook! And when she talked about Betty, she bubbled  over with such enthusiasm that she was again moved to tears! It seems her first  two little ones died very young, and I think they&rsquo;ve always feared they  mightn&rsquo;t raise Betty. Hence the spoiling process.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it also explains,&rdquo; observed the interested friend, &ldquo;why the parents discountenance  the attentions of would-be swains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&mdash;but Betty is twenty, and that is surely old enough to begin to think  about such things seriously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the girl,&mdash;yes. And doubtless she does. But parents never realize that their  infants are growing up. It is not impossible that Rod Granniss and Miss Betty  have progressed much further along the road to Arcady than her elders may  suspect. Why did the Varians come here,&mdash;where Rod is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t suppose they knew it,&mdash;though, maybe Betty did. Young people are pretty  sharp. And you know, Rod was here in June, then he went away and only returned  after the Varians arrived. Yes, there must have been some sort of collusion on  the part of the youngsters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  not. I daresay Miss Betty has lots of admirers as devoted as young Granniss.  Can&rsquo;t you ask me to the picnic?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  this one. It&rsquo;s very small. And there are to be some guests at the house, I  believe. The family interests me. They are types, I think. Betty is more than  an ordinary flutterbudget, like most of the very young girls around here. And  the older Varians are really worth while. Mr Varian is a brooding,  self-contained sort,&mdash;I feel sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there, that will do, Claire! When you feel sorry for a man&mdash;I remember you began  by being sorry for Lawrence North!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry for him still. He&rsquo;s a big man,&mdash;in a way, a genius,&mdash;and yet he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gets nowhere! That&rsquo;s because he <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a genius! But he&rsquo;s a widower, so he&rsquo;s fair quarry. Don&rsquo;t go to feeling sorry  for married men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s no sentiment in my sympathy for Mr Varian. Only he intrigues me because  of his restless air,&mdash;his restrained effect, as if he were using every effort to  keep himself from breaking through!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Breaking  through what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know! Through some barrier, some limit that he has fixed for himself&mdash;I  tell you I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> what it&rsquo;s all  about. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curious,  you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  curious, then. And how he puts up with that hand-wringing ready-to-cry wife!  Yet, he&rsquo;s fawningly devoted to her! He anticipates her slightest wish,&mdash;he is  worried sick if she is the least mite incommoded or disturbed,&mdash;and I know he&rsquo;d  lie down and let her walk on him if she even looked as if she&rsquo;d care to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a lot you read into a man&rsquo;s natural consideration for his wife!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s there! I&rsquo;m no fool,&mdash;I can read people,&mdash;you know that! I tell you that man  is under his wife&rsquo;s thumb for some reason far more potent than his love for  her, or her demand for affection from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What <i>could</i> be the explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m curious. I&rsquo;m going to find out, though, and that  without the Varians in the least suspecting my efforts. Wait till you see her.  She&rsquo;s almost eerie, she&rsquo;s so emotional. Not noisy or even verbally expressive,  but her face is a study in nervous excitement. She seems to grab at the  heartstrings of a mere passer-by, and play on them until she tears them out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  gracious, you make her out a vampire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think she is,&mdash;not a silly vamp, that the girls joke about,&mdash;but the real thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
    Betty Varian</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Dad,  you&rsquo;re absolutely impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Betty, not as bad as that! Just because I don&rsquo;t agree to everything  you say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you <i>never</i> agree with me! You seem to  be opposed on principle to everything I suggest or want. It&rsquo;s always been like  that! From the time I was born,&mdash;how old was I, Dad, when you first saw me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Varian looked reminiscent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  an hour old, I think,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;maybe a little less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  from that moment until this, you have persistently taken the opposite side in  any discussion we have had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if I hadn&rsquo;t, Betty, there would have been no discussion! And, usually there  hasn&rsquo;t been. You&rsquo;re a spoiled baby,&mdash;you always have been and always will be.  Your will is strong and as it has almost never been thwarted or even curbed,  you have grown up a headstrong, wilful, perverse young woman, and I&rsquo;m sure I  don&rsquo;t know what to do with you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  rid of me, Dad,&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s laugh rang out, while her looks quite belied the  rather terrible character just ascribed to her.</p>
  <p>One  foot tucked under her, she sat in a veranda swing, now and then touching her  toe to the floor to keep swaying. She wore a sand-colored sport suit whose  matching hat lay beside her on the floor.</p>
  <p>Her  vivid, laughing face, with its big gray eyes and pink cheeks, its scarlet lips  and white teeth was framed by a mop of dark brown wavy hair, now tossed by the  strong breeze from the sea.</p>
  <p>The  veranda overlooked the ocean, and the sunlit waves, stretching far away from  the great cliff were dotted in the foreground with small craft.</p>
  <p>Frederick  Varian sat on the veranda rail, a big, rather splendid-looking man, with the  early gray of fifty years showing in his hair and carefully trimmed Vandyke  beard.</p>
  <p>His  air was naturally confident and self-assured, but in the face of this chit of a  girl he somehow found himself at a disadvantage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty,  dear,&rdquo; he took another tack, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you understand the fatherly love that  cannot bear the idea of parting with a beloved daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, but a father&rsquo;s love ought to think what is for that daughter&rsquo;s happiness.  Then he ought to make the gigantic self-sacrifice that may be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  dimple came into Betty&rsquo;s cheek, and she smiled roguishly, yet with a canny eye  toward the effect she was making.</p>
  <p>But  Varian looked moodily out over the sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;I suppose I have some authority in this  matter and I forbid you to encourage any young man to the point of a proposal,  or even to think of becoming engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I ward off a proposal, Dad?&rdquo; Betty inquired, with an innocent air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be foolish. Of course you can do that. Any girl with your intelligence knows  just when an acquaintance crosses the line of mere friendship&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Daddy, you are <i>too</i> funny! And when  you crossed the line of mere friendship with mother,&mdash;what did she do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  has nothing to do with the subject. Now, mind, Betty, I am not jesting,&mdash;I am  not talking idly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  sound very much like it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not. I&rsquo;m very much in earnest. You are not to encourage the definite attentions  of any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, let Rod Granniss come up here then, and I promise not to encourage him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall not come up here, because he has already gone too far, and you have  encouraged him too much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I love him, Daddy,&mdash;and&mdash;and I think you might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  That&rsquo;s enough! Don&rsquo;t let me hear another word now or ever regarding Granniss!  He is crossed off our acquaintance, and if he persists in staying here, we will  go away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Father, we&rsquo;ve only just come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it, and I came here, thinking to get you away from that man. He followed  us up here,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was here before we came!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he didn&rsquo;t come until he knew we were coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, he came because he wanted to be where I am. And I want to be where he  is. And you&rsquo;d better be careful, Father, or I may take the bit in my teeth and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  run off with him? That&rsquo;s why I came here. You can&rsquo;t get away. You perfectly  well know that there&rsquo;s no way down from this house but by that one narrow  path,&mdash;I suppose you&rsquo;ve no intention of jumping into the sea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  will find a way!&rdquo; Betty sang, saucily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t love, Betty. It&rsquo;s a miserable childish infatuation that will pass at  once, if you lose sight of the chap for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort! It&rsquo;s the love of my life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Varian  laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine-sounding phrase, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. Now,  child, be reasonable. Give up Granniss. Be friends with all the young people up  here, boys and girls both, but don&rsquo;t let me hear any foolishness about being  engaged to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean for me never to marry, Father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather you didn&rsquo;t, my dear. Can&rsquo;t you be content to spend your days with your  devoted parents? Think what we&rsquo;ve done for you? What we&rsquo;ve given you,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dad,  you make me tired! What have you given me, what have you done for me, more than  any parents do for a child? You&rsquo;ve given me a home, food and clothing,&mdash;and  loving care! What else? And what do I owe you for that, except my own love and  gratitude? But I don&rsquo;t owe you the sacrifice of the natural, normal,  expectation of a home and husband of my own! I&rsquo;m twenty,&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite old  enough to think of such things. Pray remember how old mother was when she  married you. She was nineteen. Suppose her father had talked to her as you&rsquo;re  talking to me! What would you have said to him, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time Fred Varian was walking with quick short strides up and down the  veranda. Betty rose and faced him, standing directly in his path.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo;  she said, speaking seriously, &ldquo;you are all wrong! You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re  talking about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will do, Betty!&rdquo; When Varian&rsquo;s temper was roused he could speak very harshly,  and did so now. &ldquo;Hush! I will not hear such words from you! How dare you tell  me I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about! Now you make up your mind to obey me,  or I&rsquo;ll cut off all your association with the young people! I&rsquo;ll shut you up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  yourself, Dad! You&rsquo;re talking rubbish, and you know it! Shut me up! In a turret  of the castle, I suppose! On bread and water, I suppose! What kind of nonsense  is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  see whether it&rsquo;s nonsense or not! What do you suppose I took this isolated  place for, except to keep you here if you grow too independent! Do you know  there is no way you can escape if I choose to make you a prisoner? And if  that&rsquo;s the only way to break your spirit, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Father Varian!&rdquo; Betty looked a little scared, &ldquo;whatever has come over you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  made up my mind, that&rsquo;s all. For twenty years I&rsquo;ve humored you and indulged you  and acceded to your every wish. You&rsquo;ve been petted and spoiled until you think  you are the only dictator in this family! Now a time has come when I have put  my foot down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  pick it up again, Daddy, and all will be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Betty  smiled and attempted to kiss the belligerent face looking down at her.</p>
  <p>But  Frederick Varian repulsed the offered caress and said, sternly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want no affection from a wilful, disobedient child! Give me your word, Betty,  to respect my wishes, and I&rsquo;ll always be glad of your loving ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Betty was angry now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give you no such promise! I shall conduct myself as I please with my friends  and my acquaintances. You know me well enough to know that I never do anything  that is in bad form or in bad taste. If I choose to flirt with the young men,  or even, as you call it, encourage them, I propose to do so! And I resent your  interference, and I deny your right to forbid me in such matters. And, too,  I&rsquo;ll go so far as to warn you that if you persist in this queer attitude you&rsquo;ve  taken,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be sorry! Remember that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Betty&rsquo;s  eyes flashed, but she was quiet rather than excited.</p>
  <p>Varian  himself was nervous and agitated. His fingers clenched and his lips trembled  with the intensity of his feelings and as Betty voiced her rebellious thoughts  he stared at her in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you two quarreling about?&rdquo; came  the surprised accents of Mrs Varian as she came out through the French window  from the library and looked curiously at them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mother,&rdquo; Betty cried, &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s gone nutty! He says I never can marry anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense, Fred&rdquo;; she did not take it at all seriously. &ldquo;Of course, Betty will  marry some day, but not yet. Don&rsquo;t bother about it at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Daddy&rsquo;s bothering very much about it at present. At least, he&rsquo;s bothering  me,&mdash;don&rsquo;t let little Betty be bothered, Mummy,&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  her alone, Fred. Why do you tease the child? I declare you two are always at  odds over something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Minna, that&rsquo;s not so. I always indulge Betty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, after I&rsquo;ve coaxed you to do so. You&rsquo;re an unnatural father, Fred, you seem  possessed to frown on all Betty&rsquo;s innocent pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want her getting married and going off and leaving us&mdash;&rdquo; he growled, still  looking angry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the baby isn&rsquo;t even engaged yet,&mdash;don&rsquo;t begin to worry. And, too, that is in the  mother&rsquo;s province.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  entirely. I rather guess a father has some authority!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, if it&rsquo;s exercised with loving care and discretion. Don&rsquo;t you bother,  Betty, anyway. Father and mother will settle this little argument by  ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather settle it with Dad,&rdquo; Betty declared spiritedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too ridiculous for  him to take the stand that I shall never marry! I&rsquo;m willing to promise not to  become engaged without asking you both first; I&rsquo;m willing to say I won&rsquo;t marry  a man you can convince me is unworthy; I&rsquo;m willing to promise anything in  reason,&mdash;but a blind promise never to marry is too much to ask of any girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, it is!&rdquo; agreed Mrs Varian. &ldquo;Why do you talk to her like that, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I propose to have my own way for once! I&rsquo;ve given in to you two in every  particular for twenty years or more. Now, I assert myself. I say Betty shall  not marry, and I shall see to it that she does not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my heavens!&rdquo; and Mrs Varian wrung her hands, with a wail of nervous pettishness,  &ldquo;sometimes, Fred, I think you&rsquo;re crazy! At any rate, you&rsquo;ll set me crazy, if  you talk like that! Do stop this quarrel anyhow. Kiss and make up, won&rsquo;t you?  To think of you two, the only human beings on earth that I care a rap for,  acting like this! My husband and my child! The only things I live for! The  apple of my eye, the core of my soul, both of you,&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see how you  distress me when you are at odds! And you&rsquo;re always at odds! Always squabbling  over some little thing. But, heretofore, you&rsquo;ve always laughed and agreed,  finally. Now forget this foolishness,&mdash;do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t foolishness,&rdquo; and Varian set his lips together, doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t foolishness,&rdquo; said Betty quietly, but with a look of indomitable  determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  stop it, at any rate,&rdquo; begged Mrs Varian, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t I shall go into  hysterics,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s time now for the Herberts to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now  both Fred and Betty knew that a suggestion of hysterics was no idle threat, for  Minna Varian could achieve the most annoying demonstrations of that sort at a  moment&rsquo;s notice. And it was quite true that the expected guests were imminent.</p>
  <p>But  no truce was put into words, for just then a party of three people came in  sight and neared the veranda steps.</p>
  <p>The  three were Frederick Varian&rsquo;s brother Herbert and his wife and daughter. This  family was called the Herberts to distinguish them from the Frederick Varian  household.</p>
  <p>The  daughter, Eleanor, was a year or two younger than Betty, and the girls were  friendly, though of widely differing tastes; the brothers Varian were much  alike; but the two matrons were as opposite as it is possible for two women to  be. Mrs Herbert was a strong character, almost strong-minded. She had no  patience with her sister-in-law&rsquo;s nerves or hysterical tendencies. It would  indeed be awkward if the Herberts were to arrive in the midst of one of Mrs  Frederick&rsquo;s exhibitions of temperamental disturbance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful  place!&rdquo; exclaimed Herbert Varian as they ascended the steps to the verandah.  &ldquo;Great, old boy! I never saw anything like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds  me of the Prisoner of Chillon or the Castle of Otranto or&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs Herbert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Climbing  that steep path reminded me of the Solitary Horseman,&rdquo; Herbert interrupted his  wife. &ldquo;Whew! let me sit down! I&rsquo;m too weighty a person to visit your castled  crag of Drachenfels very often! Whew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Uncle Herbert,&rdquo; cooed Betty; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an awful long, steep pull, isn&rsquo;t it? Get  your breath, and I&rsquo;ll get you some nice, cool fruit punch. Come on, Eleanor,  help me; the servants are gone to the circus,&mdash;every last one of &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I thought you were having a party here this afternoon,&rdquo; Eleanor said, as she  went with Betty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a party, a picnic. They&rsquo;re the proper caper up here. And only a little one. The  baskets are all ready, and the men carry them,&mdash;then we go to a lovely picnic  place,&mdash;not very far,&mdash;and we all help get the supper. You see, up here, if you  don&rsquo;t let the servants go off skylarking every so often, they leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think they would!&rdquo; exclaimed Eleanor, earnestly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to leave  now! How do you stand it, Betty? I think it&rsquo;s fearful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing you&rsquo;d like, I know. Put those glasses on that tray,  will you, Nell? But I love this wild, craggy place, it&rsquo;s like an eagle&rsquo;s eyrie,  and I adore the solitude,&mdash;especially as there are plenty of people, and a golf  club and an artist colony and all sorts of nice things in easy distance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean that little village or settlement we came through on the way from the  station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and a few of their choicest inhabitants are coming up this afternoon for our  picnic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  sounds better,&rdquo; Eleanor sighed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d never want to stay here. Is Rod  Grannis here? Is that why you came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Nell. Don&rsquo;t mention Rod&rsquo;s name, at least, not before Father. You see, Dad&rsquo;s  down on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down  on Rod! Why for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  because he&rsquo;s too fond of little Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is? Rod or your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Betty  laughed. &ldquo;Both of &rsquo;em! But, I mean, Dad is down on any young man who&rsquo;s  specially interested in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know. So is my father. I don&rsquo;t let it bother me. Fathers are all like that.  Most of the girls I know say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it&rsquo;s a fatherly failing; but Dad is especially rabid on the subject.  There you take the basket of cakes and I&rsquo;ll carry the tray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was nearly five o&rsquo;clock when the picnic party was finally ready to start for  its junketing.</p>
  <p>Mrs  Blackwood had arrived, bringing her two promised young men, Ted Landon and John  Clark.</p>
  <p>Rearrayed  in picnic garb, the house guests were ready for the fun, and the Frederick  Varians were getting together and looking over the baskets of supper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we could only have kept one helper by us,&rdquo; bemoaned Minna Varian, her speech  accompanied by her usual wringing of her distressed hands. &ldquo;I begged Kelly to  stay but he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  circus is here only one day, you know, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; Landon told her, &ldquo;and I  fancy every servant in Headland Harbor has gone to it. But command me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  we will,&rdquo; put in Betty; &ldquo;carry this, please, and, Uncle Herbert, you take this  coffee paraphernalia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Divided  among the willing hands, the luggage was not too burdensome, and the cavalcade  prepared to start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  fear of burglars, I take it,&rdquo; said Herbert, as his brother closed the front  door and shook it to be sure it was fastened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit,&rdquo; and Frederick Varian took up his own baskets. &ldquo;No one can possibly  reach this house, save through that gate down by the lodge. And that is locked.  Also the windows and doors of the house are all fastened. So if you people have  left jewelry on your dressing tables, don&rsquo;t be alarmed, you&rsquo;ll find it there on  your return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  aboard!&rdquo; shouted Landon, and they started, by twos or threes, but in a moment  were obliged to walk single file down the steep and narrow path.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my heavens!&rdquo; cried Betty, suddenly, &ldquo;I must go back! I&rsquo;ve forgotten my camera.  Let me take your key, Father, I&rsquo;ll run and get it in a minute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go and get it for you, Betty,&rdquo; said Varian, setting down his burden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Dad, you can&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s in a closet, behind a lot of other things, and you&rsquo;d upset  the whole lot into a dreadful mess. I know you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me go, Miss Varian,&rdquo; offered several of the others, but Betty was insistent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one can get it but myself,&mdash;at least, not without a lot of delay and trouble.  Give me the key, Father, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Betty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  give her the key, Fred!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t torment the child! I  believe you enjoy teasing her! There, take the key, Betty, and run along.  Hurry, do, for it&rsquo;s annoying to have to wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me go with you,&rdquo; asked John Clark, but Betty smiled a refusal and ran off  alone.</p>
  <p>Most  of them watched the lithe, slight figure, as she bounded up the rugged,  irregular steps, sometimes two of them at a time, and at last they saw her  fitting the key into the front door.</p>
  <p>She  called back a few words, but the distance was too great for them to hear her  clearly, although they could see her.</p>
  <p>She  waved her hand, smilingly, and disappeared inside the house, leaving the door  wide open behind her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Extraordinary  place!&rdquo; Herbert Varian said, taking in the marvelous crag from this new  viewpoint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must see it from the clubhouse,&rdquo; said Landon; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you all come here tomorrow  afternoon, on my invite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  see,&rdquo; Mrs Varian smiled at him, for it was impossible not to like this frank,  good-looking youth.</p>
  <p>The  conversation was entirely of the wonders and beauties of Headland House, until  at last, Mrs Blackwood said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that child gone a long while? I could have  found half a dozen cameras by this time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a long time,&rdquo; Frederick Varian said, frowning; &ldquo;I was just thinking that  myself. I think I&rsquo;ll go after her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said his wife, nervously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get into an argument with her, and  never get back! Let her alone,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be here in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the minutes went by, and Betty didn&rsquo;t reappear in the open doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what she&rsquo;s up to,&rdquo; and Frederick Varian shook his head, in annoyance.</p>
  <p>Whereupon  Mrs Frederick began to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Fred, stop,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Herbert, you go up to the house and tell Betty to come  along. If she can&rsquo;t find her camera, tell her to come without it. I wish we had  a megaphone so we could call her. Go on, Herbert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay  where you are, Herbert,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;I shall go. It&rsquo;s all right, Minna,  I won&rsquo;t tease the child,&mdash;I promise you. It&rsquo;s all right, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  kissed his wife lightly on the brow, and started off at a swinging pace up the  rocky flight of steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  fetch her,&rdquo; he called back, as he proceeded beyond hearing distance. &ldquo;Chirk up,  Minna, Janet; tell her I shan&rsquo;t abuse Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does he mean by that?&rdquo; asked Mrs Herbert of Mrs Frederick, as she repeated the  message.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing,&rdquo; and Mrs Frederick clasped her hands resignedly. &ldquo;Only you know how  Betty and her father are always more or less at odds. I don&rsquo;t know why it  is,&mdash;they&rsquo;re devoted to each other, yet they&rsquo;re always quarreling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; and her sister-in-law smiled. &ldquo;I know them both, and they&rsquo;re  an ideal father and daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    The Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>Doctor  Herbert Varian stood slightly apart from the rest of the group, his observant  eyes taking in all the details of the peculiar situation of his brother&rsquo;s  house. His eye traversed back over the short distance they had already come,  and he saw a narrow, winding and exceedingly steep path. At intervals it was a  succession of broken, irregular steps, rocky and sharp-edged. Again, it would  be a fairly easy, though stony footway. But it led to the house, and had no  branch or side track in any direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  and everybody that comes to this house has to come by this path?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Minna Varian, and added, complainingly, &ldquo;a most disagreeable arrangement.  All the servants and tradespeople have to use it as well as ourselves and our  guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  could be remedied,&rdquo; suggested Varian, &ldquo;a branch, say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  never do it,&rdquo; said Minna, sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the place well enough to buy  it, though that is what Fred has in mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t buy it,&rdquo; advised her brother-in-law. &ldquo;I see nothing in its favor except  its wonderful beauty and strange, weird charm. That&rsquo;s a good deal, I admit, but  not enough for a comfortable summer home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned and gazed out over the open sea. From the high headland the view was  unsurpassable. The few nearby boats seemed lost in the great expanse of waters.  Some chugging motor boats and a dozen or so sailing craft ventured not very far  from shore. North, along the Maine coast, he saw only more rocky promontories  and rockbound inlets.</p>
  <p>Turning  slowly toward the South, he saw the graceful curve of Headland Harbor, with its  grouped village houses and spreading array of summer cottages.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw anything finer,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I almost think, Minna, after all, you  would be wise to buy the place, and then, arrange to make it more getatable. A  continuous flight of strong wooden steps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  spoil the whole thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Claire Blackwood. &ldquo;Oh, Doctor Varian, don&rsquo;t  propose anything like that! We Harborers love this place, just as it is, and we  would defend it against any such innovations. I think there&rsquo;s a law about  defacing natural scenery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  bother,&rdquo; said Minna, carelessly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never do anything of the sort. I won&rsquo;t  agree to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; said her sister-in-law. &ldquo;This is no place to bring up Betty. The girl  has no real society here, no advantages, no scope. She&rsquo;ll become a savage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Betty,&rdquo; Minna Varian laughed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s outdoor-loving and all that, but she has  nothing of the barbarian in her. I think she&rsquo;d like to go to a far gayer  resort. But her father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is her father?&rdquo; asked Doctor Varian, impatiently. &ldquo;It will be dark before we  get to our picnic. Why don&rsquo;t they come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave a loud view-halloo, but only the echoes from the rocky heights answered  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew it!&rdquo; and Minna Varian began to wring her hands. &ldquo;He and Betty are quarreling,&mdash;I  am sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Min? What&rsquo;s this quarreling business about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  always done it,&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing new. They adore each other, but they&rsquo;re eternally  disagreeing and fighting it out. They&rsquo;re quite capable of forgetting all about  us, and arguing out some foolish subject while we sit here waiting for them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go and stir them up,&rdquo; the doctor said, starting in the direction of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, Herbert. It&rsquo;s a hard climb, and you&rsquo;ve enough walking ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go,&rdquo; and Ted Landon looked inquiringly at Mrs Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll surely appear in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  they all waited a few minutes longer and then Janet Varian spoke up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it&rsquo;s a shame to keep us here like this. Go on up to the house, Mr Landon,  do. Tell those two foolish people that they must come on or the picnic will  proceed without them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Ted, and began sprinting over the rocks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going, too,&rdquo; and Claire Blackwood followed Landon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  may as well all go, and have our picnic on our own verandah,&rdquo; said Minna,  complainingly, and though Doctor Varian would have preferred that to any  further exertions, he did not say so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  always like this,&rdquo; Minna&rsquo;s querulous voice went on; &ldquo;whenever we start to go  anywhere, somebody has to go back for something and they&rsquo;re so slow and so  inconsiderate of other people&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  they go,&rdquo; interrupted Doctor Varian as the two latest emissaries went up over  the rocks. &ldquo;Now the house will swallow them up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Herbert, don&rsquo;t say such awful things,&rdquo; wailed Minna; &ldquo;you sound positively  creepy! I have a feeling of fear of that house anyway,&mdash;I believe it would like  to swallow people up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ought  we to intrude?&rdquo; Claire Blackwood laughingly asked of Landon, as they neared the  house; &ldquo;if Betty and her father want to quarrel, they ought to be allowed to do  so in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, if they insist, we&rsquo;ll go away again, and let them have it out comfortably.  Queer thing, for Daughter and Dad to make a habit of scrapping!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take Mrs Varian&rsquo;s statements with a grain of salt,&rdquo; said Claire, sagely. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not awfully well balanced, that woman, and I doubt if Betty and her father are  half as black as they&rsquo;re painted. Shall we ring the bell or walk right in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this question needed no answer, for as they mounted the steps of the verandah  and neared the open front door, they were confronted by the sight of Mr  Frederick Varian sprawled at full length on the floor of the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  heavens, what is the matter?&rdquo; cried Claire; &ldquo;the man has had a stroke or  something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Landon  went nearer, and with a grave face, stooped down to the prostrate figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Claire,&rdquo;  he whispered, looking up at her with a white face, &ldquo;Claire, this man is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  No,&mdash;no! it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is,&mdash;I&rsquo;m almost certain,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d better touch him,&mdash;or, should I? It  can do no harm to feel for his heart,&mdash;no, it is not beating,&mdash;what does it mean?  Where&rsquo;s Miss Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  quickly, Mr Landon, what we ought to do.&rdquo; Claire Blackwood spoke earnestly, and  tried to pull herself together. &ldquo;We must be careful to do the right thing. I  should say, before we even think of Miss Betty we should call Doctor Varian up  here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very thing! Will you call him, or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Considerately,  Landon gave her her choice.</p>
  <p>With  a shuddering glance at the still figure, Claire said, &ldquo;You call him, but let me  go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  stepped out on the veranda, and Landon waved his hand at the group of waiting  people below him.</p>
  <p>Then  he beckoned, but no one definitely responded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have to shout,&rdquo; Ted said, with a regretful look. &ldquo;Somehow I hate to,&mdash;&rdquo; the  presence of death seemed to restrain him.</p>
  <p>But  of necessity, he called out, &ldquo;Doctor Varian,&mdash;come here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  distance was almost too far for his voice to carry, but because of his  imperative gestures, Herbert Varian said: &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to go. Lord! What  can be the trick they&rsquo;re trying to cut up? I vow I won&rsquo;t come back here! I&rsquo;ll  eat my picnic in your dining-room, Minna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you like,&rdquo; she returned, indifferently. &ldquo;I hate picnics, anyway. But for  goodness&rsquo; sake, Herbert, do one thing or the other. If you&rsquo;d really rather not  go to the woods, take your baskets, and we&rsquo;ll all go back to the house. It&rsquo;s  getting late, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a bit,&rdquo; counseled the doctor. &ldquo;You people stay here, till I go up to the house,  and see what&rsquo;s doing. Then if I beckon you, come along back, all of you. If I  don&rsquo;t break my neck getting up there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go, Father,&rdquo; begged Eleanor; &ldquo;let me go. What in the world can they want of  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  go. I suppose there&rsquo;s a leak in the pipes or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herbert  Varian went off at a gait that belied his recalcitrant attitude, and as he  neared the house, he could see the white faces and grave air of the two that  awaited him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the great idea?&rdquo; he called out, cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  serious matter, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; replied Landon. &ldquo;An accident, or sudden illness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  the doctor took the remaining steps at a bound. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer, Landon conducted him inside the hall, and in an instant Varian was on  his knees beside the stricken man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; he said, in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;Frederick&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stroke?&rdquo; asked Landon, while Claire Blackwood stood by, unable to speak at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  man, no! Shot! See the blood,&mdash;shot through the heart. What does it&mdash;what can it  mean? Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Claire spoke now. &ldquo;Doctor Varian, are you sure he&rsquo;s dead? Can  nothing be done to save him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  He died almost instantly, from internal hemorrhage. But how unbelievable! How  impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  shot him?&rdquo; Landon burst out, impetuously; &ldquo;or,&mdash;is it suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  the pistol?&rdquo; said the doctor, looking about.</p>
  <p>Both  men searched, Landon trying to overcome his repugnance to such close association  with the dead, but no weapon of any sort could be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t see it,&mdash;&rdquo; Varian wiped his perspiring brow. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any solution.  But, this won&rsquo;t do. We must get the others up here. Oh, heavens, what shall we  do with Minna?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me go down, and take her home with me,&rdquo; suggested Claire Blackwood, eager to do  anything that might help or ease the coming disclosure of the tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;&rdquo; demurred Varian. &ldquo;You see, she&rsquo;s got to know,&mdash;of course, she  must be told at once,&mdash;and then,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll have to look after Betty,&mdash;where is the  child? Anyway, my wife is a tower of strength,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be able to manage Mrs  Varian,&mdash;even if she has violent hysterics,&mdash;which, of course, she will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Command  me, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; said Landon. &ldquo;I will do whatever you advise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right; I&rsquo;ll be glad of your assistance. Suppose you go back to the people down  there on the rocks, and then,&mdash;let me see,&mdash;suppose you tell my wife first what  has happened; then, ask her to break the news to Mrs Varian,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll know how  best to do it. Then,&mdash;oh, Lord,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what then! They&rsquo;ll have to come  back here,&mdash;I suppose,&mdash;what else can they do? I don&rsquo;t know, Mrs Blackwood, but  your idea of taking Mrs Varian away with you is a good one. If she&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Claire, decidedly, &ldquo;if she knows the truth. If I take her,  it&rsquo;ll have to be on some false pretense,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  do,&rdquo; said Varian, briefly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got no right to keep her in ignorance of her  husband&rsquo;s death. No; she must be told. That girl of mine, too,&mdash;Eleanor, she  hasn&rsquo;t her mother&rsquo;s poise,&mdash;she&rsquo;s likely to go to pieces,&mdash;always does, in the  presence of death. Oh, what a moil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  another thing,&rdquo; said Landon, a little hesitantly. &ldquo;What about the authorities?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;yes,&mdash;&rdquo;  the doctor spoke impatiently, &ldquo;I thought of that,&mdash;who are they, in this  God-forsaken place? Town Constable, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know myself,&rdquo; said Landon. &ldquo;County Sheriff, more likely. But Clark&rsquo;s a  good, sensible sort. Say we send him down to the village&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  must it be known down there right away?&rdquo; cried Claire. &ldquo;Before even Mrs Varian  is told! Or Betty. Where is Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  is somewhere in the house,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian in a low voice. &ldquo;We know that.  Now, let that question rest, till we decide on our first move. I think, Landon,  you&rsquo;d better do as I said. Go and tell my wife, and, while she&rsquo;s telling Mrs  Varian and my daughter, Eleanor, you can take Mr Clark aside and tell him.  Then,&mdash;then, I think, you&rsquo;d all better come back here to the house. We&rsquo;ll send  Clark on that errand later,&mdash;or, we can telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Landon  started on his difficult descent and on his even more difficult errand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you,&mdash;can&rsquo;t you put Mr Varian somewhere&mdash;somewhere&mdash;&ldquo; Claire began, incoherently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not supposed to move a body until the authorities give permission,&rdquo; said Doctor  Varian, slowly. &ldquo;It would seem to me, that in this very peculiar and unusual  case, that I might,&mdash;but, that&rsquo;s just it. I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&mdash;and the very  mysteriousness of this thing, makes it most necessary for me to be unusually  circumspect. Why, Mrs Blackwood, have you any idea what we have ahead of us? I  can&rsquo;t think this mystery will be simple or easily explained. I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t dare think! Isn&rsquo;t there a phrase, &lsquo;that way madness lies&rsquo;? Well, it  recurs to me when I let myself think! No,&mdash;I won&rsquo;t think,&mdash;and I beg of you,  don&rsquo;t question me! I&rsquo;m not a hysterical woman,&mdash;but there are times when a man  feels as if hysterics might be a relief!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let&rsquo;s not think,&mdash;&rdquo; said Claire, tactfully, &ldquo;but let me try to be helpful. If  Mrs Varian is coming here,&mdash;do you advise that we&mdash;cover&mdash;Mr Varian with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a sheet, I suppose,&mdash;do you know where to find one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;ve never been upstairs,&mdash;and then, after all, isn&rsquo;t a sheet even more gruesome  than the sight as it is at present? How about a dark cover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&mdash;find one.&rdquo; The Doctor spoke absorbedly, uncaring.</p>
  <p>Glancing  about, Claire noticed a folded steamer rug, on the end of the big davenport in  the hall, and fetching that, she laid it lightly over the still form.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  about Betty,&mdash;&rdquo; said the doctor, coming out of his brown study. &ldquo;She is in the  house,&mdash;probably hiding,&mdash;from fear,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you think that? Then let us find her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can&rsquo;t both go. Will you remain here and meet the others or shall I stay here  while you go to look for the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Claire  Blackwood pondered. Either suggestion was too hard for her to accept.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t,&mdash;&rdquo; she said, at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a coward, I suppose,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t search this  great, empty house,&mdash;for Betty. And, if she were in it, she would surely come  here to us,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor  Varian looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;You stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Claire grasped his arm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that either. Oh, Doctor Varian, stay here  with me! Think,&mdash;these are not my people,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sympathetic, of course, but, I&rsquo;m  terrified,&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing to fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help that,&mdash;I won&rsquo;t stay here alone. If you leave me, I shall run down the  path to meet them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll have to stay here. Very well, Mrs Blackwood, they&rsquo;ll arrive in a few  moments,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll wait for them together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then Varian again fell to ruminating, and Claire Blackwood, sick with her own  thoughts, said no word.</p>
  <p>At  last they heard footsteps, and looked out to see the little procession headed  by the two sisters-in-law.</p>
  <p>Janet  Varian was half supporting Minna, but her help was not greatly needed, for the  very violence of Minna&rsquo;s grief and fright gave her a sort of supernormal  strength and she walked uprightly and swiftly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Frederick?&rdquo; she demanded, in a shrill voice as she came up the steps,&mdash;&ldquo;and  where&rsquo;s Betty? Where&rsquo;s my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice rose to a shriek on the last words, and Doctor Varian took her by the  arm, giving her his undivided attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful now, Minna,&rdquo; he said, kindly but decidedly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t lose your grip.  You&rsquo;ve a big trouble to face,&mdash;and do try, dear, to meet it bravely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  brave enough, Herbert, don&rsquo;t worry about that. Where&rsquo;s Fred, I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;  was the brief reply, and Varian led her to her husband&rsquo;s body.</p>
  <p>As  he had fully expected, she went into violent hysterics. She cried, she screamed,  then her voice subsided to a sort of low, dismal wailing, only to break out  afresh with renewed shrieks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it&rsquo;s better that she should do this, than to control herself,&rdquo; the Doctor said;  &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll soon exhaust herself at this rate, and may in that way become more  tractable. I wish we could get her to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can,&rdquo; responded his wife, promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after that. Give a look at  Eleanor, Herbert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  harassed doctor turned his attention to his daughter, who was controlling  herself, but who was trembling piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  girl,&rdquo; said her father, taking her in his arms. &ldquo;Buck up, Nell, dear. Dad&rsquo;s got  a whole lot on his shoulders, and my, how it will help if you don&rsquo;t keel over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Eleanor tried to smile.</p>
  <p>Claire  Blackwood approached the pair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Varian,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;suppose I take your daughter home with me for the night,&mdash;or  longer, if she&rsquo;ll stay. It might relieve you and your wife of a little care,  and I&rsquo;ll be good to her, I promise you. And, if I may, I&rsquo;d like to go now. I can&rsquo;t  be of any service here, can I? And as Miss Eleanor can&rsquo;t either, what do you  think of our going now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very good idea, Mrs Blackwood,&rdquo; and the doctor&rsquo;s face showed grateful appreciation.  &ldquo;Take one of the young men with you, and leave the other here to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  take John Clark,&rdquo; Claire decided, &ldquo;and Ted Landon will, I know, be glad to  stand by you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  three departed, and then the sisters-in-law left the room and went upstairs,  Minna making no resistance to Janet&rsquo;s suggestions.</p>
  <p>Left  alone with the dead, Doctor Varian and young Landon looked at each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it all mean?&rdquo; asked the younger man, a look of absolute bewilderment on  his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; returned the other, slowly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a pretty awful  situation. Now the women are gone, I&rsquo;ll speak out the thing that troubles me  most. Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?  Miss Varian? Why, yes, where is she? She came for her camera, you know.  She&mdash;why, she must be in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must be,&mdash;that is,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see any alternative. I understand there&rsquo;s no way out  of this house, save down the path we took.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  other, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  if the girl&rsquo;s in the house,&mdash;she must be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;&rdquo;  and Landon saw the terrible fear in the other&rsquo;s eyes, and his own glance  responded. &ldquo;Shall we search the rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  must be done. Now, I&rsquo;m not willing to leave the body of my brother unattended.  Will you watch by it, while I run over the house, or the other way about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do as you prefer I should, Doctor Varian,&mdash;but if you give me a choice, I&rsquo;ll  stay here. I&rsquo;ve never been in the house before, and I don&rsquo;t know the rooms.  However, I want to be frank,&mdash;and, the truth is, I&rsquo;d rather not make that  search,&mdash;even if I did know the rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand, Mr Landon, and I don&rsquo;t blame you. I&rsquo;ve never been in the house before  either,&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t at all like the idea of the search, but it must be  made,&mdash;and made at once, and it&rsquo;s my place to do it. So, then, if you&rsquo;ll remain  here, I&rsquo;ll go the rounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ted  Landon nodded silently, and sat down to begin the vigil he had been asked to  keep.</p>
  <p>Herbert  Varian went first upstairs to Minna&rsquo;s room, and opening the door softly,  discovered the widow was lying quietly on her bed. Janet, sitting by, placed a  warning forefinger against her lip, and seeing that the patient was quiet,  Varian noiselessly closed the door and tiptoed away.</p>
  <p>He  stood a moment in the second story hall, looking upward at a closed door, to  which a narrow and winding staircase would take him.</p>
  <p>Should  he go up there,&mdash;or search the two lower stories first? He looked out of a  window at the foot of the little stair.</p>
  <p>It  gave West, and afforded no view of the sea. But the wild and inaccessible rocks  which he saw, proved to him finally that there was no way of approach to this  lonely house, save by that one and only path he had already climbed. He sighed,  for this dashed his last hope that Betty might have left the house on some  errand or some escapade before her father had reached it.</p>
  <p>With  vague forebodings and a horrible sinking at his heart, he began to ascend the  turret stair.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    The Search</b></h2>
  <p>Doctor  Herbert Varian was a man accustomed to responsibilities; more, he was  accustomed to the responsibilities of other people as well as his own. Yet it  seemed to him that the position in which he now found himself was more appalling  than anything he had ever before experienced, and that it was liable to grow  worse rather than better with successive developments.</p>
  <p>Varian  had what has been called &ldquo;the leaping mind,&rdquo; and without being unduly  apprehensive, he saw trouble ahead, such as he shuddered to think about. His  brother dead, there was the hysterical widow to be cared for. And Betty in  hiding&mdash;</p>
  <p>He  paused, his hand on the latch of the door at the top of the stair.</p>
  <p>Then,  squaring his shoulders, he shook off his hesitation and opened the door.</p>
  <p>He  found himself in a small turret room, from which he went on to other rooms on  that floor. They were, for the most part, quite evidently unoccupied bedrooms,  but two gave signs of being in use by servants.</p>
  <p>Varian  paid little heed to his surroundings, but went rapidly about hunting for the  missing girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty,&mdash;&rdquo;  he called, softly; &ldquo;Betty, dear, where are you? Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&mdash;Uncle Herbert  will take care of you. Come, Betty, come out of hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  there was no answer to his calls. He flung open cupboard doors, he peered into  dark corners and alcoves, but he saw no trace of any one, nor heard any sound.</p>
  <p>Two  other tiny staircases led up to higher turrets, but these were empty, and  search as he would he found no Betty, nor any trace of her.</p>
  <p>Unwilling  to waste what might be valuable time, Doctor Varian went downstairs again.</p>
  <p>Then,  one after another, he visited all the rooms on the second floor but found no  sign of his niece.</p>
  <p>He  went again to the room where the women were and beckoned his wife outside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minna  is asleep?&rdquo; he asked, in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Janet replied, &ldquo;but, of course, only as an effect of that strong opiate you  gave her. She tosses and moans,&mdash;but, yes, she is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dread her waking. What <i>are</i> we to do  with her? And, Janet, where is Betty? I&rsquo;ve been all over these upper  floors,&mdash;and now I&rsquo;ll tackle the rooms downstairs, and the cellar. The girl must  be found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Herbert!  Did you ever know such a fearful situation? And&mdash;as to&mdash;Frederick&mdash;don&rsquo;t you have  to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, of course; the authorities must be called in. Don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t  realized that. But first of all we must find Betty&mdash;dead or alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that!&rdquo; Janet clutched at his arm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear any more horrors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  girl,&mdash;you may have to. Brace up, dear, I&rsquo;ve all I can do to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you have,&rdquo; his wife kissed him tenderly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I won&rsquo;t add  to your burdens, and I will help all I can. Thank heaven that kind woman took  Eleanor away with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but I daresay we ought to have kept them all here. There&rsquo;s crime to be  considered, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, they&rsquo;re gone,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad of it. You can get them back when necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s a mystery,&mdash;oh, what shall I do first? I never felt so absolutely unable to  cope with a situation. But the first thing is to hunt further for Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pursuant  of his clearest duty, Doctor Varian went on through the yet unsearched rooms,  on to the kitchen, and on down to the cellar. He made a hasty but careful  search, flinging open closets, cupboards and storerooms, and returned at last  to the hall where Ted Landon sat with folded arms, keeping his lonely vigil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine where Betty can be,&rdquo; and Varian sank wearily into a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must be in the house,&rdquo; said Landon, wonderingly, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s no way out,  except down the path where we all were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a back door, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean no way off the premises. Yes, there must be a back door&mdash;you know I&rsquo;ve  never been in this house before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  well, look here, Landon; the authorities must be notified; the local doctor  ought to be called in,&mdash;and all that. But first, I want to find Betty. Suppose I  stay here,&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I admit I&rsquo;m pretty tired,&mdash;and you take a look out around the  back door, and kitchen porch. By the way, the servants will be coming home soon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they were to stay out for the evening, I think Mrs Varian said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  those people who went back to the village will, of course, tell of the matter,  and soon we&rsquo;ll have all kinds of curious visitors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Doctor Varian, I&rsquo;ll do just what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  younger man went on his errand, and going through the kitchen, found the back  porch. To reach it he had to unlock the outside door, thus proving to his own  satisfaction that Betty had not gone out that way.</p>
  <p>But  he went out and looked about. He saw nothing indicative. The porch was pleasant  and in neat order. A knitting-bag and a much be-thumbed novel were evidently  the property of the cook or waitress, and an old cap on a nail was, doubtless,  the butler&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>He  took pains to ascertain that there was no path or road that led down to the  gate but the path that also went from the front door, and which he had been on  when Betty returned to the house.</p>
  <p>He  had seen her enter the house, had seen her father go in a few moments later,  now where was the girl?</p>
  <p>Back  to the kitchen Landon went, and in the middle of the floor, he noticed a yellow  cushion. It was a satin covered, embroidered affair, probably, he thought, a  sofa cushion, or hammock pillow, but it seemed too elaborate for a servant&rsquo;s  cushion. Surely it belonged to the family.</p>
  <p>The  kitchen was in tidy order, save for a tray of used glasses and empty plates  which was on a table.</p>
  <p>Landon  picked up the pillow,&mdash;and then, on second thoughts, laid it back where he had  found it. It might be evidence.</p>
  <p>An  open door showed the cellar stairs. Conquering a strong disinclination, Landon  went down. The cellar was large, and seemed to have various rooms and bins, and  some locked cupboards. But there was nothing sinister, the rooms were for the  most part fairly light, and the air was good.</p>
  <p>Remembering  that Doctor Varian had already searched down there for Betty, Landon merely  went over the same ground, and returned with the news of his unsuccessful  search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  way out?&rdquo; queried the doctor, briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,  except by passing the very spot where we all were when Betty ran back to the  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she, Landon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men stared at each other, both absolutely at a loss to answer the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  and Varian pulled himself together, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s a case for the  police,&mdash;how shall we get at them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know anything about the police, but if you telephone the inn or the  clubhouse they&rsquo;ll tell you. The local doctor is Merritt,&mdash;I know him. But he  couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Why call him when you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  customary, I think. You call Merritt, will you, and then I&rsquo;ll speak to the  innkeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  telephoning was just about completed, when a fearful scream from upstairs  announced the fact that Minna Varian had awakened from her opiate sleep and had  returned to a realization of her troubles.</p>
  <p>Slowly  Doctor Varian rose and went up the stairs.</p>
  <p>He  entered the bedroom to find Minna sitting up in bed, wild-eyed and struggling  to get up, while Janet urged her to lie still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie  still!&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;I will not. Come here, Herbert. Tell me,&mdash;where is my  child? Why is Betty not here? Is she dead, too? Tell me, I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Minna,&rdquo; Varian returned, quietly, &ldquo;I will tell you all I can. I do not know  where Betty is, but we&rsquo;ve no reason to think she is dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why doesn&rsquo;t she come to me? Why doesn&rsquo;t Fred come? Oh,&mdash;Fred is dead,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then the poor woman went into violent hysterics, now shrieking like a maniac  and now moaning piteously, like some hurt animal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first thing to do,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, decidedly, &ldquo;is to get a nurse for  Minna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  demurred his wife, &ldquo;not tonight, anyway. I&rsquo;ll take care of her, and there will  be some maid servant who can help me. There was a nice looking waitress among  those who went off this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  servants will surely return as soon as they hear the news,&rdquo; Varian said, and  then he gave all his attention to calming his patient.</p>
  <p>Again  he placed her under the influence of a powerful opiate, and by the time she was  unconscious, the local doctor had come.</p>
  <p>Varian  went down to find Doctor Merritt examining the body of his brother.</p>
  <p>The  two medical men met courteously, the local doctor assuming an important air,  principally because he considered the other his superior.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible  thing, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; Merritt said; &ldquo;death practically instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Practically,&rdquo;  returned the other. &ldquo;May have lived a few moments, but unconscious at once. You  know the sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Potter. He&rsquo;ll be along soon. He&rsquo;s a shrewd one,&mdash;but,&mdash;my heavens! Who did this  thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor  Merritt&rsquo;s formality gave way before his irrepressible curiosity. He looked from  Doctor Varian to Ted Landon and back again, with an exasperated air of  resentment at being told so little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know, Doctor Merritt,&rdquo; Landon said, as the other doctor said nothing.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  idea! A man shot and killed in this lonely, isolated house and you don&rsquo;t know  who did it? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a few words Varian detailed the circumstances, and added, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where  Miss Varian is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disappeared!  Then she must have shot her father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo; interrupted Landon, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say such an absurd thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else is there to say?&rdquo; demanded Merritt. &ldquo;You say there was nobody in the house  but those two people. Now, one is here dead, and the other is missing. What  else can be said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  accuse a defenseless girl,&mdash;&rdquo; advised Varian. &ldquo;Betty must be found, of course.  But I don&rsquo;t for a minute believe she shot her father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  the gun?&rdquo; asked Doctor Merritt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t  been found,&rdquo; returned Varian, briefly. &ldquo;Mrs Varian, my brother&rsquo;s wife, is  hysterical. I&rsquo;ve been obliged to quiet her by opiates. Doctor Merritt, this is  by no means a simple case. I hope your sheriff is a man of brains and  experience. It&rsquo;s going to call for wise and competent handling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Potter  is experienced enough. Been sheriff for years. But as to brains, he isn&rsquo;t  overburdened with them. Still, he&rsquo;s got good horse sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the best things to have,&rdquo; commented Varian. &ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t know that we need  keep Mr Landon here any longer. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Merritt, thoughtfully. &ldquo;He was here at the time of the&mdash;crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but so were several others, and they&rsquo;ve gone away. As you like, Mr Landon, but  I don&rsquo;t think you need stay unless you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do wish,&rdquo; Ted Landon said. &ldquo;I may be of use, somehow, and, too, I&rsquo;m deeply  interested. I want to see what the sheriff thinks about it, and, too, I want to  try to find or help to find Miss Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  must be found,&rdquo; said Varian, as if suddenly reminded of the fact. &ldquo;I am so  distracted between the shock of my brother&rsquo;s death and the anxiety regarding  his wife&rsquo;s condition, that for the moment I almost forgot Betty. That child  must be hiding somewhere. She must have been frightened in some fearful way,  and either fainted or run away and hid out in the grounds somewhere. I&rsquo;m  positive she isn&rsquo;t in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  couldn&rsquo;t have gone out the back door,&rdquo; said Landon. &ldquo;It was locked when I went  to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  couldn&rsquo;t have gone out at the front door or we should have seen her,&rdquo; Varian  added, &ldquo;She stepped out of a window, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you assuming some intruder?&rdquo; asked Merritt, wonderingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not assuming anything,&rdquo; returned Varian, a little crisply, for his nerves were  on edge. &ldquo;But Betty Varian must be found,&mdash;my duty is to the living as well as  to the dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glanced at his brother&rsquo;s body, and his face expressed a mute promise to care  for that brother&rsquo;s child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how are you going to find her?&rdquo; asked Landon. &ldquo;We saw Miss Varian enter this  house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore,  she is still in it,&mdash;or in the grounds,&rdquo; said Varian, positively. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be  otherwise. I shall hunt out of doors first, before it grows dusk. Then we can  hunt the house afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have hunted the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but it must be hunted more thoroughly. Why, Betty, or&mdash;Betty&rsquo;s body must be  somewhere. And must be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor  Merritt listened, dumfounded. Here was mystery indeed. Mr Varian dead,&mdash;shot,&mdash;no  weapon found, and his daughter missing.</p>
  <p>What  could be the explanation?</p>
  <p>The  hunt out of doors for Betty resulted in nothing at all. There was no kitchen  garden, merely a drying plot and a small patch of back yard, mostly stones and  hard ground. This was surrounded by dwarfed and stunted pine trees, which not  only afforded no hiding place, but shut off no possible nook or cranny where  Betty could be hidden. The whole tableland was exposed to view from all parts  of it, and it was clear to be seen that Betty Varian could not be hiding out of  doors.</p>
  <p>And  since she could not have left the premises, save by the road where the picnic  party was congregated, there was no supposition but that she was still in the  house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you form any theory, Doctor Varian?&rdquo; Landon asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t. Can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the obvious one,&mdash;that Miss Varian killed her father and then hid somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  where? Mind you, I don&rsquo;t for a moment admit she killed her father, that&rsquo;s too  ridiculous! But whoever killed him, may also have killed her. It is her body I  think we are more likely to find.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  then, did the assassin get away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not prepared to say there&rsquo;s no way out of this place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I know that to be the fact. There comes the sheriff, Doctor Varian. That&rsquo;s  Potter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  went into the house again, and found the sheriff and another man with him.</p>
  <p>Merritt  made the necessary introductions, and Doctor Varian looked at Potter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  strangest case you&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; he informed him, &ldquo;and the most important. How  do you propose to handle it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  I do all the others, by using my head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know, but I mean what help do you expect to have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno&rsquo;s  I&rsquo;ll need any yet. Haven&rsquo;t got the principal facts. Dead man&rsquo;s your brother,  ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shot  dead and no weapon around. Criminal unknown. Now, about this young lady,&mdash;the  daughter. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;but I hope you can find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then Doctor Varian told, in his straightforward way, of his search for the  girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mighty  curious,&rdquo; vouchsafed the sheriff, with an air of one stating a new idea. &ldquo;The  girl and her father on good terms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course,&rdquo; Varian answered, but his slight hesitation made the sheriff eye him  keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  want the truth, you know,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;If them two wasn&rsquo;t on good  terms, you might as well say so,&mdash;&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;ll come out sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they were,&mdash;so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, all right. I can&rsquo;t think yet, the girl shot her father. I won&rsquo;t think  that,&mdash;lessen I have to. But, good land, man, you say you&rsquo;ve looked all over the  house,&mdash;where&rsquo;s the murderer, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suicide?&rdquo;  laconically said the man who had come with the sheriff.</p>
  <p>It  was the first time he had spoken. He was a quiet, insignificant chap, but his  eyes were keen and his whole face alert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  be, Bill,&rdquo; said the sheriff, &ldquo;with no weapon about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  &rsquo;a&rsquo; been removed,&rdquo; the other said, in his brief way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whom?&rdquo; asked Doctor Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whoever came here first,&rdquo; Bill returned, looking at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came here first,&rdquo; Varian stated. &ldquo;Do you mean I removed the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  to look at all sides, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I didn&rsquo;t. But I won&rsquo;t take time, now, to enlarge on that plain statement. I&rsquo;ll  be here, you can question me, when and as often as you like. Now, Mr Potter,  what are you going to do first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  seems to me there&rsquo;s no more to be done with Mr Varian&rsquo;s body. You two doctors  have examined it, you know all about the wound that killed him. Bill, here, has  jotted down all the details of its position and all that. Now, I think you can  call in the undertakers and have the body taken away or kept here till the  funeral,&mdash;whichever you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  funeral!&rdquo; exclaimed Doctor Varian, realizing a further responsibility for his  laden shoulders. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d better arrange about that, for my sister-in-law  will not be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jest&rsquo;s  you like,&rdquo; said Potter. &ldquo;Next, I&rsquo;ll investigate for myself the absence of this  girl. A mysterious disappearance is as serious a matter as a mysterious  death,&mdash;maybe, more so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; agreed Varian. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to find my niece, for she must be  found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy  enough to say she must be found,&mdash;the trick is to find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any theory of the crime, Mr Potter?&rdquo; Landon asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theory?  No, I don&rsquo;t deal in theories. I may say it looks to me like the girl may have  shot her father, but it only looks that way because there&rsquo;s no other way, so  far, for it to look. You can&rsquo;t suspect a criminal that you ain&rsquo;t had any hint  of, can you? If anybody, now, turns up who&rsquo;s seen a man prowling round&mdash;or seen  any mysterious person, or if any servant is found who, say, didn&rsquo;t go to the  circus, but hung behind, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if there&rsquo;s any such, they or he must be in the house now,&rdquo; Bill said, quietly.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two started from the room and Landon, after a glance at Doctor Varian, followed  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Landon said to Potter as they went to the kitchen, &ldquo;why you folks  in authority always seem to think it necessary to take an antagonistic attitude  toward the people who are representing the dead man! You act toward Doctor  Varian as if you more than half suspected he had a hand in the crime himself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that, my boy,&rdquo; and Potter looked at him gravely; &ldquo;but that doctor brother knows  more than he&rsquo;s telling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not so! I know. I came up here to the house with him. I was with him when he  found his brother&rsquo;s body&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you were! Why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t ask me. No, I don&rsquo;t know anything more. I&rsquo;ve nothing to tell that can  throw any possible light, but I do know that Doctor Varian had no hand in it  and knows no more about it than I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  land, I don&rsquo;t mean that he killed his brother,&mdash;I know better than that. But he  wasn&rsquo;t frank about the relations between the girl and her father. Do you know  that they were all right? Friendly, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I know, they were. But I never met them until today. I can only say that  they acted like any normal, usual father and daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;ll all come out,&mdash;that sort of thing. Now to find  the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The Yellow Pillow</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this pillow doing here?&rdquo; the sheriff asked, as he picked up the yellow satin  cushion. &ldquo;This looks to me like a parlor ornament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it was strange, too,&rdquo; returned Landon. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see any clue in it,  can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  unusual may prove a clue,&rdquo; said Potter, sententiously. &ldquo;You never saw this  pillow before, Mr Landon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I&rsquo;m not familiar with the house at all. Maybe it&rsquo;s a discarded one, handed  down to the servants&rsquo; use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  look so; it&rsquo;s fresh and new, and very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lay  it aside and come on,&rdquo; growled Bill Dunn, who was alertly looking about the  kitchen. &ldquo;You can ask the family about that later. Let&rsquo;s go down cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  the cellar they went, Landon following. He had a notion that he might help the  family&rsquo;s interests by keeping at the heels of these detectives.</p>
  <p>But  the most careful search revealed nothing of importance to their quest.</p>
  <p>Until  Potter said, suddenly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  sure is,&rdquo; and Bill Dunn peered over an old well curb and looked down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  well in a cellar! How queer!&rdquo; exclaimed Landon. &ldquo;I never heard of such a  thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncommon,  but I&rsquo;ve known of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Bill &ldquo;Looks promising, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Potter  considered. &ldquo;It may mean something,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to  sound it, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sound  it, nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said the executive Bill; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  Potter asked him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bucket. It&rsquo;s probably a dried up well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly,&rdquo;  and Bill nodded. He already had one foot over the broken old well curb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried Landon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump down! You must have a light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  one,&rdquo; and Bill drew a small flashlight from his pocket.</p>
  <p>With  the agility of a monkey he clambered down the side of the old well. The stones  were large and not smoothly fitted, so that he had little trouble in gaining  and keeping his foothold.</p>
  <p>The  others watched him as he descended and at last reached the bottom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  at all,&rdquo; he called up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  an old dried up well,&rdquo; he reported, as he reached them again. &ldquo;Must &rsquo;a&rsquo; dried  up long ago. No water in it for years, most likely. But there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; else  down there, neither. No body, nor no clues of any sort. Whatever became of that  girl, she ain&rsquo;t down that well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  parts of the cellar were subjected to the same thorough search.</p>
  <p>Landon  was amazed at the quickness and efficiency shown by these men whom he had  thought rather stupid at first.</p>
  <p>Cupboards  were poked into to their furthest corners; bins were raked; boxes opened, and  Bill even climbed up to scan a swinging shelf that hung above his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  about secret passages?&rdquo; Potter asked, when they had exhausted all obvious  hiding places.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  been thinkin&rsquo; about that,&rdquo; Bill returned, musingly; &ldquo;but, so far, I can&rsquo;t see  where there could be any. This isn&rsquo;t the sort of house that has &rsquo;em, either.  It&rsquo;s straightforward architecture,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is,&mdash;straightforward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Landon, interested in this strange man who looked  so ignorant, yet was in some ways so well informed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, there&rsquo;s no unexpected juts or jambs. Everything&rsquo;s four-square, mostly.  You can see where the rooms above are,&mdash;you can see where the closets and stairs  fit in and all that. There&rsquo;s no concealed territory like,&mdash;no real chance for a  secret passage,&mdash;at least not so far&rsquo;s I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; agreed Potter. &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s the man when it comes to architecture and  building plans. Well,&mdash;let&rsquo;s get along upstairs, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Going  through the kitchen again, Potter picked up the yellow pillow and took it along  with him. Quite evidently it belonged to a sofa in the large, square front  hall. The upholstery fabric was the same, and there was a corresponding pillow  already at one end of the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer  thing,&rdquo; Potter said; &ldquo;how&rsquo;d that fine cushion get on the kitchen floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is queer,&rdquo; Landon assented, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t see any meaning in it, can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; returned Potter. &ldquo;Now, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; and he turned to the physician who  sat with bowed head beside his brother&rsquo;s body, &ldquo;I dessay the undertakers&rsquo;ll be  coming along soon. You see them and make plans for the funeral; while Bill and  I go on over this house. Then, we&rsquo;ll have to see the rest of the people who  were around at the time of the&mdash;the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Mrs Frederick Varian,&rdquo; said Herbert, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t see her. I forbid that, as her  physician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;ll see your wife first, and then, we&rsquo;ll have to see the folks that went back  to the village. And there&rsquo;s the servants to be questioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the careful and exhaustive search of the two inquiry agents failed to disclose  any sign of the missing Betty Varian or any clue to her whereabouts. They went  over the whole house, even into the bedroom of the newly-made widow,&mdash;whose deep  artificial sleep made this possible.</p>
  <p>This  was the last room they visited, and as they tiptoed out, Bill said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  saw such a case! No clue anywhere; not even mysterious circumstances.  Everything just as natural and commonplace as it can be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the yellow pillow,&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Potter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&mdash;but that may have some simple explanation,&mdash;housemaid took it out to clean  it,&mdash;or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Bill, there&rsquo;s got to be a secret passage; there&rsquo;s just got to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there ain&rsquo;t. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll sound the walls and all that sort of thing, but  I&rsquo;ve measured and estimated, and I vow there ain&rsquo;t no space unaccounted for in  this whole house. But there&rsquo;s a lot of questionin&rsquo; yet to be done. I&rsquo;ll say  there is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time some of the servants had heard of the affair and had returned.</p>
  <p>Potter  and Bill Dunn went to the kitchen to see them, and found Kelly the butler and  Hannah the cook in a scared, nervous state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  tell us, sir, all about it,&rdquo; Kelly begged, his hard face drawn with sympathy.  &ldquo;The master&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  true, Kelly, your master is dead. He was killed, and we are investigating. What  can you tell us? Do you know of anybody who had it in for Mr Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir! I&rsquo;m sure he hadn&rsquo;t an enemy in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, you can&rsquo;t be sure of that, my man. But tell me of the circumstances. When  you all went away, this afternoon, there was no sign of disturbance,&mdash;of  anything unusual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir. Everything was pleasant and proper. I had packed the luncheon for the  picnic, Hannah here made the sandwiches, and I filled the coffee Thermos, and  all such things. The baskets were all ready, and the family expected to start  on the picnic almost as soon as we went off. I offered to stay behind and help  Mrs Varian, but she was so kind as to say I needn&rsquo;t do that. So we all went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  went down the path that leads from the front door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no other way. It branches around to the kitchen entrance, up here, but there&rsquo;s  no other way off the premises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even for a burglar or robber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I don&rsquo;t believe even a monkey could scramble up the cliff, and I know a  man couldn&rsquo;t. You see it overhangs, and it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  coming from the other direction,&mdash;the village?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  that way, everybody has to pass through the lodge gate. The lodge, you  know,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the garage, as well. There&rsquo;s a gate here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  through that gate is the only way to get to this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  all the picnic party were waiting, in full view of that gate, and in full view  of the house. Yet somebody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t say somebody got in,&mdash;for nobody could do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say it. But I&rsquo;m looking out for some such person. If not, we must  conclude&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Miss Varian shot her father, and then,&mdash;in some yet undiscovered place, killed  herself, or still alive,&mdash;is in hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Betty kill her father!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah, the cook, speaking to the sheriff for  the first time. &ldquo;No, she never did that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  there was ill feeling between them,&rdquo; Potter returned, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  there was not! A more loving father and child I never met up with! Bless her  pretty face! To dare accuse darlin&rsquo; Miss Betty of such a thing! I say, now,  Mister Man, you better be careful how you say such lies around here! You know  you&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to go on, but your own black thoughts! You know you don&rsquo;t know  who killed the master, and you&rsquo;re too dumb to find out, and so you pick on that  poor dear angel child, who ain&rsquo;t here to speak up for herself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she, then? Where&rsquo;s Miss Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she? Belike in some hidin&rsquo; place, scared into fits because of seein&rsquo; her  father shot! Or maybe, stunned and unconscious herself,&mdash;the deed bein&rsquo; done by  the same villyun what did for the master! Oh, sakes! it&rsquo;s bad enough without  your makin&rsquo; it worse callin&rsquo; my darlin&rsquo; girl a murderer! Where&rsquo;s Mrs Varian?  What does she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  asleep. The doctor had to quiet her, she was in raving hysterics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  she would be. Poor lady. She&rsquo;ll be no help in this awful thing. And, sir,  another thing: The waitress and the chambermaid, they&rsquo;re sisters, Agnes and  Lena, they say they&rsquo;re not coming back here. Nothing would induce them to step  foot in this house again, they say. They bid me send &rsquo;em their things and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  they&rsquo;ll have to come back.&rdquo; This from Bill. &ldquo;Tell me where they are. I&rsquo;ll bring  them back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they won&rsquo;t come. They&rsquo;re going down to Boston tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to do that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  gone by now,&rdquo; and Hannah looked unconcerned. &ldquo;But never you mind, they know  nothin&rsquo; of this matter. They&rsquo;re two young scared girls, and they&rsquo;d be no good  to you nor anyone else. They know nothin&rsquo; to tell, and they&rsquo;d have worse hysterics  than Mrs Varian if you tried to bring &rsquo;em back to this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t desert Mrs Varian, will you, Hannah?&rdquo; asked Potter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll be leavin&rsquo; in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and the cook shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I  couldn&rsquo;t be expected to stay in such a moil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  of course you couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Potter, angrily. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care that poor  Mrs Varian is in deep trouble and sorrow! You don&rsquo;t care that there&rsquo;ll be  nobody to cook for her and her brother&rsquo;s family! You&rsquo;ve no sense of common  humanity,&mdash;no sympathy for grief, no heart in your stupid old body!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might stay on for a time, sir,&mdash;if&mdash;if they made it worth my while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  greed might keep you here! Kelly, what about you? Are you going to desert this  stricken household?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  stay for a time, sir,&rdquo; the butler said, quite evidently ill at ease. &ldquo;Now, you  mustn&rsquo;t blame us, Mr Potter for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do blame you! I know how you feel about a house where there&rsquo;s a mystery, but  also, you ought to be glad to do whatever you can to help. And nothing could  help poor Mrs Varian so much as to have some of her servants faithful to her.  Also, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I may promise you extra pay,&mdash;as I know that will hold  you, when nothing else will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; Bill Dunn put in, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better fix up a meal for those who want it. They  had no picnic supper, you see, and there are the guests to be considered as  well as your Mrs Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speakin&rsquo;  one word for them and two for yourself, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Hannah sniffed, as she  began to tie on her apron. &ldquo;Well, Mr Potter, you&rsquo;ll be welcome to a good meal,  I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Hannah,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;when you left here today, was there a sofa pillow  out here in the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sofy pillow? There was not. Why should such a thing be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  yellow satin one,&mdash;embroidered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Off  the hall sofy? No, sir, it never was in my kitchen at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know about it?&rdquo; Dunn turned to the butler. &ldquo;When did you last see the  sofa pillows on the hall sofa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kelly  stared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw them this morning, sir,&mdash;yes, and I saw them this afternoon,&mdash;when I set the  picnic baskets out. I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you happen to notice the pillows, Kelly?&rdquo; Bill watched him closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I didn&rsquo;t exactly notice them,&mdash;but,&mdash;well, if they hadn&rsquo;t been in place I should  have noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; Dunn gave a satisfied nod. The pillow episode seemed important to him,  though he could get no meaning to it as yet. &ldquo;Now Kelly, tell me the truth.  When you&rsquo;ve been around, in the dining room, or the living rooms, haven&rsquo;t you  heard conversations between Miss Varian and her father that showed some  friction between the two?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  now, sir, Miss Betty&rsquo;s a saucy piece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean gay chaff,&mdash;I mean real, downright quarreling. Did you ever hear any  of that? Tell me the truth, Kelly, you&rsquo;ll serve no good purpose by trying to  shield either of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, yes, sir, I did,&mdash;and often. But not to say exactly quarreling,&mdash;more like  argufying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that, Kelly? They do quarrel,&mdash;all the time they quarrel,&mdash;and you  know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  astonishing speech was from the lips of Minna Varian, who suddenly appeared in  the kitchen doorway.</p>
  <p>She  was smiling a little, she looked tired and wan, but she was in no way excited  or hysterical. She wore a trailing blue wrapper, and her hair was falling from  its combs and hairpins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Varian!&rdquo; exclaimed Potter, springing to her side. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard voices and I wondered who was down here. Where are my people? Who are you  two strange men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there,&rdquo; said Hannah, advancing and putting an arm round her mistress, &ldquo;let me  take you back to your room. Come now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a minute,&rdquo; and Potter looked keenly at the lady. &ldquo;Say that again, Mrs Varian.  Your daughter quarrels with her father often?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the time,&rdquo; Minna Varian laughed. &ldquo;I have to make peace between them morning,  noon and night. Oh, why do they do it? Fred is so dear and sweet to me,&mdash;then he  will scold Betty for the least trifle! And Betty never differs from me in her  opinions, but she is antagonistic to her father, always. Can you explain it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Varian&rsquo;s large gray eyes stared at Potter, and then turned to Bill Dunn. It was  clear to be seen that she was still partly under the influence of the opiate  effects, and that her memory of the recent tragedy was utterly obliterated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  her to her room,&rdquo; Potter said quickly, to Hannah. &ldquo;If she comes to down here  there&rsquo;ll be a fearful scene. How did she get away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was nobody in my room,&rdquo; Minna said, overhearing. &ldquo;Who should be there? I&rsquo;m not  ill. I woke up from a nap, and I heard talking,&mdash;my room is right above this, so  I came down. Where&rsquo;s Miss Betty, Hannah? Kelly, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  about to get supper, madam,&rdquo; Kelly&rsquo;s glance rested kindly on the pathetic  figure.</p>
  <p>Minna  Varian looked small and frail, and her white face and vacant, staring eyes  seemed to add to the mystery of the whole affair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now, Mrs Varian, come along of Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Minna,  where are you?&rdquo; Janet&rsquo;s frightened voice broke in upon them. &ldquo;Merciful powers,  however did she get down here? Help me get her back, Hannah. No, wait, I&rsquo;ll  call Doctor Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Herbert Varian was already entering the kitchen, and between them, Minna was  safely convoyed back to her room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we&rsquo;re getting at the truth,&rdquo; said Potter, with an air of satisfaction as he  glanced at Dunn. &ldquo;Lord knows I&rsquo;m sorry for that poor woman, but they say  children and fools speak the truth, and so, though she isn&rsquo;t herself, mentally,  she told the truth about Miss Varian and her father being enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hannah moaned, wiping her eyes on her apron. &ldquo;I tell you it wasn&rsquo;t  as bad as Mrs Varian makes out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was,&rdquo; said Kelly, slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no way of knowing, Hannah, you&rsquo;re always  in the kitchen. But I&rsquo;m about the house all the time, and I hear lots of talk.  And it&rsquo;s just as Mrs Varian said: Miss Betty and her father never agree. They  scrap at the least hint of a chance; and though sometimes they&rsquo;re terribly  affectionate and loving, yet at other times, they quarrel like everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  enough, Kelly; now keep quiet about this. Even if Miss Varian and her father  were not always friendly, it may not mean anything serious and it may make  trouble for the young lady if such reports get out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  expect to find Miss Betty, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  her? Of course. You say yourself there&rsquo;s only one way out of these premises. We  know she didn&rsquo;t go out that way, so, she must be here. There must be places we  haven&rsquo;t yet discovered, where she is hiding,&mdash;or&mdash;or has been concealed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a fearful situation!&rdquo; broke out Dunn. &ldquo;That girl may be gagged and bound&mdash;in  some secret closet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say there are none, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do say I don&rsquo;t see how there can be any, but, good lord, Potter, the girl must  be somewhere,&mdash;dead or alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  attractive supper, largely consisting of the delicacies intended for the  picnic, and supplemented by some hot viands, was soon in readiness.</p>
  <p>Hannah  was deputed to sit beside Mrs Varian, now sleeping again, and the others,  including the detectives, gathered round the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like the sum of your findings, so far,&rdquo; Doctor Varian said, raising weary eyes  to Potter&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty  slim, Doctor,&rdquo; the sheriff responded. &ldquo;But, I want to say, right now, that I&rsquo;ve  got to do my duty as I see it. Much as I&rsquo;d like to spare the feelings of you  people and all that, I&rsquo;ve got to forge ahead and discover anything I may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you have, Mr Potter. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d put a straw in the way of truth or  justice. But, granting that you may speak with all plainness, where do you come  out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  to the inevitable conclusion that Miss Varian killed her father and then killed  herself, and her body will yet be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Potter,&rdquo; Dunn said, slowly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go too fast. That is one theory, to be sure,  but it&rsquo;s only a theory. You&rsquo;ve nothing to back it up,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no evidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  negative evidence, Bill. Nobody else could get up here to do that shooting, or,  if he did, he couldn&rsquo;t get away again. Say, for a minute, that some intruder  might have been concealed in the house, say he shot Mr Varian, how&rsquo;d he get out  of here without being seen, and how did he do for the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all so,&rdquo; Bill said, doggedly, &ldquo;but it ain&rsquo;t enough to prove,&mdash;or, even to  indicate that Miss Varian did the shooting. Where&rsquo;d she get a pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw,  that&rsquo;s a foolish question! If she had nerve and ingenuity enough to shoot, she  had enough to provide the gun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  never did such things,&rdquo; said Janet Varian with spirit. &ldquo;That girl did sometimes  have words with her father,&mdash;that&rsquo;s a mere nothing,&mdash;my own daughter does  that,&mdash;but Betty Varian is a loving, affectionate daughter, and she no more  killed her father than I did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Small  use in asserting things you can&rsquo;t prove,&rdquo; said Potter, devoting himself to his  supper. &ldquo;Next thing for me to do&rsquo;s to see those other people,&mdash;the ones that  were here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, &ldquo;but what do you hope to learn from them? They  don&rsquo;t know as much as we do. I was first on the spot, young Landon, who&rsquo;s gone  home, was here with me, and those others stayed down on the path waiting for  us. See them, by all means, but I doubt their helpfulness. Now, aside from  that, and granting you get no new evidence, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; Potter said thoughtfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better offer a reward for any news of  Miss Varian. It&rsquo;s not likely to bring results,&mdash;but it ought to be done, I  think.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    The Varian Pearls</b></h2>
  <p>When  Bill Dunn went up on the porch of Mrs Blackwood&rsquo;s bungalow that evening, he  found a group of neighbors there, and was not at all surprised that they were  discussing the dreadful affair of Headland House.</p>
  <p>Claire  Blackwood greeted the caller courteously and asked him to go inside the house  with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us all go,&rdquo; said Rodney Granniss. &ldquo;I want to learn all about this case, and  we&rsquo;re entitled to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, everybody,&rdquo; Dunn invited, &ldquo;I want to ask a lot of questions and who knows  where I may get the best and most unexpected answers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Granniss  and Lawrence North, with Ted Landon and John Clark, who had been up on the  Headland in the afternoon, were the men, and Mrs Blackwood and her young guest,  Eleanor Varian were the only women present.</p>
  <p>Yet  Dunn seemed well satisfied as he looked over the group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;all the witnesses I wanted, and all here together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  didn&rsquo;t witness anything,&rdquo; offered John Clark, who was apparently by no means  desirous of taking part in the colloquy. &ldquo;And, as I&rsquo;ve an engagement, can&rsquo;t you  question me first, and let me go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  I can,&rdquo; returned Dunn, whose easy manners were not at all curbed by the more  formal attitude of those about him. &ldquo;Just tell the story in your own way, son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clark  resented the familiar speech, but said nothing to that effect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  little to tell,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never been up to Headland House before, and of  course I&rsquo;d never before met the Varians,&mdash;any of them. I went on Mrs Blackwood&rsquo;s  invitation, and after meeting the family and their guests on the veranda, we  all started for a picnic. We had reached a point half way down the steep path  from the house, when Miss Betty Varian said she had forgotten her camera. She  returned to the house for it, and we waited. She was gone so long, that we  wondered,&mdash;and then, her father went to hurry her up. He, too, was gone a long  time, and then, Doctor Varian and Ted Landon went after him. That&rsquo;s my story.  Landon can tell you the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the rest,&rdquo; said Dunn, shortly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, Mr Clark, that you need  remain. Your evidence is merely that of all the party who stayed behind while  the others went up to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Clark, with a sigh of relief, and making his adieux, he went away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you formed any theory of the crime, Mr Dunn?&rdquo; asked Lawrence North, who was  consumed with impatient curiosity, during the already known testimony of Clark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a definite one,&rdquo; Dunn replied, seeming by his manner to invite advice or  discussion. &ldquo;It is too mysterious to theorize about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove, it is!&rdquo; North agreed; &ldquo;I never heard of a case so absolutely strange. I&rsquo;d  like to get into that house and see for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  what for yourself Mr North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether  there&rsquo;s any secret passage&mdash;but, of course you&rsquo;ve looked for that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  thoroughly. I&rsquo;m of an architectural mind,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  is Mr North,&rdquo; said Mrs Blackwood. &ldquo;He designed this bungalow we&rsquo;re in now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you an architect, Mr North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  by profession, but I&rsquo;m fond of it. And I flatter myself I could discover a  secret passage if such existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  flatter myself I could, too,&rdquo; said Dunn, but not boastfully. &ldquo;Yet, I may have  overlooked it. I&rsquo;d be obliged, Mr North, if you&rsquo;d come up to the house, and  give it the once over. You might spot what I failed to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t know the people at all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  matter; I ask you as a matter of assistance. Come up there tomorrow, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  promised to do so, and Dunn turned to Eleanor Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  to trouble you, Miss Varian, but I have to ask you some very definite  questions. First, do you know your relatives up there pretty well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes,&rdquo; said Eleanor, with a surprised look. &ldquo;They live in New York and we live  in Boston, but we visit each other now and then and we often spend our summers  at the same place. Of course, I know them well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  tell me exactly the relations between Miss Varian and her father. Don&rsquo;t quibble  or gloss over the facts,&mdash;if they were not entirely in accord it will be found  out, and you may as well tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eleanor  Varian looked thoughtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell the truth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I can see it&rsquo;s better to do so. Betty  and her mother are much more in sympathy with one another than Betty and her  father. I don&rsquo;t know what makes the difference, but Aunt Minna always seems to  want everything the way Betty wants it, while Uncle Fred always wants just the  opposite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  Miss Betty was fond of her father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; they were devoted, really,&mdash;I think. Only, their natures were different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there any special subject on which they disagreed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  has been of late,&rdquo; Eleanor admitted, though with evident reluctance. &ldquo;Of course  Betty is a great belle. Of course, she has and has had many admirers. Now,  Uncle Fred seems always to be willing for Betty to have beaux and young man  friends, but as soon as they become serious in their attentions, and want to  marry Betty, then Uncle Fred shoos them off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was, as yet, impossible for Eleanor to speak of her uncle in the past tense.  The girl had not at all realized this sudden death, and couldn&rsquo;t help thinking  and speaking of him as still alive. Nor could she realize Betty&rsquo;s  disappearance. She was somewhat in a daze, and also over-excited by the  awfulness of the situation. She talked rapidly, yet coherently, and Dunn  secretly rejoiced at her agitation, knowing he would learn more than if she had  been cool and collected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that&rsquo;s not at all an unusual thing,&rdquo; put in North, who felt sorry for Eleanor  and wanted to relieve her all he could from the grilling fire of Dunn&rsquo;s  questions. &ldquo;I find that the majority of fathers resent the advances of their  daughters&rsquo; suitors. Now, mothers are different,&mdash;they encourage a match that  seems to them desirable. But a father can&rsquo;t realize his little girl is growing  up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Lawrence,&rdquo; exclaimed Claire Blackwood, &ldquo;for a bachelor, you seem to know a lot  about family matters!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  lots of friends, and I can&rsquo;t help noticing these things. Isn&rsquo;t it true, Miss  Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Eleanor said, &ldquo;to a degree, it is. I mean, in some instances. Any way, it&rsquo;s  quite true of Uncle Fred and Betty. Aunt Minna would be delighted to have Betty  engaged to some nice young man, but Uncle Fred flies in a fury at mere mention  of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can swear to that,&rdquo; said Rodney Granniss. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known the Varians for two  years, and it&rsquo;s quite true. Mrs Varian smiled on the attachment between Betty  and myself, but Mr Varian most certainly did not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  exclaimed Dunn, &ldquo;you one of Miss Betty Varian&rsquo;s suitors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  so,&rdquo; said Granniss, calmly. &ldquo;I knew them in New York. I came up here to be near  Betty. And now, Mr Dunn, I want to say that I&rsquo;m going to do all I can to solve  the mystery of Mr Varian&rsquo;s death, but even more especially am I going to try to  find Betty herself. I haven&rsquo;t been up to Headland House yet, for it&mdash;well, it  seems awful to go there now that Mr Varian can&rsquo;t put me out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, young man,&rdquo; Dunn gazed at him curiously, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t seem to occur to you  that you yourself may be said to have an interest in Mr Varian&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  that I shot him!&rdquo; Grannis looked amused. &ldquo;Well,&mdash;if you can tell me how I  accomplished it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  my dear sir, somebody accomplished it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it might as well be me! The only trouble with your theory Mr Dunn is, that I  didn&rsquo;t do it. Investigate all you like, you can&rsquo;t pin the crime, on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  I suppose you didn&rsquo;t abduct Miss Betty either?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not!&rdquo; Granniss looked solemn. &ldquo;I only wish I had. But I&rsquo;m going to find  her, and I want to start out by being friendly with you, Mr Dunn,&mdash;not  antagonistic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy  enough to check up your alibi, Mr Granniss,&rdquo; Dunn said; &ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t tell me  where you were at the time,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll find out for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you,&rdquo; said North, casually. &ldquo;Mr Granniss was out in his motor boat all the  afternoon. I know, because I was out in mine, and I saw him frequently. We were  both fishing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; said Granniss, carelessly, as if his alibi were of small moment to him,  as indeed it was. &ldquo;Now, Mr Dunn, you must have some theory,&mdash;or if not a theory,  some possible explanation of what occurred. Do give it to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  do,&rdquo; said North. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of detective stories, but I never read one that  started out so mysteriously as this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t any theory,&rdquo; Dunn looked at each in turn, his eyes roving round the  room as he talked, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as I can even dope out how it <i>could</i> have happened. But here&rsquo;s what I  work on,&mdash;motive. That&rsquo;s the thing to seek first,&mdash;motive. We know Mr Varian is  dead, we know Miss Varian is missing. That&rsquo;s all we really know. Now, you can&rsquo;t  deduce anything from those facts alone. So, I say, hunt for a motive. It isn&rsquo;t likely  that Mr Varian had any enemies up here. And if he had, they never&rsquo;d chosen such  an opportunity to shoot him,&mdash;for, just think how sudden, how unexpected that  opportunity was! Who could have foreseen that Miss Varian would go back to the  house for her camera? Who could have foreseen that her father would go back  after her? If those goings back were unpremeditated, then no enemy could have  been there ready to utilize his chance. If, on the other hand, those goings  back were premeditated, then they were arranged by either Miss Betty or her  father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  cried North. &ldquo;Mr Varian couldn&rsquo;t foresee that his daughter would forget her  camera, and Miss Betty couldn&rsquo;t foresee that it would be her father who would  come back for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it seems that way,&rdquo; Dunn looked deeply perplexed, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t get away  from the idea of there being some premeditation about the two goings back to  that empty house that resulted in a double tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  a burglar&mdash;&rdquo; began Claire Blackwood; &ldquo;suppose he had been concealed in the house  before we left to go to the picnic. Suppose when Betty came back unexpectedly,  he attacked her, and then, when Mr Varian came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what became of the burglar,&mdash;and of Miss Betty?&rdquo; asked Dunn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve mulled over  the burglar proposition, I&rsquo;ve imagined him to be one of the servants, but it  all comes back to the fact that such an intruder just simply couldn&rsquo;t get away,  and couldn&rsquo;t get Betty away, dead or alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  perfectly true,&rdquo; Claire agreed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to dispose of an imaginary  intruder. But neither is there any way to dispose of Betty. Nothing in this  world will make me believe that girl shot her father, but just assuming, for a  moment, that she did,&mdash;what happened next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Claire  demanded this with the air of an accusing judge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  that&rsquo;s the only possible theory,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;Say the young lady did shoot her  father, then she went some place,&mdash;where, we haven&rsquo;t yet discovered,&mdash;and shot  herself,&mdash;or, is there, alive yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll find her!&rdquo; Rodney Granniss burst forth, his strong young  face alight with zeal; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up there at once. Mr Varian didn&rsquo;t like me,  but Mrs Varian does, and maybe I can help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; Dunn told him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s under the influence of opiates all the  time. Doctor Varian keeps her that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  have to come to her senses some time,&rdquo; said Rod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up there any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going with you,&rdquo; declared Eleanor Varian. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay here,&mdash;forgive  me, Mrs Blackwood, you&rsquo;re kindness itself,&mdash;but I want to be where father and  mother are. I want to help find Betty, too. I know a lot of places to look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do!&rdquo; exclaimed Dunn. &ldquo;Where are they, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  all that Eleanor mentioned, Dunn had already searched, and his hopes of the  girl&rsquo;s assistance fell. Still, she might be familiar with Betty&rsquo;s ways, and  might be of some slight use.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Varian, you must do as you think best,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I advise you to bide  here till the morning, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  do, dear,&rdquo; urged Claire, and Eleanor, remembering the unavoidable climb up the  steep rocks, consented.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me one thing, Miss Varian,&rdquo; said Dunn, suddenly; &ldquo;were you in the kitchen of  the Varian house this afternoon at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was; I went out there with Betty to get some cakes and things. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you were there, did you notice a yellow sofa pillow out there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the kitchen? No, I did not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the two yellow cushions that belong on the hall sofa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I  think I know the ones you mean. What about them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  found one of them in the middle of the kitchen floor. Do you think anybody  could have put it there purposely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine why any one should!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you deduce from that?&rdquo; Lawrence North asked, interestedly, and Claire said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  that&rsquo;s what you call a clue, isn&rsquo;t it? What does it show?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t show a thing to me,&rdquo; declared Dunn; &ldquo;leastways, nothing sensible. Look  here, folks,&mdash;either there was somebody else in that house at that time besides  Betty and her father,&mdash;or else there wasn&rsquo;t. Now if there was, he surely  wouldn&rsquo;t be moving sofa pillows about. And if there wasn&rsquo;t, then one of those  two people moved it. Now, why? I can&rsquo;t think of any reason, sensible or not,  that would make anybody lug a fine handsome sofa cushion out to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it valuable enough to be worth stealing?&rdquo; asked North.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  a good looking affair, but nothing to tempt a thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks  like the servants&rsquo; work, I think,&rdquo; suggested Claire. &ldquo;Suppose one of them had  stayed behind, and not with any criminal intent, either; and suppose, merely to  be luxurious, she had taken a fine pillow out to her kitchen quarters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  even so, and even if she were caught by the returning Betty she couldn&rsquo;t have  shot Mr Varian and concealed both herself and Betty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  run up against a stone fence whatever you surmise,&rdquo; exclaimed Landon. He had  been a quiet listener, but had done some deep thinking. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one  plausible solution,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a secret passage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mr Landon,&rdquo; Dunn said, sharply, &ldquo;that speech gets on my nerves. Anybody  who thinks there&rsquo;s a secret passage in that house up there on the cliff is  welcome to go up there and find it. But I&rsquo;m no fool and sheriff Potter isn&rsquo;t  either; nor is Doctor Herbert Varian. And none of us can find a secret passage,  and what&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;re positive there isn&rsquo;t any. So, either show where there  could be one,&mdash;or let up on that solution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  lord, Dunn, don&rsquo;t get so wrathy!&rdquo; Landon said, good-humoredly. &ldquo;And I will go  and look for one,&mdash;since you invite me. Go with me, North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the willing reply, and Rodney Granniss said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you fellows won&rsquo;t want to make that search till tomorrow. But I&rsquo;m going up to  the house now. You&rsquo;ll stay here, won&rsquo;t you, Miss Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Reluctantly,  Eleanor agreed to stay, and Granniss went off alone.</p>
  <p>Rodney  Granniss was a determined man, and when he made his mind to hunt for Betty  Varian he also made up his mind to find her. To his mind the very fact that the  whole case was so inexplicable made it likely to develop some sudden clue or  key that would unlock the situation.</p>
  <p>He  still felt averse to visiting a house where his presence had been forbidden by  one who was now unable to resent his coming, but this was offset by his desire  to help Mrs Varian and to help in finding Betty.</p>
  <p>He  pondered over the idea of a secret passage in the house, but it was of small  comfort to him. If those other indefatigable workers had not been able to find  it, he had no reason to think he could do so. And, besides, it was anything but  an attractive picture to imagine Betty, either hidden voluntarily or concealed  against her will in some such place.</p>
  <p>He  trudged along up the rocky steps and presented himself at the door of Headland  House.</p>
  <p>Sheriff  Potter admitted him, and listened to his story.</p>
  <p>Then  he took him to the library and introduced him to Doctor Varian and his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you,&rdquo; cried Janet. &ldquo;Tell me of Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; returned Granniss, cheerfully. &ldquo;She rather wanted to come up here  with me, but they persuaded her to stay over night with Mrs Blackwood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  so,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian. &ldquo;Did Dunn learn anything from anybody that you know of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Rodney, &ldquo;and I fear there&rsquo;s little to learn from anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  that whatever there is to be learned must be found out here in this house,&mdash;not  from any of those onlookers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sensible  talk,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, &ldquo;but how shall we set about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not possessed of what is called detective instinct, nor am I  especially clever at solving puzzles. But I have determination, and I&rsquo;m going  to devote my whole time and energy to finding Betty Varian!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  said, young man,&rdquo; put in Potter, who was listening, &ldquo;but untrained sleuthing is  not often productive of great results.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean sleuthing, exactly,&rdquo; and Granniss looked at him squarely, &ldquo;I am  untrained. But I&rsquo;m willing to be advised, I&rsquo;m willing to be dictated to; I only  ask to help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a brick!&rdquo; said Janet; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you succeed better than the  detectives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  so, it will be because of my more personal interest in the case. I ought to  tell you, Mrs Varian, that Betty and I are practically engaged. It depended, of  course, on her father&rsquo;s consent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that he refused to give?&rdquo; asked Potter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he did. Which immediately ticketed me as his murderer in the eyes of Mr Dunn.  But I&rsquo;m not a criminal, and I didn&rsquo;t shoot Mr Varian. I shan&rsquo;t insist on this  point, because you can prove my words true for yourself. Now, I&rsquo;d like a talk  with Mrs Varian,&mdash;Betty&rsquo;s mother,&mdash;when such a thing is possible&mdash;and convenient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure but it would be a good thing,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, thoughtfully; &ldquo;when  she wakes, Mr Granniss, she will either be hysterical still, and in need of  further opiate treatment, or,&mdash;and which I think more likely,&mdash;she will be calm,  composed and alert minded. In the latter case, she might be glad to talk to the  man who cares so much for her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so; and, in the mean time, what can we do in the matter of finding Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing to be done in that line that hasn&rsquo;t been done,&rdquo; said the sheriff,  despairingly. &ldquo;All evening Doctor and Mrs Varian as well as the butler and cook  have been going over the house and the grounds, calling, and hunting for the  girl, with no success of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  she a dog?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  there is none about. Now, just before you came, we were thinking of looking  over some of Mr Frederick Varian&rsquo;s papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there&rsquo;s no reason to change our plans,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian; &ldquo;Mr Granniss&rsquo;  presence will not interfere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Rodney sat by, awaiting the possible awakening of Mrs Varian, and trying hard  to think of some new way to look for Betty.</p>
  <p>With  keys obtained from the pockets of the dead man, his brother opened the drawers  of the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be done,&rdquo; he said, as his hand slightly hesitated, &ldquo;and, too, we may come  across some clue to his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Among  the first of the important papers found was Frederick Varian&rsquo;s will. The  contents of this were a surprise to no one present, for the entire estate was  left to the wife, with instructions that she make due and proper provisions for  the daughter.</p>
  <p>But  a final clause caused Herbert Varian to stare incredulously at the paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, dear?&rdquo; Janet asked, seeing his astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;why,  Janet! the Varian pearls are left to Eleanor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Eleanor? No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they are! See, it&rsquo;s plain as day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no doubt as to his statement. The final clause of Frederick Varian&rsquo;s last  will and testament, bequeathed the string of pearls, known as &lsquo;the Varian  pearls,&rsquo; to his niece, Eleanor, the daughter of his brother Herbert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what is so startling in that?&rdquo; asked Potter, curiously, and Doctor Varian  replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Varian pearls are an heirloom, and are valued at two hundred thousand dollars.  It is the custom for the oldest of the family to inherit them, and he is  expected to bequeath them to his oldest child. Why did my brother leave them to  my daughter instead of to Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Herbert,  it&rsquo;s dreadful! Eleanor shall not take them!&rdquo; Janet cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  makes no difference, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Potter said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the fact that Mr Varian left  them away from his own child, that proves the attitude of the father to the  daughter!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    Minna Varian</b></h2>
  <p>It  was not until after the funeral of her husband that Minna Varian really came to  herself. The three intervening days, she had been free from hysterics but had  been in a state of physical exhaustion and incapable of any exertion.</p>
  <p>But  on the day after the funeral, she seemed to take on a new vitality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to life,&rdquo; she said, speaking very seriously. &ldquo;I have at last realized  what has happened to me. I was dazed at first, and couldn&rsquo;t seem to get my  senses. Now, we will have no more hysterics, no more emotional scenes, but we  go to work to find my child,&mdash;to save what I can from my wrecked life. It is a  wonder that I didn&rsquo;t lose my mind utterly. Think of it, Herbert, to lose my  husband by death and my child by a mystery far worse than death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  showed signs of breaking down again, but forced herself to control her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have made up my mind,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to go about the search for Betty systematically  and immediately. The detectives can do nothing,&mdash;they have proved that. The sheriff  and that Mr Dunn are at the end of their rope. I don&rsquo;t blame them,&mdash;it is a  baffling case. And I know they think Betty&rsquo;s dead body is hidden somewhere on  the premises. Though how they can think that, I don&rsquo;t see, after the search  that has been made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  think it,&rdquo; Janet said, &ldquo;because there&rsquo;s no other possible conclusion. You know,  yourself, Minna, if Betty were alive we would know of it by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind theories or conclusions,&rdquo; Minna said, determinedly, &ldquo;action is what I  want. I <i>know</i> my Betty never killed  her father! I know that as well as I know that I&rsquo;m alive. And Betty may be dead  or alive,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m going to find her in any case. Now, first of all, I suppose  you people want to get away from here. Herbert, your practice is calling you,  of course. I&rsquo;m not going to keep you. But I&rsquo;m going to stay here, on these premises,  where my child disappeared, until I get some knowledge of what happened to  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Minna,&rdquo; Varian objected, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stay here alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll get some one to stay with me. I can get a companion or a nurse or a  secretary,&mdash;you see, Herbert, there&rsquo;s a lot of business to be attended to in  connection with Fred&rsquo;s papers and affairs. He left me very well off, but the  financial settling up will call for the trained work of a good lawyer or  accountant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  Granniss spoke to me about that,&rdquo; Doctor Varian said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a bright young  lawyer, you know, and he thought perhaps you&rsquo;d employ him, and then he thought  he&rsquo;d help you in the search for Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like that. Rod&rsquo;s a nice chap, and truly, Fred had nothing against him, except  that he wanted to take Betty away from us. It would be no slighting of Fred&rsquo;s  wishes if I should have to do with Mr Granniss,&mdash;and nobody could be better help  to me in my search.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see, Minna,&rdquo; said Janet, &ldquo;what you hope from that search. Every nook and  cranny of this whole place has been thoroughly examined, and as nothing has  been found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it, Janet,&rdquo; Minna spoke patiently, &ldquo;because nothing has been found is the  very reason I must search more and further. I shall, first of all, offer a  large reward. The size of the reward may bring information when no other means  would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make  the offer as large as you like, Minna,&rdquo; Varian said, but not unkindly, &ldquo;for  you&rsquo;ll never be called upon to pay it. Why, child, there&rsquo;s no hope. I don&rsquo;t  want to be brutal, but really, Minna, dear, you oughtn&rsquo;t to buoy yourself up  with these false hopes, that never can be realized.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Herbert, what do you think happened to my child? Who do you think killed  Fred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  you ask me, Minna, I must say, in all honesty, that I can&rsquo;t see any possible  theory or any imaginable explanation except that Betty shot her father, and  then shot herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hidden  in some secret cupboard in this house, that she knew of, but that we haven&rsquo;t  yet found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can see, Herbert,&rdquo; Minna spoke slowly, &ldquo;how you can believe that, because, as  you say, you can&rsquo;t think of any other case. But I know,&mdash;I <i>know</i> Betty never shot her father. I know that,&mdash;and I shall yet  prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Minna, there must have been more enmity between Fred and Betty than you know  of, to make him leave the Varian pearls to Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is incredible,&rdquo; Minna mused. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand that and I shouldn&rsquo;t believe  it, if it were not right there in Fred&rsquo;s own handwriting. I haven&rsquo;t seen the  pearls for some years. I&rsquo;ve been too much of an invalid to wear them often, and  they&rsquo;ve stayed in the safe deposit for the last five or six years. But I meant  Betty should wear them next winter. Of course, I was sure Fred would leave them  to her in his will. I can&rsquo;t understand it! It isn&rsquo;t so much the loss of the  value that affects me, as the appalling fact that he wanted to leave them away  from Betty. As you say, there must have been something between those  two,&mdash;something desperate that I don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what could there be?&rdquo; Janet said, a blank wonder on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the very point,&rdquo; said Minna. &ldquo;I know there has never been any special or  particular ground for disagreement between those two except as to the matter of  Betty&rsquo;s getting married,&mdash;or engaged. Fred never would consent to that. But of  course he would have done so, later. He didn&rsquo;t approve of very early  marriages,&mdash;but more, I think, he dreaded the idea of Betty&rsquo;s going away from  us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  that only proves a special and even selfish fatherly love,&rdquo; Varian said, &ldquo;and  in that case, why take the pearls away from her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Minna again; &ldquo;it is too amazing! He adored Betty,  and what ever possessed him to give the pearls to Eleanor,&mdash;he liked Eleanor, as  we all do, but he never seemed especially attached to her. Not to put her ahead  of Betty, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she shall never take the pearls,&rdquo; said Janet, decidedly. &ldquo;I think Fred  was temporarily out of his mind when he made that will, or he was temporarily  angry at Betty. When is it dated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the strange part,&rdquo; said Minna. &ldquo;He made that will ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  Betty was only about ten years old! He couldn&rsquo;t have been angry at the child  then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that is the only explanation,&rdquo; Doctor Varian said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any  other explanation except that Fred was foolishly angry at the child, and in a  fit of silly temper made the will giving the pearls to Eleanor, and then forgot  all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgot  the Varian pearls!&rdquo; cried Janet; &ldquo;not likely. But I never shall let Eleanor  accept them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that, my dear,&rdquo; remonstrated her husband. &ldquo;If Betty never is found, of  course it&rsquo;s right Eleanor should have the pearls. I am the next Varian to Fred,  and my daughter is the rightful heir,&mdash;after Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; said Minna. &ldquo;But let that matter rest for the present. If Betty is never  found, Eleanor ought to have the pearls. If Betty is found, I shall be so  happy, I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, Minna,&rdquo; Doctor Varian said, &ldquo;in thinking I ought to get back to the  city. But Janet or Nell or both will stay here with you as long as you need or  want them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  till I can get somebody else. I&rsquo;ve about concluded to take Rodney Granniss as  secretary and have him settle up Fred&rsquo;s estate. With the co-operation of Fred&rsquo;s  own lawyers. Then, I&rsquo;ll have a sort of nurse companion who can look after me,  and then, I shall devote my life and, if need be, all my money to solving my  mysteries. I shall get the best detectives in the country. I shall follow out  also some ideas of my own, and if success is possible, I shall attain it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  sat upright, her eyes shining with a clear, steady determined light. She seemed  another being from the one who had screamed in hysterics at first knowledge of  her sorrows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  found myself,&rdquo; she said, in explanation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve risen above my dead self of  grief and sorrow. Why, my desolation is so great, so unspeakable, that I must  do something or go mad! I&rsquo;m not going mad,&mdash;I have too much to do. Now, Janet,  if you and Eleanor,&mdash;or one of you, will stay a day or two longer, I&rsquo;ll get a  nurse up from the city, and as soon as she arrives you can go. I know you&rsquo;ll be  glad to get away from this place of horrors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that, Minna, dear, but we have several engagements&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course, I know. Well, plan for two days more,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be settled by that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she was. Inside of forty-eight hours, the now energetic woman had Rodney  Granniss installed as her secretary and man of business, and had secured the  services of a capable and kindly woman as nurse and companion. Her new  household made up, she let her relatives go back to their own summer home, and  devoted herself to her life work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; she said to Granniss, &ldquo;we must go ahead on the supposition that Betty  is alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she is, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; the young man said, earnestly. &ldquo;For, North and I have been  all over this place, and North is a sort of an architect, you know, and I&rsquo;m  sort of a detective, and we can&rsquo;t find any place where any one could be  concealed. Now, it doesn&rsquo;t do any good, as some do, to say there must be a  secret passage, or secret cupboard. If there were, we must have found it. And  it&rsquo;s too ridiculous, even to think for a minute that Betty killed her father! I  know Betty, even better, perhaps than you or her father ever knew her. We have  been sweethearts for nearly a year, and I tried many a time to persuade Betty  to defy her father, and announce her engagement to me. She would have done so  soon, I&rsquo;m sure, but it was her love and respect for him that made her hold off  so long. As to their little squabbles, they meant nothing at all. To imagine  that girl shooting anybody is too absurd! I could rather imagine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Granniss  paused, and Minna took up his thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could rather imagine her father shooting her! I&rsquo;ve thought that over, but you  see, it&rsquo;s impossible, because there was no weapon found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the strangest case I ever heard of! Now, about the reward. It&rsquo;s time that was  attended to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and I think we&rsquo;ll make it as high as ten thousand dollars,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Betty&rsquo;s return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is, for any information that may lead to knowledge of what happened to  Betty and where she is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  about apprehending the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, Mr Granniss, they make fun of me for imagining this &lsquo;criminal.&rsquo; How could  there be one? How did he get in the house? How did he disappear again? You say  yourself there&rsquo;s no secret passage,&mdash;we know nobody came in through the regular  way,&mdash;how, then, even suggest a &lsquo;criminal&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but why offer a reward, if there&rsquo;s no one who could by any chance appear to  claim it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the point Doctor Varian makes. He says it doesn&rsquo;t matter how large we make the  offer, for it never will be claimed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we&rsquo;ll just assume that criminal, and go ahead with the reward plan,&rdquo; said  Granniss, cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to it, and we won&rsquo;t speculate on its result  at present. It surely can&rsquo;t do any harm. But, Mrs Varian, we must do more than  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Detectives.  I think you should get the best one you can and get him up here at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  do that, Mr Granniss. What do you do? Apply to a city agency?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  or get a private detective. I know of one,&mdash;the best there is in the country,  but we might not be able to get him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try,  anyway. Offer any price,&mdash;any bonus. Only get him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try. I have to go down to New York soon, for there are many  important matters to see to with Mr Varian&rsquo;s lawyers. I&rsquo;ll see about this  detective then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  had replaced the servants who had left her with maids from the village. There  were some who were glad to go to a house suddenly made famous by such an  astounding mystery. Others declared the house was haunted, and wouldn&rsquo;t go near  it.</p>
  <p>Among  those who inclined to the haunted house idea was the new nurse. A Mrs Fletcher:  she was of a psychic turn of mind, and while she didn&rsquo;t exactly believe Betty  was carried off by spooks, yet she thought the girl might have taken her own  life, and perhaps her father&rsquo;s, because of supernatural influences or  directions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  Minna Varian told her. &ldquo;My Betty was,&mdash;is,&mdash;a healthy, normal girl. She has none  of those foolish notions of the occult or supernatural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the only explanation,&rdquo; said Mrs Fletcher, doggedly. &ldquo;And I do think the house  is haunted,&mdash;I heard mysterious sounds last night,&mdash;like rustling of wings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  Varian only looked amused at this, but Granniss, who was present, said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  interesting, Mrs Fletcher. Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  account, however, was merely a vague idea of sounds, that might have been  mysterious, but were more likely made by the servants going about at night.</p>
  <p>Sheriff  Potter and his colleague, Bill Dunn, had practically given up the matter. They  pretended to be working on it, but as they themselves put it, &ldquo;What can you do  when you can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was room for much discussion, but when it came to action, what was there to be  done?</p>
  <p>You  can&rsquo;t hunt a criminal when you&rsquo;ve no reason to assume any criminal intent. You  can&rsquo;t hunt for a missing girl after you&rsquo;ve scoured all the places where she  could by any possibility be found. You can&rsquo;t hunt for the murderer of a man  when there was no way for a murderer to be on the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  are you going to give up the quest?&rdquo; Granniss asked of the sheriff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not that,&rdquo; Potter said, uneasily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re open to suggestion,&mdash;we&rsquo;re keen for any  new clue or testimony,&mdash;but where can we look for such? You must see, Mr  Granniss, that it&rsquo;s a mighty unusual case,&mdash;a most mysterious and unsolvable  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do see that, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to get expert assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  ahead,&rdquo; said Potter, agreeably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to see any man who can handle the  thing. Why, there&rsquo;s no handle to it. No place to catch hold. Here&rsquo;s a man  killed, and a girl missing. Now, we&rsquo;ve no more idea what happened to those two  people than we had at the moment of the discovery of the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  perfectly true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what&rsquo;s more, we never will have. That mystery will never be solved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  saying that, Mr Potter, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but it&rsquo;s true all the same. If Miss Betty was in any way to blame,&mdash;which, I  can&rsquo;t believe,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never find out anything. Because, if she&rsquo;s alive she&rsquo;d  have shown up by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&mdash;and if Miss Betty was not to blame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  whoever was to blame made a blame good job of it,&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll never catch him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the principle I&rsquo;m going to work on,&mdash;the idea that somebody did do it,&mdash;that he  did make a good job of it,&mdash;and that I am going to catch him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  talk, but there&rsquo;s the same old stumbling block. You can&rsquo;t argue an outsider,&mdash;an  intruder, without allowing a secret entrance to that house,&mdash;and you say there  isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  sure isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  suppose your criminal didn&rsquo;t arrive and depart in an aeroplane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  thought of that,&mdash;but it isn&rsquo;t possible. You see there were half a dozen people  looking on all the time. I wish I&rsquo;d been there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t  have done any good. You couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; seen more&rsquo;n anybody else did. There was  nothing to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  agreed Granniss, &ldquo;there was nothing to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawrence  North came up to the house again at Rod&rsquo;s request, and once more they looked  for a secret room or cupboard.</p>
  <p>Armed  with a yardstick and measuring tape, they went through the house from roof to  cellar. They paced floors and measured walls and tapped ceilings, and proved to  their own conviction that there was no foot of space in the whole structure  unaccounted for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said North, &ldquo;as if it were an old English manor house or a medieval  castle. It&rsquo;s modern, it isn&rsquo;t built with any sinister plan or any desire for secret  maneuvers. There never was any smuggling going on up as far as this, and,  anyway, this is a simple pleasure house, built for a pleasant simple family  life. I&rsquo;ve looked up the builders, and they say it was built by a commonplace  man with a commonplace family. They moved out of the state long ago, but there  never was anything secretive or mysterious about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  spent a long time in the cellar, but here, too, there was no uncertain space.  Everything was built four-square. Every room, bin or cupboard was as plainly  defined as those above, and there was no hiding place possible.</p>
  <p>Granniss  looked down the old dried up well. &ldquo;Dunn went down that,&rdquo; Lawrence said;  &ldquo;nothing doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got to go down myself,&rdquo; returned Rodney, shortly, as he took off his coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful, then,&rdquo; North admonished him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  good, strong flashlight illumined the old well, and Rod Granniss clambered down  its stone sides.</p>
  <p>But  he returned with the same message Dunn had brought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  dried up; nothing down there but a muddy bottom and moss-grown stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  stones missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  all solid and complete. I gave it a most careful scrutiny, for I don&rsquo;t want to  have to go down again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that finishes the cellar, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and finishes the house. You must admit, Lawrence, there&rsquo;s no possible chance of  Betty Varian being in this house, dead or alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I admit that,&mdash;but, what, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t even suggest! Can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing left but that she went away,&mdash;managed somehow to elude the watchers,&mdash;perhaps  they were not noticing the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk as if she could get down from this headland by any other route than right  past where the crowd were waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  she hid here in the house, until after dark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t suggest such awful things! Betty kill her father, and then, hiding until  dark, make her way out and down to the village and away from the Harbor&mdash;oh,  impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alternative?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know! The more I think it over the less I can see <i>any</i> solution!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the haunted house idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing to me,&rdquo; Granniss scorned it. &ldquo;In fact, I usually come back  to the idea that Mr Varian in some way killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but I mean, maybe he shot himself, and Betty, who might have been trying  to prevent it, took the pistol and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t <i>know!</i> You are too  exasperating, Lawrence! You just stand there and say &lsquo;why&rsquo;? Stop it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  your temper, Rod. I&rsquo;m only trying, as you are, to find some way to look. It is  indeed impenetrable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then that matter of the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  me that is the strangest revelation yet. No matter how much the father and  daughter had little disagreements, even quarrels, how could he leave that great  treasure away from his child and give it to his niece!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that very thing is a key to the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. You know I don&rsquo;t know, Lawrence; if I did I&rsquo;d have told long ago!  But I believe when the worthwhile detective that I&rsquo;m going to get for Mrs  Varian takes hold of the case, he&rsquo;ll work from that strange bequest of the  Varian pearls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  he will,&mdash;but to me,&mdash;while it&rsquo;s passing strange, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to indicate  anything definite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  nor to me. But we haven&rsquo;t the trained mind of the real detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  the man you&rsquo;re going to get?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pennington  Wise, the best in the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard of him. Well, it will be interesting to see how he goes about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    Ransom</b></h2>
  <p>The  Herbert Varians went back to their summer home, and Minna, left alone with her  companion and her secretary, began what she called her campaign to find Betty.</p>
  <p>Some  people thought Mrs Varian a little affected mentally by her awful griefs, but  those who knew her best read in her determination and persistence a steady aim  and felt a slight hope of her success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  in the world I can do, dear,&rdquo; Claire Blackwood said to her, &ldquo;command me. I&rsquo;ll  go to the city for you or do errands or anything I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Minna, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing you can do. Nothing anybody can do. I&rsquo;m only  afraid that if I get no encouragement in my efforts, I will lose my mind,&mdash;and  that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to guard against. I follow my nurse&rsquo;s directions as to  exercise, diet and all that, but I feel as if I could only keep my brain from  flying to pieces by hanging onto my hope of eventually finding my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will,&rdquo; Claire said, earnestly, though she voiced a belief that she was far  from feeling, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs Varian, you will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; Minna went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a new theory now. I think that maybe Betty killed  her father accidentally&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a new idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I know it&rsquo;s almost incredible,&mdash;but what idea isn&rsquo;t? Say Mr Varian went suddenly  insane,&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t think of any other way,&mdash;and attacked Betty with a revolver.  Say, trying to protect herself, it went off and killed him,&mdash;perhaps the weapon  was in his hands, perhaps in hers,&mdash;and then, the child, in an agony of fear or  remorse, ran away,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how she got away,&mdash;but, don&rsquo;t you see, Mrs  Blackwood, she must have left the premises somehow,&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  they would have found her by this time,&mdash;yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  I&rsquo;ve offered ten thousand dollars reward for any information that will lead to  finding Betty,&mdash;dead or alive. Mr Granniss thinks it will bring no results, but  I can&rsquo;t help hoping. And if it doesn&rsquo;t,&mdash;what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  going to employ a detective, aren&rsquo;t you? These local authorities are not  capable of managing a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Mr Granniss advises a Mr Wise,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t see what any detective can do.  There&rsquo;s nothing to detect, as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it. We can&rsquo;t see,&mdash;but the trained detective can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is your mail, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; said Granniss, coming into the room, &ldquo;will you run  it over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  glanced at the letters, mostly notes of sympathy, or letters of advice from  would-be helpful friends, but there was one that caused her to exclaim in  amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Rodney,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;will you look at this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  great was her agitation that Claire Blackwood went in search of the nurse, for  she feared some emotional outburst beyond her power to control.</p>
  <p>The  disturbing letter was a plain looking affair, on ordinary letter paper, and it  read:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Varian.</p>
  <p>We  have your daughter safe. We are holding her for ransom. Your reward does not  tempt us at all but if you are ready to pay one hundred thousand dollars, you  may have your child back. If not, you will never see her again. There must be  no dickering, no fooling, and, above all, no police interference. I will not go  into details now, but if you want to take up with this offer put a personal in  any of the large Boston papers, saying, &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; and all directions will be  sent to you as to how to proceed. But if you tell the police or allow any  detective to know anything about this deal, it is all off. Don&rsquo;t think you can  fool us, we have eyes in the back of our heads and any insincerity or breach of  faith on your part will result in sad results to your daughter. To carry this  thing through you must trust and obey us implicitly and any lapse will mean far  deeper trouble than you are in now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  letter was not signed, nor was it dated. The postmark was Boston, and it had  been mailed the day before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a fake,&rdquo; Granniss declared, at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Claire Blackwood, &ldquo;it sounds real to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s real or not,&rdquo; Minna interrupted, excitedly. &ldquo;I mean I  don&rsquo;t care whether anybody believes it&rsquo;s real or not. I&rsquo;m going to answer it at  once, and I&rsquo;m going to agree to everything they say, and I&rsquo;m not going to tell  the police or a detective or anybody,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to get Betty back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  face was radiant with joy, her eyes shone and she was smiling for the first  time since that awful day of the double tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; began Granniss, who was convinced the whole letter was  a mere attempt to get money under false pretenses, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t throw away a  hundred thousand dollars in that fashion!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? It is a lot of money, but I have the sum and it means getting Betty back!  What is any sum of money,&mdash;even my whole fortune, against that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it doesn&rsquo;t surely mean getting her back. If I thought it did I&rsquo;d feel just as  you do about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it does,&mdash;it does!&rdquo; Minna cried, her face still transfigured with happiness. &ldquo;I  know it,&mdash;I feel it&mdash;something in my heart tells me that it is true,&mdash;and, you  see, it explains everything. These people kidnapped Betty,&mdash;abducted her, and  now they&rsquo;re holding her for ransom,&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll get it,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll get Betty!  They don&rsquo;t want her, you see, but they do want the money. And they&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with Mrs Varian,&rdquo; Claire said, quite convinced by Minna&rsquo;s confidence in  the good faith of the letter writer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s too absurd!&rdquo; insisted Rodney. &ldquo;You know,&mdash;Mrs Varian, you must know, that I  want to find Betty quite as much as you do,&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t qualify that statement.  I love her as much as you can. But I don&rsquo;t believe for one minute that that  letter is genuine. I mean, I don&rsquo;t believe the man who wrote it has Betty, or  ever saw her! Why, think a minute. Of all the theories regarding Betty&rsquo;s  disappearance, abduction is the least believable. How could any one abduct Betty  that day,&mdash;how could the kidnapper get into this house, and out again,&mdash;with  Betty,&mdash;when so many people were about, watching?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know how it was done,&rdquo; Minna said, doggedly, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a chance, and I&rsquo;m  going to take it. You can&rsquo;t stop me, Rodney. You&rsquo;ve no authority to say what I  shall do with my own money. I&rsquo;ve a right to try this thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  oh,&rdquo; said Claire, &ldquo;suppose it should be a fake! Not only you&rsquo;d lose all that  money,&mdash;but think of your disappointment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  disappointment would be no worse than things are at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it would. If you follow up that letter and pay all that sum, and then get  nothing in return, it would just about kill you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would just about kill me not to take the chance,&rdquo; returned Minna. &ldquo;Now, I  suppose I still have the right to order my own movements. I shall at once send  the personal to the Boston paper,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put it in several, so he&rsquo;ll be sure to  see it,&mdash;and then, I&rsquo;ll await his further advice. Will you send the messages,  Rodney, or must I do it myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I am at your orders, Mrs Varian.&rdquo; Rod gave her his winning smile, &ldquo;But,  at least, let&rsquo;s think it over a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  send the word at once. We can talk it over afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  seemed to be no way out, so Granniss went off to do her bidding.</p>
  <p>Even  then, he had half a mind to pretend to send the word but really to withhold it.  On reflection, he concluded he had no right to do this. But he remembered that  Minna had not bound him to secrecy, though, of course, it was implied.</p>
  <p>So  with the letters to the Boston papers went also one to Pennington Wise begging  him to come at once to investigate the remarkable case of Betty Varian, and  telling him frankly of the strange letter just received.</p>
  <p>That  same afternoon a telegram came for Mrs Varian.</p>
  <p>Granniss  opened it, as was his custom, and its contents so surprised him that he nearly  succumbed to the temptation to keep it from Mrs Varian.</p>
  <p>But,  he reconsidered, he had no right to presume on his position as confidential  secretary, so with grave fears of its effects he handed it to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  Mother,&rdquo; it ran; &ldquo;I am all right, and if you do just as you agree, I will soon  be with you again. Please obey implicitly. &ldquo;Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  her!&rdquo; Minna cried, and fainted.</p>
  <p>Nurse  Fletcher soon revived her, but she was in a shaken, nervous state, and could  stand no contradiction or disapproval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you see, Rodney,&rdquo; she cried triumphantly, &ldquo;it is all right! Here is word from  Betty herself&mdash;oh, my darling!&rdquo; and she fell to kissing the yellow paper, as if  it were the face of her child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Mrs Varian,&rdquo; Granniss hesitated to correct her but felt he must, &ldquo;that may not  be from Betty, you know. Anybody could send a telegram signed with Betty&rsquo;s  name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rodney!&rdquo;  Minna&rsquo;s eyes blazed with anger, &ldquo;why do you try every way to make me miserable?  Why dash every cup of joy from my lips? You seem to hope that we never find  Betty! I can&rsquo;t understand your attitude, but unless you are more helpful,&mdash;yes,  and more hopeful,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we can get along together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Granniss knew that he must stand by this distracted woman. Another secretary  might have more leniency and less judgment, which would be a bad thing for  Minna&rsquo;s interests. No, even at risk of letting her be imprudent, he must stand  by her, and protect her all he could against her own wrong decisions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, we&rsquo;ll get along all right, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; he said, trying to treat the  matter lightly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get rid of me so easily,&mdash;and, too, you know that I  want to believe all this quite as much as you do. But you must admit that a  telegram is not like a letter. It might be faked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  this isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Minna, contentedly, still caressing the paper missive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  consider it,&rdquo; said Rod. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound to me like Betty&rsquo;s diction. Would she  use the word &lsquo;implicitly&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; Minna stared at him. &ldquo;And, too, she wrote it under compulsion, most  likely. Oh, my darling child,&mdash;at the mercy of those ruffians! Yet, I make no  doubt they&rsquo;re good to her. Why should they harm my baby? They only want the  ransom money, and that they shall have. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s a large sum, it makes me  more sure I&rsquo;ll get Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Granniss  was in despair. He felt the awful responsibility of Mrs Varian&rsquo;s wild  determination, but he couldn&rsquo;t see anything to do about it.</p>
  <p>To  report to Doctor Varian was not his duty, and though he thought it was his duty  to tell the story to the police, Minna had exacted his promise not to do so,  and he had given it. After all, it was her money,&mdash;if she chose to give it up so  easily, it was not his affair. And, too, he couldn&rsquo;t help a lurking hope that  it might be all true and might result in Betty&rsquo;s restoration to her sorrowing  mother,&mdash;and, to himself. For he knew, now that the opposing influence of her  father was removed, if Betty should ever be found, she would some day be his  wife. He trusted in her faith and loyalty to himself as he believed in his own  to her.</p>
  <p>And  yet, he couldn&rsquo;t approve of Minna&rsquo;s wholesale compliance with the exorbitant  demands of people who might be and probably were mere swindlers. He was  thinking these things over when Mrs Varian came to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to go right down to New York,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;and get me a hundred  thousand dollars in cash. Now, don&rsquo;t raise objections, for I should only combat  them, and it takes my strength so to argue with you. My husband&rsquo;s fortune is mine.  There is no one to dictate to me how I shall use it. I want,&mdash;I insist upon this  sum in cash, or some sort of bonds or securities that may be cashed by anybody,  without identification. Oh, you know what I mean,&mdash;I want the money in such  shape that these kidnappers will take it willingly. Of course, they won&rsquo;t accept  checks or notes. Go on, now, Rodney, get off at once, and get back as soon as  you can. And I want some man to stay in this house while you&rsquo;re away. I&rsquo;m not  exactly timid, but I&rsquo;ve never stayed nights in a house without a man in  it,&mdash;beside the butler, I mean,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure you can invite some friend who  would be willing to come. Perhaps Mr Landon. He&rsquo;s so nice, and I&rsquo;d try to make  it pleasant for him in any way I could. There are plenty of books, and with  good cigars, he might be contented.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;d be contented, all right; but Landon&rsquo;s gone off on a little trip. He won&rsquo;t  be back for several days. How&rsquo;d you like to have North? Probably he&rsquo;d come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&mdash;if he&rsquo;s perfectly willing. I&rsquo;d hate to bore him. You&rsquo;ll be back,&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have to be away two nights,&mdash;if North can&rsquo;t come, there&rsquo;s young Clark,&mdash;he&rsquo;s a  good sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate to ask it of any of them, but I hate worse to stay alone. I&rsquo;d get nervous  and I shouldn&rsquo;t sleep at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right, Mrs Varian, I know how you feel about it, and I&rsquo;ll get somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Granniss  was as good as his word, and, finding that Lawrence North was glad to do  anything in his power to help Mrs Varian, it was arranged that he should visit  at Headland House until Rodney could get back from New York.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  promise me,&rdquo; Granniss said, &ldquo;that if you get further letters from the  kidnappers you won&rsquo;t do anything definite until I return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Minna, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t promise, anyway, but, as you must  see for yourself, I can&rsquo;t do anything till I get that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose not,&rdquo; Granniss agreed, and went off. During a sociable and chatty  evening, Minna told North about the letter from the abductors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  Mrs Varian,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t believe it, do you? I only wonder you  haven&rsquo;t had several. It&rsquo;s a common way of crooks to attempt to get money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this rings so true,&rdquo; Minna defended herself, and showed him the letter.</p>
  <p>North  studied it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  sounds plausible enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how is it possible? How could anyone  have kidnapped the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Mr North, don&rsquo;t say over and over again, &lsquo;how could he?&rsquo; You know  somebody or something is responsible for Betty&rsquo;s disappearance as well as for  Mr Varian&rsquo;s death. Don&rsquo;t think for a minute that my anxiety about my daughter  in any way obliterates or lessens my grief at my husband&rsquo;s death. But, as you  must see, nothing can bring Mr Varian back. While,&mdash;something may bring Betty  back! Can you wonder, then, that I catch at any straw,&mdash;believe in any  hope,&mdash;take up with any suggestion on the mere chance of getting my child back?  If they had asked for my whole fortune, I should pay it&mdash;on the chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  North spoke slowly,&mdash;&ldquo;I see how you feel about it,&mdash;but you ought to have some  proof that they really have your Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  thought about that,&rdquo; Minna shuddered, &ldquo;but, I&rsquo;ve read of these cases, and&mdash;when  they send a proof&mdash;sometimes, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;a finger&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  now, now, don&rsquo;t be morbid! I don&rsquo;t mean anything of that sort. But if they  would give you a bit of her hair, or a scrap of her own handwriting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can I demand that? How can I ask for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  just wait for their next instruction. If they are sincere in this offer, if  they really have Miss Betty and are really ready to negotiate, they must tell  you what to do next. And, Mrs Varian, I advise you to do it. It may be a wrong  principle, but your case is exceptional,&mdash;and, since you&rsquo;ve showed me this  letter, I can&rsquo;t help feeling it&rsquo;s the real thing. For one thing, you can see  it&rsquo;s written by at least a fairly well educated man. I mean, not by the common,  ignorant class. Moreover, the very audacity of demanding such enormous ransom,  indicates to my mind that the writer can perform his part of the bargain. A  mere crook, writing a fake letter, would never dream of asking such a sum. How  are you going to manage the payment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you mean the method of handing it over, I don&rsquo;t know. I shall do as I&rsquo;m  directed. If you mean how shall I obtain the cash, I&rsquo;ve asked Mr Granniss to  bring it up from New York for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he going to travel home with that sum on his person!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he said he had no fear in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; since no one knows of it, he runs little risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Rodney Granniss, in New York, was putting through his errands in record time.</p>
  <p>He  attended to the money matter, and by the aid of some influential friends of the  Varian family, he obtained the desired sum in cash and unregistered bonds.</p>
  <p>Then  he went to see Pennington Wise.</p>
  <p>That  astute detective declared himself too busy to accept any new commission. But  after Granniss had personally told the astonishing details of the case, Wise  was unable to resist the temptation to undertake its investigation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  way you put it, Mr Granniss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it sounds like an impossible condition.  I can&rsquo;t see any explanation at all, but, as we know, there <i>must</i> be one. The obvious solution is a secret passage, but since  you tell me there is none, I feel I must go up there and see for myself what could  have happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  drop all else, and go straight off. We won&rsquo;t travel together, though. You go  ahead, right now, and I&rsquo;ll follow soon. And, by the way,&mdash;you&rsquo;re carrying that  money with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me take it. It&rsquo;s far safer so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rod  Granniss opened his eyes wide. Was this strange man asking him to transfer his  trusted errand to him?</p>
  <p>Wise  laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I blame you for not wanting to hand it over. But, this I  do tell you,&mdash;it will be safe with me,&mdash;and it may not be with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  nobody knows I have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  so. I strongly advise your letting me take it,&mdash;but you must do as you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  get it safely up to Mrs Varian?&rdquo; Granniss said, reluctantly producing the  rather bulky parcel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I will,&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make the loss good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked meaningly at the younger man, and, flushing a little, Rodney said,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&mdash;Mr Wise. I couldn&rsquo;t make it good if I lost it. Take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with no further security than the detective&rsquo;s word, Granniss handed over the  money.</p>
  <p>He  went to his train in a most perturbed spirit. Had he done right or not? It all  depended on the fidelity of the detective. To be sure, Granniss had every  confidence in him, but the sum of money was so large that it might well prove a  temptation to hitherto impeccable honesty.</p>
  <p>He  boarded his train, still uncertain of the wisdom of his course, and more  uncertain as to what Mrs Varian would say.</p>
  <p>But,  he reasoned, if they were to employ the services of one of the best and best  known detectives in the country, it was surely right to obey his first bit of  advice.</p>
  <p>This  thought comforted Granniss somewhat, and he was further comforted by an event  which took place that night, and which proved the wisdom of the detective&rsquo;s  advice.</p>
  <p>Granniss  was asleep in his lower berth when the merest feeling of a cautious movement  above awakened him.</p>
  <p>He  could hear no sound, but through half-dosed eyes, he saw the occupant of the  berth above crawl silently down and stealthily reach for Rodney&rsquo;s clothes,  which were folded at the foot of the berth.</p>
  <p>Interested  rather than afraid, Granniss watched the performance, keeping his own eyes  nearly closed. It was too dark for him to see the marauder, who worked entirely  by feeling, and who swiftly examined the clothing of his victim and then turned  his attention to his bag.</p>
  <p>Still  Granniss made no sign, for he preferred to see the chagrin of the robber rather  than to interrupt him at his work.</p>
  <p>The  bag yielded nothing of interest, and then the upper berth man came along and  slipped his hand under Granniss&rsquo; pillow.</p>
  <p>Deftly  done as it was, Rodney shot out his own hand and grabbed the wrist of the  other. But it was twisted away from him, and in an instant the man was back in  his own berth.</p>
  <p>Rod  thought it over, and concluded to raise no outcry. In the morning he would see  who his visitor was, and then take such steps as he thought best. He fell  asleep, and when he awoke the sun was up and his would-be robber had  disappeared.</p>
  <p>Chagrined  at his own stupidity in over-sleeping, but rejoiced at the safety of Mrs  Varian&rsquo;s money, Granniss went on with his journey home.</p>
  <p>But,  when he found on the floor of the car a handkerchief that had been under his  pillow, he realized that a still further search for treasure had been made  beneath his sleeping head.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    Poor Martha</b></h2>
  <p>When  Granniss stepped off the train at Headland Harbor, there were but few other  passengers who alighted at the same time. But one of these, a mild young man,  came nearer Rodney and said, quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Granniss, may I speak to you a moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  Rod answered, after a quick glance at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a messenger from Mr Wise. I have with me the money for Mrs Varian. Shall I  give it to you here, or go up to the house with you and carry it? No one seems  to be observing us; take it if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rodney  stared at him. Wise, then, had sent his messenger with the money along on the  same train. By this means he had outwitted the man in the upper berth, who,  without question, knew of Granniss&rsquo; errand, and who had thus been foiled in his  attempt to rob him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  for you!&rdquo; Granniss exclaimed, heartily. &ldquo;I think it will be all right for me to  take it now,&mdash;here is the Varian car. But would you prefer to go up to the  house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;d rather not. I&rsquo;m sure the way is clear now. I saw that performance in the  train last night. But don&rsquo;t talk any more about it. Just take the box, and I&rsquo;ll  go right back on the next train. Mr Wise will arrive tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marveling  at the detective&rsquo;s way of managing, Granniss took the unimportant looking  parcel the young man offered, and with a brief good-by, got into the Varian  car.</p>
  <p>The  car could go only to the lodge gate, and from there Rodney trudged up the steep  path to the house, half afraid that some bandit would even yet appear to rob  him of the treasure.</p>
  <p>But  nothing untoward happened, and he reached Headland House in safety.</p>
  <p>It  was nearly noon when he arrived, and Lawrence North, still there, was as eager  as Minna to hear the results of Granniss&rsquo; errands in New York.</p>
  <p>But  not until after luncheon, when the three were alone in the library, did he tell  the whole story.</p>
  <p>He  then gave a frank account of the detective&rsquo;s asking to take charge of the  package of money, and of the lucky stroke it was that he did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I never imagined,&rdquo; Rodney said, &ldquo;that he would send it along by a messenger on  the same train!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever  work!&rdquo; said North. &ldquo;Now, Mrs Varian, have you a really good safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have. My husband had it sent up here with our trunks. It looks like a  wardrobe trunk, but it is a modern and secure safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  safe was in a closet in the library, and as the men examined it, they agreed  that it was a good safe and proof against even a most skilful burglar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  he carries it off,&rdquo; suggested North. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very large.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s very heavy,&rdquo; Minna said, &ldquo;and besides, it&rsquo;s clamped to the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  put the parcel of money in the safe, tucked it well back behind less important  matters, and Minna herself closed the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  use the same combination Fred used,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;nobody on earth knows it but  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  it to yourself, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; North counseled her, &ldquo;a secret shared is no  secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not afraid to trust you two,&rdquo; Minna returned, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t tell any one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  had no further communication from the kidnappers?&rdquo; asked Granniss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a letter came in this morning&rsquo;s mail. I don&rsquo;t know what to do  about it. It&rsquo;s so strange,&mdash;and yet,&mdash;I feel a positive conviction that I ought  to do as they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  they ask, I beg of you not to decide until Mr Wise gets here,&rdquo; Rodney said,  earnestly. &ldquo;Since I have seen him, I know he will help us, and I feel sure that  he would disapprove of your going ahead with this until he can advise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do they ask you to do?&rdquo; North inquired; &ldquo;that is, if you care to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m glad to tell you, and see what you think. I know it might be a better plan  to wait for Mr Wise&rsquo;s arrival, but that may scare off these people and lose me  my one and only chance to meet their demands,&mdash;and&mdash;get my Betty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  the letter?&rdquo; asked Granniss, looking very serious.</p>
  <p>Minna  handed him a paper, and the two men read it at the same time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is your one and only chance to get back your daughter. Unless you obey these  directions exactly and secretly you have no chance at all. At midnight,  tonight, take the packet of money, if you have it, and drop it over the cliff  into the sea. First you must place it in a light pasteboard box that is too  large for it. This will insure its floating until we can pick it up. Now if you  have told any one of this and if there is any boat on the sea at that time, we  will not carry out our plans, the money will be lost and your daughter will be  killed. So, take your choice of acting in good faith or losing your child  forever. We are desperately in earnest and this is your one and only chance. If  you fear to go to the cliff&rsquo;s edge alone, you may take a companion but only one  who is in your faith and confidence. If you breathe a word to the police we  shall know of it, and we will call off all our arrangements. It is up to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no signature. The paper and typing were like those of the previous letter  from the same source, and the tenor of the letter seemed to be an ultimatum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think of it for a minute,&rdquo; urged Granniss. &ldquo;You are simply throwing away a  large sum of money and you cannot possibly get any return. If the thing were  genuine, if it were from real kidnappers who really had Betty, they would have  given you a sign, a proof that they have her. They would have enclosed a scrap  of her handwriting or some such thing. That telegram is of course a fake! This  letter proves it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  looked dubious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be right, Granniss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you are. But,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t help thinking  there may be some way to foil these people. Suppose Mrs Varian throws a faked  packet over the cliff&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Granniss declared, &ldquo;that would do no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a minute,&rdquo; North went on; &ldquo;then we could have a swift motor boat hidden in the  shadows, and follow the boat that picks it up,&mdash;for I have no doubt that they  will come for the money in a motor boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; Rod agreed, &ldquo;but it will be a boat more powerful than  any we have around here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo;  broke in Minna, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t play them false. I shall either follow their  instructions in good faith, or not do it at all. I&rsquo;m sure if I try to fool  them, they&rsquo;ll take it out on Betty.&rdquo; She began to cry, and North said, hastily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let me influence you, Mrs Varian. You must do just as you please in the matter.  If you feel that the mere chance of getting Betty by such means is sufficient  to justify your equal chance of losing all that money,&mdash;you must follow your own  wishes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  Varian sat for several moments in deep thought. Then she said, quietly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  made up my mind. I shall not do this thing tonight. I am more influenced by  Rodney&rsquo;s remark about the telegram than anything else. As he says, if these  people really had Betty, they would send a note in her writing and not a  telegram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the way to look at it, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; cried Granniss, much pleased at her logical  decision. &ldquo;The telegram was a mistake on their part. To begin with, if Betty is  closely confined, which she must be, if there&rsquo;s any truth at all in this  matter, how could she get out to send a telegram? And if they sent it for  her,&mdash;why not a note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all true,&rdquo; said North, thoughtfully; &ldquo;and when Mr Wise gets here, he can  doubtless discern the real truth of it all. The money will be all right in the  safe over night, and tomorrow the detective can look after it. Then you&rsquo;re  decided, Mrs Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  decided for the present,&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled a little; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t say I won&rsquo;t change  my mind. It&rsquo;s a terrible temptation to do as they bid me, even if it proves a  false hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  went away, and poor Minna spent the rest of that day in alternate decisions for  and against the directions of the kidnappers.</p>
  <p>Granniss  tried his best to dissuade her from what he deemed a foolish deed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  begin with,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe in kidnappers. How could they have  abducted Betty, in broad daylight, with half a dozen people looking for her to  come out of the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said poor Minna, dejectedly, &ldquo;but oh, Rodney, it doesn&rsquo;t mean  anything to ask such questions as that! For how could any other thing happen? I  mean, how do you explain Betty&rsquo;s disappearance without being kidnapped, any  more easily than by such means? How explain Fred&rsquo;s death? How explain anything?  Now, the only chance,&mdash;as the letter says,&mdash;is this plan of theirs. Shall I try  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at it this way, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; Granniss said at last. &ldquo;Suppose you throw that  money over the cliff. It&rsquo;s by no means certain that they will retrieve it  safely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that&rsquo;s their business. It&rsquo;s full moon now, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock the sea will  be bright as day. There&rsquo;ll be no spying boat around at that hour, and they will  watch the box fall, get it quickly, and go away. Then they will send Betty  back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna&rsquo;s  face always lighted up with a happy radiance when she spoke of the return of  Betty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  think a minute. Suppose by some chance they don&rsquo;t get the money,&mdash;suppose there  is some stray boat out at that hour. Suppose the parcel gets caught on the way  down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t if I drop it right down from the overhang. And I&rsquo;d have you to protect  and watch over my own safety,&mdash;oh, Rodney, I <i>must</i> do it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so, despite Granniss&rsquo; dissuasion, in defiance of her own misgivings as to the  genuineness of the anonymous bargainers, the poor distracted mother made up her  mind to take the slim chance of recovering her lost child by the desperate  method offered her.</p>
  <p>But  an unforeseen difficulty prevented her.</p>
  <p>Shortly  before midnight the sky clouded over and became entirely black. A terrific  thunderstorm followed, and when that was over the whole heavens remained  darkened and a drizzling rain kept up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  out of the question,&rdquo; Granniss said, as the clock struck twelve. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still  raining, it&rsquo;s pitch dark, nobody could see a parcel dropped over the cliffs,  and you might lose your own life in the process. But, let this comfort you, if  these people are really the kidnappers, they will give you another chance. They  won&rsquo;t lose their chance of a fortune for a rainstorm, and they&rsquo;ll communicate  with you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  probably true, Rod,&rdquo; and Minna gave a sigh of relief as she gazed out of the  window at the rain. &ldquo;And so, let&rsquo;s go to rest and try to hope for a future  opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Fletcher was waiting to put her patient to bed, and was much displeased at her  late hour of retiring.</p>
  <p>So,  little was said by either of the women, and at last with a curt good night, the  nurse went away to her own room, and Minna closed the door between.</p>
  <p>But  she could not sleep, she was restless and nervous.</p>
  <p>At  last she began to worry over the safety of the money in the safe. She imagined  the thwarted kidnappers, disappointed at the collapse of their plans, coming up  to the house to rob her of the money they had reason to suppose she had in her  possession.</p>
  <p>To  her anxious and worried mind, it seemed the money would be safer up in her own  room than down in the library safe.</p>
  <p>On  a sudden impulse she determined to go down stairs and get it. She donned  dressing gown and slippers and stealthily, not to awake Fletcher, she crept  down the stairs.</p>
  <p>Into  the library she went and, opening the closet door, began to work the combination  that unlocked the safe.</p>
  <p>Absorbed  in her occupation, she did not hear a slight noise behind her. But suddenly a  voice said; softly, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, ma&rsquo;am! I thought it was a robber!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Minna  turned quickly to see Martha, the waitress, staring at her.</p>
  <p>As  she already had the safe door open and was about to take out the parcel she was  after, she was annoyed at any interruption.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Martha!&rdquo;  she exclaimed, though in a low whisper, &ldquo;what are you doing here? Go back to  bed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am. I thought I heard robbers, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  it&rsquo;s only I. I have to see about some important papers, and I can&rsquo;t sleep, so  I&rsquo;m attending to it now. Go back to your room at once, Martha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and the girl obeyed.</p>
  <p>Drawing  a sigh of relief, Minna took her precious parcel, shut the safe, and went  softly back to her own room. She put the package beneath her mattress, locked  her bedroom door, and soon fell asleep, worn out with weariness and exhaustion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  doin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; grumbled the cook, as Martha, who shared her room, returned to it,  &ldquo;where you been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush  up,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;I heard a noise and I thought it was burglars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you went downstairs!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah. &ldquo;Why, what foolishness! They might &rsquo;a&rsquo;  shot you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  wasn&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; Martha explained. &ldquo;It was Mrs Varian, poking about in her safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  pore leddy,&rdquo; said Hannah, sympathetically; &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t sleep at all, at all. The  nurse tells me she lies awake nearly all night and only gets forty winks in the  morning after sun-up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she was a bit upset at my coming in,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone, only I  thought it was my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you and your duty!&rdquo; growled the cook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; your duty is to keep quiet  and let me get a bit of sleep myself. I can&rsquo;t do without it as you and the  missus can!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hannah  grunted as she turned over and promptly went to sleep again, while Martha, who  was both imaginative and curious of mind, lay awake, wondering what fearful  things had happened or would happen to this strange house.</p>
  <p>The  girl was of a fearless nature, but deeply interested in the mysterious, and had  more than once made investigations herself in an effort to find some secret  passage such as the family were continually discussing.</p>
  <p>But  she had found nothing, and now, still unable to sleep, she occupied her mind in  trying to form some new theory of the tragedies of Headland House.</p>
  <p>Hannah  awakened in the morning by reason of the alarm sounding from her bedroom clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  goodness,&rdquo; she growled, to herself, &ldquo;seems like I&rsquo;d only just dropped to sleep.  Well,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to get up. Hey, Martha, come along, my girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no response came from the other bed, and Hannah stepped across the room to give  the girl an arousing shake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  heaven bless us, she ain&rsquo;t here!&rdquo; exclaimed the startled cook. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t that  beat all! Not content with rampoosin&rsquo; round the house in the night, she must be  up and off early in the mornin&rsquo;! She thinks she&rsquo;s able to help them as has the  detective work in charge! That Martha!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hannah  proceeded to make her toilet and then descended the back stairs to the kitchen.</p>
  <p>But  on reaching the kitchen she gave voice to such a scream as could be heard by  all the servants in the house, and even penetrated to the rooms occupied by  Minna and her nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  is the matter?&rdquo; cried Fletcher, running out to the hall in her night clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matter  enough,&rdquo; Hannah called back. &ldquo;Will you get Mr Granniss, and tell him to come  quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stunned  by the cook&rsquo;s voice and manner, the nurse hurriedly knocked at Rodney&rsquo;s door,  and he responded at once.</p>
  <p>He  was partly dressed, and finishing a hasty toilet, he ran down stairs.</p>
  <p>He  found Hannah, and Kelly, the butler, gazing at a huddled heap on the kitchen  floor, which he saw at once, was the dead body of Martha, the waitress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo; he asked, in an awed voice. &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who,  indeed, sir?&rdquo; Hannah said, whimpering like a child. &ldquo;Oh, Mr Granniss, sir, do  get Mrs Varian to go away from this accursed house! Nobody is safe here! I&rsquo;m  leaving as soon&rsquo;s I can pack up. Kelly, here, is going, too,&mdash;and I hope the  missus will go this very day. It&rsquo;s curst indeed, is this place! Oh, Martha, me  little girl,&mdash;who could &rsquo;a&rsquo; done this to ye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Going  nearer, Rodney looked at the body, touched it and felt for the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>There  was no heartbeat and the cold flesh proved her death took place some hours  since.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know about it?&rdquo; he asked the cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a thing, sir. Martha was down stairs late last night, and she came up again,  saying Mrs Varian was down in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Varian down stairs! At what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Long  about one o&rsquo;clock, sir. Then me and Martha both went to sleep,&mdash;leastways, I  did, and that&rsquo;s all I knew till morning. Then I went to call the girl to get  up, and her bed was empty. I came down&mdash;and here I saw&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Throwing  her apron over her face, Hannah rocked back and forth in her chair.</p>
  <p>Rodney  forced himself to think,&mdash;to give orders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hannah,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we mustn&rsquo;t touch Martha,&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll have to get  breakfast,&mdash;just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t, sir&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get the breakfast, with that poor dead girl,&mdash;why, I loved  that young one like she was my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Hannah, remember your duty to Mrs Varian. Now, we&rsquo;ll lay a coverlet over Martha,  and you and Kelly between you must prepare the coffee, and such things as Mrs  Varian wants. Be brave now, for there&rsquo;s enough sorrow for Mrs Varian to bear.  You and Kelly must do whatever you can to help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Rodney looked hastily at all the doors and windows, finding them all securely  fastened, as they always were at night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  goodness, Wise is coming today,&rdquo; he thought, as he went to telephone for  Sheriff Potter again.</p>
  <p>Potter  summoned, he turned his mind to the question of how best to tell the news to  Minna, and concluded to tell Nurse Fletcher first.</p>
  <p>She  came down then, greatly excited, to learn what had happened.</p>
  <p>Granniss  told her, and then said, &ldquo;Now Mrs Fletcher, I beg of you, don&rsquo;t threaten to  leave. Mrs Varian needs you now more than ever, and as Mr Wise, the great  detective, is coming today, I&rsquo;m sure you need not be afraid to stay on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; Fletcher returned, primly, &ldquo;I know my duty, and I propose to do it. I  will stay with Mrs Varian until she can get some one else,&mdash;or until I can get  some one else for her,&mdash;but not an hour longer. How did the maid die?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, exactly,&rdquo; Rodney looked puzzled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it best to touch  the body, except to convince myself that she is really dead. Now, will you tell  Mrs Varian, or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell her,&mdash;but I&rsquo;d like you to stand by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So,  taking Minna&rsquo;s breakfast tray, quite as usual, the nurse went back to her  patient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; was the greeting she received. &ldquo;I overheard enough to know  what has happened. It&rsquo;s awful,&mdash;but I suppose it&rsquo;s only the beginning of a  further string of tragedies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  utter hopelessness of the white face alarmed Granniss more than a hysterical  outburst would have done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mrs Varian,&rdquo; he said, consolingly, &ldquo;it is an awful occurrence, but in comparison  with your nearer sorrows, it means little to you. Try not to think about it;  leave it to us and trust me to do all that is necessary or possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Potter  arrived then, and Granniss went down to receive him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another!&rdquo;  the sheriff exclaimed. &ldquo;What devil&rsquo;s work is going on here, any way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went to the kitchen and knelt beside the dead girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strangled,&rdquo;  he said, briefly, after an examination. &ldquo;Choked to death by a strong pair of  man&rsquo;s hands. Mr Granniss, I accuse you of the murder of this girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    Pennington Wise</b></h2>
  <p>Granniss  looked at the constable blankly. Then he said, &ldquo;Oh, well, you may as well  accuse me as anybody, for the present. Where&rsquo;s Dunn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  coming,&rdquo; replied Potter, angry at the young man&rsquo;s indifference to his charge.  &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t treat this matter so scornfully, Mr Granniss. I&rsquo;ve been thinking  a whole lot about you in connection with all these mysteries up here, and I&rsquo;m  of the opinion you know more about some things than you admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right, I do,&rdquo; said Rod, cheerfully. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t arrest me just yet, for a really  worth while detective is coming this morning and he may disagree with your  conclusions. But this is a bad thing,&mdash;about this poor girl. I can&rsquo;t understand  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can,&rdquo; and Potter looked straight at him. &ldquo;You found her in your way and&mdash;you put  her out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Sheriff,&rdquo; this from Bill Dunn, who had come hurrying in, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go  off half-primed! You haven&rsquo;t any evidence against Mr Granniss, except that he  was in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will have, though!&rdquo; Potter muttered. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the butler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am,&rdquo; and Kelly put in his appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  saw this girl last?&rdquo; Potter thundered, glaring round at the assembled members  of the household. They were all present, for Nurse Fletcher had been unable to  resist her aroused curiosity, and Minna Varian, too, stood in the background,  composed and quiet, but evidently holding herself together by a strong effort  of will-power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; said Hannah, who stood, silent and grim, with folded arms, watching the  sheriff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was she, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  her bed,&mdash;last night after midnight. She had been down stairs,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  midnight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She heard somebody down stairs, and&mdash;Martha was a brave one! She thought it was  robbers in the house and she went down to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it was Mrs Varian, who had gone down to the library. So Martha came up again,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaving  Mrs Varian down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Minna interrupted, &ldquo;leaving me down there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were you doing, Mrs Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was wakeful, and I went down to the library to look over some papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this girl came to you there? Tell the story in your own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  little to tell. I was startled at Martha&rsquo;s unexpected appearance, and sent her  back to her room. Shortly afterward, I went back to my own room. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Martha must have come down stairs again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is quite evident,&rdquo; said Minna, looking sorrowfully at the dead girl. &ldquo;Oh, Mr  Potter,&mdash;Rodney,&mdash;what <i>does</i> it all  mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will take a lot of clearing up, ma&rsquo;am, before anybody can say what it means.  Where were you at this time, Kelly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my own room, asleep,&rdquo; answered the butler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard nothing of the goings on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  my room is up in the third story, and I sleep very soundly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  You do? Well, how about the doors and windows? I suppose they were locked and  barred as usual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they were,&rdquo; asserted Kelly. &ldquo;I always look after those,&mdash;especially nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there was no way for an intruder to get in this house, last night, between  midnight, say, and morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  way, sir,&rdquo; assented Kelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this girl was murdered by either you, Kelly, or by Mr Granniss. Those marks on  her throat of a strangling hold, were made by a man,&mdash;and by a strong man.  Either of you two could have done it,&mdash;now, which one did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I, sir,&rdquo; Kelly denied, as calmly as if he were merely refuting a slight  accusation. &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe you do,&rdquo; said Potter, judicially, &ldquo;but I do think you&rsquo;re implicated,  Mr Granniss. Were you in your room all night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I was. I retired about one o&rsquo;clock, and I didn&rsquo;t open my door again  until I was summoned this morning to learn of Martha&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say that glibly enough,&mdash;but it will take some proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  your denial of it, or suspicion of my veracity will take the proof. Can you  produce it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not wise to be so cocksure, sir. There is such a thing as elimination, and I  say that only you could have done this thing. The women are not capable of such  a deed, and I&rsquo;ve no reason to suspect Kelly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  just what is your reason for suspecting me?&rdquo; Rodney&rsquo;s eyes were beginning to  grow stern and his jaw set firmly. &ldquo;Also, what evidence have you for your  suspicions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  off, Potter,&rdquo; Bill Dunn warned him. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t got no real evidence against Mr  Granniss, and you&rsquo;d better go easy. To my mind, Mr Granniss ain&rsquo;t going to kill  a servant girl without a good reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may have a very good reason. Suppose Mr Granniss was at the safe and suppose  Martha surprised him there as she had startled Mrs Varian. And suppose Mr  Granniss didn&rsquo;t want it known that he had been there, so he took the only sure  method of silencing her lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what would Mr Granniss be doing at the safe?&rdquo; asked Dunn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I happen to know that there was considerable of value in that safe last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rodney  started. How did the sheriff know that?</p>
  <p>But  he said, &ldquo;This is aside the mark, Mr Potter. For Mrs Varian has trusted me with  the combination of the safe. I can open it at any time without let or  hindrance. Why, then, should I sneak down in the middle of the night to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the very good reason that you wanted to take the money that was there and make  off with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did I get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say not,&rdquo; declared Potter, &ldquo;since you are still here!&rdquo; He looked proud  of this triumph of deduction, and went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had some valuables in that safe last night, Mrs Varian, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Minna, almost smiling at the trend of the questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  they there now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!  What did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they are not there, because when I visited the library late last night, I took  them away to my room for better protection of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Potter looked deeply chagrined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have them safe, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, quite safe, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  all the same,&rdquo; went on the sheriff, doggedly, &ldquo;Mr Granniss thought they were  there, and went down to steal them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  Martha was there on the same errand,&rdquo; said Dunn, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you dare say a word against that pore dead child,&rdquo; cried Hannah, resenting at  once any aspersion of her friend. &ldquo;She would never dream of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she come down for, then?&rdquo; asked Potter. &ldquo;She had been down and had spoken  to Mrs Varian. Then she returned to her room, you say, and went back to bed.  Now, why did she go down again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I do not know,&rdquo; Hannah said, belligerently, &ldquo;but it was for no wrong purpose.  Maybe she thought again she heard burglars, and maybe,&mdash;this time she was not  mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be a fine theory,&rdquo; Potter observed, &ldquo;but for the fact that a burglar  couldn&rsquo;t get in or out. So if she heard any one prowling about it must have  been some member of the household. Isn&rsquo;t she a very daring young person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was afraid of nothing,&rdquo; Hannah stated. &ldquo;She was great for detective stories,  and she was crazy to investigate and inquire into all the goin&rsquo;s on of this  terrible house! Martha was a dabster at puzzles. She was terrible quick-witted,  and sensed out everything&mdash;like a ferret! I never saw her beat at findin&rsquo; out  things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would explain why an evil-doer, if there was one, would put her out of the way  rather than have her live to tell of his depredations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, sir,&rdquo; Hannah conceded, &ldquo;if so be&rsquo;s you put it that way. But don&rsquo;t you  accuse that innocent girl of any wrongdoings herself, for she never did!  Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does look that way,&rdquo; Rodney said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;If Martha had that investigating  proclivity, that would explain her reappearance down stairs,&mdash;that is, if there  was a burglar,&mdash;yet, how could there be one? As usual, we&rsquo;re reasoning round in  a circle. Now, Mr Potter, I think your conclusions are logical and probable,  except in so far as they drag me into this thing. I didn&rsquo;t leave my room last  night at all. But I shall be at your disposal any time you want to question me  further on the subject. Now, I want to go to the library and attend to my daily  routine of business matters. Also, Mr Wise will arrive before noon, and perhaps  his skill may be helpful to your inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shortly  before noon Pennington Wise did arrive.</p>
  <p>He  brought with him a strange, almost weird little girl creature, who ran up the  steps and into the house before him.</p>
  <p>Granniss  had opened the door to them, and after greeting Wise, he turned to the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  assistant,&rdquo; Wise said, carelessly. &ldquo;Name, Zizi. Give her over to the housekeeper,  she&rsquo;ll take care of herself. Where&rsquo;s the library&mdash;or living room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quite  apparently tired from the steep walk up the cliff, Wise sank into a chair that  Rodney placed for him. They stayed in the hall, which was large and square, and  was often used as a sitting room.</p>
  <p>Zizi,  however, dropping her bag in the hall, darted toward the dining room and thence  to the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  she cried, to Hannah, &ldquo;are you the cook? Do give me some tea and toast or  something,&mdash;I&rsquo;m famished! My heavens! Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  bent over the dead girl, whose body still lay on the kitchen floor.</p>
  <p>Martha  was clad only in a kimono, over her nightdress, and wore bedroom slippers but  no stockings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hopped  out of bed and ran down suddenly, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; commented the strange girl.  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t even stop to pin up her hair. Must have heard somebody that she was  pretty sure was burglaring, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have run down again on the chance  of its being Mrs Varian the second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know all about it?&rdquo; asked Hannah, aghast, at the remarkable person that  had invaded her kitchen. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right! Martha was too cute to be caught in  a mistake twice,&mdash;she must have been sure it was not Mrs Varian again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  chauffeur, who met us at the train, told us about this poor girl.&rdquo; Zizi&rsquo;s black  eyes snapped as she delicately touched the awful bruises on Martha&rsquo;s throat.  &ldquo;Small doubt what did for her! Brute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kneeling  down, she ran her tiny fingers lightly over the body, and finally scrutinized  the hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look,  Hannah,&rdquo; she said, quietly, and held open the left hand.</p>
  <p>It  showed a dark green streak, of some sort, that spread entirely across the palm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paint?&rdquo;  asked Hannah, not specially interested. &ldquo;Our porch chairs have been painted  lately,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t see how she got out on the porch. Though o&rsquo; course, she  could &rsquo;a&rsquo; done so. That Martha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  then Potter and Bill Dunn returned, and said they were ready to take the body  of the girl down to the village, where her parents lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a good job to get it out of this house,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;I tell you, Potter, poor  Martha&rsquo;s death has nothin&rsquo; to do with those other horrors up here; and Mrs  Varian has all she can stagger under without the extra sorrow and trouble of a  servant girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  commanded Zizi, for her ringing tone was nothing less than commanding, &ldquo;wait,  till Mr Wise sees this girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  ran for the detective, who came at once.</p>
  <p>The  sheriff gazed with eager curiosity at the great city detective, and sniffed to  see that he was a mere human being after all. He saw only a good-looking, well  set up man, with chestnut hair, brushed back from a broad forehead, and sharp  blue eyes that were kindly of expression but keen of observation.</p>
  <p>But  the astute Bill Dunn saw more than this. He recognized the air of efficiency,  the subtle hint of power, the whole effect of generalship which fairly emanated  from this quiet-mannered man.</p>
  <p>There  was no bustle about Pennington Wise, no self-assertion, but to those blessed  with perceptions he gave an instant impression of sure reasoning and inerrant  judgment.</p>
  <p>He  glanced quickly at Zizi, caught the almost imperceptible motion of her own  little bird claw of a hand, and then, without seeming to notice her at all, he  spoke genially to the two men, and nodded sympathetically at the cook.</p>
  <p>And  they all liked him. If asked why, they could not have told, but his manner and  attitude were so friendly, his mien so inoffensive and his cordial acceptance  of each of them was so pleasant that he was instantly in their good graces.</p>
  <p>Even  the sheriff, who had been fully prepared to dislike and distrust this city  wizard, capitulated gladly, and was ready to subscribe to all his theories,  deductions and decisions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  bad,&rdquo; Wise said, with real feeling, as he knelt by Martha&rsquo;s side. And few could  have seen, unmoved, the bright young face of the strong healthy girl who had  been so brutally done to death.</p>
  <p>Gently,  he lifted her chin and examined the black bruises on her throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finger-prints?&rdquo;  suggested Potter, eager to show the city man his familiarity with modern  methods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo;  Wise said. &ldquo;I doubt much could be learned that way,&mdash;the bruise is so deep.  Perhaps there may be prints of the ruffian&rsquo;s hands on her clothing. You might  try it out, Mr Potter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then,  while the two men were speaking to each other about the matter, Wise  unobtrusively looked at the inside of the girl&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>On  the left palm he saw the long smear of dark green, and after quick but careful  scrutiny, he bent lower and smelled of it. Then he closed the dead hand and  rose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may take away the body, Sheriff,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so far as I am concerned. She has  people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Parents and sisters. Oh, it&rsquo;s a sorry thing for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is so,&rdquo; and then Wise let his perceiving eyes roam over the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you searched the floor well for anything that may have been dropped?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; the sheriff answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all been done, Mr Wise. We&rsquo;re plain country  folks here, but we know a thing or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of that,&rdquo; Wise assented. &ldquo;Did you look under the dresser and beneath that  corner cupboard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no; we didn&rsquo;t think it necessary to go so far as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  not; most likely not. Yet, I wish, Hannah, you&rsquo;d get a broom and just run it  under there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do it,&rdquo; volunteered Kelly, who had come to the kitchen.</p>
  <p>He  brought a broom, and brushing under the two dressers, brought out some dust,  some threads and shreds and two yellow beads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s?&rdquo;  asked Wise, quietly, picking up the beads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  exclaimed Hannah, staring at them. &ldquo;Miss Betty&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Varian&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Wise was himself surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; the very ones she wore the day&mdash;the day she&mdash;was lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take charge of them,&rdquo; he said, simply, and put them in his pocket.</p>
  <p>Kelly  and his broom failed to find anything further, and suddenly realizing the side  light it gave on her housekeeping habits, Hannah began to explain how  everything was going at sixes and sevens of late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it would,&rdquo; Zizi soothed her, as Wise returned to the hall. &ldquo;Now, Hannah,  tell me, did you find anywhere, any more of Miss Betty&rsquo;s beads?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found two, when I was sweepin&rsquo; here one day. But I slipped &rsquo;em in this drawer  an&rsquo; never remembered them again. Here they be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  retrieved the two beads, and Zizi took them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she wear a long string of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  miss, a fairly short string. About like that you&rsquo;ve on yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi&rsquo;s  modest little string of black beads hung perhaps four inches below her throat.  She examined the yellow beads, saw they were of amber, and put them away in her  little handbag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Hannah,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you and I are friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  that I&rsquo;m proud to be, miss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you must help me all you can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help  you what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  out the truth about Miss Betty,&mdash;and perhaps,&mdash;find her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you,&mdash;are you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;m a detective,&mdash;that is, I&rsquo;m the assistant of Mr Wise, and he&rsquo;s the greatest  detective in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he that, now?&rdquo; and Kelly, unable to resist the fascination of this queer visitor,  joined the group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is. And he is going to solve the whole mystery,&mdash;if we all help. And, maybe  we&rsquo;ll help best by doing nothing. And especially by saying nothing. So, you two  keep quite still about finding these beads, won&rsquo;t you, and about matters in  general. You talk over things with the villagers, I suppose, but don&rsquo;t say  anything about what happens up here now. Discuss the past, all you like, but  not the present. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  didn&rsquo;t see clearly, but they were more than ready to promise whatever this girl  asked, and then between the two, Zizi was served with such a luncheon as might  have befitted a royal guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness,  gracious, sakes alive!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t bring me anything more, I beg of  you. I shall go to sleep like an anaconda and not wake up for six months!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then,  while the detective ate his luncheon at the table with Minna Varian and her  secretary, Zizi went in search of the nurse.</p>
  <p>She  found Mrs Fletcher eating her meal from a tray in her sitting room. It hurt her  pride to do this, but Minna Varian declared that she saw quite enough of  Fletcher between meals and must have some respite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice  to eat alone, I think,&rdquo; was Zizi&rsquo;s observation as she entered, uninvited, and  perched herself on the arm of a nearby chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  Fletcher, aren&rsquo;t you? Now, won&rsquo;t you please tell me some things confidentially?  I see, you&rsquo;re a woman of deep perceptions, and are not to be caught napping.  Tell me, do you think Mrs Varian went down stairs a second time last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she did not,&rdquo; asserted the nurse. She was flattered at Zizi&rsquo;s attitude and  would have told her anything she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t go to sleep myself, you see, till Mrs Varian is asleep. So I always wait  until I hear her steady breathing before I let myself drop off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  statement was too surely true to be disbelieved and Zizi went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who was it that Martha heard downstairs, that she went down a second time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  she didn&rsquo;t hear anybody. Maybe she went down to see what she could pick up  herself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steal,  do you mean? Oh, for shame! To accuse a poor, dead girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Fletcher looked ashamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  oughtn&rsquo;t to,&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose. But, Miss, what else is there to think? I well know how  this house is locked up of nights; nobody from outside could get in. The other  servants are as honest as the day, and though I&rsquo;ve no real reason to suspect  Martha, yet there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any other way to look,&mdash;does there, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  way may turn up,&rdquo; said Zizi. &ldquo;Tell me more about Betty,&mdash;Miss Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you from having known her, for I never saw the girl, but since I&rsquo;ve  been taking care of Mrs Varian there&rsquo;s little I don&rsquo;t know about the whole  family. She&rsquo;s nervous, you know, and so she talks incessantly, when we&rsquo;re  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  though, to cast any light on Miss Varian&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; nothing but sort of reminiscences about her husband and how good he was to  her, and how she grieves for him,&mdash;and for her child. Poor woman,&mdash;it&rsquo;s fearful  to hear her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be,&rdquo; said Zizi, sympathetically; &ldquo;my heart bleeds for that poor tortured  soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    Clues</b></h2>
  <p>It  was after luncheon, in the library, that Pennington Wise began his real  business of the investigation of the Varian mysteries.</p>
  <p>First  of all, he desired to look over the papers in Mr Varian&rsquo;s desk, and with the assistance  of Granniss, he was soon in possession of the principal facts to be learned  that way.</p>
  <p>Moreover,  he discovered some things not yet taken into consideration by the local  detectives, and he read with interest a number of letters that were carefully  filed, apparently for preservation.</p>
  <p>Rapidly  he scanned them and tossed them aside, retaining a few for further  consideration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;that a most important fact in the case  is the strange bequest of the Varian pearls to your husband&rsquo;s niece instead of  to his daughter. Can you explain this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot,&rdquo; said Minna, &ldquo;it seems to me absolutely unexplainable. For generations  those pearls have descended from parent to child,&mdash;sometimes a mother owned  them, sometimes a father, but they were always given to the oldest daughter,  or, if there were no daughter, then to a son. Only in case of a childless  inheritor did they go to a niece or nephew. Why my husband should so definitely  bequeath them to his niece,&mdash;I cannot imagine. I&rsquo;ve thought over that for hours,  but I can&rsquo;t understand it I will say frankly, that Betty and her father  frequently had differences of opinion, but nothing more than many families  have. They were really devoted to one another, but both were of decided, even  obstinate nature, and when they disagreed they were apt to argue the matter  out, and as a result of it, they did sometimes lose their temper and really  quarreled. But it always blew over quickly and they were good friends again. I  never paid any attention to their little squabbles, for I knew them both too well  to think they were really at enmity. But this matter of the pearls looks as if  my husband had a positive dislike for the child, and as a mark of spite or  punishment left the pearls away from her. It makes little difference, if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think about that, Mrs Varian,&rdquo; said Wise, kindly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m considering this strange  clause of Mr Varian&rsquo;s will from the viewpoint of the whole mystery. It may  prove a clue, you see. I want to say, right now, that the whole affair is the  greatest and most baffling puzzle I have ever known of. The disappearance of  your daughter and the death of your husband offer no solution that seems to me  possible,&mdash;let alone probable. I can set up no theory that does not include a  secret passage of some sort. And though I am emphatically informed there is  none, yet, as you may imagine, I must investigate that for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  found the house plans,&rdquo; said a low, thin little voice, and the strange girl,  Zizi, appeared in the room. That slender little wisp of humanity had an uncanny  way of being present and absent, suddenly, and without explanation. She was  there, and then she wasn&rsquo;t there,&mdash;but her goings and comings were so noiseless  and unobtrusive that they were never noticed.</p>
  <p>Pennington  Wise held out his hand without a word. Zizi gave over a bulky roll of papers  and subsided.</p>
  <p>Unrolling  the time-yellowed sheets, they saw that they really were the old contractor&rsquo;s  plans of the house.</p>
  <p>With  a sigh of satisfaction Wise commenced to study them,&mdash;Granniss looking over his  shoulder.</p>
  <p>Minna  sat quietly, her nervousness lost in her eager anticipation of the new  detective&rsquo;s successful quest.</p>
  <p>The  two men studied the plans carefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish North could see these,&rdquo; Rodney said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s of an architectural bent, Mr  Wise, and he measured the house all over, trying to find an unexplained bit of  space. According to these plans, North is right, and there isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  of an architectural bent myself,&rdquo; Wise smiled, &ldquo;and I agree, there&rsquo;s no foot of  room left unaccounted for on these papers. Of course a secret passage could  have been built in, in contradiction of the plans, but I can&rsquo;t think there is  any such, after your own search. It might be out-of-doors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we would have seen anyone going in or out of the house,&rdquo; Minna explained. &ldquo;We  were all watching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  back doors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  only one,&rdquo; Rodney told him. &ldquo;And that was locked on the inside. Locked and  bolted. No, whatever happened, nobody came in through the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you assume an intruder, then, Mr Wise?&rdquo; Minna asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am obliged to, Mrs Varian. To begin with the only fact we can positively  affirm, Mr Varian was shot,&mdash;and not by his own hand. This we assume because of  the absence of the weapon. Now, either Miss Betty shot him or someone else did.  I can&rsquo;t think the daughter did it, for it&rsquo;s against the probabilities in every  way,&mdash;though, of course, it&rsquo;s a possibility. But the difficulties in the way of  explaining what the girl did with herself afterward, seem to me greater than  the objections to assuming an intruder from outside. I mean from outside the  family,&mdash;not from outside the house. The explanation of his entrance and exit is  no more of a puzzle than the explanation of Miss Varian&rsquo;s exit. And I think we  must dismiss the idea that the girl concealed herself in this house,&mdash;whether  alive or&mdash;a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  girl didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; came Zizi&rsquo;s low murmur. She was sitting on an ottoman, near  Minna, and now and then she caressed the hand of her hostess. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big  mind at the back of all this. And you&rsquo;re overlooking the death of the maid last  night Why, Penny, it&rsquo;s all of a piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;;  and Wise roused himself from a brown study. &ldquo;It is all of a piece, and it  hinges on that bequest of the Varian pearls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hinges  on that?&rdquo; said Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that&rsquo;s a key to the situation. When we learn <i>why</i> Mr Varian made that strange arrangement, we&rsquo;ll be on our way to  a solution of the mystery. But the first thing is to find Miss Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr Wise,&rdquo; Minna cried out, &ldquo;you think she is alive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  very much hope so, and though I don&rsquo;t want to give you false encouragement, I  can&rsquo;t help feeling that she may be,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she is,&rdquo; came Zizi&rsquo;s quiet assurance, and Minna impulsively kissed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a comfort you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;elf, pixie,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to call  you,&mdash;but you bring me courage and hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi&rsquo;s  great dark eyes gave appreciation, but she only said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up against it,  Penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am, indeed,&rdquo; Wise said, very gravely; &ldquo;and my first work must be a deep  investigation of all Mr Varian&rsquo;s affairs. You were entirely in his confidence,  Mrs Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; we had no secrets from one another. He told me all his financial ventures  or business worries. There were none of those of late, but years ago, there  were some. Yes, I may say I know everything that ever happened to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who has been blackmailing him of late, and what for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmail!&rdquo;  Minna looked blank. &ldquo;Never such a thing as that has happened to my husband!&rdquo;  She spoke proudly and positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know of no one who had a hold over Mr Varian,&mdash;or thought he had,&mdash;and who wrote  him threatening letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  assuredly not! And I know that nothing of the sort ever did occur, for he would  most certainly have told me. We were more confidential than most married  people, and we never had secrets from one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  perhaps I am over-imaginative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you think it?&rdquo; asked Minna, curiously; &ldquo;if you have found any letters you  can&rsquo;t explain, show them to me,&mdash;I can doubtless tell you about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Wise handed her a letter.</p>
  <p>It  bore neither date nor address, but it read,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  you accede to my demands, I shall expose you, and the woman you robbed will  claim redress or return of her property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  brief message was signed &ldquo;Step.&rdquo; and Minna read it with a look of utter  perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what it means,&rdquo; she said, handing it back, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s of no  importance. Mr Varian never robbed a woman in his life! The very idea is too  absurd to consider. You are at liberty to hunt it down, Mr Wise, but you will  never find it has a meaning that will reflect on my husband&rsquo;s stainless honor!  You may refer to any of his friends, his relatives or his business associates.  All will tell you that Frederick Varian and dishonesty are contradictory  terms!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may all be true, Mrs Varian, and doubtless is true, but you know blackmailers  are not so scrupulous, and they sometimes find a peg to hang their demands on  even in the case of the most upright. This note is undated, but the envelope  shows it was mailed less than six months ago. Therefore the matter may be still  unsettled, and may have a bearing on the whole case. Could there have been any  family reason that would influence him to leave the pearls away from his  daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! His brother and sister-in-law were quite as much surprised as I was to  learn of that. But, Mr Wise, what do you think about this matter of the  kidnappers asking for ransom? Do you think it is all a fraud?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to look into that as soon as I can. At first glance, it seems fraudulent,  but the wonder is that you haven&rsquo;t had similar letters from other fakers.  However, I am going to work backward. I want, first of all to look about a bit,  for evidences or clues regarding last night&rsquo;s tragedy. I am sure the whole  string of horrors is a connected one, and to find out who killed poor Martha,  will in my opinion be a stepping-stone to the solution of the other mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a clue for you, then,&rdquo; Zizi said, not moving from her seat, but pointing to a  spot on the rug near the safe.</p>
  <p>Wise&rsquo;s  eyes followed her finger&rsquo;s direction and saw a slight mark, as of a dusty  footprint.</p>
  <p>In  a moment, he was on his knees near it, and scrutinized it carefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard of footprint clues,&rdquo; said Granniss, interested, &ldquo;but that is so vague and  imperfect, I don&rsquo;t think you can deduce who made it,&mdash;can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  from the print,&mdash;&rdquo; Wise said,&mdash;thoughtfully, and then added nothing to his  unsatisfactory statement.</p>
  <p>He  then took a paper-cutter from the desk, and scraped onto a bit of smooth paper  what dust he could get from the footprint, and carefully folded it up and put  it in his pocketbook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shoes were you wearing when you visited the safe last night, Mrs Varian?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bedroom  slippers,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you walked anywhere except to traverse the halls and stairs, from your bedroom  down here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  nowhere else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you took that package of money up to your room with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you not done so, it would have been stolen,&rdquo; Wise said, calmly. &ldquo;A thief  visited this safe after you were here,&mdash;he thought the money was here. He was  surprised by the maid, Martha, coming down to spy on him,&mdash;and in order to get  rid of her,&mdash;and save himself, he strangled her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  present stared at him, and Rodney Granniss flushed a deep red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  a disinterested observer, Mr Wise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it might easily appear that I was  that thief. I knew the money had been put in the safe. I did not know Mrs  Varian had removed it. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; interrupted Zizi, &ldquo;you talk too much! If you&rsquo;re going to be suspected,  for the love of cheese, let somebody else do it! Don&rsquo;t meet trouble half way,  and sing out, &lsquo;Pleased to meetcha!&rsquo; Be careful, Mr Granniss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush  up, Zizi,&rdquo; Wise counseled her. &ldquo;Children should be seen and not heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Penny, I&rsquo;ll be good. Now, here&rsquo;s a present for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him the yellow beads given her by the cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Divulge,&rdquo;  he said, briefly, as he stared at the tiny objects in his palm.</p>
  <p>But  Minna Varian had caught sight of them and had recognized them. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried,  &ldquo;Betty! <i>Betty!</i> Those are the beads  she had on that day! Where did you get them? Where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then, before they could answer her, her over-wrought nerves gave way, her calm  broke through the constraint she had put upon it, and she became hysterical.</p>
  <p>Granniss  went at once for Mrs Fletcher, and the nurse took her patiently away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  be all right with Fletcher,&rdquo; Rodney said, returning after he had assisted Minna  to her room; &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be a very bad attack, nurse thinks. Really, I&rsquo;ve been  surprised that Mrs Varian has kept up as well as she has. Now, Mr Wise, tell me  what you suspect regarding Mr Varian? And also, tell me if you suspect me&mdash;in  any way. I plead not guilty,&mdash;and I want to add that Miss Varian and I are  sweethearts. We couldn&rsquo;t call it an engagement for her father wouldn&rsquo;t hear of  such a thing. But we hoped to persuade him in time,&mdash;and truly, I thought he  would finally consent. I&rsquo;m telling you this, so you can see what a deep  interest I have in the recovery of Betty,&mdash;for I am not willing to believe she  is dead. In fact, I believe she has been kidnapped, and though I&rsquo;m not sure  those letters Mrs Varian has received are in good faith,&mdash;yet I believe she is  being held for ransom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whom?&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the kidnapper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  also is the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmailer!&rdquo;  said Zizi, in an awestruck voice. &ldquo;Oh, Penny Wise, how you do jump at a  solution! You just clear all intervening obstacles, and land on the truth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  far from having landed,&rdquo; said Wise, ruefully; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all theory,&mdash;with very  little fact to back it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  these beads are facts,&rdquo; Zizi said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re two more, Penny, from the same  string that you already have a few from. You see, Mr Granniss,&rdquo; she said,  turning to Rod, &ldquo;Mr Wise discovered a few of these beads in the kitchen this  morning, and a little later, I found that the cook had picked up two in the  kitchen the day after Miss Betty&rsquo;s disappearance. The string of them that she  wore was not a long one, but still there were at least a dozen or so more than  we have found. Where are they?&rdquo; She had turned again to Wise as she put this  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the beads well,&rdquo; Granniss said, &ldquo;but how did they get in the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be a simple matter,&rdquo; Wise responded. &ldquo;Perhaps the string broke when she was  out there getting the lemonade. I understand all the servants were away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Penny,&rdquo; Zizi reminded him, &ldquo;in that case the other beads would be about,  somewhere. She would have picked them up and put them in a box or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she would,&rdquo; Rodney agreed, &ldquo;for Betty loved that necklace. She loved anything  yellow. You&rsquo;ve heard about the yellow pillow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Wise. &ldquo;Do try, Mr Granniss, to tell me everything. I was called to this  case altogether too late. Much could have been done had I been here sooner.  But, now tell me every little thing you can think of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Granniss told them of the finding of the yellow satin sofa-pillow in the middle  of the kitchen floor. He obtained the pillow from the hall and showed it to  them.</p>
  <p>Zizi  scrutinized it with her eager black eyes, and carefully extracted from its  embroidered design a small fine hairpin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  invisible,&rdquo; she said, holding it up to the light. &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s,&mdash;I daresay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and Granniss looked at it. &ldquo;She wore dinky little ones like that in her front  hair. All girls do, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may mean something or nothing,&rdquo; Wise said, musingly. &ldquo;If Miss Varian was in the  habit of lying on the hall sofa, the hairpin may have been caught in the  cushion some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Granniss said; &ldquo;I never was here while&mdash;when Betty was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  aside from the hairpin, what about the yellow pillow, on the kitchen floor,  Penny?&rdquo; Zizi asked, looking up into the detective&rsquo;s face as at an oracle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a clue, all right,&rdquo; Wise said; &ldquo;oh, if I&rsquo;d only been here that very day! A most  astounding case, and every possible evidence wiped out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, not that,&rdquo; Zizi spoke cheerfully. &ldquo;And now, as you say, you must get busy  in the matter of poor Martha. What about the green streak?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the  detective spoke to Rodney. &ldquo;There was a dull green smear across the palm of  that girl&rsquo;s left hand. I see no freshly painted furniture in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  there wouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Zizi ruminated. &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t paint,&mdash;you know it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looked like paint, and what else would remain there so indelibly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could it be anyway?&rdquo; queried Granniss. &ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t think, myself,&rdquo; and Wise looked nonplussed. &ldquo;I smelled it, but there was  no odor of paint. Nobody around the house uses water colors, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Granniss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was such a smear as might have been made by a paint brush filled with a dull  green watercolor pigment,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t say it was that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was more like a vegetable stain,&rdquo; Zizi suggested. &ldquo;A mark like that could have  been made, by grasping a dish or saucepan that had held spinach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Zizi, that&rsquo;s a little far-fetched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if we find cold spinach in the refrigerator,&rdquo; Zizi persisted. &ldquo;Martha might  have been getting something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case the green smear doesn&rsquo;t count for much,&rdquo; Wise said. &ldquo;But we have  accumulated some clues. We have the yellow beads, the yellow pillow, the green  streak, and last, but by no means least, the dust I scraped from the floor in  this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  the significance of that, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Granniss. &ldquo;Or are you one of those  secretive detectives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. That dust is, to my mind, from the shoe of the man who tried to rob  this safe last night, thinking that money was in it. Now, I admit, Mr Granniss,  that you knew, or thought you did, that the money was there; you knew the  combination; you are quite strong enough to have strangled a woman who  surprised you at your job; yet I know you didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the  attempted robbery, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you love Betty!&rdquo; Zizi said, softly, her eyes shining with sympathy and  understanding. &ldquo;Right you are, Wise, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also,  because,&rdquo; Wise went on, &ldquo;because, I&rsquo;m sure that is the footprint of the  would-be burglar, and while the footprint as a print is too indistinct to be a  clue to the man who made it, yet the dust that forms the print is indicative.  It is a fine dust made up of particles of cement. I mean such dust as would  adhere to a shoe that had traversed a cement floor, and, more likely an  imperfect cement floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means the cellar!&rdquo; Rodney cried; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down there a lot of late, poking  around for that everlasting secret passage, and there&rsquo;s a lot of loose cement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  gave him a quick glance, but his enthusiasm was so genuine, that the detective  dismissed a sudden qualm of suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Slip  down and get me a sample, will you?&rdquo; he said, and Granniss went at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Big  case, Zizi,&rdquo; Wise said, as the two were left alone.</p>
  <p>But  he spoke heavily, almost despairingly, and with no show of his usual exultant  interest in a big case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but,&rdquo; the black eyes turned hopefully to his own, &ldquo;there are tangible clues.  And those of Betty&rsquo;s can wait. Do you chase those that have to do with Martha  first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly shall. Martha was killed by the burglar. Did he kidnap Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kill Mr Varian?&rdquo; Zizi added, and then Granniss returned.</p>
  <p>He  brought a little cellar floor dust in a paper, and, as Wise had expected, that  and the particles he had scraped from the library rug, were indubitably the  same.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; Wise remarked, &ldquo;the burglar came up from the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  he had been hiding, goodness knows how long!&rdquo; Rodney exclaimed. &ldquo;For we locked  the house securely before we went upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it&rsquo;s time I took a look at the cellar,&rdquo; said Wise, and all three started  down.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    A Letter from Nowhere</b></h2>
  <p>Pennington  Wise himself assisted in the locking up of the house that night, for he was  determined if any more burglars came, he would know how they got in. The money  that Minna had in her possession he took charge of, saying he would be  responsible for its safety.</p>
  <p>Long  the detective lay awake in his pleasant bedroom that overlooked the sea. He  could hear the great waves tossing and breaking at the foot of the cliff and he  couldn&rsquo;t free his mind from a queer obsession to the effect that those waves  held the secret of the mysteries of Headland House.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too absurd,&rdquo; he thought to himself in the darkness, &ldquo;but I do feel that the  whole matter is dependent in some way or other on the cliff and the sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  he been asked to elucidate this more definitely he could not have done so. It  was only a hunch,&mdash;but Wise&rsquo;s hunches were often worthy of consideration, and he  determined to go out on the sea in somebody&rsquo;s boat when the morning came, and  see if he could find any inspiration.</p>
  <p>When  the morning came it brought a fresh surprise.</p>
  <p>The  household assembled promptly for an eight o&rsquo;clock breakfast. Minna Varian, pale  and fragile looking, clad in a simple black house dress, was a strong contrast  to the young and glowing vitality of Zizi, whose slim little black frock was  touched here and there with henna, and whose vivid and expressive face needed  no aid of cosmetics to be a bright, colorful picture in itself.</p>
  <p>Wise  was very grave and silent,&mdash;he was in a mood which Zizi knew was that of utter  bafflement. It was not often the detective felt this conviction of  helplessness, but it had occurred before, and Zizi noted it with some alarm. It  meant desperate and wearing effort on Wise&rsquo;s part, deep thinking and dogged  persistence in forming and proving theories, that more likely than not would  prove false. It meant a strain of brain and nerves that might result in a  physical breakdown,&mdash;for the detective had been working hard of late, and this  impenetrable mystery seemed the last straw.</p>
  <p>Granniss  was the most serene of the quartette. He was young and hopeful. He was innocent  of any crime or knowledge of it, and he cared naught for the half-voiced  suspicions of the local police. In fact, they had practically given up the case  as far beyond their ken, and now that Wise was in charge, the sheriff wanted  nothing to say in the matter, except when Wise desired to consult him.</p>
  <p>And  Granniss was confident that Wise would find Betty. He had no real reason for  his belief in the detective&rsquo;s magic, but he had unbounded faith, and he was a  born optimist. He felt sure that, if Betty had been killed, the fact would have  become known by this time,&mdash;and if she were still alive, surely she would be  found. He had come to believe in the kidnappers, and though he couldn&rsquo;t  understand how the deed had been done, he cared more to get Betty back than to  learn what had happened to her. Also, he was kept busy in attending to the  daily influx of business letters and financial matters connected with the  Varian estate. Doctor Varian had promised to come up to Headland House again as  soon as he could, but he was a busy man and hadn&rsquo;t yet made time for the visit.</p>
  <p>As  breakfast was about to be served, Kelly brought a letter to Minna saying  simply, &ldquo;This was on the hall table when I came downstairs this morning,  madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  glance showed Minna that it was from the same source as the other &ldquo;ransom&rdquo;  letter, and she handed it unopened to Wise.</p>
  <p>Staring  hard at the envelope, he slit it open, and read the contents aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  know all that is going on. We have your daughter. You have the required sum of  money. If you will bring about an exchange, we will do our part. Your fancy  detective must work with you, or at least refrain from working against you, or  there can be no deal. You may drop the package over the cliff, exactly as  directed before, at midnight on Friday. Unless you accomplish this, in strict  accordance with our orders, you will lose both the money and your child. One  divergence from our directions and your daughter will be done away with. You  can see we have no other way out. This is our last letter, and our final offer.  Take it or leave it. Enclosed is a note from your daughter to prove that we are  telling you the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  enclosed was a small slip of paper on which was written,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,  do as they tell you. Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that your daughter&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo; Wise asked, as he passed the little note to  Minna.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she whispered, trembling so violently and turning so white, that Zizi flew to  her side, and induced her to take a sip of coffee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brace  up, now, dear,&rdquo; Zizi said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need all your strength and all your pluck.  And cheer up, too. If that&rsquo;s from Betty, she&rsquo;s alive, and if she&rsquo;s alive, we&rsquo;ll  get her! Bank on that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi&rsquo;s  strong young voice and encouraging smile did as much as the coffee to  invigorate and cheer the distracted mother, and Rod Granniss, said, &ldquo;Sure!  that&rsquo;s Betty&rsquo;s own writing,&mdash;no forgery about that! Now, Mr Wise, what next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next,  is to find out how that note got into this house,&rdquo; said Pennington Wise. &ldquo;I  locked up myself last night,&mdash;I listened but I heard no intruder&rsquo;s footstep, and  I know no outside door or window was opened. It was,&mdash;it <i>must</i> have been an inside job. Kelly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you all night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my bed, sir. On the third floor of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  pouf! I know it wasn&rsquo;t you, Kelly, you could no more have engineered this  letter than you could fly to the moon! And Hannah, I suppose was in her bed,  too. I&rsquo;ve no wish to question the servants,&mdash;they had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the kidnappers, then?&rdquo; Zizi asked, softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the kidnappers,&rdquo; Wise said. &ldquo;They,&mdash;or he,&mdash;came into this house by some  secret way, which we have got to find. They, or their agent, came in night  before last to steal that money from the safe. Foiled in that attempt, they  have returned to their ransom scheme, hoping to get the money that way. They  are desperate, and,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, Mrs Varian but that we&rsquo;d better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny,&rdquo; Zizi cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t throw away all that money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that sum,&mdash;any sum,&mdash;in comparison with getting my child?&rdquo; cried Minna, so  excited as to be with difficulty warding off a hysterical attack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you wouldn&rsquo;t get her,&rdquo; Zizi asserted, positively. &ldquo;First, they&rsquo;d never get the  money,&mdash;thrown down in the darkness like that,&mdash;it&rsquo;s too uncertain. And, if they  did, they wouldn&rsquo;t return Betty,&mdash;I know they wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that now, Zizi,&rdquo; Wise spoke from deep preoccupation. &ldquo;We have till Friday  night to decide about it. Today is only Wednesday. What I hope to get at from  this note is the identity of the kidnapper. I am sure it is the same man as the  one who wrote that blackmail letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is typewritten,&rdquo; Granniss said, studying the letter. &ldquo;And not signed in any  way. I&rsquo;ve heard, though, that typewriting is as easily distinguished or  recognized as penwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true in a sense,&rdquo; Wise told him. &ldquo;I mean, if you suspect a certain person or  machine, you can check up the peculiarities of the script, and prove the  typing. But in this case, the letter was doubtless written on some public  machine,&mdash;say in a hotel or business office, and even if found, would give no  clue to the writer. We have to do with the cleverest mind I have ever been up  against. That is positive. Now the reason I connect the kidnapper and the  blackmailer is twofold. First, if this man&rsquo;s blackmailing scheme proved  unsuccessful, he may have struck at his victim in this more desperate way. And,  second, there is a resemblance in the diction of the notes from the kidnappers  and the note of blackmail intent, signed &lsquo;Step&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you suppose &lsquo;Step&rsquo; means?&rdquo; Granniss asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Short  for Stephen, I daresay,&rdquo; replied Wise. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other name that begins,&mdash;oh,  yes, there is Stepney,&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. &lsquo;Step&rsquo; is our man,&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m  sure. But how to find such an elusive individual is a puzzling problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you believe there&rsquo;s a secret passage?&rdquo; Granniss said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  simply has to be. It may be a hidden one,&mdash;or it may be a false doorway or  window frame, but there is most certainly a way for that villain to get in and  out of this house at will. Now that way must be found, and at once or I give up  my profession and make no further claim to detective ability!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  find it, Penny,&rdquo; Zizi promised him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  it, if you have to tear down the whole house,&rdquo; Minna exclaimed, excitedly. She  was nervously caressing the note from Betty, and was ready to further any  project that was suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t own the house?&rdquo; Wise asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but I&rsquo;ll buy it. It&rsquo;s in the market, and the price is not so very high. Then  you can tear it down, if you wish, and I can sell the ground afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  business deal!&rdquo; Granniss said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like nothing better than to drive a pick  into these old walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there&rsquo;s no place to drive, with any expectation of success,&rdquo; Wise demurred.  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend North? Isn&rsquo;t he an architect? Can you get him up here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;  Rod said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone him, if you say so. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be glad to come.  He isn&rsquo;t a professional architect, but he knows more about building plans than  many a firm of contractors does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  him, then, please, when you&rsquo;ve finished your breakfast,&rdquo; Wise directed, and  returned to his study of the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; he groaned to Zizi, after breakfast was over.</p>
  <p>Minna  had gone to her room, and Rodney was reading the mail.</p>
  <p>Wise  and Zizi were in the hall, sitting on the sofa with the yellow pillows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  figures in it,&rdquo; Zizi said, patting the yellow pillow that had held the little  hairpin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  that secret entrance first,&rdquo; she said, drawing her pretty brows together. &ldquo;That  will explain &rsquo;most everything. And, Penny, it isn&rsquo;t a secret passage, as they  call it. It&rsquo;s just a concealed entrance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  through the cellar,&mdash;for you know, there was cellar dust on the library  floor,&mdash;near the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  only proved the man had been down cellar,&mdash;hiding probably until the time was  ripe. I&rsquo;ve scoured that cellar myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  have I, Zizi, and there&rsquo;s not a loose stone in its walls or a trap in its  floor,&mdash;of that I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of that, too; and Penny, I even went down the well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did! You little rascal. They told me Dunn went down and examined that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I had to go, too. It wasn&rsquo;t difficult,&mdash;the stone sides are easy to climb up and  down. Not very slippery, either. But dirty! My, I ruined one of my pet dresses.  Yet there was no hole in the old well sides. No missing stone or anything  suspicious. And that settles the cellar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think the entrance is through the cellar. I incline more to the idea of a  false door frame,&mdash;you know, the frame and all on hinges. Then, locking would  not affect the opening of the whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&mdash;but, which door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are only two. I&rsquo;ve examined them both. It may be a window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  friend North to confab with you. You&rsquo;re clever enough, Penny, but you&rsquo;re not a  real architect. Mr North may have some suggestions to make, that with your  ingenuity may work it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawrence  North arrived and with him came Claire Blackwood. The latter was urged to the  visit largely by curiosity to learn how things were going, and also by a desire  to renew her expressions of sympathy and hope to Mrs Varian.</p>
  <p>Zizi  managed to get a few words alone with Claire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me about this Eleanor,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;I feel sure a lot hinges on that  peculiar matter of the pearls. Is Eleanor a scheming sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs Blackwood. &ldquo;She is a dear girl,&mdash;very young, and of a simple,  charming nature. She was devoted to her cousin, and had no thought of the  family pearls ever being hers. Don&rsquo;t for a moment think of Eleanor Varian as  capable of the slightest thought of disloyalty, much less of envy or  covetousness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I just wanted to know,&rdquo; said Zizi, with her winning, confidential smile. &ldquo;What  about her parents? Could her mother have influenced Mr Frederick Varian&rsquo;s mind  against his own daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed! Nor Doctor Varian either! Why, they&rsquo;re the best and finest kind of  people, all of them. Whatever the explanation of those pearls being left away  from Betty, it was not due to any maneuvering on the part of Eleanor or her  parents! Of that you may be sure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Lawrence North and the detective were discussing architecture. They were in the  library and the plans of the house were spread out before them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  interested,&rdquo; North said, looking eagerly at the plans, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m always fond of  plans. And, too, I want to prove my contention that there&rsquo;s no space  unaccounted for. At first, I thought there might be a bit of spare room between  this wall and this,&mdash;you see. But that jamb is merely the back of a small  cupboard in the hall. Can you find any hint of false building?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Wise admitted, and then he unfolded his theory of a double door  frame,&mdash;or, rather a hinged door frame or window frame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  said North, &ldquo;must be looked for in the house, not on the plans. But I doubt it.  Any such thing would be apt to show the joints after years of disuse. You see,  this house hasn&rsquo;t been lived in before for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll have to give up the notion of a double door,&rdquo; and Wise sighed. &ldquo;Now,  here&rsquo;s another matter. I want to go out in a boat,&mdash;a good motor boat, and have  a look round the sea and the cliff and observe for myself the possibilities of  an expert climber entering the grounds from that side. Will you take me in your  boat? I&rsquo;m told you have a fine one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will,&rdquo; was the ready response. &ldquo;When do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as you can make it convenient. I want to work rapidly, as things are  coming to a focus, and I don&rsquo;t dare delay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  stared at him, as if wondering how a trip in his boat would advance the work  definitely, but the detective had no intention of telling him about the  kidnapper&rsquo;s letter and, too, Wise wanted to view the whole headland from the  ocean.</p>
  <p>The  result was that the two started off at once, and going first to North&rsquo;s  bungalow to get his keys, and also his man who helped run the boat, inside of  an hour Pennington Wise found himself out on the ocean with North, and Joe  Mills, who, though taciturn and even grumpy, was a good navigator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remarkable  cliff!&rdquo; Wise exclaimed, amazed at its effect from below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all of that!&rdquo; North said; &ldquo;most wonderful cliff on the whole Maine coast, they  say. Notice the overhang, and then tell me if any one could climb it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  human being could!&rdquo; Wise declared. &ldquo;And I can think of no animal,&mdash;unless a  spider. Go clear round to the other side, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  gave orders and Mills drove them round the great headland, and on all sides it  was as massive and forbidding as the first view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;High  tide, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Wise, as they went on beyond the headland, and then  turned back again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said North, glancing at the rocky base. &ldquo;Almost top notch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rise  high?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very.  Twenty feet at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so. Marvelous tides up in this locality. Well, there&rsquo;s nothing more to  be discovered by gazing at these rocks and water: let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  the trip homeward, the detective proved himself so entertaining that North went  back to Headland House with him.</p>
  <p>Again  they poured over the plans of the house, and Wise announced his determination  of using a pick on one room in the third story that he surmised might be a  trifle shorter than its adjacent walls implied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it measures up,&rdquo; North insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite,&rdquo; Wise declared. &ldquo;There may be a two foot space in there, which would be  enough for a secret passage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a persistent one!&rdquo; North laughed. &ldquo;All right, Mr Wise, go ahead with your  investigation. May I help? I can wield a pick with the best of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective glanced at the lithe, sinewy form, that seemed to be all muscle and  no superfluous flesh, and said, admiringly, &ldquo;I believe you! But I think Kelly  or the chauffeur can do the really hard work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  let me do it,&rdquo; North offered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So,  half amused at his own decision, Wise agreed, and the two went in search of the  necessary tools.</p>
  <p>But  the result of their labor was absolutely nothing, beyond an incredible amount  of dust and dirt, of lath and plaster, and two very much disheveled men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you must stay to dinner, Mr North,&rdquo; the detective urged him. &ldquo;You can put  yourself to right enough for our informal meal, and it is too late for you to  get to your home by dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  North stayed, and at dinner they all discussed freely the whole affair. Mrs  Varian did not appear at the table, the nurse thinking it was better for her to  have no more excitement that day.</p>
  <p>So  Zizi calmly appropriated the chair at the head of the table, and acted the part  of hostess prettily and capably.</p>
  <p>Wise  changed his mind about confiding to Lawrence North the matter of the ransom  letters, and concluded that in the absence of Mrs Varian the subject might be  discussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  any rate,&rdquo; the detective summed up, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in the possession of positive  knowledge. We know that Betty was kidnapped,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now,&rdquo; North said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;those letters may be faked,&mdash;it seems to  me they must be,&mdash;by some clever villain who expects to get all that money under  false promises. I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute there is a kidnapper&mdash;why would  anyone kidnap Betty Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the usual kidnapper&rsquo;s reason,&mdash;ransom,&rdquo; Wise replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  how did the kidnapper get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr North!&rdquo; Wise threw up his hands. &ldquo;This from you! I made up my mind that if  one more person said to me, &lsquo;How did the kidnapper get in?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have him  arrested! I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> how he got  in,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m going to find out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I won&rsquo;t assist in the work personally the next time you try,&rdquo; Lawrence  said. &ldquo;I scarcely could get myself presentable for dinner! But, seriously, Mr  Wise, you asked me up here to consult with you. Now, I&rsquo;m sure we must agree,  that there is a way in and out of this house that we don&rsquo;t know of. And that  explains the entrance of the person who killed that poor girl in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  explains the disappearance of Miss Varian, and the scattering of her beads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beads?&rdquo;  said Lawrence North, interrogatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  there were several beads found in the kitchen that have been identified as  hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the way in must be connected with the kitchen,&rdquo; North remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  but not necessarily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a dark night, Mr North,&rdquo; Rodney Granniss said, hospitably. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you spend the  night here? We can give you a room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  a polite demurrer, North accepted the invitation.</p>
  <p>The  evening was spent in further and repeated discussion of the known facts and the  surmised possibilities of the mystery, and then, both the detective and  Granniss went about locking up the house against further marauders, and they  all retired.</p>
  <p>And  the next morning they found that Lawrence North had disappeared! His room  showed signs of a struggle. A chair was overturned, a rug awry and deep  scratches on the shining floor proved a scuffle of some sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  kidnapping case!&rdquo; Granniss exclaimed. &ldquo;Must have been a husky chap that got the  better of North! Could there have been two against him? He&rsquo;s a powerful  fighter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Search  the house,&rdquo; said Wise, briefly, &ldquo;and keep everybody out of North&rsquo;s bedroom.  I&rsquo;ll lock it and take the key myself. Now look for him. Is he given to  practical joking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no amount of searching disclosed Lawrence North, or any sign of him, dead or  alive. And the locked doors and windows were undisturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  certainly didn&rsquo;t leave of his own accord,&rdquo; said Granniss; &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t have locked  the doors behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was carried off,&rdquo; cried Minna, &ldquo;just as Betty was! Oh, who of us is safe now?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    Where is North?</b></h2>
  <p>Pennington  Wise was at his wits&rsquo; end. His wits were of the finest type and had always  stood him in good stead; but he had reached their limit, at least regarding  this present case.</p>
  <p>Baffling  was too mild a word for it. Uncanny it was not, for there was no hint or  evidence of anything supernatural in the taking off of Lawrence North. He was a  big, strong personality, and he had gone out of that house by natural means,  whether voluntarily or not.</p>
  <p>That  is, of course, if he <i>had</i> gone out of  the house.</p>
  <p>Wise  was inclined to think he had, but Rodney Granniss still held to the possibility  of some concealed room,&mdash;perhaps a dungeon, where the mysterious disappearances  could be compassed.</p>
  <p>Wise  paid no attention to Granniss&rsquo; opinions, not from any ill-will toward the young  man, but because he had concluded to his own satisfaction that there was really  no space for a concealed room in the house.</p>
  <p>North  had come up there for the purpose of helping him look for such a matter, and  North had agreed that it could not be.</p>
  <p>And  now North himself was gone,&mdash;carried off,&mdash;yet the mere phrase, &ldquo;carried off&rdquo;  seemed to Wise incongruous.</p>
  <p>Could  North have been carried off without making noise enough to rouse some of the  sleeping household? It was incredible!</p>
  <p>Before  discussing the matter with Minna, or calling the local police again, Wise went  to the bedroom North had occupied and locked himself in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;whether that man was kidnapped or whether  he sneaked himself off&mdash;yet <i>why</i> would  he do such a thing as that? My desperation over this puzzle is leading my mind  astray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carefully,  without touching a thing, Wise considered the state of the room.</p>
  <p>The  bed had been occupied, and, it was quite evident, had been hastily quitted. The  coverings were tossed back over the footboard, and the pillow still bore the  impress of a head.</p>
  <p>On  the dresser lay North&rsquo;s collar and tie, and beneath the pillow, Wise discovered  his watch and a handkerchief.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  the man had gone, after a hasty and incomplete toilette.</p>
  <p>On  the small table, lay some sheets of paper and a pencil.</p>
  <p>These  papers were some that they had used the night before drawing plans and making  measurements of the house.</p>
  <p>Scanning  the papers, Wise was startled to see a scrawled message on the corner of a  sheet. It read:</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ve  got me. <i>L. N.</i></p>
  <p>It  had been so hastily jotted down as to be almost illegible.</p>
  <p>Had  North managed to scribble it while his captor or captors looked another way? It  was all too unbelievable!</p>
  <p>The  thought would creep in that North was implicated in the mystery himself. Yet  that was quite as unbelievable as the rest of it,&mdash;if not more so.</p>
  <p>Wise  turned his attention to the disordered furniture.</p>
  <p>The  overturned chair was not broken, but a glass tumbler was. Evidently it had been  knocked off the night stand. The rug was in wrinkles and one window curtain had  been partly pulled from its rod.</p>
  <p>The  scratches on the hardwood floor were apparently made by scuffling feet, but of  that Wise could not be sure.</p>
  <p>In  fine, the whole disorder of the room could have been made by struggling men, or  could have been faked by any one desiring to produce that effect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I&rsquo;ve no reason to think North faked it,&rdquo; Wise told himself frankly, &ldquo;except  that that would be an easy way out of it for me! And that message he left looks  genuine,&mdash;and his watch is a valuable one,&mdash;oh, Lord, I <i>am</i> up against it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went downstairs, and learned that Lawrence North&rsquo;s straw hat still hung on the  hall rack. The man must have been forcibly carried off. He couldn&rsquo;t have walked  out without collar, tie or hat! Moreover, the doors were all locked.</p>
  <p>It  still was necessary to assume a secret exit from the house.</p>
  <p>Wise  inclined to the hinged door frame, or window frame, but his most careful search  failed to reveal any such. He determined to get an expert carpenter to look  over the house, feeling that such would be better than an architect.</p>
  <p>Crestfallen,  dispirited and utterly nonplussed, Wise sat down in the library to think it  over.</p>
  <p>First,  the authorities must be told of North&rsquo;s disappearance, and all that, but those  things he left to Granniss. The mystery was his province.</p>
  <p>Acting  on a sudden impulse, Wise started off at once for North&rsquo;s home. This was a  good-looking bungalow, of artistic effects and quiet unpretentious charm.</p>
  <p>His  knock brought the grumpy Joe Mills to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatcha  want?&rdquo; was his surly greeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I&rsquo;m here on an important matter, I&rsquo;ll come inside,&rdquo; Wise said, and entered the  little living-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatcha  doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo; Mills continued. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know where he is. Isn&rsquo;t he here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  no,&mdash;he stayed up to Headland House last night. Ain&rsquo;t you the detective from  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am. And Mr North left Headland House,&mdash;er,&mdash;before breakfast this morning.  Didn&rsquo;t he come home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he didn&rsquo;t. Leastways, I ain&rsquo;t seen him. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got work to do,&mdash;so you can  leave as soon as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, my man, keep a civil tongue in your head. Mr North has disappeared,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he&rsquo;s got a right to disappear if he likes,&mdash;ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he went off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care how he went off. It&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to me. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got my work to do. Now  you vamoose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; said Wise coolly, and began to look about the house. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in  taking that attitude, Mr Mills, the authorities of the village and of the  county will be here shortly,&mdash;unless Mr North turns up, which I don&rsquo;t think he  will. Now, I&rsquo;m going to do a little looking about on my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  set to work, and went swiftly over the house, from room to room. He found  nothing that gave him any clue to North&rsquo;s disappearance nor anything that gave  him much information as to North&rsquo;s private life.</p>
  <p>Even  an examination of the letters and notes in the small desk showed only some  bills, some invitations, some circulars, that meant nothing to the detective.</p>
  <p>He  noted some memoranda in Lawrence North&rsquo;s handwriting and saw that it corresponded  with the note left for him.</p>
  <p>Sheriff  Potter came in while he was there, but the conversation between the two men was  of little interest to either.</p>
  <p>It  was all so hopeless, it seemed to Wise,&mdash;and, so blankly mysterious it seemed to  Potter.</p>
  <p>Claire  Blackwood came over from her home, and Wise turned to her as to a friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  tell me something about this man, North, Mrs Blackwood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you  known him long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  through this summer,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a New Yorker, but I don&rsquo;t know much  else about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  his business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure, but I think he&rsquo;s a real estate man. He&rsquo;s spending two months here,  and he rented this bungalow furnished. You see, Mr Wise, the people of this  colony are a sort of lawless, happy-go-lucky set. I mean if we like any one, we  don&rsquo;t bother to inquire into their antecedents or their social standing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  North married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. At least, I&rsquo;ve always thought him a bachelor, though nowadays  you never can tell. He may have a wife, for all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  any rate, Mrs Blackwood, he has most mysteriously disappeared. And I do hope if  you know anything&mdash;anything at all, about the man, you will tell me. For, I  don&rsquo;t mind admitting I am greatly distressed and disturbed at this new  development of the Varian case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  connect Mr North&rsquo;s disappearance with Betty Varian&rsquo;s, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I help it? Both vanished from the same house. It proves, of course, that  there is a secret exit, but it is strange that such cannot be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is disappointing, Mr Wise, to find that such a famous detective as you cannot  find a concealed entrance to a country house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not more disappointed than I am, at that fact, Mrs Blackwood. I am  chagrined, of course, but I am more frankly puzzled. The whole case is so  amazing, the evidence so scanty,&mdash;clues are non-existent,&mdash;what can I do? I feel  like saying I was called in too late,&mdash;yet, I&rsquo;m not sure I could have done  better had I been here at first. I can&rsquo;t see where evidence has been destroyed  or clues lost. It is all inexplicable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are delightfully candid and far from bumptious,&rdquo; she said, smiling at him. &ldquo;I  feared you were of the know-it-all variety, and I see you aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help  me to know it all, Mrs Blackwood,&rdquo; Wise urged. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help feeling you know  more about Lawrence North than any one else up here. If so, can&rsquo;t you tell me  something of his life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  truly, Mr Wise, I don&rsquo;t know any more than I&rsquo;ve told you. He was up here last  year,&mdash;this is my first season. But I don&rsquo;t know of any one up here now, that  knows him very well. He is a quiet, reserved sort of man,&mdash;and,&mdash;as a matter of  fact, we are not a gossipy lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Disheartened  and disappointed, Wise went back to Headland House only to find that Doctor  Varian had arrived during his absence.</p>
  <p>The  detective was glad to have him to talk to, for it promised at least a fresh  viewpoint to be considered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admit, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; Wise said frankly, as the two confabbed in the Varian  library, &ldquo;I have no theory that will fit this case at all. I have solved many  mysteries, I have found many criminals, but never before have I struck a case  so absolutely devoid of even an imaginary solution. Granting a criminal that  desired to bring disaster to the Varian family, why should he want to abduct  Lawrence North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  North knew something incriminating to him,&rdquo; suggested the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that&rsquo;s purely supposition, there&rsquo;s no fact to prove it, or anything like it. As  a start, suppose we assume a kidnapper of Betty Varian. Although, even before  that, we have to assume a secret entrance into this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  I think, we must assume,&rdquo; said Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems so,&mdash;yet, if you knew how hard I&rsquo;ve hunted for one! Well, then, assume a  kidnapper, who, for the sake of ransom, abducts Betty Varian,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kills her father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kills her father, who interrupted the abduction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  enough, so far, but what about North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t fit North in,&mdash;unless he is in league with the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  too absurd. He and my brother weren&rsquo;t even acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know it&rsquo;s absurd! But, what isn&rsquo;t? I can&rsquo;t see a ray of light! And, then,  there&rsquo;s that awful matter of the maid, Martha!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think, Mr Wise, that since you admit failure, there is nothing for it, but to  take Mrs Varian away and give up the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaving  Betty to her fate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can search for the child just as well from Boston or New York as from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so, Doctor. Take Mrs Varian away, if you wish,&mdash;and if she will go.  I shall stay here and solve this mystery. Because I have failed thus far, is no  proof I shall continue to be unsuccessful. Mrs Varian is a rich woman,&mdash;I am not  a poor man. I shall use such funds as she provides, supplementing them, if  necessary, with my own, but I shall find Betty Varian, if she&rsquo;s alive,&mdash;I shall  find Lawrence North,&mdash;if he is alive,&mdash;and I shall discover the murderer or  murderers of Frederick Varian and of Martha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak confidently, Mr Wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do; because I mean to devote my whole soul to this thing. I can&rsquo;t fail,  ultimately,&mdash;I <i>can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>The  man was so desperate in his determination, so sincere in his intent, that  Doctor Varian was impressed, and said heartily, &ldquo;I believe you will. Now,  here&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve found out. I&rsquo;ve talked with my brother&rsquo;s lawyer, and I  find there was something in Frederick&rsquo;s life that he kept secret. I don&rsquo;t for  one minute believe it was anything disgraceful or dishonorable, for I knew my  brother too well for that. But it may have been some misfortune,&mdash;or even some  youthful error,&mdash;but whatever it was, it had an effect on his later years. And,  there&rsquo;s that strange matter of the Varian pearls. Those pearls, Mr Wise, are  historic. They have never been bequeathed to any one save the oldest son or  daughter of a Varian. Now, the fact that Betty and her father sometimes  squabbled, is not enough to make my brother leave them to <i>my</i> daughter instead of to his own. Yet I can form no theory to  explain the fact that he did do so. I&rsquo;ve tried to think he was temporarily or  hypochondriacally insane, but I can&rsquo;t reconcile that belief with my knowledge  of his physical health and well-being. Then, I&rsquo;ve wondered if he ever did me a  wrong in the past, that I never learned of, and if this was by way of  reparation. But that is too unlikely. Again, I&rsquo;ve thought that there might be  some error in the family records, and that I might be the elder son instead of  Fred. But I checked it all up, and he was two years my senior. Yet, he told the  lawyer, who drew up his will, that justice demanded that the pearls be left to  his niece instead of to his daughter. Now, what could he have meant by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine, but I&rsquo;m glad you have told me these things. For it makes me feel  there <i>must</i> be something pretty  serious back of all this. You don&rsquo;t think it could in any way reflect on Mrs  Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve talked it over with the lawyer and also with my wife, and we all  agree that Minna Varian is a true, sincere and good woman. There is not only no  blame or stigma to be attached to her in any way, but whatever was the secret  of my brother&rsquo;s life, his wife knows nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I can imagine no secret, no incident that would necessitate that strange  bequest of the family pearls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  can I, except that he might have thought he owed me some reparation for some  real or fancied wrong. It must have been to me, for he couldn&rsquo;t have wronged my  daughter in any way. There was no question about the division of my father&rsquo;s  fortune. We were the only children and it was equally shared. The pearls were  Frederick&rsquo;s as he was the oldest child. That&rsquo;s all there is to the matter,&mdash;only  it is strange that my brother spoke in the way he did to his lawyer. He seemed  really broken up over the business, the lawyer said. And he was deeply moved  when he dictated the clause leaving the pearls to Eleanor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  is really the child of the Frederick Varians?&rdquo; Wise asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Mrs Varian lost her first two babies in infancy, and when the third child  was expected, we were all afraid it would not live. But Betty was a healthy  baby from the first, and I&rsquo;ve known her all her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  father was as fond of her as her mother was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and  no. I can&rsquo;t explain it, Mr Wise, but in my medical practice, I&rsquo;ve not  infrequently found a definite antipathy between a father and a daughter. For no  apparent reason, I mean. Well, that condition existed between Frederick Varian  and his child. They almost never agreed in their tastes or opinions, and while  they were affectionate at times, yet there was friction at other times. Now,  Minna and Betty were always congenial, thought alike on all subjects and never  had any little squabbles. I&rsquo;m telling you this in hopes it will help you,  though I confess I don&rsquo;t see how it can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it may,&mdash;and at any rate, it is interesting, in view of the strange  occurrences up here. You&rsquo;ve found no papers or letters bearing on this matter  among Mr Varian&rsquo;s effects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  except a few proofs that he was more or less blackmailed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you can&rsquo;t learn by whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there were one or two veiled threats, that might have meant blackmail, and yet  might not. I have them safe, but I didn&rsquo;t bring them up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t matter, such a careful blackmailer as the one we have to deal with,  never would write letters that could be traced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is to be done in this North matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  of all, I shall offer a large reward for any word of him. I have faith in  offered rewards, if they are large enough. They often tempt accomplices to turn  state&rsquo;s evidence. I&rsquo;ve already ordered posters and advertisements with  portraits of North. My agents will attend to this, and though it may bring no  results, yet if it doesn&rsquo;t,&mdash;it will be a hint in another direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Lawrence North is implicated in the crimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t agree to that. Why the man himself was carried off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&mdash;oh, well, Doctor Varian, first of all, we must find that secret passage.  There is one,&mdash;we can&rsquo;t blink that fact. Now, where is it? Think of having a  given problem like that, and being unable to solve it! I am so amazed at my own  helplessness that I am too stunned to work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  to it, man,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find it. Tear the house down, if necessary, but get at it  somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall; I&rsquo;ve already sent for carpenters to demolish some parts of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could stay up here and see the work progress. You&rsquo;ll have to find the  secret, you know. You can&rsquo;t help it, if you tear down the whole structure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean to do that. I want to continue to live in the house. But some expert  carpenters can dig into certain portions of it without making the rest  uninhabitable, and that&rsquo;s what I propose doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about finger prints? I thought you detectives set great store by those.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in a case like this. Suppose we find finger prints,&mdash;they&rsquo;re not likely to be  those of any registered criminal. And since this talk with you, I shall turn my  investigations in a slightly different channel, anyhow. I must look up Mr  Varian&rsquo;s past life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  all you wish, but I tell you now, you&rsquo;ll find nothing indicative. Whatever  secret my brother had, it was not a matter of crime,&mdash;or even of lighter  wrongdoing. And, if Frederick Varian wanted to keep the matter secret neither  you nor any other detective will ever find it out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may have been true during your brother&rsquo;s life, Doctor, but now that he can&rsquo;t  longer protect his secret, it must come out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Mr Wise, I truly hope it will. For even if it reflects against my  brother&rsquo;s integrity, it may aid in finding Betty. I don&rsquo;t believe that girl is  dead,&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I don&rsquo;t. I believe these letters from the kidnappers are true bills. I believe  they have her concealed and confined, and by Heaven, Doctor Varian, I&rsquo;m going  to find her! I know that sounds like mere bluster, but I&rsquo;ve never totally  failed on a case yet,&mdash;and this,&mdash;the biggest one I&rsquo;ve ever tackled, shall not be  my first failure! I <i>must</i> succeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I can help in any way, command me. I&rsquo;m glad to see you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m  criminally implicated because of the legacy of the pearls. Eleanor shall never  touch them until we&rsquo;ve positively concluded that Betty is dead. But that&rsquo;s a  small matter. Those pearls have lain undisturbed in safe deposit many  years,&mdash;they may lie there many years more,&mdash;but let the search work go on  steadily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know nothing of North, personally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I never met him. Has he no relatives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  found any yet. But you see, the police don&rsquo;t hold that it is a criminal case as  yet. They say he may have walked out of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half  dressed, and leaving his watch behind him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that note to say what had happened! That note rings true, Doctor, and either it  is sincere, or North is one of the cleverest scamps I ever met up with!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  conceivable that he is a scamp, but I can&rsquo;t see anything that points to it. Why  should a perfect stranger to the Varian family cut up such a trick as to come  up here and pretend to be kidnapped,&mdash;if he wasn&rsquo;t? It&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  is too absurd,&rdquo; said Wise, bitterly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    A Green Stain</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me more about Betty,&rdquo; Zizi said, &ldquo;that is, if you don&rsquo;t mind talking about  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; Minna returned, &ldquo;I love to talk about her. It&rsquo;s the only way I can keep my  hope alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  was sitting with Mrs Varian while the nurse went out for a walk. There was a  mutual attraction between the two, and the sympathetic dark eyes of the girl  rested kindly on the face of the bereaved and suffering mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me about her when she was little. Was she born in New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  at the time of her birth, we chanced to be spending a summer up in Vermont,&mdash;up  in the Green Mountains. I hoped to get home before Betty arrived, but I didn&rsquo;t,  and she was born in a tiny little hospital way up in a Vermont village.  However, she was a strong, healthy baby, and has never been ill a day in her  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she is so pretty and sweet,&mdash;I know not only from her picture, but from  everything I hear about her. I&rsquo;m going to find her, Mrs Varian!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi&rsquo;s  strange little face glowed with determination and she smiled hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t doubt your wish to do so, Zizi, dear, but I can&rsquo;t think you will succeed.  I&rsquo;m so disappointed in Mr Wise&rsquo;s failure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hasn&rsquo;t failed!&rdquo; Zizi cried, instantly eager to defend her master. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say  that,&mdash;he is baffled,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a most extraordinary case, but he hasn&rsquo;t failed,&mdash;and  he won&rsquo;t fail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he&rsquo;s been here a week, and what has he done so far?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you what he&rsquo;s done, Mrs Varian.&rdquo; Zizi spoke seriously. &ldquo;We were talking it  over this morning, and he&rsquo;s done this much. He&rsquo;s discovered, at least to his  own conviction, that Betty was really kidnapped. That those letters you have  received are from the abductors and that through them we must hope to trace  Betty&rsquo;s present whereabouts. This would not be accomplished by merely following  their instructions as to throwing money over the cliff. As you know, Doctor  Varian advises strongly against that,&mdash;and Mr Wise does, too. But they have  learned of some more letters found among your husband&rsquo;s papers, signed &lsquo;Step,&rsquo;  and we hope to prove a connection between those and the kidnapper&rsquo;s letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  good will that do?&rdquo; Minna asked, listlessly. &ldquo;Oh, Zizi, you&rsquo;re a dear girl, but  you&rsquo;ve no idea what I&rsquo;m suffering. Nights, as I lie awake in the darkness, I  seem to hear my baby Betty calling to me,&mdash;I seem to feel her little arms round  my neck&mdash;somehow my mind goes back to her baby days, more than to her later  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  natural, dear, when you&rsquo;re so anxious and worried about her. But, truly, I  believe we&rsquo;ll get her yet. You see, everything points to the theory that she is  alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so tired of theories,&mdash;they don&rsquo;t help any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, they do, dear. Now, try to get up a little more hope. Take it from  me,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see Betty again! She&rsquo;ll come dancing in, just as she used to  do,&mdash;say, Mrs Varian, why did she and her father squabble so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t explain it. I&rsquo;ve thought over it often, but it seems to me there was no  reason for it. He admired Betty, he was proud of her beauty and grace and  accomplishments, but there was something in the child that he didn&rsquo;t like. I  hate to say this, but he seemed to have a natural dislike toward her that he  honestly tried to overcome, but he utterly failed in the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  very strange!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  surely is. I&rsquo;ve never mentioned it to any one before, but you are so sympathetic,  I want to ask you what you think could have been the reason for anything like  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Betty feel that way toward him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! I mean, not naturally so. But when he would fly at her and scold her for  some little, simple thing, of course she flared up and talked back at him. It  was only petty bickering, but it was so frequent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t  Mr Varian pleased when he learned that you expected another child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was delighted. He feared it might not live,&mdash;as the others hadn&rsquo;t, but he was  pleased beyond words at the prospect, and we both hoped for a healthy baby. He  was so careful of me,&mdash;so devoted and loving, and so joyful in the anticipation  of the new baby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was with you in Vermont?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; we had a cottage, and he stayed there while I was in the hospital during  my confinement. The house was near by, and he could come to see me at any  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I can&rsquo;t understand his turning against her later. Do they look alike?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;that  is, they have similar coloring, but no real resemblance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty  doesn&rsquo;t look like you, either?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  specially. Though I can&rsquo;t see resemblances as some people do. She was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Is</i>, Mrs Varian!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, Betty is a dear, pretty, sweet-faced girl, healthy and happy, but not  remarkable in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she inherit your disposition or her father&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  particularly. But I don&rsquo;t think a young girl often shows definite or strong  traits of character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  do,&rdquo; Zizi said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;How about talents? I want to find out, you see,  more of what Betty is like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has a little musical talent, a taste for drawing, and a fondness for outdoor  sports,&mdash;but none of these is marked. I can&rsquo;t describe the child otherwise than  as a natural, normal everyday girl. I adore her, of course, but I am not blind  to the fact that she is not a genius in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  do you want her to be! As you&rsquo;ve told me of her, she seems to me a darling, and  I mean to find her for you,&mdash;and for Mr Granniss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Rodney loves her, and he is as desolate as I am at her loss. Oh, Zizi, have you  really any hope, or are you just saying this to comfort me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really have hope, and more, I have conviction that we will yet have Betty back  here. But it is not yet a certainty, and I only can offer you my own opinions.  Still, dear, it&rsquo;s better to hope than to despair, and any day may bring us good  news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  recounted this whole conversation to Pennington Wise, not so much because she  deemed it important, as that he wanted every word she could get, reported to  him.</p>
  <p>The  man was frankly bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too ridiculous,&rdquo; he exclaimed to Zizi, &ldquo;that I, Pennington Wise, should have a  great, a unique mystery, as this one is,&mdash;and not be able to make one step of  progress toward its solution!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Step,&rsquo;&rdquo;  Zizi said, &ldquo;makes me think of that black-mailing person, Stephen, or whatever  his name is. Let&rsquo;s work from that end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  tried and there&rsquo;s no place to start from. You see, the letters signed &lsquo;Step&rsquo;  are as untraceable as the kidnappers&rsquo; letters. They&rsquo;re typed, not on the same  machine, but on some equally obscure and unavailable one. It&rsquo;s impossible to  hunt a typewriter, with no suspect and no indication where to look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be for an ordinary detective, Penny, but for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it, Ziz. An ordinary detective would say, &lsquo;pooh, of course we can trace  that!&rsquo; But I&rsquo;m not an ordinary detective, and my very knowledge and experience  prove to me how baffling,&mdash;how hopeless&mdash;this search is. Sometimes I think  Frederick Varian did away with Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rubbish!&rdquo; Zizi said, calmly. &ldquo;But I do think there was some definite reason for  Mr Varian&rsquo;s attitude toward his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  question of her paternity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Lord, no! Minna Varian is the best and sweetest woman in the world! But I&rsquo;ve a  glimmer of a notion that I can&rsquo;t work out yet,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too vague to put into words.&rdquo; Zizi knit her heavy eyebrows, and screwed up her red  lips.</p>
  <p>And  then the carpenters came, and the demolition of Headland House began. It was  carefully managed; no rooms that the family used were put in disorder, but the  kitchen quarters, and the cellar were desperately dug into.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  kitchen is indicated,&rdquo; Wise said to Doctor Varian. &ldquo;For it is clear to my mind  that Betty was carried out through it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Through  the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you see, Doctor, we must reconstruct the matter like this. Betty came back to  the house alone. She came in the front door with her father&rsquo;s key. Now, she  must have been attacked or kidnapped then and there. I mean whoever did it,&mdash;and  we have to assume somebody did do it,&mdash;was in the house waiting. Well&mdash;say he  was,&mdash;for the moment. Then, say Betty put up a fight, which of course she would,  then she was carried off through the kitchen by means of the secret passage,  which we have got to find! She had the yellow pillow in her hands for some  reason,&mdash;can&rsquo;t say what&mdash;and she dropped it on the kitchen floor,&mdash;or maybe the  villain used the pillow to stifle the girl&rsquo;s screams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  owing to the girl&rsquo;s struggles, the string of beads round her neck broke, and  scattered over the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  part of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the others stayed with her, or were picked up by the kidnappers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  than one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think two. For, when Mr Varian arrived upon the scene, one of them turned on  him,&mdash;and killed him,&mdash;while there must have been another to hold Betty. It is  possible there was only one, but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you think the concealed entrance is through the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  or the cellar. Anyway, there is one, and it must be found! It was used the  night Martha was killed,&mdash;it was used the night North disappeared,&mdash;why, man, it <i>must</i> be there,&mdash;and I <i>must</i> find it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough, and I hope you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  something, Penny,&rdquo; Zizi said, appearing suddenly at his elbow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a  stain on my frock that&rsquo;s exactly like the one we noticed on poor Martha&rsquo;s  hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a green stain,&mdash;a long swish, as of green paint,&mdash;but it isn&rsquo;t paint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  held up a little linen frock that she sometimes wore mornings.</p>
  <p>On  the side, down near the hem, was a green smear, and it was similar in appearance  to the strange mark on the hand of the dead girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d  it come from?&rdquo; asked Wise, shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s the dress I wore when I was exploring the cellar, and it  got pretty dirty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been  washed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I shook off and brushed off most of the dirt, but this stain stuck, and  wouldn&rsquo;t brush off. That&rsquo;s how I noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coincidence,  I&rsquo;m afraid. Or maybe Martha went down cellar that night for something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what in the cellar would make a mark like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,  Ziz. There&rsquo;s no green paint down there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t paint, Penny,&rdquo; Zizi persisted. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t smell like paint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it smell like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no odor to it, that I can notice. But it&rsquo;s a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s  the yellow pillow,&mdash;so are the scattered beads,&mdash;so was the footprint of cellar  dust on the library floor,&mdash;but they&rsquo;re all blind clues,&mdash;they lead nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Penny  Wise! what ails you? I never knew you so ready to lie down on a job!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Zizi, not that. It&rsquo;s only that I can see how futile and useless all these clues  are. We&rsquo;ve got to get some bigger evidence. In fact, we can do nothing till we  find the way the criminal got in and out of this house. Don&rsquo;t tease me, Zizi, I  never was so put about!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must be, when you revert to your old-fashioned phrases!&rdquo; the girl laughed at  him, but there was deepest sympathy in her dark eyes, and an affectionate,  brooding glance told of her anxiety for him.</p>
  <p>Yet  the carpenters found nothing. They proved beyond all possible doubt that there  was no secret passage between the interior of Headland House and the outer  world,&mdash;that there could be none, for every inch of space was investigated and  accounted for.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no way to get into that house except through its two doors or its windows,&rdquo; the  master carpenter declared, and the men who were watching knew he spoke the  truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  proves,&rdquo; Granniss said, looking up from the plans to the actual walls, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  all just as this drawing shows it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Doctor Varian. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no missing bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Wise, thoughtfully, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t. And, at least, the carpenters have  proved that there is no secret passage built into this house. Yet there is one.  I will find it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the first time, his words seemed to be spoken with his own conviction of their  truth. His voice had a new ring,&mdash;his eyes a new brightness, and he seemed  suddenly alert and powerful mentally, where, before, his hearers had thought  him lacking in energy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  thought of a new way to go about it?&rdquo; asked Granniss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have! It may not work, but I&rsquo;ve a new idea, at least. Zizi, let me see that  stained dress of yours again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obediently  Zizi brought her frock with the smear still on its hem. Wise looked at it  closely, sniffed it carefully, and gave it back, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you want to remove that stain, dear, just wash it with soap and water. It&rsquo;ll  come off then. Now, I&rsquo;m going down to the village, and I may not be back for luncheon.  Don&rsquo;t wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went off, and Doctor Varian said to Zizi:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he really has a new theory, or is he just stalling for time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;s off on a new tack,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes shone. &ldquo;I know him so well, you  see, I&rsquo;m sure he has a new idea and a good one. I&rsquo;ve never seen him so cast  down and so baffled as he has been over this case,&mdash;but now that his whole  demeanor is changed, he has a fresh start, I know, and he&rsquo;ll win out yet! I  never doubted his success from the beginning,&mdash;but the last two days he has been  at the lowest ebb of his resources.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have to go back to Boston this afternoon,&rdquo; Doctor Varian went on, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be  up again in a few days. Meantime, keep me informed, Rodney, of anything new  that transpires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down  in the little village of Headland Harbor, Pennington Wise went first to see  Claire Blackwood.</p>
  <p>She  seemed to know more about Lawrence North than any one else did, yet even she  knew next to nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she told the detective, &ldquo;the police haven&rsquo;t found out anything definite about  him yet. Why don&rsquo;t you take up the search for him, Mr Wise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  all I can do searching for Betty Varian,&rdquo; he returned with a rueful smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not employed to hunt up North, and I am to find Miss Varian. But surely the  police can get on the track of him,&mdash;a man like that can&rsquo;t drop out of  existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what he&rsquo;s done, though,&rdquo; said Claire. &ldquo;Do you know, Mr Wise, I believe  Lawrence North is a bigger man than we supposed. I mean a more important one,  than he himself admitted. I think he was up here incognito.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean that North is not his real name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know about that, but I mean that he wanted a rest or wanted to get away  from everybody who knew him,&mdash;and so he came up here to be by himself. How else  explain the fact that they can&rsquo;t find out anything about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  they know his city address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but only an office,&mdash;which is closed up for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!  They ought to find him all the more easily if he is a man of importance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean of public importance, but I think&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what! But I&rsquo;m  sure there&rsquo;s something mysterious about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of that, too! And you know nothing of his private life, Mrs Blackwood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;ve heard that he is a widower, but nobody seems quite certain. As I told you,  up here, nobody questions one&rsquo;s neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  it necessary, before members are taken into the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; but Mr North wasn&rsquo;t a member of the club. Lots of the summer people aren&rsquo;t  members but they use the clubhouse and nobody makes much difference between  members and non-members. It isn&rsquo;t like the more fashionable beaches or resorts.  We&rsquo;re a bit primitive up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  tell me of North&rsquo;s financial standing. He&rsquo;s a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of. But he always has enough to do what he likes. Nobody is very  rich up here, yet nobody is really poor. We&rsquo;re a medium-sized lot, in every  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  North owns a fine motor boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the best and fastest up here. But he doesn&rsquo;t own it, he rents it by the season.  Most people do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. And that not very pleasant factotum of his,&mdash;Joe Mills,&mdash;is he a native  product?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he came up with Mr North. He&rsquo;s grumpy, I admit, but he&rsquo;s a good sort after all.  And devoted to his master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  then he must be inconsolable at North&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  on the contrary he takes it calmly enough. He says North knows his own  business, and will come back when he gets ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he knows where North is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  pretends he does,&rdquo; corrected Claire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that he is as easy about the  matter as he pretends. I saw him this morning and I think he is pretty well  disturbed about it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  I&rsquo;ll go to see him. Thank you, Mrs Blackwood, for your patience and courtesy in  answering my questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Mr Wise, if you&rsquo;re really grateful, do tell me what you think about the Varian  affair. That&rsquo;s much more mysterious and much more important than the matter of  Lawrence North&rsquo;s disappearance. Are they connected?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks so,&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;but  that&rsquo;s no answer. Do you think they are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, Mrs Blackwood,&mdash;I surely do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Pennington Wise walked briskly over to the bungalow of Lawrence North.</p>
  <p>He  found Mills in no kindly mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatcha  want now?&rdquo; was his greeting, and his scowl pointed his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to take me out for a sail in Mr North&rsquo;s motor boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you gotcha nerve with you! What makes you think I&rsquo;ll do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it&rsquo;s for your own best interests to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  looked the man straight in the eye, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mills&rsquo;  own gaze waver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatcha  mean by that?&rdquo; he growled, truculently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  if you don&rsquo;t take me, I&rsquo;ll think you have some reason for refusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gotta work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  work will keep. We&rsquo;ll be gone only a few hours at most. How is the tide now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plumb  low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, then. We start at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether  Mills decided it was best for him to consent to the trip or whether he was  cowed by the detective&rsquo;s stern manner, Wise didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t care, but  the trip was made.</p>
  <p>Wise  directed the course, and Mills obeyed. Few words were spoken save those  necessary for information.</p>
  <p>Their  course lay out around the headland, and into the small bay on the other side of  it.</p>
  <p>As  they rounded the cliff, Wise directed the other to keep as close to the shore  as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dangerous  rocks,&rdquo; Mills said, briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steer  clear of them,&rdquo; said Wise, sternly.</p>
  <p>After  passing round the headland on all its exposed sides, Wise declared himself  ready to return.</p>
  <p>In  silence Mills turned his craft about and again Wise told him to make the trip  as close to the rocky cliff as he could manage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want to get us into trouble?&rdquo; asked Mills, as he made a quick turn between two  treacherous looking points of rock. &ldquo;I nearly struck then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Wise, cheerfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever sailor, Mills. Get along  back home, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Criminal or Victim?</b></h2>
  <p>Pennington  Wise came to the conclusion that he had now on hand the hardest job of his  life. This knowledge did not discourage him, on the contrary it spurred him to  continuous and desperate effort.</p>
  <p>Yet,  as he told Zizi, his efforts consisted mostly in making inquiries here and  there, in a hope that he might learn something indicative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t a case for clues, evidence or deduction,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s,&mdash;I hate the  word,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s psychological.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can&rsquo;t be logical be psychological,&rdquo; said Zizi, flippantly. &ldquo;Now, you know,  Penny, you&rsquo;re going to win out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I do, it&rsquo;ll be solely and merely because of your faith in me,&rdquo; he said, his  face beginning to show the look of discouragement that she had learned to  dread.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;but this old faith of mine, while it will never  wear out,&mdash;its effect on you will. Don&rsquo;t depend on it too long. Now let&rsquo;s count  up what we&rsquo;ve really got toward a solution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  got a lot,&rdquo; began Wise hopefully. &ldquo;We know enough to assume that Betty Varian  was kidnapped and her father shot by the same hand. Or rather by orders of the  same master brain. I don&rsquo;t say the criminal himself committed these crimes.  Then, we know that our master villain got in and out of this house,&mdash;or his  subordinates did,&mdash;by means which we haven&rsquo;t yet discovered, but which I am on  the trail of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, are you? Tell me where you think it is? Is it through the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a couple of days, Ziz. I&rsquo;ll tell you as soon as I&rsquo;m certain. In fact, I may  have to wait a week to find out about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Getting  an expert on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nope.  Working it out myself,&mdash;but it all depends on the moon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, I&rsquo;ve long suspected you of being luny, but I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d admit it  yourself! Howsumever, as long as you&rsquo;re jocular, I&rsquo;m not discouraged. It&rsquo;s when  you pull a long face and heave great, deep sighs that my confidence begins to  wobble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  wobble yet, then, my dear, for when the moon gets around to the right quarter,  I&rsquo;ll show you the secret way in and out of this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too bad of you, Penny, to spring those cryptic remarks on me! Save &rsquo;em for  people you want to impress with your cleverness. But all right, wait till the  moon gets in apogee or perigee or wherever you want her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall. And meantime, I&rsquo;m going to track down Friend North. He is a factor in  the case, whether sinned against or sinning. That upset room was never upset in  a real scuffle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  ma&rsquo;am, it wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been over it again, and unless I&rsquo;m making the mistake of  my life, that upset chair was carefully,&mdash;yes, and silently overturned by a  cautious hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  North&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  North&rsquo;s. Of course, Ziz, I may be mistaken, so I&rsquo;m not advertising this yet,  but I can&rsquo;t see a real scuffle in that room. To begin with, if a man, or two men,  or three men tried to kidnap Lawrence North and carry him off against his will  don&rsquo;t you suppose there would be enough noise made to wake some of us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  they chloroformed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  they did. But, I&rsquo;m working on a different maybe. Say that man wanted to  disappear and make it look like an abduction. Wouldn&rsquo;t he have done just what  he did do? Leave the room looking as if he had gone off unwillingly or  unconsciously? The very leaving of his watch behind was a clever touch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now, Penny, I believe you <i>are</i> luny! Do you suspect Lawrence North of all the crimes? Did he abduct Betty,  shoot her father,&mdash;kill Martha? and then,&mdash;finally abduct himself! And, if  so,&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zizi,  you&rsquo;re a bright little girl, but you don&rsquo;t know everything. Now, you stay here  and hold the fort, while I go off for a few days and stalk North. I don&rsquo;t say  he did commit all that catalogue of crimes you string off so glibly, but I do  say that he has to be accounted for,&mdash;and I must know whether he is a criminal  or a victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  went away and the little family at Headland House tried to possess their souls  in patience against his return.</p>
  <p>Zizi  devoted herself to the cheer and entertainment of Minna Varian, while Rodney  Granniss found enough to do in looking after the accounts and financial matters  of the estate.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Varian came up again, and was both surprised and pleased to find his brother&rsquo;s  wife in such a calm, rational state of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it is not a unique case,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known other instances of hysterical  and even unbalanced minds becoming rational and practical after a great shock  or sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  the fearful blows Minna Varian had received from the hand of Fate, did indeed  seem to change her whole nature, and instead of a pettish, spoiled woman, she  was now quiet, serious, and mentally capable.</p>
  <p>She  kept herself buoyed up with a hope of Betty&rsquo;s return. This hope Zizi fostered,  and as the days went by, it came to be a settled belief in Minna&rsquo;s mind, that  sooner or later her child would be restored to her waiting arms.</p>
  <p>Nurse  Fletcher did not approve of this state of things at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know that girl will never be found!&rdquo; she would say to Zizi. &ldquo;You only pretend  that you think she will, and it isn&rsquo;t right to fill Mrs Varian&rsquo;s mind with  fairy tales as you do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Nurse,&rdquo; Zizi would wheedle her, &ldquo;you let me alone. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs Varian would  collapse utterly if the hope of Betty&rsquo;s return were taken away from her. You  know she would! So, don&rsquo;t you dare say a word that will disturb her  confidence!&rdquo; Doctor Varian agreed with Zizi&rsquo;s ideas, regarding Minna, though he  said frankly, he had grave doubts of ever seeing Betty again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  my mind,&rdquo; he said, as he and Zizi had a little confidential chat, &ldquo;nothing has  been accomplished. Nearly a month has passed since Betty disappeared. There is  no theory compatible with a hope that she has been kept safely and comfortably  all that time. The kidnappers,&mdash;if there are any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  doubt their existence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I&rsquo;m not at all sure that those ransom letters are genuine. Anybody could demand  ransom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not at all sure of anything, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; Zizi said, &ldquo;and strictly speaking,  Mr Wise isn&rsquo;t either. But he is sure enough to go away and stay all this  time,&mdash;he&rsquo;s been gone ten days now, and I know unless he was on a promising  trail he would have abandoned it before this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Pennington Wise was on a promising trail.</p>
  <p>It  was proving a long, slow business, but he was making progress.</p>
  <p>His  first start had been from Lawrence North&rsquo;s New York office. This he found  closed and locked, and no one in attendance.</p>
  <p>Instead  of bring disturbed at this, he regarded it as a step forward.</p>
  <p>The  owner of the building in which Mr North&rsquo;s office was, told the detective that  Mr North had gone away for the summer,&mdash;that he had said, his office would be  closed until September, at least, and that there was nothing doing.</p>
  <p>Wise  persuaded him that there was a great deal doing and in the name of justice and  a few other important personages he must hand over a key of that office.</p>
  <p>At  last this was done, and Wise went eagerly about the examination of Lawrence  North&rsquo;s books and papers.</p>
  <p>The  fact that he found nothing indicative, was to him an important indication.  North&rsquo;s business, evidently, was of a vague and sketchy character. He seemed to  have an agency for two or three inconspicuous real estate firms, and he  appeared to have put over a few unimportant deals.</p>
  <p>What  was important, however, was a small advertisement, almost cut out from a  newspaper and almost overlooked by the detective.</p>
  <p>This  was a few lines expressing somebody&rsquo;s desire to rent a summer home on the  seashore, preferably on the Maine coast.</p>
  <p>It  was signed F. V. and Wise thought that it might have been inserted by Frederick  Varian. He hadn&rsquo;t heard that the Varians took Headland House through the agency  of or at the suggestion of North, yet it might be so.</p>
  <p>At  any rate there was nothing else of interest to Wise in North&rsquo;s whole office,&mdash;and  he left no paper unread or book unopened.</p>
  <p>It  took a long time, but when it was accomplished the detective set out on a  definite and determined search for North.</p>
  <p>The  man proved most elusive. No one seemed to know anything about him. If ever a  negligible citizen lived in these United States, it was, the detective  concluded, Lawrence North.</p>
  <p>He  hunted directories and telephone books. He visited mercantile agencies and  information bureaus. He had circulars already out with a reward offered for the  missing man, but none of his efforts gave the slightest success.</p>
  <p>Had  he been able to think of North as dead, he could have borne defeat better, but  he envisaged that nonchalant face as laughing at his futile search!</p>
  <p>There  was, of course, the possibility that North was an assumed name, and that the  true name of the man might bring about a speedy end to his quest. But this was  mere surmise, and he had no way of verifying it.</p>
  <p>By  hunting down various Norths here and there, he one day came upon a woman who  said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I once knew a woman named Mrs Lawrence North. She lived in the same apartment  house I did, and I remember her because she had the same name. No, her husband  was no relation of my husband,&mdash;my husband has been dead for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  her husband dead?&rdquo; Wise inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but he better &rsquo;a&rsquo; been! He only came to see her once in a coon&rsquo;s age. He kept  her rent paid, but he hardly gave her enough money to live on! He was one of  these hifalutin artistic temperament men, and he just neglected that poor thing  somethin&rsquo; fierce!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  became of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno.  Maybe she&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; there yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  the address given Wise went, scarcely daring to hope he was on the right track  at last.</p>
  <p>At  the apartment house he was informed that Mrs Lawrence North had lived there but  that she had also died there, about three months previous.</p>
  <p>The  superintendent willingly gave him all the details he asked, and Pennington Wise  concluded that the woman who had died there was without doubt the wife of the  Lawrence North he was hunting for.</p>
  <p>But  further information of North&rsquo;s later history he could not gain. After the death  of his wife he had given up the apartment, which was a furnished one and had  never been there since.</p>
  <p>Wise  cogitated deeply over these revelations. So far, he had learned nothing greatly  to North&rsquo;s discredit, save that he had not treated his wife very well, and that  he had, directly after her death, gone to a summer resort and mingled with the  society there.</p>
  <p>Yet  this latter fact was not damaging. To his knowledge, North had in no way acted,  up at Headland Harbor, in any way unbecoming a widower. He had not been called  upon to relate his private or personal history, and if he had sought diversion  among the summer colony of artists and dilettantes, he had, of course, a right  to do so.</p>
  <p>Yet,  the whole effect of the man was suspicious to Wise.</p>
  <p>He  told himself it was prejudice, that there was no real evidence against him,&mdash;that&mdash;but,  he then thought, if North was a blameless, undistinguished private citizen,  why, in heaven&rsquo;s name would anybody want to kidnap him?</p>
  <p>This  he answered to himself by saying North might have learned some secret of the  kidnappers or of the secret entrance that made it imperative for the criminals  to do away with him. This might also explain the death of the maid, Martha.</p>
  <p>Yet,  through it all, Wise believed that North was in wrong. How or to what extent he  didn&rsquo;t know, but North must be found. So to the various under-takers&rsquo;  establishments he went until at last he found the one who had had charge of the  obsequies of Mrs Lawrence North.</p>
  <p>That  was a red letter day in the life of Pennington Wise. For, though he gained no  knowledge there of his elusive quarry, he did learn the name and former  dwelling place of the woman North married.</p>
  <p>She  had been, he discovered, a widow, and had been born in Vermont. Her name when  she married North was Mrs Curtis, and they had been married about ten years  ago.</p>
  <p>This,  while not an astounding revelation was of interest and, at least promised a  further knowledge of North&rsquo;s matrimonial affairs.</p>
  <p>The  town in Vermont was Greenvale, a small village Wise discovered, up in the  northern part of the state.</p>
  <p>It  was a long trip, but the detective concluded that this case on which he was  engaged was a case of magnificent distances and he at once made his railroad  reservations and bought his tickets.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the household at Headland House had been thrown into a new spasm of excitement  by the receipt of a letter from a stranger.</p>
  <p>It  was addressed to Mrs Varian, and was of a totally different character from the  frequent missives she received telling of girls who looked like the pictures of  the advertised lost one.</p>
  <p>This  was a well written, straightforward message that carried conviction by its very  curtness.</p>
  <p>It  ran:</p>
  <p>Mrs  Varian, Dear Madam:</p>
  <p>I  address you regarding a peculiar experience I have just had. I am deaf, therefore  I never go to the theatre, as I can&rsquo;t hear the lines. But I go often to the  Moving Pictures. Of late I have been taking lessons in Lip Reading, and though  I have not yet progressed very far in it, I can read lips sometimes, especially  if the speaker makes an effort to form words distinctly. Now last night I went  to the Movies and in a picture there was a girl, who seemed to be speaking yet  there was no occasion in the story for her to do so. She was merely one of a  crowd standing in a meadow or field. But as practice in my Lip Reading I  watched her and I am sure she said, &ldquo;I am Betty Varian,&mdash;I am Betty Varian.&rdquo;  This seemed so strange that I went again this afternoon, and saw the picture  again,&mdash;and I am sure that was what she said,&mdash;over and over. I don&rsquo;t know that  this will interest you, but I feel I ought to tell you.</p>
  <p>Very  truly yours, Ella Sheridan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; Minna said. &ldquo;Wherever Betty is, she isn&rsquo;t in a moving  picture company!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  wait a minute,&rdquo; cried Granniss, &ldquo;when they take pictures of crowds, you  know,&mdash;in a field or meadow, they pick up any passer-by or any one they can get  to fill in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  so,&rdquo; Zizi said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it. I think somebody was talking about Betty and  the girl read the lips wrong. She&rsquo;s only a beginner, she says. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s  a most difficult thing to learn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Granniss said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got to be looked into. I&rsquo;m going to answer  this letter,&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m going straight down there, it&rsquo;s from Portland, and I&rsquo;m  going to see that picture myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make  sure it&rsquo;s still being shown,&rdquo; said the practical Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  telegraph and ask her,&rdquo; cried Rodney; his face alight at the thought of doing  some real work himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t go, Rod,&rdquo; Minna said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get along without you,&mdash;and what good will  it do? You know a picture isn&rsquo;t the real people, and&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s all too vague and  hazy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Granniss insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first real clue. Why didn&rsquo;t that girl  notice what the girl in the picture looked like? Oh, of course I must go! I can  get to Portland and back in three days, and&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ve got to go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  go he did.</p>
  <p>The  picture was still on at the theater, and with a beating heart Rodney took his  seat to watch it.</p>
  <p>He  could scarce wait for the preliminary scenes, he knew no bit of the plot or  what happened to the characters: he sat tense and watchful for the appearance  of the crowd on the meadow.</p>
  <p>At  last it came,&mdash;and, he nearly sprang from his seat,&mdash;it <i>was</i> Betty! Betty Varian herself,&mdash;he could not be mistaken! She wore  a simple gingham frock, a plain straw hat, and had no sign of the smartness  that always characterized Betty&rsquo;s clothes, but he could not be deceived in that  face, that dear, lovely face of Betty herself!</p>
  <p>And  he saw her lips were moving. He could not read them, as the girl who told of it  had done, but he imagined she said, &ldquo;I am Betty Varian,&mdash;I am Betty Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  her face was expressionless,&mdash;no eager air of imparting information, no apparent  interest in the scene about her,&mdash;the face in the screen seemed like that of an  automaton saying the words as if from a lesson.</p>
  <p>Rod  couldn&rsquo;t understand it. He feared that it was merely a chance likeness,&mdash;he had  heard of exact doubles,&mdash;and as the scene passed, and the crowd on the meadow  returned no more to the story, he left his seat and went in search of the owner  of the theater.</p>
  <p>But  all his questioning failed to elicit any information as to the scene or where  it was taken. The theatrical manager arranged for his picture through an agent  and knew nothing of the company that took it or the author of the play.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Rodney tried again to locate the producer, but failing, decided to  return home and put the matter in the hands of Pennington Wise:</p>
  <p>He  was sure the girl on the screen was Betty, yet had he been told authoritatively  that it was not, he could believe himself the victim of a case of mistaken  identity.</p>
  <p>He  related his experiences to Minna and Zizi and they both felt there was little  to hope for as a result.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; Zizi explained it, &ldquo;when those crowds are picked up at random that way,  they are always chatting about their own affairs. Now, it may well be this girl  had been reading the circulars about Betty, also she may have been told how  much she looked like her, and that would explain her speaking the name. And  except for the actual name, I don&rsquo;t believe the Ella Sheridan person read it  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Minna agreed. &ldquo;I wish I could see something in it, Rod, but it&rsquo;s  too absurd to think of Betty in the moving pictures, even by chance, as you  say. And, too, where could she be that she would saunter out and join in a  public picture like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, it seems utterly absurd,&mdash;but&mdash;it was Betty,&mdash;it was, it <i>was!</i> When will Mr Wise be back, Zizi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had a letter this morning, and he says not to expect him before the end of the  week at least. He is on an important trail and has to go to a distant town,  then he will come back here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I want to consult him about this thing,&rdquo; and Rodney looked disconsolate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Work  at it yourself, Rod,&rdquo; Zizi advised him. &ldquo;Get lists of the picture making  companies, write to them all, and track down that film. It must be a possible  thing to do. Go to it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will,&rdquo; Rodney declared, and forthwith set about it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  I want to go off on a little trip,&rdquo; Zizi said to Minna. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to  say where I&rsquo;m going, for it may turn out a wild goose chase. The idea is not a  very big one,&mdash;yet it might be the means of finding out a lot of the mystery.  Anyway, I want to go, and I&rsquo;ll be back in three days or four at most.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate to have you leave me, Zizi,&rdquo; Mrs Varian answered, &ldquo;but if it means a  chance, why take it. Get back as soon as you can, I&rsquo;ve grown to depend on you  for all my help and cheer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Zizi packed her bag and departed.</p>
  <p>With  her she took a letter that she had abstracted from a drawer of Minna Varian&rsquo;s  writing-desk.</p>
  <p>She  had taken it without leave, indeed without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge, but she felt  the end justified the means.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  indeed the end amounts to anything,&rdquo; Zizi thought, a little ruefully.</p>
  <p>Once  started on her journey, it seemed like a wilder goose chase than it had at  first appeared.</p>
  <p>The  route, the little, ill-appointed New England railroad, took her inland into the  state of Maine, and then westward, until she was in the green hills and valleys  of Vermont.</p>
  <p>It  was when the conductor sung out &ldquo;Greenvale&rdquo; that Zizi, her journey ended,  alighted from the train.</p>
  <p>She  found a rickety old conveyance known as a buckboard and asked the indifferent  driver thereof if she might be conveyed to any inn or hostelry that Greenvale  might boast.</p>
  <p>Still  taciturn, the lanky youth that held the horse told her to &ldquo;get in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  got in, and was transported to a small inn that was not half so bad as she had  feared.</p>
  <p>She  paid her charioteer, and as he set her bag down for her on the porch, she went  into the first room, which seemed to be the office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I have a room for a day or two?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  said the affable clerk, looking at her with undisguised admiration.</p>
  <p>Zizi  smiled at him, quite completing his subjugation, for she wished to be friendly  in order to get all the help she could on her mission.</p>
  <p>She  registered, and then said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greenvale  is a lovely place. How large is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most  three thousand,&rdquo; said the clerk, proudly. &ldquo;Gained a lot of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you have many visitors in the summer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lots;  and we&rsquo;ve got a noted one here right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  less than&mdash;why, here he comes now!&rdquo; and Zizi looked toward the door, and just  entering, she saw,&mdash;Pennington Wise!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    In Greenvale</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the love of Mike, Zizi, what are you doing here?&rdquo; exclaimed Pennington Wise,  nearly struck dumb with astonishment at sight of the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask you that!&rdquo; she returned, looking at him with equal amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  anyway, I&rsquo;m glad to see you;&rdquo; he smiled at her with real pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a  long, horrid and most unsatisfactory quest for the elusive L. N. and I haven&rsquo;t  found him yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  hope of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  but. I mean no expectation or certainty,&mdash;but always hope. Now, what&rsquo;s your lay? <i>Why</i>,&mdash;Zizi, tell me <i>why</i> you&rsquo;re here, or I&rsquo;ll fly off the  handle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  wait till we can sit down somewhere and talk comfortably. I haven&rsquo;t had a room  assigned to me yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  tell me this: you&rsquo;re here on the Varian case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am. Oh, girl, there must be something doing when we&rsquo;re here from different  starting points and for different reasons!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  here because of some revelations of Mrs Varian,&rdquo; Zizi said and Wise stared at  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Varian!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I say, Ziz, go to your room, get your bag unpacked and  your things put away as quick as you can, won&rsquo;t you? And then let&rsquo;s confab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  darted away, she arranged to have a bedroom and sitting-room that she could call  her own for a few days, and in less than half an hour, she was receiving Wise  in her tiny but pleasant domain. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t much of a story,&rdquo; Zizi admitted,&mdash;&ldquo;but I came here because this is where  Betty Varian was born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  here? In Greenvale, Vermont?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;in  a little hospital here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what has that fact to do with Betty&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, I don&rsquo;t know! But I hope,&mdash;I believe it has something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my child, I&rsquo;m up here to investigate the early life of Mrs Lawrence North.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we are most certainly brought to the same place by totally different clues,&mdash;if  they are clues, and one or both of them <i>must</i> prove successful! Who was she, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  near as I can find out, she was a widow when North married her. Her name was  then Mrs Curtis. Her maiden name I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what&rsquo;s the procedure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  procedure, as Wise mapped it out, was to go to the hospital first and see what  could be learned concerning Mrs Varian&rsquo;s stay there twenty years ago.</p>
  <p>They  had no difficulty in getting an interview with the superintendent of the  institution, but as Wise had feared, he was not the man who had been in charge  a score of years previous.</p>
  <p>In  fact, there had been several changes since, and the present incumbent, one Doctor  Hasbrook, showed but slight interest in his callers&rsquo; questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hospital is only twenty-two years old,&rdquo; Hasbrook said, &ldquo;so the patient you&rsquo;re  looking up must have been here soon after it was opened.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have the  records, I suppose?&rdquo; asked Wise. &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;if you care to hunt them over, they are  at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  a result of this permission, Wise and Zizi spent several hours looking over the  old and not very carefully kept records of the earliest years of the little  country hospital.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  worst of it is,&rdquo; said Zizi, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know what we&rsquo;re hoping to find, do  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a dim idea, Zizi, and it&rsquo;s getting clearer,&rdquo; Wise replied, speaking as  from a deep absorption. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a list of births for a year,&mdash;the year Betty Varian was born and,&mdash;oh, Zizi! the  very same night that Mrs Varian&rsquo;s baby was born, a Mrs Curtis also bore a  child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t sit there and babble &lsquo;What?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  wait a bit,&mdash;now, let me see,&mdash;yes, Miss Morton,&mdash;h&rsquo;m,&mdash;Miss Black,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pennington  Wise, if you&rsquo;ve lost your mind, I&rsquo;ll take you to a modern sanitarium,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t  want to go off and leave you here in this little one-horse hospital!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush  up, Zizi, don&rsquo;t chatter! Miss Morton,&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  kept silent in utter exasperation. She knew Wise well enough to be sure he was  on the trail of a real discovery, but her impatience could scarcely stand his  mutterings and his air of suppressed excitement.</p>
  <p>However,  there was nothing to do but wait for his further elucidation and when at last  he closed the books and looked up at her, his face was fairly transfigured with  joyous expectancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on, girl,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rose, and, as Zizi followed, they went back to the superintendent&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you tell us, Doctor Hasbrook,&rdquo; Wise asked, &ldquo;where we can find two nurses who  were here twenty years ago? One was named Black and one Morton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a matter of definite record, and Hasbrook soon informed them that Nurse  Black had died some years ago but that Nurse Morton had married and was still  living in Greenvale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  Heaven,&rdquo; murmured Wise as he took the address of Mrs Briggs, who had been Nurse  Morton.</p>
  <p>To  her house they then went, Zizi now quite content to trudge along by the  detective&rsquo;s side, without asking further questions. She knew she would learn  all in due time.</p>
  <p>The  pretty little cottage which was the home of Mrs Briggs they found and went  through the wooden picket gate and up to the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  tells me she won&rsquo;t be glad to see us,&rdquo; Wise whispered, and then they were  admitted by a middle-aged woman who answered Wise&rsquo;s courteous question by  stating that she was Mrs Briggs.</p>
  <p>She  looked amiable enough, Zizi thought, and she asked her callers to be seated in  her homely but comfortable sitting-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am here,&rdquo; Wise began, watching her face for any expression of alarm, &ldquo;to ask  you a few questions about some cases you attended when you were a nurse in the  Greenvale Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; was the non-committal response, but Zizi&rsquo;s quick eye noticed the woman&rsquo;s  fingers grasp tightly the corner of her apron, which she rolled and twisted  nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  case, especially, was that of a Mrs Varian. You remember it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;I  do not,&rdquo; Mrs Briggs replied, but it was after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and she  spoke, in a low, uncertain voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you do,&rdquo; and Wise looked at her sternly. &ldquo;Mrs Frederick Varian,&mdash;a lovely  lady, who gave birth to a girl child, and you were her attendant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I don&rsquo;t remember any Mrs Varian.&rdquo; The voice was steadier now but the speaker  kept her eyes averted from the detective&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  memory is defective,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Do you, then, remember a Mrs Curtis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  shot went home, and Mrs Briggs cried out excitedly, &ldquo;What do you mean? Who are  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t been asked anything about these people for twenty years, have you?&rdquo;  Wise went on. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think you ever would be asked about them, did you?  Your memory is all right,&mdash;now what have you to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say. I remember a Mrs Curtis, but she was not my patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Mrs Varian was your patient. But Mrs Curtis figured in the Varian case pretty  largely, I should say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Briggs broke down. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do any harm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I only did what I was  told. I obeyed the others who were in greater authority than I was.&rdquo; She buried  her face in her apron and sobbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Mrs Briggs,&rdquo; Wise said kindly; &ldquo;tell the truth, and I promise you it  will be far better for you in the long run, than to make up any falsehoods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what happened,&rdquo; the woman said, eagerly, as she wiped her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, sir,  tell me? Did Mrs&mdash;Mrs Varian&rsquo;s little girl live to grow up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs <i>Varian&rsquo;s</i> little girl!&rdquo; Wise repeated  with a strange intonation and a shrewd shake of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs Varian&rsquo;s little girl,&rdquo; the woman insisted obstinately. &ldquo;They took the child  away when it was four weeks old, Mrs Varian was quite well and happy then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she was,&mdash;but, were you happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; The words were defiant, but Mrs Briggs&rsquo; face showed an involuntary fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, Mrs Briggs, tell me the whole story and you will get off scot free. Keep  back the truth or any portion of the truth, and you will find yourself in most  serious trouble. Which do you choose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the Varians? Where is Mr Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Varian is dead. You have me to reckon with instead of him. Oh, I begin to see!  Was it Mr Varian&rsquo;s scheme?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was. I told you I had no choice in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he paid you well. Now, are you going to tell me, or must I drag the story from  you, piece-meal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it all, then. Begin at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  beginning was merely that the Varians were spending the summer here in a little  cottage over on the next street to this. Mrs Varian was expecting a confinement  but hoped to get back to the city before it took place. However, she was not  well, and Mr Varian brought her to the hospital for consultation and treatment.  I was her nurse, and I came to know her well, and&mdash;to love her. She was a dear  lady, and as her first babies had died in infancy she was greatly worried and  anxious lest this new baby should be sickly or, worse, should be born dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Varian was the most devoted husband I ever saw. He put up with all his wife&rsquo;s  whims and tantrums,&mdash;and she was full of them,&mdash;and he indulged and petted her  all the time. He was quite as anxious as she for a healthy child, and when they  discovered that she must remain here for her confinement, he sent to town for  all sorts of things to make her comfortable and happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;the  baby was born,&mdash;and it was born dead. Mrs Varian did not know it, and when I  told Mr Varian, he was so disappointed I thought he would go off his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  there was another case in the hospital that was a very sad matter. It was Mrs  Curtis. She, poor woman, was confined that same night, and her baby was born,  fine and healthy. But she didn&rsquo;t want the child. She was so poor she scarce  could keep soul and body together. She had three little children already and  her husband had died by accident only a month before. How to care for a new  little one, she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Nurse Black who thought of the plan of substituting the lovely Curtis child  for the dead Varian baby, and we proposed it to Mr Varian. To our surprise he  fairly jumped at it. He begged us to ascertain if Mrs Curtis would agree, saying  he would pay her well. Now, Mrs Curtis was only too grateful to be assured of a  good home and care for her child, and willingly gave it over to the Varians.  But Mrs Varian never knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was Mr Varian&rsquo;s idea, and it was an honest and true desire to please his wife  and to provide her with a healthy child such as she herself could never bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Mr Varian was decided at the last by the piteous cries of Mrs Varian for  her baby. When he heard her, he said quickly, &lsquo;Take the Curtis child to her,&mdash;and  see if she accepts it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did she?&rdquo; asked Zizi, her eyes shining at the dramatic story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she did! She cried out in joy that it was her baby and a beautiful, healthy  child, and she was so pleased and happy and contented that she dropped off into  a fine, natural sleep and began to get well at once. When she wakened she asked  for the child, and so it went on until there was no question what to do. The  whole matter was considered settled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knew of the fraud?&rdquo; asked Wise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one in the world but Mrs Curtis, Mr Varian and we two nurses. Mr Varian paid  the poor mother ten thousand dollars, and he gave us a thousand dollars apiece.  The authorities of the hospital never knew. They assumed the dead child was Mrs  Curtis&rsquo; and the living child was Mrs Varian&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the doctors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was but one. I forgot him. Yes, he knew, but he was a greedy scamp, and Mr  Varian easily bought him over. He died soon after, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that now,&mdash;what living people know of this thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;you  say Mr Varian is dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs Varian never learned the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Zizi answered, emphatically, &ldquo;she never did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Nurse Black is dead, and the doctor is dead,&mdash;why, then nobody knows it&mdash;oh, yes,  Mrs Curtis, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She,  too, is dead,&rdquo; Wise said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  nobody knows it but we three here. Unless of course, Mr Varian or Mrs Curtis  told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Varian never did,&rdquo; Wise said,&mdash;&ldquo;as to Mrs Curtis I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;d never tell,&rdquo; Mrs Briggs declared. &ldquo;She was honest in the whole matter.  She said she didn&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;d support her three children, let alone a  fourth. And, she was glad and thankful to have it brought up among rich and  kind people. She never would have let it go unless she had been sure of their  kindness and care, but we told her what fine people the Varians were and she  was satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  there adoption papers taken out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Briggs stared at Wise&rsquo;s question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  no; it wasn&rsquo;t an adoption, it was a substitution. How could there be an  adoption? Mrs Varian thought it her own child,&mdash;the authorities of the hospital  thought the living child was Mrs Varian&rsquo;s. The matter was kept a perfect  secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I think it was all right,&rdquo; Zizi defended. &ldquo;So long as Mr Varian knew, so long  as Mrs Curtis was satisfied, I don&rsquo;t see where any harm was done to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t either, miss,&rdquo; said Mrs Briggs eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gratified to hear you say  that, and I hope, sir, you feel the same way about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I scarcely know what to say,&rdquo; Wise returned. &ldquo;It depends on whether you view  the whole thing from a judicial&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  from a viewpoint of common sense and kind-heartedness!&rdquo; Zizi said. &ldquo;I think it  was fine,&mdash;and I&rsquo;m only sorry for poor Mr Varian who had to bear the weight of  his secret all alone through life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Zizi, that would explain the pearls!&rdquo; Wise cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it does! He had to leave them to a Varian,&mdash;and Betty wasn&rsquo;t a Varian,&mdash;oh,  Penny, what a situation! That poor man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it explains a lot of other things,&rdquo; Wise said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, Mrs Briggs,  we&rsquo;ll be going now. As to this matter, I think I can say, if you&rsquo;ll continue to  keep it secret, we will do the same, at least for the present. Did you never  tell anybody? Not even your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never did. It was the only secret I ever kept from my husband, he&rsquo;s dead now  this seven year, poor man,&mdash;but I felt I couldn&rsquo;t tell him. It wasn&rsquo;t my secret.  When I took Mr Varian&rsquo;s money, I promised never to tell about the child. And I  kept my word. Until now,&rdquo; she added, and Wise said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had to tell now, Mrs Briggs, if you hadn&rsquo;t told willingly and frankly, I could  have brought the law to bear on your decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I thought, sir. Please tell me of the child? Is she now a fine girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  realized that up in this far away hamlet the news of Betty Varian&rsquo;s disappearance  had not become known, so he merely said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  never seen her, but I&rsquo;m told she is a fine and lovely girl. Her mother is a  charming woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you say so, sir, for though I was sorry for her, she was a terror for  peevishness and fretting. Yet, after she got the little girl she seemed  transformed, she was that happy and content.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Back  to the inn went Pennington Wise and Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  most astonishing revelation I ever heard,&rdquo; was Wise&rsquo;s comment, as he closed the  door of Zizi&rsquo;s sitting room and sat down to talk it over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do you come out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all sorts of unexpected places. Now, Zizi, have you realized yet that Lawrence  North married that Mrs Curtis?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Practically;  he married a widow named Curtis, who formerly lived in Greenvale, Vermont. I&rsquo;ve  not struck any other. And besides, it connects North with this whole Varian  case and I&rsquo;m sure he is mixed up in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the question. But here&rsquo;s a more immediate question, Zizi. Are we to tell Mrs  Varian what we have learned from the nurse up here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can we help telling her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  think, Zizi. Have we a right to divulge Frederick Varian&rsquo;s secret? After he  spent his life keeping it quiet, shall we be justified in blurting it out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, that&rsquo;s why Mr Varian and Betty were at odds! She wasn&rsquo;t his child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t know that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but he did, and it made him irritable and impatient. Oh, don&rsquo;t you see? He was  everlastingly thinking that her traits were not Varian traits nor traits of her  mother&rsquo;s family,&mdash;and he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the child&rsquo;s real mother,&mdash;and  oh, I can see how altogether he was upset over and over again when Betty would  do or say something that he didn&rsquo;t approve of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s so,&mdash;but Zizi, here&rsquo;s a more important revelation. The reason Frederick  Varian was so opposed to Betty&rsquo;s marrying was because he found himself in such  an equivocal position! He couldn&rsquo;t let her marry a decent man without telling  him the story of her birth,&mdash;yet, he couldn&rsquo;t tell it! He couldn&rsquo;t tell the  young man without telling his wife,&mdash;and to tell Mrs Varian,&mdash;at this late  date,&mdash;oh, well, no wonder the poor father,&mdash;who was no father,&mdash;was nearly  distracted. No wonder he was crusty and snappish at Betty,&mdash;yet of course the  poor girl was in no way to blame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  you think Mrs Varian would have suspected?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  why should she? And, too, her husband took good care that she shouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a  truly marvelous situation!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    The Last Letter</b></h2>
  <p>When  Wise and Zizi returned to Headland House, they found Doctor Varian there on one  of his brief visits.</p>
  <p>Deciding  that it was the best course to pursue the detective took the physician entirely  into his confidence. The two were closeted in the library, and Wise related his  discoveries regarding the Vermont hospital.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is astounding! Incredible!&rdquo; exclaimed Varian, &ldquo;but if true, and it must be  true, it explains a great many things. As a doctor, I can understand these  things, and looking back, I see that Betty never had any traits of either  parent. Not always are children like their parents but I&rsquo;ve never seen a case  where there was not some sign of heredity, some likeness to father or mother in  looks or character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Betty showed none such. She was a dear girl, and we all loved her,&mdash;but she was  not in any way like Fred or Minna. To be sure, I never thought about this definitely,  for I had no reason to think of such a thing as you&rsquo;re telling me. But,  recollecting Betty, for I&rsquo;ve known her all her life, I can see where she is of  a totally different stamp from my brother or his wife. My, what a case!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you blame Mr Varian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit! He did it out of the kindest of motives. He was not only a devoted  husband but a willing slave to his wife, even in cases where she was  unreasonable or over-exacting. He petted and humored her in every imaginable  way, and when the third baby was expected, the poor man was nearly frantic lest  it should not live and Minna could not bear the disappointment. And so, when,  as it seems by a mere chance he had an opportunity to provide her with a  strong, healthy, beautiful child,&mdash;I, for one, am not surprised that he did so,  nor do I greatly blame him. As you represent it, the poor mother was willing  and glad to consent to the arrangement. An adoption would have been perfectly  legitimate and proper. Fred only chose the substitution plan to save Minna from  trouble and worry. I know Fred so well, he was impulsive and he stopped at  nothing to please or comfort his wife. So, I can easily see how he decided, on  the impulse of the moment, to do this thing, and if, as you say, Minna took to  the child at once, and loved it as her own, of course he felt that the plan  must be kept up, the deception must be maintained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  accounts, I dare say, for the slight friction that so frequently arose between  Betty and her father,&mdash;for we may as well continue to call him her father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does. I suppose when the child exhibited traits that annoyed or displeased  Fred, he resented it and he couldn&rsquo;t help showing it. He had a strong clannish  feeling about the Varians and he was sensitive to many slight faults in Betty  that Minna never gave any heed to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an interesting study in the relative values of heredity and environment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is; and it proves my own theory which is that their influences average about  fifty-fifty. Many times heredity is stronger than environment, and often it&rsquo;s  the other way, but oftenest of all, as in this case, the one offsets the other.  I know nothing of Betty&rsquo;s real ancestry, but it must have been fairly good, or  Fred never would have taken her at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it was, of course, his clannish loyalty to his family name that would not let  him leave the pearls to Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they have always been left to a Varian and Fred couldn&rsquo;t leave them to one who  was really an outsider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  also explains Mr Varian&rsquo;s objections to Betty&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it does! Poor man, what he must have suffered. He was a high-strung nature,  impulsive and even impetuous, but of a sound, impeccable honesty that wouldn&rsquo;t  brook a shadow of wrong to any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose what he had done troubled him more or less all his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. Not his conscience,&mdash;I can see how he looked on his deed as right,&mdash;but  he was bothered by circumstances,&mdash;and it was a difficult situation that he had  created. The more I realize it, the sorrier I feel for my poor brother. To make  his will was a perplexity! His lawyer has told me that when he left the pearls  away from Betty, he said, &lsquo;I <i>must</i> do  it! I <i>have</i> to do it!&rsquo; in a voice that  was fairly agonized. The lawyer couldn&rsquo;t understand what he meant, but assumed  it was some cloud on Betty&rsquo;s birth. I daresay Fred was not bothered about his  money, for he knew if he died first, Minna would provide for Betty. But the  pearls he had to arrange for. Oh, well, Mr Wise, now then, viewed in the light  of these revelations, where do we stand? Who killed my brother? Who killed the  maid, Martha? Who kidnapped Betty and Mr North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  are not easy questions, Doctor Varian,&rdquo; Wise responded, with a grave face, &ldquo;but  of this I am confident,&mdash;one name will answer them all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not quite sure enough yet to say that I do,&mdash;but I have a strong suspicion. I  think it is the man who wrote the blackmailing letters to Mr Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man we call Stephen? It well may be. They referred to a robbed woman. Now, my  brother never robbed anybody in the commonly accepted sense of that term, but  it may mean the mother of Betty. Could the doctor in the Greenvale Hospital,  that attended the two women that night, be trying to make money out of the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  tell me he died some years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  these letters are not all recent. And, too, he might have divulged the secret  before he died, and whoever he told used it as a threat against my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  hardly a blackmailing proposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is. Say the doctor,&mdash;or the doctor&rsquo;s confidant threatened Fred with  exposure of the secret of Betty&rsquo;s birth, I know my brother well enough to be  certain that he would pay large sums before he would bring on Minna and Betty  the shock and publicity, even though there was no actual disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, granting a blackmailer, he&rsquo;s the one to look for, but on the other hand,  why should he kill Mr Varian, when he was his hope of financial plunder? Why  should he kidnap Betty? And, above all, why should he kill Martha and abduct  Lawrence North?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  only one of those very pertinent questions that I can answer is the one about  Betty. Whoever kidnapped her, did it for ransom. That is evidenced by the  letters to Minna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they are genuine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they are,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure. She had another while you were away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did! To what purport?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Further  and more desperate insistence of the ransom,&mdash;and quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  regular procedure! If it is a fake they would do the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and  they would also, if it is a real issue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wise  went at once to find Minna and see the new letter.</p>
  <p>It  was indeed imperative, saying, in part:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we have Betty safe, but this is your last chance to get her back. We are too  smart for your wise detective and we are in dead earnest. Also Betty will be  dead in earnest unless you do exactly as we herein direct. Also, this is our  last letter. If you decide against us, we settle Betty&rsquo;s account and call the  whole deal off. Our instructions are the same as before. On Friday night, at  midnight, go to the edge of the cliff and throw the package of money over. Tie  to it some float and we will do the rest. That is, if you act in sincerity. If  you are false-minded in the least detail, we will know it. We are wiser than  Wise. So take your choice and,&mdash;have a care! No one will be more faithful than  we, if you act in good faith. Also, no one can be worse than we can be, if you  betray us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  somewhat lengthy letter was written on the same typewriter as had been used for  the others, and Wise studied it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing to be deduced from the materials,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too smart to use  traceable paper or typing. But there are other indications, and, I think, Mrs  Varian, at last I see a ray of hope, and I trust it will soon be a bright gleam  and then full sunshine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;  Zizi cried, clapping her hands. &ldquo;When Penny talks poetry, he&rsquo;s in high good  humor,&mdash;and when he&rsquo;s in high good humor, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s on the right  track,&mdash;and when he&rsquo;s on the right track,&mdash;he gets there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  they told Wise about the strange communication from the girl who knew  lip-reading, and the detective was even more highly elated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;  he exclaimed. &ldquo;Perfectly remarkable! Where&rsquo;s Granniss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone  to Boston to see a moving picture concern. He may have to go on to New York. He  hopes to be back by Saturday at latest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Minna who answered, and her face was jubilant at the hope renewed in her  heart by Wise&rsquo;s own hopefulness.</p>
  <p>But  she determined in her secret thoughts to throw the money over the cliff on  Friday night, whether the detective agreed to that plan or not. What, she  argued to Mrs Fletcher, whom she took into her confidence on this matter, was  any amount of money compared to the mere chance of getting back her child? She  urged and bribed Fletcher until she consented to help Minna get out of the  house on Friday night without Wise&rsquo;s knowledge.</p>
  <p>It  was now Tuesday, and after much questioning of every one in the house as to  what had taken place in his absence, the detective shut himself alone in the  library, and surrounded by his own written notes, and with many of Mr Varian&rsquo;s  letters and financial papers, he thought and brooded over it all for some  hours.</p>
  <p>At  last he opened the door and called Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my child,&rdquo; he said, closing the door behind her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a line on things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do hope, Penny, you&rsquo;ll watch out for Mrs Varian. She&rsquo;s going to throw the money  over the cliff on Friday night without your knowledge or consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t without your knowledge, I admit. But, she can without your consent. Her  money is her own and you&rsquo;ve no real authority that will let you dictate to her  how to use it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  oh, Queen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, when you smile like that, I know something&rsquo;s up! What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  luck, I hope. Ziz, do you remember you said you had a green smear on your frock  like the one on Martha&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it there yet, or did you clean it off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  there yet, I haven&rsquo;t worn the dress since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  went, and returned with the little frock, a mere wisp of light, thin material,  and handed it to Pennington Wise.</p>
  <p>He  inspected the green streak, which was visible though not conspicuous, and then  he sniffed at it with such absorption that Zizi laughed outright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pen,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;in detective stories they always represent the great detective as  sniffing like a hound on a scent. You&rsquo;re literally doing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  astonishing that I should, little one, when you realize that this green smear  is a beacon to light our way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; Zizi&rsquo;s big Hack eyes grew serious at Wise&rsquo;s tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  way out; the exit; the solution of the mystery of the secret passage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny, tell me! You&rsquo;ll be the death of me if you keep the truth from me! I&rsquo;m  crazy with suspense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Zizi&rsquo;s curiosity could not be gratified just then, for Fletcher came to say  that Minna desired the girl&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <p>Minna  Varian had come to depend much on Zizi&rsquo;s charm and entertainment, and often  sent for her when feeling especially blue or nervous.</p>
  <p>Zizi  had been waiting for an opportunity, and now as the nurse left her alone with  Mrs Varian, she gradually and deftly led the talk around to Betty as a baby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what you thought when you first saw your little daughter,&rdquo; Zizi said, in her  pretty, coaxing way. &ldquo;How old was she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  an hour or so, I think,&rdquo; Minna said, reminiscently. &ldquo;And my first thought was,  &lsquo;Oh, thank God for a healthy, beautiful baby!&rsquo; She was so lovely,&mdash;and so strong  and perfect! I had hoped she would be all right, but I never looked for such a  marvel as came to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr Varian was as pleased as you were!&rdquo; Zizi said, gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&mdash;but,&rdquo; Minna&rsquo;s face clouded a little, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to express it,&mdash;but  he never seemed to love Betty as he did our first children. He admired  her,&mdash;nobody could help it,&mdash;but he had a queer little air of restraint about  her. It lasted all through life. I can&rsquo;t understand it,&mdash;unless he was jealous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of my love and adoration of the child. Silly idea, I know, but I&rsquo;ve racked my  brain and I can&rsquo;t think of any other explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t explain the Varian pearls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nothing can explain that! Oh, nothing explains anything! Zizi, you&rsquo;ve no idea  what I suffer! I wonder I keep my mind! Just think of a woman who never had to  decide a question for herself, if she didn&rsquo;t want to,&mdash;who never had a care or  responsibility that she didn&rsquo;t assume of her own accord,&mdash;who had a husband to  care for her, a daughter to love her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  poor woman broke down completely, and Zizi had her hands full to ward off the  violent hysterics that attacked her at times.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Pennington Wise, convinced of the origin of the green smear on Zizi&rsquo;s frock,  was starting forth to prove his conviction.</p>
  <p>Armed  only with a powerful flashlight and a good-sized hammer, he went out to the  kitchen and through that to the cellar.</p>
  <p>There,  he went straight to the old well, and testing the rope as he did so, he let the  bucket down as far as it would go. Then, with monkey-like agility he began to  clamber down,&mdash;partly supported by clinging to the rope, partly by getting firm  footholds on the old stones that lined the well.</p>
  <p>Scarcely  had he started, when he experimentally drew his hand across the stones, and by  his flashlight perceived a green smear, the counterpart of that on Zizi&rsquo;s  frock. Also, the counterpart of that on Martha&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>Yet,  the dead girl could scarcely have been in the well! So,&mdash;her assailant must have  been.</p>
  <p>However,  he went on investigating.</p>
  <p>He  noted carefully the walls as he descended, and it was not until he almost  reached the bottom of the dried-up old well, that he noticed anything strange.</p>
  <p>All  of the wall was very rough and uneven but here was what appeared to be a  distinct hole, roughly filled in with loose stones.</p>
  <p>Standing  now on the bottom of the well, slippery with moisture but no water above his  shoe soles, he used his hammer to dislodge these stones, working carefully and  slowly, but with a certainty of success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool  that I was,&rdquo; he chattered to himself, &ldquo;not to come down here the very first  thing! To trust to Zizi was all right,&mdash;the kid couldn&rsquo;t notice this place,&mdash;but  I had no business to trust that half-baked sheriff or his man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  work soon disclosed the fact that the loose stones apparently closed the mouth  of a deep hole.</p>
  <p>When  all that were loose had been either pulled out or pushed in, he found there was  an aperture large enough to permit a man&rsquo;s body to pass through, and without  hesitation, he scrambled through it.</p>
  <p>His  flashlight showed him that almost from the start the hole widened until it  became a fair-sized tunnel. Crawling along this for a hundred yards or so, he  heard the splash of water, and soon he no longer needed his flashlight, as  daylight streamed in through a narrow fissure in the rock.</p>
  <p>It  was fortunate for Wise that it did, for just ahead the tunnel descended  sharply, and at the bottom, what was evidently the surf was surging in from the  ocean.</p>
  <p>It  was quite dark below, and being unable to progress further, Wise backed out of  the tunnel, it wasn&rsquo;t wide enough to turn around in, and reaching the well  again, he ascended to the surface.</p>
  <p>He  went to his room, looked with satisfaction on the numerous smears of green and  brown that disfigured his suit,&mdash;which he had taken care should be an old one.</p>
  <p>No  one knew what he had done, nor did any one know his destination when, half an  hour later, he set off for the village.</p>
  <p>He  went to the inn and inquired where he could get the best motor boat that could  be hired.</p>
  <p>A  suitable one was found and its owner agreed to take Wise on an exploring  expedition at the next low tide. This would not be until the following morning,  so the detective went back to Headland House.</p>
  <p>Then,  he concentrated all his efforts and attention on the subject of the moving  picture film that had been said to portray Betty Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rod  Granniss vows it was really Betty,&rdquo; Zizi insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  ought to know,&rdquo; said Wise. &ldquo;A man in love with a girl doesn&rsquo;t mistake her  identity. Besides, it&rsquo;s quite on the cards, Ziz. Say Betty is confined  somewhere,&mdash;say she is let out for a little exercise in care of a jailer, of  course,&mdash;say there&rsquo;s a M. P. contraption taking a picture of a crowd,&mdash;they often  do,&mdash;pick up stray passers-by you know, and say, Betty somehow got into the  picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the jailer, as you call him, wouldn&rsquo;t let her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  likely a woman in charge of her. And, maybe a woman not averse to taking the  few dollars those people pay to actors who just make up a crowd. Well, say that  happened, and then Betty, not daring to speak aloud, made her lips form the  words &lsquo;I am Betty Varian,&rsquo; in the hope that among a few thousands of lip  readers in the country one might strike twelve!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  could be so clever as all that, Pen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might be on a chance inspiration. Anyway, how else can you explain it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  anybody might have said that, who wasn&rsquo;t Betty at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why? What would be the sense of it? and why would such a thing occur to anybody  but Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s true,&mdash;then you can find her! Surely you can track down a moving picture  company!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it isn&rsquo;t that! It&rsquo;s tracking down the place where Betty is confined,&mdash;and&mdash;doing  it while she is still alive. You see, Zizi, those ransom letters are true  bills, and the villains have nearly reached the end of their patience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why don&rsquo;t you approve of Mrs Varian&rsquo;s throwing the money over the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may advise her to do it by Friday night,&mdash;if nothing happens in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  look here, Penny,&rdquo; Zizi said, after a thoughtful moment, &ldquo;if your theory is the  right one, why didn&rsquo;t Betty scream out, &lsquo;I am Betty Varian!&rsquo; and take a chance  that somebody in the crowd would rescue her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem a natural thing to do, unless the girl had been so cowed by threats  of punishment or even torture if she made any outcry when allowed to go for a  walk. I&rsquo;m visualizing that girl as kept in close confinement, but not in any  want or discomfort. She is most likely treated well as to food, rooms and all  that, but is not allowed to step out of doors except with a strict guard and  under some terrible penalty if she attempts to make herself known. With Betty&rsquo;s  love of fresh air and sunshine she would agree to almost anything to get out of  doors. Then, too, if she merely formed those words without sound, the chance of  their being read by a lip reader was really greater than the chance of doing any  good by crying out aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  she done that, whoever had her in charge would have whisked her away at once,  and no one would have paid any attention to the slight disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all perfectly logical and, oh, I hope Rodney gets some clue to the place where  the picture was taken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so, Ziz, but they&rsquo;ve probably moved Betty away from there by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you find out, Penny, what that stain on my frock was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear, you&rsquo;ve struck it! You got that stain while you were down the well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Zizi&rsquo;s eyes lighted up; &ldquo;of course I did! Those damp, mossy stones. And, then,  oh, Wise one, just how did the same stain get on Martha&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  Zizi,&rdquo; Wise spoke almost solemnly, &ldquo;is part of the solution of the whole great  mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    The Trap</b></h2>
  <p>In  a small but powerful motor boat Wise went on his voyage of exploration. The man  who managed the craft was a stolid, silent person who obeyed Wise&rsquo;s orders  without comment.</p>
  <p>But  when the detective directed that he go round the base of the headland, and  skirt close to the rocks he grumbled at the danger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful of the danger,&rdquo; Wise said, &ldquo;steer clear of hidden reefs, but go close  to the overhanging cliff, there where I&rsquo;m pointing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Skirting  the cliff, at last Wise discovered what he was looking for, a small cave, worn  in the rock by the sea. The floor of this cave rose sharply and it was with  difficulty that Wise managed to scramble from the boat to a secure footing on  the slippery wet rocks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  out there,&rdquo; said the imperturbable boatman, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get caught in there when  the tide comes up. I never noticed that hole in the wall before, it must be out  o&rsquo; sight &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; at low tide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay  where you are and wait for me,&rdquo; Wise directed, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not out here again in  half an hour, go on home. But I&rsquo;ll probably be back in less than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will, if you&rsquo;re back at all! The tide will turn in fifteen minutes and in half  an hour it&rsquo;ll be all you can do to get out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Disappearing,  Wise began his climb up the floor of the cave, and at a point just above high  water there was a fissure in the cliff which admitted air and some light. At  this point the cave ran back for some distance, though still on a rising level.  During the winter storms the ocean evidently had worn this tunnel in the rock.</p>
  <p>Wise  at once realized that this nature-made tunnel ran on for some distance until it  ended in the old well.</p>
  <p>Using  his flashlight when necessary, he made his way, until he reached the pile of  stones which he himself had pushed out from the well and found to his  satisfaction that he had indeed come to the well, and that his solution of the  mystery of a secret passage into Headland House was accomplished.</p>
  <p>But  what a solution! The difficulty and danger of entrance or exit by means of that  rock tunnel and that old well could scarce be exaggerated!</p>
  <p>Moreover,  all such entrances or exits must be made at the lowest ebb of the tide. But the  cave was roomy, not uncomfortable, and the tunnel, though cramped in places,  was fairly navigable.</p>
  <p>There  was plenty of room in the cave quite above reach of the highest tide, and the  whole matter was clear and simple now that he saw it all, but he marveled at  the energy and enterprise that could conceive, plan and carry out the various  attacks.</p>
  <p>Whoever  the criminal, or the master criminal, might be, he had come up through that  tunnel and well on the several occasions of the kidnapping of Betty, the murder  of Martha, the abduction of North,&mdash;yes,&mdash;and Wise remembered the letter that had  been mysteriously left on the hall table,&mdash;also the night the library had been  entered,&mdash;clearly, the man came and went at will!</p>
  <p>A  master mind, Wise concluded, he had to deal with, and he set his own best energies  to work on his problems.</p>
  <p>The  way between Headland House and the outer world was not easy of negotiation, but  it was a way, and it was passable to a determined human being.</p>
  <p>Wise  was back inside the prescribed half hour, and the uninterested boatman took him  back to the Harbor without question or comment as to his enterprise.</p>
  <p>That  afternoon, Wise called Minna and Doctor Varian into the library and closed the  door.</p>
  <p>Zizi  was also present, her black eyes shining with anticipation, for she knew from  Wise&rsquo;s manner and expression that he was making progress, and was about to  disclose his discoveries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have learned a great deal,&rdquo; the detective began, &ldquo;but not all. At least, I have  found the so-called secret passage, which we all felt sure must exist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  described the cave and the tunnel as he had found them, and the outlet into the  old well, so carefully piled with loose stones that it would escape the  observance of almost any searcher.</p>
  <p>He  told briefly but graphically of his exit from the well for a distance, and of  his later entrance from the cave and his procedure to the well.</p>
  <p>Zizi  nodded her bird-like little head, with an air of complete understanding, Doctor  Varian was absorbedly interested and profoundly amazed, while Minna looked  helplessly ignorant of just what Wise was talking about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; she said, piteously, &ldquo;but never mind that, I don&rsquo;t care,  if you say it&rsquo;s all so. Now, where is Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Wise said, gently, &ldquo;but we are on the way at last to find  out. As I reconstruct the crime, now, that day that Betty returned for her  camera, she must have done so under one of two conditions. Either her errand  was genuine, in which case, she surprised the criminal here at some nefarious  work,&mdash;or, which I think far more probable, she came back pretending it was for  her camera, but really because of some message or communication which she had  received purporting some good to her, but really a ruse of the criminal, who  was here for the purpose of abducting the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  ransom?&rdquo; asked Doctor Varian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for ransom. Now, he would naturally attack her in the hall. Perhaps she threw  herself on the sofa, clung to it, and was carried off, still holding that  yellow pillow, either unconsciously, or he may have used it to stifle her  cries. There were two men involved, of that I am sure. For, when they had  partly accomplished their purpose, Mr Varian appeared at the door and one of  the men had to intercept his entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  rather fancy the killing of Mr Varian was unintentional,&mdash;or possibly, self-defence,  for these ruffians did not want to kill their blackmail victim. They may have  parleyed with the father to pay them to release the girl, and when he showed  fight, as he would, they did also, and as a result, Mr Varian met his death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However,  that is mere surmise. What we know is, that Betty was carried through the  kitchen where the pillow fell,&mdash;still holding one of her hair-pins, probably  caught during the struggle,&mdash;and she was carried down the cellar stairs. During  this trip her string of beads broke, and were scattered about. As we never  found but a few, and those were under furniture or cupboards, I gather the  villains picked up all they could see, lest they should be found as evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  they were!&rdquo; said Zizi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  they were,&rdquo; Wise assented. &ldquo;Then, they carried that girl whether conscious or  chloroformed I can&rsquo;t say, down to the cellar, down the old well, through the  tunnel to the cave. There they could wait any number of hours until the tide  served, and take her away in a boat without attracting the notice of anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  likely at night,&rdquo; Zizi put in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  likely. Anyway, Mrs Varian, that&rsquo;s my finding. It&rsquo;s all very dreadful, but  horrifying as it is, it opens the way to better things. To go on, there can be  no doubt that this same villain, and a clever one he is, returned here at night  for plunder and on other errands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  came and left the letter found so mysteriously on the hall table. He came to  rob the library safe, thinking the ransom money was in it. And he was spied  upon and discovered by the maid, Martha, so that he ruthlessly strangled the  poor thing to death, rather than face exposure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then he abducted North!&rdquo; Doctor Varian cried; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s easy to see why! North  had doubtless also spied on him, and somehow he forced North to go away with  him,&mdash;perhaps at pistol&rsquo;s point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  our question is,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  questions!&rdquo; Zizi cried; &ldquo;first, who is the criminal,&mdash;and second where is he  keeping Betty all this time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and we know a great deal to start on.&rdquo; Wise spoke thoughtfully. &ldquo;We know,  almost to a certainty, that it is the man whom we call Stephen, because he  wrote threatening letters signed &lsquo;Step.&rsquo; We know he is diabolically clever,  absolutely fearless, and willing to commit any crime or series of crimes to  gain his end, which is merely the large sum of money he has demanded from Mrs  Varian, and which he had previously demanded from Mr Varian, as blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should he blackmail my husband?&rdquo; Minna asked, tearfully, and Wise said, &ldquo;There  is not always a sound reason for blackmail, Mrs Varian. Sometimes it is an  unjust accusation or a mistaken suspicion. Any way, as you have often declared,  Mr Frederick Varian was a noble and upright man, and his integrity could not be  questioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  then,&rdquo; said Doctor Varian, &ldquo;to find this master hand at crime. I am astounded  at your revelations, Mr Wise, and I confess myself utterly in the dark as to  our next step.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  animal that attacks in the open,&rdquo; Wise returned, &ldquo;may be shot or snared. But a  wicked, crafty animal may only be caught by a trap. I propose to set a trap to  catch our foe. It is a wicked trap, but he is a wicked man. It will harm him  physically, but he deserves to be harmed physically. It is a sly, underhand  method, but so are his own. Therefore, I conclude that a trap is justified in  his case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean a real, literal mantrap?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean just that. I have already procured it and I propose to set it tonight.  This is Thursday. As matters stand now, our &lsquo;Stephen&rsquo; is assuming or at least  hoping that Mrs Varian means to accede to his last request and throw the money  over the cliff tomorrow, Friday night. Now, I feel pretty positive that Stephen  is not so confident of getting that money safely as he pretends he is. He must  be more or less fearful of detection. I&rsquo;m sure that he will return to this  house tonight, by his usual mode of entrance, and will try to steal the money.  Then he will disappear and he may or may not give up Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think he&rsquo;ll come here? Tonight?&rdquo; Doctor Varian was astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we&rsquo;ll be ready for him! I fancy between us, Mr Wise, we can account for him and  his accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  dangerous, Doctor. He would kill us both before we knew it. No, I&rsquo;m going to  set my trap. If he comes he deserves to be trapped. If he doesn&rsquo;t come, there  is certainly no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  shall we hide the money?&rdquo; asked Minna, nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; and Wise&rsquo;s face set sternly. &ldquo;He will never get as far as the  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hating  his job, but fully alive to the justice and necessity of it, Wise set his trap  that night.</p>
  <p>It  was a real trap, and was set up in the kitchen in such a position that it faced  the cellar door. It consisted of a short-barreled shotgun which was mounted on  an improvised gun carriage, made of a strong packing box.</p>
  <p>This  contrivance was fastened carefully to the kitchen wall about twelve feet in  front of the cellar door, and when the door should be opened, the trap would be  sprung and the shotgun discharged.</p>
  <p>A  steel spring fastened to the trigger, and a strong cord running to a pulley in  the ceiling, thence to another, and finally to a pulley in the floor, and on to  the door knob completed the deadly mechanism.</p>
  <p>The  tension of the spring was so carefully adjusted that an intruder might open the  door a foot or more before the strain was carried to the trigger. This insured  a sure aim and a clear shot.</p>
  <p>Wise  tested his trap thoroughly, and finally, with a grim nod of his head, declared  it was all right.</p>
  <p>He  had sent the servants and the women-folks to bed, before beginning his work,  and now he and Doctor Varian seated themselves in the library to await  developments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I said,&rdquo; Wise remarked, &ldquo;&lsquo;Stephen&rsquo; may not come at all, he may send an  accomplice. Yet this I expect the most surely,&mdash;he will come himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you no idea of his identity, Mr Wise?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have an idea,&mdash;and if he does not come tonight, I will tell you who I think he  is. But we will wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  waited, now silent and now indulging in a few low toned bits of conversation,  when at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning the report of the gun brought them to their  feet and they raced to the kitchen.</p>
  <p>The  roaring detonation was still in their ears as they strode through the hall, and  the smell of powder greeted them at the kitchen door.</p>
  <p>The  cellar door was open, and on the floor near it lay a man breathing with  difficulty.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Varian dropped on his knees beside him, and his professional instinct was at  once in full working order, even as his astonished voice exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawrence  North!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I expected,&rdquo; Wise said, &ldquo;and well he deserves his fate. Will he live, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a few moments,&rdquo; was the preoccupied reply. &ldquo;I can do nothing for him. He  received the full charge in the abdomen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  your story, North,&rdquo; Wise said, briefly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste time in useless groaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>North  glared at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  fiend!&rdquo; he gasped, gurgling in rage and agony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  the fiend!&rdquo; Varian said; &ldquo;hush your vituperation and tell us where Betty is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile of low cunning came over North&rsquo;s villainous face. He used his small  remaining strength to say: &ldquo;That you&rsquo;ll never know. You&rsquo;ve spiked your own  guns. Nobody knows but me,&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t tell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alarmed,  Wise tried another tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  won&rsquo;t do, North,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;whatever your crime, you can&rsquo;t refuse that last act  of expiation. Tell where she is, and die the better for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  gasped the dying man. &ldquo;Bad I&rsquo;ve lived and bad I&rsquo;ll die. You&rsquo;ll never find Betty  Varian. There are standing orders to do away with her if anything happens to  me, and,&rdquo;&mdash;he tried to smile,&mdash;&ldquo;something has happened!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  sure has,&rdquo; Wise said, and looked at him with real pity, for the man was  suffering tortures. &ldquo;But, I command you, North, by the blood you have shed, by  the two human lives you have taken, by the heart of the wife and mother that  you have broken,&mdash;I charge you, give up your secret while you have strength to  do so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a moment, North seemed to hesitate.</p>
  <p>A  little stimulant administered by the doctor gave him a trifle more strength,  but then his face changed,&mdash;he turned reminiscent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  work,&rdquo; he said, it seemed, exultingly. &ldquo;When I first found the cave a year ago,  I began to plan how I could get the Varians to take this house. They little  thought I brought it about through the real estate people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind all that,&rdquo; Wise urged him, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty?  ah, yes,&mdash;Betty&mdash;&rdquo; His mind seemed to wander again and Varian gave him a few  drops more stimulant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  it out of him,&rdquo; he said to the detective, &ldquo;this will lose all efficacy in  another few moments. He is going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going,  am I?&rdquo; and North was momentarily alert. &ldquo;All right, Doc, I&rsquo;ll go and my secret  will go with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Betty?&rdquo; Wise leaned over the miserable wretch, as if he would drag the  secret from him by sheer will power.</p>
  <p>But  the other&rsquo;s will power matched his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo;  he said,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, yes, Betty. Really, my wife&rsquo;s daughter, you know,&mdash;my  step-daughter,&mdash;I had a right to her, didn&rsquo;t I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Step&rsquo;!&rdquo;  Wise cried, &ldquo;Step, that you signed to those letters was short for Stepfather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course; my wife didn&rsquo;t mean to tell me that story,&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know she did,&mdash;she  babbled in her sleep, and I got it out of her by various hints and allusions.  Mrs Varian never knew, so I bled the old man. My, he was in a blue funk  whenever I attacked him about it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she now?&rdquo; Wise hinted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, you don&rsquo;t get it out of me. You caught me,&mdash;damn you! now I&rsquo;ll make you  wish you hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Lawrence North died without another word.</p>
  <p>Baffled,  and spent with his exhausting efforts, Wise left the dead man in the doctor&rsquo;s  care and returned to the library.</p>
  <p>He  found Zizi there. She had listened from the hall and had overheard much that  went on, but she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to go where the wounded man lay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Penny,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t tell! Maybe if I had gone in I could have got it  out of him! But I c-couldn&rsquo;t look at him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, dear, that&rsquo;s all right. He wouldn&rsquo;t have told you, either. The man is the  worst criminal I have ever known. He has no drop of humanity in his veins. As  to remorse or regret, he never knew their meaning! Now, what shall we do? Is  Mrs Varian awake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  in mild hysterics. Fletcher is with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor  Varian must go to her, and after that doubtless you can soothe her better than  any one else. I&rsquo;ll get Potter and Dunn up here,&mdash;and I fervently hope it&rsquo;s for  the last time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Penny,  your work was wonderful! You were right, a thing like that had to be  trapped,&mdash;not caught openly. You&rsquo;re a wonder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it all failed, when I failed to learn where Betty is. I shall find her,&mdash;but I  fear,&mdash;oh, Zizi, I fear that the evil that man has done will live after him,&mdash;and  I fear for the fate of Betty Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Zizi  tried to cheer him, but her heart too was heavy with vague fears, and she left  him to his routine work of calling the police and once again bringing them up  to Headland House on a gruesome errand.</p>
  <p>These  things done, Wise went at once to North&rsquo;s bungalow in Headland Harbor. He had  small hope of finding Joe Mills there, and as he had foreseen, that worthy had  decamped. Nor did they ever see him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose,&rdquo; Wise said afterward, &ldquo;he was in the cellar when North was killed; but  I never thought of him then, nor could I have caught him as he doubtless fled  away in the darkness to safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was a put up job, that scene of struggle and confusion in North&rsquo;s bedroom  that day he disappeared?&rdquo; Bill Dunn asked of Wise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I felt it was, but I couldn&rsquo;t see how he got away. You see, at that time, North  began to feel that my suspicions were beginning to turn in his direction, and  he thought by pretending to be abducted himself, he would argue a bold and  wicked kidnapper again at work. At any rate, he wanted to get away, and stay  away the better to carry on his dreadful purposes, and he chose that really  clever way of departing. The touch of leaving his watch behind was truly artistic,&mdash;unless  he forgot it. Well, now to find Betty Varian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a minute, Mr Wise. How&rsquo;d you come to think of looking for that cave arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  I began to suspect North, I watched him very closely. I had in my mind some  sort of rock passage, and when I took him out in a boat, or Joe Mills, either,  when we went close to that part of the rocks where the cave is, I noted their  evident efforts <i>not</i> to look toward a  certain spot. It was almost amusing to see how their eyes strayed that way, and  were quickly averted. They almost told me just where to look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful  work!&rdquo; Dunn exclaimed, heartily. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Wise returned, &ldquo;only a bit of  psychology. Now to find Betty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  though the detective doubtless would have recovered the missing girl, he had  not the opportunity, for love had found a way.</p>
  <p>By  the hardest sort of work and with indefatigable perseverance, Granniss had gone  from one to another of the various officials, mechanicians and even workmen of  the moving picture company he was on the trail of and after maddening delays  caused by their lack of method, their careless records and their uncertain  memories, he finally found out where the picture of a crowd, in which Betty had  appeared, was taken.</p>
  <p>And  then by further and unwearying search, he found an old but strongly built and  well guarded house where he had reason to think Betty was imprisoned.</p>
  <p>Finding  this, he didn&rsquo;t wait for proofs of his belief, but telegraphed for Pennington  Wise and Sheriff Potter to come there at once and gain entrance.</p>
  <p>Rod&rsquo;s  inexperience led him to adopt this course, but it proved a good one, for his  telegram reached Wise the day after North&rsquo;s death, and he hurried off, Potter  with him.</p>
  <p>The  house was in Vermont, and while Potter made the necessary arrangements with the  local authorities, Wise went on to meet Granniss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the house,&rdquo; and Wise saw the rather pleasant-looking old mansion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead  sure Betty&rsquo;s in there, but I can&rsquo;t get entrance, though I&rsquo;ve tried every  possible way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the arrival of the police soon effected an entrance, and armed with the  knowledge of North&rsquo;s death as well as more material implements, they all went  in.</p>
  <p>Pretty  Betty, as pretty as ever, though pale and thin from worry and fear, ran  straight into Granniss&rsquo; arms and nestled there in such absolute relief and  content, that the other men present turned away from the scene with a choke in  their throats.</p>
  <p>If  Granniss hadn&rsquo;t found her!</p>
  <p>The  news of North&rsquo;s death brought the jailers to terms at once. They were a man and  wife, big, strong people, who were carrying out North&rsquo;s orders &ldquo;to be kind and  proper to the girl, but not to let her get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  moving picture incident had occurred just as Wise had surmised. On her daily  walks for exercise, Betty was sometimes allowed to get into a crowd at the  studio near by, and frequently she had tried her clever plan of silent talk.  But only once had that plan succeeded.</p>
  <p>Yet  once was enough, and Granniss said, &ldquo;Look here, you people, clear up all the  red tape, won&rsquo;t you? Betty and I want to go home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run  along,&rdquo; said Wise, kindly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a train in an hour. Skip,&mdash;and God bless  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Their  arrival at Headland House, heralded by a telegram to Zizi, had no unduly  exciting effects on Minna Varian.</p>
  <p>Doctor  Varian watched her, but as he saw the radiant joy with which she clasped Betty  in her arms, he had no fear of the shock of joy proving too much for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mother,&rdquo; Betty cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it now. I&rsquo;ll tell you anything  you want to know some other time. Now, just let me revel in being here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor  did any one bother the poor child save to ask a few important questions.</p>
  <p>These  brought the information that Betty had been decoyed back to the house that day,  by a false message purporting to be from Granniss, asking her to return after  the rest left the house, and call him up on the telephone. This Betty tried to  do, using her camera as an excuse.</p>
  <p>But  she never reached the telephone. Once in the house, she was grasped and the  assailants, there were two, attempted to chloroform her. But chloroforming is  not such a speedy matter as many believe and she was still struggling against  the fumes when her father appeared.</p>
  <p>North  held Betty while the other man, who was Joe Mills, fought Frederick Varian,  and, in the struggle, shot him.</p>
  <p>This  angered North so, that he lost his head. He almost killed Mills in his rage and  fury, and seizing Betty, made for the secret passage.</p>
  <p>On  the way, her string of beads broke, the pillow which they used to help make her  unconscious was dropped on the kitchen floor, and then she was carried down the  well, through the tunnel and cave and away in a swift motor boat.</p>
  <p>But  in a half conscious state, all these things were like a dream to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dream which must not be recalled,&rdquo; said Granniss, with an air of authority that  sat well upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  blessing,&rdquo; Minna said, fondling the girl. &ldquo;Never mind about anything, now that  I have you back. I miss your father more than words can say, but with you  restored, I can know happiness again. Let us both try to forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later,  a council was held as to whether to tell Minna the true story of Betty&rsquo;s birth.</p>
  <p>The  two young people had to be told, and Doctor Varian was appealed to for a  decision regarding Minna.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, uncertainly. &ldquo;You see it explains the pearls,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you,&rdquo; Granniss said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s tell Mother Varian now. Betty and I will  be married very soon, and after that we can see about it. Or, if she has to  know at the time of the wedding, we&rsquo;ll tell her then. But let her rejoice in  her new found child as her own child as long as she can. Surely she deserves  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo; Betty asked, looking  at him, wistfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  darling! I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re the daughter of a princess or pauperess,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll  soon be my wife, and Granniss is all the name you&rsquo;ll ever want or need!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  your sweet hearts,&rdquo; said Zizi, her black eyes showing a tender gleam for the  girl she had so long known of, and only now known.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  bless your sweetheart, when you choose one!&rdquo; Betty said, her happy heart so  full of joy that her old gayety already began to return.</p>
