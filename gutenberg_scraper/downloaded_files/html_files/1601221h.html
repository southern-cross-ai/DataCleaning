    In the Studio</b></h2>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner paused a moment, on her way down the great staircase, to gaze  curiously at the footman in the lower hall.</p>
  <p>A  perfectly designed and nobly proportioned staircase is perhaps the finest  indoor background for a beautiful woman, but though Mrs. Faulkner had often  taken advantage of this knowledge, there was no such thought in her mind just  now. She descended the few remaining steps, her eyes still fixed on the  astonishing sight of a footman&rsquo;s back, when he should have been standing at  attention. He might not have heard her soft footfall, but he surely had no  business to be peering in at a door very slightly ajar.</p>
  <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s  Folly was the realised dream of the architect who had been its original owner.  It was a perfect example of the type known in England as Georgian and in our  own country as Colonial, a style inspired by the Italian disciples of Palladio,  and as developed by Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren, it had seemed to James  Faulkner to possess the joint qualities of comfort and dignity that made it  ideal for a home. The house was enormous, the rooms perfectly proportioned, and  the staircase had been the architect&rsquo;s joy and delight. It showed the wooden  wainscoting, which was handed down from the Jacobeans; broad, deep steps with  low risers, large, square landings, newels with mitred tops and rather plain  balusters. But the carved wood necessary to carry out the plans, the great  problems of lighting, the necessity for columned galleries and long, arched and  recessed windows, together with the stupendous outlay for appropriate grounds  and gardens, overtaxed the available funds and Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly, in little more  than two years after its completion, was sold for less than its intrinsic  value.</p>
  <p>James  Faulkner died, some said of a broken heart, but his wife had weathered the  blow, and was, at the present time, a guest in what had been her own home.</p>
  <p>The  man who bought Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly was one who could well appreciate all its  exquisite beauty and careful workmanship. Eric Stannard, the artist and  portrait painter, of international reputation and great wealth, and a friend of  long standing, took Faulkner&rsquo;s house with much joy in the acquisition and  sympathy for the man who must give it up.</p>
  <p>A  part of the purchase price was to be a portrait of Mrs. Faulkner by the master  hand of the new owner; but Faulkner&rsquo;s death had postponed this, and now, a  widow of two years, Beatrice was staying at the Stannards&rsquo; while the picture  was being painted. Partly because of sentiment toward her husband&rsquo;s favourite  feature of the house, and partly because of her own recognition of its artistic  possibilities, Beatrice had chosen the stairs as her background, and rarely did  she descend them without falling into pose for a moment at the spot she had  selected for the portrait</p>
  <p>But  on this particular evening, Beatrice had no thought of her picture, as she  noticed the strange sight of the usually expressionless and imperturbable  footman, with his face pressed against the slight opening of the studio door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blake,&rdquo;  she said, sharply, and then stopped, regretting her speech. As the Stannards&rsquo;  guest, she had no right or wish to reprove her hosts&rsquo; servants, but it was  well-nigh impossible for her to forget the days of her own rule in that house.</p>
  <p>Even  as she looked, the man turned toward her a white and startled face,&mdash;it seemed  almost as if he welcomed her appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blake!  What is it?&rdquo; she said, alarmed at his manner. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;heard  a strange sound, Madame,&mdash;from the studio&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange sound?&rdquo; and Beatrice came along the hall toward the footman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the lights in there, just went out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lights went out! What do you mean, Blake? It is not your business if lights in  rooms are turned off or on, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Madame&mdash;but&mdash;there, Madame! Did you not hear that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, yes,&rdquo; and Beatrice paled, as an indistinct voice seemed to cry faintly, &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;  It was a horrible, gurgling sound, as of one in dire extremity. &ldquo;What can it  be? Go in, Blake, at once! Turn on the lights!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Madame,&rdquo; and the trembling footman pushed open the door and felt fumblingly in  the dark for the electric switch.</p>
  <p>It  was only a few seconds, but it seemed an interminable time before the lights  flashed on and the great room was illuminated to its furthest corners.</p>
  <p>Beatrice,  close behind the trembling footman, stood, stunned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew it was something dreadful!&rdquo; Blake cried, forgetting in his shock his  conventional speech.</p>
  <p>Beatrice  gave one gasping &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and covered her face with her hands. But in a moment she  nerved herself to the sight, and stared, in a horrified fascination, at the  awful scene before her.</p>
  <p>At  the other end of the long room, in a great, carved armchair, sat Eric Stannard,  limp and motionless. From his breast protruded an instrument of some sort, and  a small scarlet stain showed on the white expanse of his shirt bosom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he&mdash;is he&mdash;&rdquo; began Beatrice, starting forward to his assistance, when her  bewildered eyes took in the rest of the scene.</p>
  <p>Behind  Stannard, and across the room from one another, were two women. They were  Joyce, his wife, and Miss Vernon, a model.</p>
  <p>Joyce,  only a few feet from her husband&rsquo;s left shoulder, was glaring at Natalie  Vernon, with a wild expression of fear and terror, Natalie was huddled against  the opposite wall, near the outer door, cowering and trembling, her hands  clutching her throat, as if to suppress an involuntary scream.</p>
  <p>Unable  to take in this startling scene at a glance, Beatrice and Blake stared at the  unbelievable tableau before them. The man got his wits together first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must do something,&rdquo; he muttered, starting toward his master. &ldquo;There is some  accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  if by this vitalised into action, the two women behind Stannard came forward,  one on either side of him, but only his wife went near to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eric,&rdquo;  she said, faintly, taking his left hand, as it hung at his side. But she got no  further. With one glance at his distorted face she sank to the ground almost  fainting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did this, sir?&rdquo; Blake cried out, standing before Stannard. The dying man  attempted to raise his right hand. Shakingly, it pointed toward the beautiful  girl, his model.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natalie,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;not Joyce.&rdquo; The last words were a mere choking gurgle, as his head  fell forward and his heart ceased to beat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Natalie screamed. &ldquo;No! Eric, don&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Eric Stannard would say no word again in this world.</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner staggered to a divan and sank down among the pillows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  something, Blake,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Get a doctor. Get Mr. Barry. Call Halpin. Oh,  Joyce, what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Mrs. Faulkner forced herself to go to Joyce&rsquo;s assistance, and gently raised her  from the floor, where she was still crouching by her husband&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t&mdash;know&mdash;&rdquo; returned Joyce Stannard, her frightened eyes staring in tearless  agony. &ldquo;Did you kill him, Natalie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried the girl. &ldquo;You know I didn&rsquo;t! You killed him yourself!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Halpin,  the butler, came in the room, followed by Miller, who was Stannard&rsquo;s own man.</p>
  <p>Astounded,  amazed, but not hysterical, these old, trusted and capable servants took the  helm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Telephone  for Doctor Keith,&rdquo; Miller told the other, &ldquo;and then find Mr. Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry  Stannard was Eric&rsquo;s son by a former marriage; a boy of twenty, of lovable and  sunny disposition, and devoted to his father and to his young stepmother. He  soon appeared, for he had been found strolling about the grounds.</p>
  <p>He  came in at Halpin&rsquo;s message, and seeing the still figure in the armchair,  sprang toward it, with a cry. Then, as suddenly, he turned, and without a word  or glance at any one else, he ran from the room.</p>
  <p>Without  touching it further than to assure himself that life was really extinct, Miller  stood, a self-appointed sentinel over the body of his dead master. He looked  curiously at the instrument of death, but said no word concerning it.</p>
  <p>There  was more or less confusion. Several servants, both men and women, came to the  doors, some daring to enter, but except in one or two instances, Miller ordered  them out.</p>
  <p>Annette,  Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s maid, he advised to look after the ladies, and Foster, a  houseman, he detailed to keep an eye on Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Barry?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Miller, calmly. &ldquo;He just stepped out&mdash;probably he&rsquo;s on the  terrace. Don&rsquo;t annoy him by intrusion, but be near if he wants you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  three women of the household said almost nothing. Mrs. Faulkner was so  stupefied by the situation, and the inexplicable attitude in which she had  found her hostess and the girl, Natalie, she could think of nothing to say to  either. And the two who had stood near the dying man, as the light disclosed  the group, were equally silent.</p>
  <p>Annette  proffered fans and sal volatile impartially to all three, but she, also, though  usually too voluble, had no words.</p>
  <p>After  what seemed an interminable wait, Dr. Keith arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed,&rdquo;  he said, briefly, as he examined the body, &ldquo;and with one of his own etching  needles! Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  what?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Faulkner, looking puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  an etching point&mdash;or needle. An artist&rsquo;s tool. Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a silence, not so much awkward, as fraught with horror. Who could answer  this question, even by a surmise.</p>
  <p>Blake  threw himself into the breach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was doubtless done in the dark, and, when I  turned up on the lights&mdash;the&mdash;the murderer had fled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  half exclamation from Joyce seemed to deny this assertion, and Natalie&rsquo;s lovely  face again showed that hunted, terrified look that had marked it at first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Barry?&rdquo; went on Dr. Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am here,&rdquo; said young Stannard, himself, coming in from the terrace. &ldquo;Dr. Keith,  I want this matter hushed up. I am master here now, and horrible though it may  all be, it will not lessen our trouble, but rather increase it, if you have any  investigation or inquiry made into this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Keith looked at the speaker in amazement. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking  about, Barry, my boy. It is not possible to ignore the facts and causes of an  occurrence of this sort. Do you know who stabbed your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not. Nor do I want to know. Father is gone, no persecution of any innocent  person can restore him to life, and the criminal can never be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel sure of it. Oh, listen to me, Dr. Keith. Be guided by my wishes, and do  not seek the one who brought about my father&rsquo;s death. Joyce, you agree with me,  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young fellow had never addressed his father&rsquo;s wife more formally than this;  indeed, there was not much more than half a dozen years between their ages, and  Joyce, at twenty-seven or thereabouts, looked almost as young as her stepson.  There had always been good comradeship between the two, and during the two  years Joyce had been Stannard&rsquo;s wife she and Barry had never had a word of  disagreement or unpleasantness of any sort.</p>
  <p>About  six weeks ago, Natalie Vernon, a professional model, had come to pose for  Stannard, and as she had proved most satisfactory, Eric had informed his wife  that he wished the girl to stay as a house guest for a time. Joyce had voiced  no objection, whatever she may have felt in her heart, and had always treated  Natalie with all courtesy and kindness.</p>
  <p>The  girl was a most exquisite beauty, a perfect blonde, with a face like Dresden  china and a form of fairylike grace. The soft pink and white of her  apple-blossom skin, the true sky colour of her eyes and the gleaming gold of  her wonderful hair were Greuze-like in their effects, yet of an added piquancy  and charm.</p>
  <p>It  is not to be wondered at that Barry promptly fell in love with her, nor is it  remarkable that Eric himself was more or less under the spell of his beautiful  model. A worshipper of all beauty, Stannard could not help it if his soul bowed  down to this masterpiece of Nature&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>A  professional model Natalie was, but only for the draped figure. She was but  eighteen, had been well brought up and educated, but, obliged to earn her own  living, had found she had no resources of work except in her God-given beauty.  Posing was a joy to her, and she had posed for but a few artists and those of  the better, even best class. But Eric, accustomed to having whatever he  desired, was determined Natalie should pose for some allegorical figures in a great  picture on which he was engaged. This she refused to do, and the more Stannard  insisted the more obdurate she became, until there was continual war between  them on the subject. And owing to this state of things, Natalie had decided she  must leave &ldquo;Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; and it was only Barry&rsquo;s entreaties that had thus  far kept her from fulfilling her intentions.</p>
  <p>Joyce,  herself a beautiful woman, of the dark-haired, brown-eyed type, had often been  a model for Eric&rsquo;s pictures, and if she resented being superseded by this  peaches and cream maiden, she never confided the fact to those about her. Joyce  Stannard was clever by nature, and she knew the quickest way to make her  impressionable husband fall desperately in love with Natalie, was for her, his  wife, to be openly jealous. So this Joyce would not appear to be. She chaffed  him gaily about his doll-faced model and treated Natalie with the patronising  generosity one would show to a pretty child.</p>
  <p>But  if Joyce was clever, Natalie was too, and she took this treatment exactly as it  was offered, and returned it in kind. Her manner to her hostess was entirely  correct, well-bred and even indicative of gratitude; but it also implied, with  subtle touch, the older and more settled state of Joyce, and gave a hint of contrast  in the freshness of Natalie&rsquo;s extreme youth and the permissibility of a spice  of the madcap in her ways.</p>
  <p>But  all these things, on both sides, were so veiled, so delicately suggested, that  they were imperceptible to any but the closest observer.</p>
  <p>And  now, whatever the facts of Eric Stannard&rsquo;s death might be shown to be, now it  must soon be made known that when the lights of the room where he died were  turned on, they had revealed these two&mdash;his wife and his paid model&mdash;near his  stricken body, already quivering with its last few heartbeats.</p>
  <p>In  answer to Barry&rsquo;s question, Joyce lifted her white face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; she  said, slowly, &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;as Dr. Keith says&mdash;these things must be&mdash;be attended to  in&mdash;in the usual way. But I, too, shrink from the awful publicity and the  harrowing experience we must go through,&mdash;Beatrice, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Faulkner replied, with a gentle sympathy: &ldquo;I fear it won&rsquo;t matter what we  think, Joyce, dear. The law will step in, as always, in case of a crime, and  our opinions or wishes will count for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have sent for the Coroner and for the Police,&rdquo; said Dr. Keith, who had given  Halpin many whispered orders. &ldquo;Now, Barry, don&rsquo;t be unreasonable. You can no  more stop the routine of the law&rsquo;s procedure than the stars in their courses.  If you know any facts you must be prepared to state them truthfully. If not,  you must say or do nothing that will put any obstacle in the way of proper  inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Keith was treating Barry like a child, and though the boy resented it, he said  nothing, but his face showed his hurt pride and his disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  us all you can of the facts of the attack,&rdquo; said Beatrice Faulkner to the  doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  simple facts are plainly seen,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Some one standing in front of  Mr. Stannard, as he sat in his chair, intentionally stabbed him with the  etching needle. The instrument penetrated his flesh, just above and a little to  one side of the breast bone, piercing the jugular vein and causing almost  instant death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  it not have been a suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  Mrs. Faulkner. Stannard could not have managed that thrust, and, too, the  position of his hands precludes the theory of suicide. But the Coroner and his  physician will, I am sure, corroborate my statement. It is a clear case of  wilful murder, for, as you must see for yourself, no accidental touch of that  instrument would bring about such a deep sinking of the point in a vital part  of the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  if I may ask, sir,&rdquo; said Miller, respectfully, &ldquo;how could a murderer see to  strike such a blow in a dark room? While Mr. Stannard could have stabbed  himself in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  points are outside my jurisdiction,&rdquo; returned the Doctor, looking grave. &ldquo;The  Coroner and the Police Detectives will endeavour to give the answers to your  perfectly logical queries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then the men from Police Headquarters arrived. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>II<br>
    Where They Stood</b></h2>
  <p>The  countryside was in a tumult. A murder mystery at Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly, of all  places in world! Rensselaer Park, the aristocratic Long Island settlement, of  which the celebrated house was the star exhibit, could scarcely believe its  ears as the news flew about. And the criminal? Public opinion settled at once  on an intruder, either burglarious or inimical. Of course, a man of Eric  Stannard&rsquo;s position and personality had enemies, as well as friends, from  Paris, France, to Paris, Maine. Equally, of course, his enormous collection of  valuable art works and even more valuable jewels would tempt robbers.</p>
  <p>But  the vague rumors as to his wife or that darling little model girl being  implicated, were absurd. To be sure, the installation of Miss Vernon as a house  guest was a fling in the face of conventions, but Eric Stannard was a law unto  himself; and, too, Mrs. Stannard had always introduced the girl as her friend.</p>
  <p>The  Stannards were comparatively new people at The Park, but Mrs. Faulkner, whose  husband had built the Folly, was even now visiting there, and her sanction was  enough for the community. It would, one must admit, be thrillingly exciting to  suspect a woman in the case, but it was too impossible. No, it was without  doubt, a desperate marauder.</p>
  <p>Thus  the neighbours.</p>
  <p>But  the Police thought differently. The report of the Post Patrolman who first  appeared upon the scene of the tragedy included a vivid description of the  demeanour of the two ladies; and the whole force, from the Inspector down,  determined to discover which was guilty. To them the death of Eric Stannard was  merely a case, but from the nature of things it was, or would become, a  celebrated case, and as such, they were elated over their connection with it.</p>
  <p>In  due course, the Coroner&rsquo;s Inquest took place, and was held in the big studio  where Eric Stannard had met his death.</p>
  <p>Owing  to the personality of Coroner Lamson, this was not the perfunctory proceeding  that inquests sometimes are, but served to bring out the indicative facts of  the situation.</p>
  <p>It  was the day after the murder and the room was partially filled with the  officers of the law, the jury and a crowd of morbidly curious strangers. It  seemed sacrilege to give over the splendid apartment to the demands of the  occasion, and many of the audience sat timidly on the edge of the luxurious  chairs or stared at the multitudinous pictures, statues and artistic  paraphernalia. In the original plan the studio had been a ballroom, but its  fine North light and great size fitted it for the workroom of the master  painter. Nor was the brush the only implement of Eric Stannard. He had  experimented with almost equal success in pastel work, he had done some good  modelling and of late he had become deeply interested in etching. And it had  been one of his own etching needles that had been the direct cause of his  untimely death.</p>
  <p>This  fact was testified to by Doctor Keith, who further detailed his being called to  the house the night before. He stated that he had arrived within fifteen  minutes after Mr. Stannard&mdash;as the family had told him&mdash;had breathed his last.  Examination of the body had disclosed that death was caused by the piercing of  the jugular vein and the weapon, which was not removed until later, was a tool  known as an Etcher&rsquo;s needle, a slender, sharp instrument, set in a Wooden  handle, the whole being not unlike a brad-awl. On being shown the needle, the  Doctor identified it as the instrument of death.</p>
  <p>Blake,  the footman, was next questioned. He was of calm demeanour and impassive  countenance, but his answers were alert and intelligent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much so,&rdquo; thought Mr. Robert Roberts, a Police Detective, who had been put upon  the case, to his own decided satisfaction. &ldquo;That man knows what he&rsquo;s talking  about, if he is a wooden-face.&rdquo; Now, Roberts, called by his chums, Bobsy, was  himself alert and intelligent, and therefore recognised those traits in others.  He listened attentively as Coroner Lamson put his queries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were the first to discover your master&rsquo;s dead body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stannard was not dead when I entered the room,&rdquo; replied Blake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, to be sure. I mean, you were the first to enter the room after the man was  stabbed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I can&rsquo;t say. When I entered&mdash;&rdquo; Blake paused, and glanced uncertainly about.  Barry Stannard was looking at the footman with a stern face.</p>
  <p>Inspector  Bardon, who was present, interposed. &ldquo;Tell the story in your own words, my man.  We&rsquo;ll best get at it that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was on duty in the hall,&rdquo; began Blake, slowly, &ldquo;and I noticed the lights go out  in the studio here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the door between the hall and studio open?&rdquo; asked Lamson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, not open, but it was a very little ajar. I didn&rsquo;t think much about the  light going out, though Mr. Stannard never turned off the lights when he left  the room to go upstairs to bed. And if it did strike me as a bit queer, I had  no time to think the matter over, for just then I heard a slight sound,&mdash;a  gasping like, as if somebody was in distress. As I had not been called, I didn&rsquo;t  enter, but I did try to peep in at the crack of the door. This was not  curiosity, but there was something in that gasp that&mdash;that scared me a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  next?&rdquo; said the Coroner, as Blake paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  then, sir, Mrs. Faulkner came down the stairs. She was surprised to see me  peeping at a door, and spoke chidingly. But I was so alarmed, I forgot myself,  and&mdash;well, and just then, I heard a distinct sound&mdash;a terrible, gurgling sound,  and a voice said, &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; I turned to Mrs. Faulkner to see if she had heard it,  and she had, for her face looked frightened and she asked me what it meant, and  she told me to go in and turn on the light. So&mdash;so, I did, and then I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  very careful now, Blake; tell us exactly what you saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw Mr. Stannard first, at the other end of the room, in his favourite big  chair, and he was like a man dying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever seen a man die?&rdquo; Lamson snapped out the words as if his own nerves  were at a tension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,  sir.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how do you know how one would look?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw something had been thrust into his breast, I saw red stains on his shirt  front, and I saw his face, drawn as in agony, and his eyes staring, yet with a  sort of glaze over them, and his hands stretched out, but sort of fluttering,  as if he had lost control over his muscles. I couldn&rsquo;t think other than that he  was a dying man, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I want you to tell, Blake. An exact account of the scene as it appeared  to you. Now the rest of it. Were you too absorbed in the spectacle of Mr.  Stannard&rsquo;s plight to see clearly the others who were present?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; and the man&rsquo;s calm face quivered now. &ldquo;It is as if photographed on my  brain. I can never forget it. Behind Mr. Stannard were the two ladies, Mrs.  Stannard and Miss Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Directly  behind him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that, exactly. Mrs. Stannard stood behind, but off toward his left, and Miss  Vernon was behind, but toward the right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  me exactly, Blake, where these two ladies stood,&rdquo; and Coroner Lamson rose to  see his demands fulfilled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir,&rdquo; begged Blake, his frightened eyes wavering toward the members of the  household which employed him, &ldquo;oh, sir&mdash;Mrs. Faulkner, sir,&mdash;she came in with  me,&mdash;she can tell better than I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs,  Faulkner will be questioned in due time. You came in first; we will hear your  version and then hers. Be accurate now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  great hesitancy, Blake stepped to the spots he had designated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard stood here,&rdquo; he said, indicating a position perhaps a yard back and to  the left of Stannard&rsquo;s chair, which was still in its place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was she doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  sir. One hand was on this table, and the other sort of clasped against her  breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was over here,&rdquo; and Blake, still behind the chair, crossed to its other side,  and stood near the outer door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was she standing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against  this small table, and the table was swaying back and forth, like it would upset  in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  her hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were both behind her, sir, clutching at the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a wonderful memory, Blake,&rdquo; and the Coroner looked hard at his witness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  always, sir. But the thing is like a picture to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  a moving picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, nobody moved. It was like a tableau, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then,&rdquo; prompted Inspector Bardon.</p>
  <p>At  this point, Barry Stannard was again seen to look at Blake with a glance of  deep concentration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Important,  if true,&rdquo; Detective Roberts said to himself. &ldquo;Young Stannard is afraid of the  footman&rsquo;s further disclosures!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether  that was so or not, Blake suddenly lost his power of clear and concise  narration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  then&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;then, all was confusion. I started toward Mr. Stannard,  it&mdash;it seemed my duty. And Mrs. Faulkner, she came toward him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the two ladies behind him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  came toward him, too, and Mrs. Stannard took hold of his hand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, I couldn&rsquo;t help it, sir&mdash;I blurted out, &lsquo;Who did this?&rsquo; And Mr. Stannard&mdash;he  said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Said!</i> Spoke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Attention  was concentrated on the footman, and it is doubtful if any one save Roberts  noticed Barry Stannard&rsquo;s face. It was drawn in an agonised protest at the  forthcoming revelation. But Blake, accustomed to obeying orders implicitly,  continued to tell his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, he spoke&mdash;sort of whispered, in a gasping way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said, &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; answered the stolid Blake. &ldquo;And he sort of raised his hand, pointing  toward the lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pointing  toward Miss Vernon, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry  Stannard could stand it no longer. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have this!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t  allow this hysterical story of an ignorant servant to be told in a way to  incriminate an innocent girl. It&rsquo;s all wrong!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Coroner considered. It did seem too bad to listen to the vital points of the  story from an underling, when such tragic issues were at stake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down, for the present, Blake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Faulkner, will you give us your  version of these events?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner looked very white and seemed loth to respond and then with a sudden,  determined air, she faced the Coroner, and said, &ldquo;Certainly. Will you ask  questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  beautiful woman looked even more stately in her mild acquiescence than she had  done on her first mute refusal. Her large, soft black eyes rested on Joyce with  a pitying air and then strayed to Natalie, the little model, who was a mere  collapsed heap of weeping femininity. With a deep sigh, Beatrice turned to the  Coroner. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready,&rdquo; she said, with the air of one accustomed to dictate times and  seasons.</p>
  <p>A  little awed, Coroner Lamson asked: &ldquo;Do you corroborate the story as just  related by Blake, the footman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think so,&rdquo; and the witness drew her beautiful brows together as if in an  effort of recollection. Though fully thirty-five, Beatrice Faulkner looked  younger, and yet, compared to Joyce or Natalie she seemed a middle-aged matron.  &ldquo;I am sure I agree with his facts as stated, as to our entering the room, but I&rsquo;m  not sure he was able to hear clearly the words spoken by Mr. Stannard. I was  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I heard the indistinct mumble of the dying man, but I am not ready to say  positively that I clearly understood the words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came down stairs just as Blake was peeping in at the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wasn&rsquo;t peeping. He was, it seemed to me, listening. I, naturally, thought it  strange to see a footman prying in any way, and I called out his name,  reprovingly. Then, I suddenly realised that as he was not my footman I had no  right to reprimand him; and just then he turned his full face toward me, and I  saw that the man looked startled, and that something unusual must be happening  in the studio. He told me the lights had just gone out, and even as he spoke we  both heard that sighing &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; It was a fearful sound, and struck a chill to  my very heart. I bade Blake turn on the light quickly, and then I followed him  into the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Faulkner, that is just as the footman told it. Now, will you tell what you  saw in the studio, and what you inferred from it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw Mr. Stannard in his arm chair, a dagger or some such thing protruding from  his breast, and blood stains on his clothing. I inferred that some burglar or marauder  had attacked him and perhaps robbed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how did you think this intruder had entered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think anything about that. One doesn&rsquo;t have coherent thoughts at such a  moment. I realised that he had been stabbed, so of course, I assumed an assailant.  Then I saw his wife and Miss Vernon standing near him, and I had no thought  save to assist in any way I might. I cried out to Blake to get a doctor, and  then I went to Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s side, just as she was about to faint:&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she faint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that is, she did not entirely lose consciousness, though greatly agitated. And  then, soon, the butler and Miller, Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s valet, came in, and after  that Barry came and&mdash;and everything seemed to happen at once. Doctor Keith came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Mrs. Faulkner, you are getting ahead of your story. What about the  words uttered by Mr. Stannard before he died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were so inarticulate as to be unintelligible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  swear this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. If he said &lsquo;Joyce&rsquo; or &lsquo;Natalie,&rsquo; it is not at all strange, considering that  those two women were in his sight. But I repeat that he did not say them in a  connected sentence, nor did he himself mean any real statement. It was the  unconscious speech of a dying man. In another instant he was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though  outwardly calm, Beatrice Faulkner&rsquo;s voice trembled, and was so low as to be  scarcely audible. But she stood her ground bravely, and her eyes met Barry&rsquo;s  for a moment, in the briefest glance of understanding and approval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo;  commented the astute Roberts to his favourite confidant, himself, &ldquo;the Barry  person is in love with the dolly-baby girl, and the queenly lady is his friend,  and she&rsquo;s helping him out. She isn&rsquo;t telling all she knows, or if she is, she&rsquo;s  colouring it to save the implicated ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your position in this house, Mrs. Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  faintest gleam of amusement passed over the white face. It was almost as if he  thought her a housekeeper or governess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a guest,&rdquo; she returned, simply. &ldquo;I have been staying here a few weeks for  the purpose of having my portrait painted by Mr. Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  previously owned this house, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  late husband, an architect of note, built it. Later, it was sold to Mr.  Stannard, who has lived in it nearly two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you just before you came down the stairs and saw Blake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Drawing Room, on the second floor, at the other end of the house. I had  been entertaining a guest, and as he had just taken leave, I went down stairs  to rejoin my hostess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you expect to find Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  I had left her, in the Billiard Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  left her there? How long before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  hour or so. There were several guests at dinner, and they had drifted to the  various rooms afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  were the guests at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Wadsworth, who was with me in the Drawing Room; Mr. Courtenay, a neighbour, and  Mr. and Mrs. Truxton, who also live nearby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Truxton, the jewel collector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that is the one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no one else at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the family group; Mr. and Mrs. Stannard, Mr. Barry Stannard, Miss Vernon and  myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once  again, Mrs. Faulkner, you attach no significance to the words, &lsquo;Natalie, not  Joyce&rsquo; which Blake quotes Mr. Stannard as saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taken  thus unexpectedly, Mrs. Faulkner hesitated. Then she said, steadily: &ldquo;I do not.  They were the articulation of a brain already clouded by approaching death. He  merely named the people he saw nearest to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not true! Eric meant what he said!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Joyce Stannard who spoke. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>III<br>
    What They Said</b></h2>
  <p>With  a vague idea of taking advantage of a psychological moment, Coroner Lamson  began to question Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you make that statement, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;do you realise that it is  a grave implication?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Joyce, though not hysterical, was at high tension, and she said, talking  rapidly, &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s words were in direct answer to the footman&rsquo;s question.  Blake said, &lsquo;Who did this?&rsquo; and Mr. Stannard, even pointing to Miss Vernon,  said, &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce.&rsquo; Could anything be plainer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might seem so, yet we must take into consideration the fast clouding intellect  of the dying man, and endeavour thus to get at the truth. Will you tell the  circumstances of your entering the room, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will. I had been in the Billiard Room for some time, ever since  dinner, in fact&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at first. Several were there with me. Then, later, all had gone&mdash;and&mdash;I was there  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speaker paused. She seemed to forget her audience and became lost in  recollection or in thought. She looked very beautiful, as she sat, robed in her  black gown of soft, thin material, with a bit of white turned in at the throat.  Her brown hair waved carelessly back to a loose, low knot and her deep-set  brown eyes, full of sorrow, grew suddenly luminous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it wasn&rsquo;t Natalie,&rdquo; she said, speaking breathlessly. &ldquo;Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t Miss  Vernon&mdash;after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are not asking your opinion, Mrs. Stannard,&rdquo; said the Coroner, stiffly; &ldquo;kindly  confine your recital to the facts as they happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  now, the witness&rsquo; poise was shaken. Of a temperamental nature, Joyce Stannard  had thought of something or realised something that affected the trend of her  testimony.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts watched her with intense interest. &ldquo;Well, Milady,&rdquo; he said to her,  mentally, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve struck a snag in your well-planned defence. Careful now, don&rsquo;t  leap before you look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Joyce, but her quivering lip precluded further speech.</p>
  <p>The  Coroner was made decidedly uncomfortable by the sight of her beauty and her  distress, always a disquieting combination, and to hide his sympathy, he repeated,  brusquely, &ldquo;The facts, please, as they occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in the Billiard Room,&rdquo; Joyce began again, &ldquo;and I heard, in the studio, a  slight sound of some sort, and then the light in here went out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  was first, the sound or the sudden darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sound&mdash;no, the darkness. I don&rsquo;t really know. Perhaps they were simultaneous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment; was the Billiard Room lighted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the door between open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sliding doors were open&mdash;the curtains pulled together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Glancing  at the heavy tapestry curtains in question, Mr. Lamson said quickly: &ldquo;If they  were pulled together, and the room where you were was light, how could you  notice when this room went dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  looked bewildered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, blankly, &ldquo;how could I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  question was so naive, and the brown eyes so puzzled and troubled, that Bobsy  Roberts whistled to himself. But not for want of thought. His thoughts flocked  so fast he could scarcely marshal them into line. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; his principal  thought was, &ldquo;one of these women is guilty. If the crime had been committed by  a burglar they wouldn&rsquo;t have any of this back and forth kiyi with their eyes.  Now, the question is, <i>which</i> one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  and Natalie had exchanged many glances. But to a stranger they were unreadable,  and Roberts contented himself with storing them up in his memory for future  consideration. And now, as Joyce looked confused and nonplussed, Natalie seemed  a bit triumphant, but she as quickly drooped her eyes and veiled whatever  emotion they showed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are sure you did know when the studio lights went out?&rdquo; pursued Lamson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes&mdash;I think so. You see&mdash;it was all so confused&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;the  lights,&mdash;and that queer sound&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, Mrs. Stannard. Never mind the lights and the sound. You entered the studio  from the Billiard Room, and saw&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see anything!&rdquo; declared Joyce, with a sudden toss of her head. &ldquo;I  c-couldn&rsquo;t. It was dark, you know. Then somebody, Blake, you know, turned the  switch, and I saw Miss Vernon standing by my dying husband&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know he was dying? Did you see Miss Vernon strike the blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But she was in the room when I entered&mdash;and, too, Eric said it was Natalie and  not&mdash;me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are prepared to swear that Miss Vernon was in the room before you were?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was there when I went in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it was dark, how could you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t. I heard her breathing in a quick, frightened way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when you first saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was cowering back against the little paint stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looking  terrified?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  guilty.&rdquo; Joyce said the words solemnly, as one unwillingly pronouncing a doom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard, I must be unpleasantly personal. Can you think of any reason why Miss  Vernon would desire your husband&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  trembled visibly. &ldquo;I cannot answer a question like that,&rdquo; she said, in a low  tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry,&mdash;but you must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  then,&rdquo; and Joyce looked squarely at Natalie. &ldquo;I cannot imagine why she should  desire his death. I certainly cannot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  any reason why she should dislike him, or wish him ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  husband was a great artist,&rdquo; Joyce began, as if thinking it out for herself. &ldquo;He  was accustomed to having his models do as he requested. Miss Vernon was not  always amenable to his wishes and&mdash;and they were not very good friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you and Miss Vernon are good friends? You like her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  favoured Natalie with a calm stare. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said, in an even voice, &ldquo;I  like her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  breathed our friend Roberts, silently. &ldquo;At last I see what one Mr. Pope meant  when he wrote:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  with faint praise, assent with civil leer,<br>
    And, without sneering, cause the rest to sneer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For,  surely, Joyce&rsquo;s attestation of friendship between herself and the artist&rsquo;s  model convinced nobody. She sat, gracefully erect, her serious face blank of  any emotion, yet impressing all with the sense of profound feeling beneath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what ways did Miss Vernon incur Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s displeasure?&rdquo; asked Lamson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merely  on some technical matters connected with her posing for his pictures,&rdquo; was the  nonchalant reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  then, could scarcely be construed into a motive for murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely.&rdquo;  Joyce seemed to give a mere parrot-like repetition of the Coroner&rsquo;s word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet,  you are willing to believe that Miss Vernon is the criminal we are seeking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not say that,&rdquo; and Joyce spoke softly. &ldquo;I can only say I saw her here when I  came into this room and found my husband dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  she not have come in just as you did, attracted by that strange sound, as of a  man in pain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, who could have stabbed my husband? There was no one else near. That  has been testified by those who entered at the other end of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  not a burglar have entered by a window, attempted robbery, and, being  discovered, stabbed Mr. Stannard in self-preservation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could he have entered?&rdquo; said Joyce, dully. &ldquo;I can see no way. That is, he might  have been in here, but in no way could he have gotten out. That great North  window, I am told, opens only in a few high sectional panes. It is shaded by  rollers from the bottom, and is inaccessible. The other large window, the West  one, is so blocked up with easels, canvases and casts, that it is certain  nobody could get in or out of that. The door to the main hall was, of course,  in full sight of Blake the footman, and that leaves only the South end of the  room to be considered. Now no intruder could have gone out by the door to the  Billiard Room or the door to the Terrace without having been seen by you or  Miss Vernon, who claims she was on the Terrace all evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every  one present looked around at the Studio. They saw a spacious room, about forty  feet long by thirty wide, its lofty ceiling fully twenty feet high. An enormous  fireplace was on the side toward the house, and above it ran an ornamental  balcony, reached by a light staircase at either end. The fine, big windows were  of stained glass, save where ground glass had been put in to meet the artist&rsquo;s  needs. Originally a ballroom, the decorations were ornate but in restrained and  harmonious taste. There were priceless rugs on the floor, priceless works of  art all about, and furnishings of regal state and luxury. Yet, also, was there  the litter and mess of working materials and mediums&mdash;seemingly inseparable from  any studio, however watched and tended. Here would be a stunning Elizabethan  chair, all carved wood and red velvet, heaped high with paintboxes and  palettes; there, an antique chest of marvellous workmanship, from whose  half-open lid peeped bits of rare drapery stuffs or quaintly-fashioned  garments. Tables everywhere, of inlay or marquetry, were piled with sketches,  boxes of pastels, or small casts. Jugs and vases, fit only for museum pieces,  held sheafs of paint-brushes, while scores of canvases, both blank and painted,  stood all round the wall. </p>
  <p>The  armchair, in which Eric Stannard had sat when he died, was undisturbed, also  the tables near it. A new idea seemed to strike Lamson. He said, &ldquo;When you came  in in the darkness, Mrs. Stannard, how did you avoid stumbling over the chairs  and stands in your way? I count four of them, practically in the course you  must have pursued.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  looked at the part of the room in question. True, there were four or more small  pieces of furniture that would have bothered one coming in without a light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so!&rdquo; she said, as if the idea were illuminating. &ldquo;I must have come in just  after or at the very moment that Blake lighted the electrics!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  found Miss Vernon already here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon, will you tell your story?&rdquo; said Lamson, abruptly, turning from Joyce to  the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I  &ldquo; Natalie fluttered like a frightened bird, and gazed piteously at the  inquisitor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  work!&rdquo; commented Bobsy Roberts, mentally. &ldquo;Smart little girl to know how the  baby act fetches &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  if Natalie Vernon&rsquo;s air of helplessness was assumed, it was sufficiently well  done to convince all who saw it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  little thing!&rdquo; was in everybody&rsquo;s mind as the rosebud face looked pleadingly at  the Coroner. At that moment, if she had declared herself the guilty wretch,  nobody would have believed her.</p>
  <p>Lamson&rsquo;s  abruptness vanished, and he said, gently, &ldquo;Just a simple description, Miss  Vernon, of your presence in this room last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was this way,&rdquo; she began, and her face drew itself into delicious wrinkles, as  she chose her words. &ldquo;I had been, ever since dinner, almost, on the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. Different people were there. Coming and going, you know. Well, at last, I  chanced to be there alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  had been with you latest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see,&rdquo; and the palpable effort to remember was too pronounced to be real, &ldquo;I  guess&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m sure it was Barry,&mdash;Mr. Barry Stannard. And he went away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. For a stroll with the dogs, probably. I was about to go upstairs to  my room, when I heard a sound in the studio that seemed queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  queer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if somebody were calling me&mdash;I mean, calling for somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear your name?&rdquo; and Lamson caught at the straw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, just a general exclamation, it was. And I went toward the door to listen,  if it might be repeated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the door open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but it has glass in it, with sash curtains, and these were a little way open,  and I could see through them that the light went out suddenly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then I went right in, without making a sound&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  it make a sound as you opened the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  door was open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said it was not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know whether it was or not! I was so scared to see Eric,&mdash;Mr. Stannard,  dead or dying, and his wife standing there as if she had just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what? Killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and Natalie&rsquo;s big blue eyes were violet with horror. &ldquo;She had! And she stood  there, just as Blake said, one hand on the table, and one clutched to her  breast. She did do it, Mr. Coroner. She must have been out of her mind, you  know, but she did it, for I saw her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saw  her kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not that. But I saw her just after the deed was done, and she was the picture  of guilty fear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  Natalie could have been transferred to canvas as she looked then, the picture  would have made any painter&rsquo;s fortune. The girl was in white, soft, crepy wool  stuff, that clung and fell in lovely lines, for the gown had been designed by  no less a genius than Stannard himself. It was his whim to have Natalie about  the house in the gowns in which he posed her, that he might catch an occasional  unexpected effect. But the simple affair was not out of place as a morning  house-gown, and more than one woman in the audience took careful note of its  cut and pattern. Her golden hair was carelessly tossed up in a mass of curls,  held with one hair-pin, a huge amber thing, that threatened every minute to  slip out, and one couldn&rsquo;t help wishing it would. Her wonderful eyes had long  dark lashes, and her pink cheeks were rosy now, because of her nervous  excitement. So thin was her delicate skin that her hands and throat were  flushed a soft pink and her curved lips were scarlet. Yet notwithstanding the  marvellous colouring, there was not one iota of doubt that it was Nature&rsquo;s own.  The play of rose and white in her cheeks, the sudden occasional paling of the  red lips and the perfection of the tiny shreds of curl that clustered at her  throbbing temples all spoke of the real humanity of this girl&rsquo;s beauty. Small  wonder the artist wanted her for his own pictures exclusively! Joyce was a  beautiful woman, but this child, this fairy princess, was a dream, a very  Titania of charm and wonder.</p>
  <p>Not  by her testimony, not by words of assertion, but by her ethereal, her  incredible beauty, this wonder-girl took captive every heart and, without  effort, secured the sympathy and belief of everybody present.</p>
  <p>And  yet, the Coroner had to do his duty. Had to say, in curt, accusing tones, &ldquo;Then  how do you explain Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s dying words, &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  red lips quivered, the roseleaf cheeks grew pinker and great tears formed in  the appealing blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me that!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh, pray, don&rsquo;t ask me <i>that!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I do, I must ask you. And I must ask you why you stabbed him? Had he asked you  to pose in any way to which you were unwilling to consent? Had he insisted,  after you refused? Was he tyrannical? Brutal? Cruel? Did you have to defend  yourself? Was it on an impulse of sudden anger or indignation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  Stop!&rdquo; cried Natalie, putting her pink finger tips into her tiny, rosy ears. &ldquo;Stop!  He was none of those things! He was good to me, he&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  to you, yet you killed him! Kind to you, yet you took his life&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t! I tell you I didn&rsquo;t! It was Joyce! She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon, if you came into the room in the dark, how could you effect an entrance  without upsetting something? There are even more small racks and stands on that  side of the room than the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t upset anything&mdash;&rdquo; and Natalie stared at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you came in before the room was darkened,&mdash;long before,&mdash;and you darkened it  yourself, after you had driven the blow that ended the life of your friend and  patron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner  Lamson paused, as the dawn-pink of Natalie&rsquo;s face turned to a creamy pallor,  and the girl sank, unconscious, into a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brutal!&rdquo;  cried Barry Stannard, springing to her side. &ldquo;Inexcusable, Mr. Lamson. This is  no place for a Third Degree procedure!&rdquo; and asking no one&rsquo;s permission, he  carried the slight form from the studio. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>IV<br>
    Goldenheart</b></h2>
  <p>A murmur  of indignation sounded faintly through the room. Public Opinion was not with  the Coroner, however black the case might look against the pretty little model.  For &ldquo;model,&rdquo; Natalie was always called, in spite of the fact that she was an  honoured guest in the Stannard&rsquo;s house. And she looked like a model. Her  manners, though correct in every way, were not those of an ingenuous flapper or  a pert debutante. She had the poise and assurance of a woman of the world, with  the appearance of an innocent, rather than ignorant, child. But her  self-reliance, though it had given way before the Coroner&rsquo;s accusation, was  always evident in the clear gaze of her apprehending eyes and the set of her  lovely head. Moreover, she had that precious possession called <i>charm</i> to an infinite degree. It was the  despair of the artists who had painted her, and Eric Stannard, unwilling to be  baffled, had tried a hundred times, more or less successfully, to fasten that  charm in colour medium. Of late, he had tried it in his etching. An unfinished  piece of work was a waxed plate bearing an exquisite portrayal of Natalie as  Goldenrod. This he had previously painted, and the result, a study in yellow,  was his copy for the etching. The canvas showed the girl, her arms full of  goldenrod, her yellow gown and her yellow hair against a background of yellow  autumn leaves. It was a masterpiece, even for Stannard. And aside from the  colour, the lines were so beautiful that he decided to make an etching of the  study.</p>
  <p>The  waxed plate, with this design, had been found on the floor near Eric&rsquo;s chair,  after his death. The wax had been scratched and smudged, quite evidently by  some furious hand, and the scratches and disfigurements were doubtless made by  the very instrument that had caused the artist&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>This  was indicative, beyond a doubt; but what was indicated? That Natalie, in a fit  of anger at Eric, had destroyed his picture of her? Or, that Joyce, in a  jealous rage, had resented the portrait?</p>
  <p>The  painting, as Natalie had posed for it, was a lovely girl in a full flowing robe  of soft, opaque stuff, showing only a bit of throat and shoulder, and one  rounded arm. The etching, as the artist had drawn it, garbed the figure in a  filmy, transparent drapery, revealing lines that gave a totally different  character to the work.</p>
  <p>Natalie  Vernon was a prude, there was no denying that. Whether she was absurdly  fanatical on the subject or not, was her own affair. But could an indignant  girl go so far as to kill an artist who had drawn her in a way she didn&rsquo;t care  to be portrayed? It was most unlikely. Still, there was latent fire in those  blue eyes, there was force of character in those curved scarlet lips, and if  Miss Vernon chose to be an unusual, even eccentric model, she was important  enough to make her own terms and insist upon them. And in a furious moment of  surprised indignation, what might not a woman do?</p>
  <p>Again,  could it not be that the artist&rsquo;s wife had had her jealousy stirred to its  depths by this latest result of her husband&rsquo;s interest in the model? Could she  not, coming upon him as he mused over his drawing on the wax, have snatched the  etching tool from his table and revenged her slighted wifehood?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a poor clue that won&rsquo;t work both ways,&rdquo; mused Bobsy Roberts, as he heard of  this etching business. The story of it had been told while Natalie was out of  the room. Joyce listened with an unruffled countenance. Either she was  uninterested, or determined to appear so.</p>
  <p>Coroner  Lamson next called as witnesses the guests who had been at dinner the night  before.</p>
  <p>The  first, a Mr. Wadsworth, told a straightforward story of the occasion. He was a  genial, pleasant man, a neighbour and a widower.</p>
  <p>After  dinner, he stated, he had been for a time with his host and others in the  studio. Mr. Stannard had shown some new gems, a recent addition to his  collection. After that, Mr. Wadsworth had gone to the Billiard Room, and later,  he and Mrs. Faulkner had gone to the Drawing Room at the other end of the  house. He had remained there with the lady until perhaps half past eleven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  interposed the Coroner. &ldquo;Mrs. Faulkner came downstairs, after your departure,  at that hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it must have been a little earlier. I didn&rsquo;t note the time. I went directly  home, and retired without looking at the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  went out at the front door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Blake, the footman, let me out. I didn&rsquo;t look for my hostess as I left, for we  are on intimate neighbourly terms, and often ignore the formalities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was nothing more to be learned from this witness, and the next was Mr. Eugene  Courtenay.</p>
  <p>But  one swift, intense glance passed between Courtenay and Joyce as the witness  took the stand. It was seen by no one but the keen-eyed Bobsy, and to him it  was a revelation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ho,&rdquo; was his self-communing, &ldquo;sits the wind in that quarter? Now, if his nibs  and the stately chatelaine are&mdash;er&mdash;<i>en  rapport</i>&mdash;it puts a distinctly different tint on the racing steed! I must see  about this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eugene  Courtenay was a man of the world, about thirty years old, and a near neighbour.  He had been a suitor of Joyce&rsquo;s before she succumbed to Stannard&rsquo;s Cave Man  wooing, and since, had been a friend of both.</p>
  <p>Easily  and leisurely Courtenay gave his testimony, which was to the effect that after  the dinner guests had scattered into the various rooms, he had been in the  Billiard Room until he went home. Several others had been there, but had  drifted away, and he was for a time alone there with his hostess. Then he had  taken leave, going out from the Billiard Room, which had an outside door. He  had not gone directly home, but had sauntered across a lawn, and had sat for a  short time on a garden seat, smoking. He had chanced to sit facing the studio  South window, and had noticed the light go out in that room. He thought nothing  of it, nor when, a few moments later the room was relit, did he think it  strange in any way. Why shouldn&rsquo;t people light and relight their rooms as they  chose? He then went home, knowing nothing of the tragedy and heard nothing of  it till morning. No further questioning brought out anything of importance and  Courtenay was dismissed.</p>
  <p>Mr.  and Mrs. Truxton gave no new information. They told of the dinner party, and of  the hours afterward. Mr. Truxton mentioned the jewels exhibited by Eric  Stannard, and dilated slightly upon them with the enthusiasm of a gem lover,  but neither he nor his wife could shed any light on the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are these jewels?&rdquo; asked Lamson, suddenly, scenting a possible robbery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Joyce answered, listlessly. &ldquo;Mr. Stannard kept some of them in  Safety Deposit and some in the house. He had a place of concealment for them,  but I preferred not to know where it is. When I wished to wear any of the  jewels he got them for me, and afterward put them away again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not think, Mrs. Stannard, that a burglar intent on securing these gems  might have attempted a robbery, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  come, Lamson,&rdquo; interposed Inspector Bardon, &ldquo;a burglar would scarcely make his  attempt while the household was still up, the house alight, and people  sauntering through the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not,&rdquo; responded the Coroner, in no wise abashed.</p>
  <p>Next,  Barry Stannard was asked to tell what he could of the whole matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the work of a burglar,&rdquo; said young Stannard, confidently; &ldquo;it simply shows  his cleverness that he chose a time when he could effect an entrance easily. He  need not have been a rough customer. He may have been of a gentlemanly type,&mdash;even  in evening clothes. But he gained access to my father, I haven&rsquo;t the slightest  doubt, and brought to bear some influence or threat that he hoped would gain  him his end. When my father refused his demands,&mdash;this is my theory and  belief,&mdash;he either feared discovery or, in a rage of revenge, killed my father  with the nearest weapon he could snatch at&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then, you think, Mr. Stannard, that this intruder turned off the lights and  made his exit just before the ladies entered the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. He was evidently a cool hand, and made a quick and clever getaway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  just how did he leave the room? You know, Mrs. Stannard was in the Billiard  Room and Miss Vernon on the Terrace, while Blake was at the main hall door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  made his escape by the large West window,&rdquo; replied Barry. &ldquo;If you will examine  it on the outside, you will see the marks of the jimmy, or whatever you call  the tool that burglars open windows with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  officer was sent at once to investigate this, and returned with the information  that there certainly were marks and scratches outside the window in question.  It was a long, French window, opening like a double door, and near the lock  were the telltale marks.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts cast one comprehensive glance at the West window, and then closed and  reopened one of his rather good-looking grey eyes. He glanced at Barry, and  observed, silently, &ldquo;Some scheme!&rdquo; after which, he calmly awaited developments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can we think that a man entered at that window,&rdquo; said Lamson, &ldquo;when we  notice how it is filled with furniture and apparatus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might have been managed,&rdquo; asserted Barry.</p>
  <p>And  then Bobsy Roberts spoke out loud. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he said, positively. &ldquo;No  one could, by any chance or skill, come in or go out by that window without  moving those plaster casts that are on the floor. No one could do it without  overturning that small easel, whose leg is directly in the path of the window  frame as it swings back. If you will try it, Inspector, you will see what I  mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was true. Even though the window might be opened, it would crash into and knock  over the small, light-weight easel, which held an unfinished picture on a  mounted canvas. And it would also knock down some casts which leaned against  it.</p>
  <p>Barry  looked crestfallen, the more so, that now the Coroner regarded him with a sort  of suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stannard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do you an injustice, but your theory is so  suspiciously implausible, that I can&rsquo;t help thinking you might have made those  scratches on the window yourself, for the purpose of diverting suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; Barry blurted out, almost like a schoolboy. &ldquo;And I am not ashamed of it.  My father&rsquo;s death is a mystery. So much of a one that I feel sure it will never  be solved. For that reason, I did and do want to turn your mind away from the  absurd and utterly unfounded presumption you make that the crime could have  been committed by either of the two ladies who, hearing my father&rsquo;s dying  struggles, rushed to his assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be the case,&rdquo; said Lamson, &ldquo;with one of the ladies you refer to. But the  other is, to all appearances the one responsible for the crime. It is my duty  to prove or disprove this, even though the position and high character of the  ladies make it seem impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is impossible!&rdquo; protested Barry. &ldquo;I know of facts and conditions which make it  possible and probable that an outsider, a&mdash;well, a blackmailer, perhaps,&mdash;might  have attacked my father. This is outside of discovery or proof, but I  request,&mdash;I demand that you cease to persecute your present suspects!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy, for in his passionate tirade he seemed even younger than usual, quivered  with the tensity of his emotion and faced the Coroner with a belligerent  antagonism that would have been funny in a case less grave.</p>
  <p>Roberts  regarded him with interest. &ldquo;Some chap!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I wonder, now, if he did  it himself,&mdash;and is trying to scatter the scent. No, I fancy it&rsquo;s his fear for  the dolly-baby girl, and he jimmied the door in a foolish attempt to make a  noise like a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know where your father kept his jewels?&rdquo; asked Lamson, suddenly, and Barry  started, as he said, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve no idea. That is, the ones in the house. The  others are in deposit with the Black Rock Trust Company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  does know the whereabouts of those kept in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  nobody seemed to know. Joyce had said she did not. Barry disclaimed the  knowledge. Inquired of, Miller, the valet, did not know. Nor Halpin, the old  Butler, nor any of the other servants.</p>
  <p>It  would seem that Eric Stannard had concealed his treasures in a hiding-place  known only to himself. An officer was sent to search his personal rooms, and in  the meantime Joyce was subjected to a further grilling.</p>
  <p>Exhausted  by the nervous strain, her calm, handsome face was pale and drawn. Wearily, she  answered questions that were not always necessary or tactful.</p>
  <p>At  last, when Lamson was trying to draw from her an account of what she was doing  or thinking after Courtenay had left her alone in the Billiafd Room, she seemed  to lose both patience and control, and burst forth, impulsively, &ldquo;I was  listening at the Studio door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  And what did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard my husband say, &lsquo;No, no, my lady, I will not divorce Joyce for you!&rsquo; and  then he laughed,&mdash;a certain laugh of his that I always called the trouble  laugh,&mdash;a sarcastic, irritating chuckle, enough to exasperate anybody,&mdash;anybody,  beyond the point of endurance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Coroner almost gasped, but fearing to check the flow of speech that promised so  much, he said, quietly, &ldquo;Did you hear anything further?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did. I heard him say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the emeralds, if you like, but I really  won&rsquo;t marry you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband was not a cruel man, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary, he was gentleness itself. He was most courteous and gallant  toward all, but if any one went counter to his wishes or opinions, he  invariably used a good-natured, jeering tone that was most annoying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to whom were these remarks that you overheard, addressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you ask? I was just about to go into the room, as I felt it my right, when,  at that very moment, the light was extinguished. I was so surprised at this,  that I stood there, uncertain what to do. Then hearing Eric gasp, as if in  distress, I pushed the curtain aside and went in. The rest, I have told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  sat down, and as she did so, a wave of crimson swept over her face. She looked  startled, ashamed, as if she had violated a confidence or told a secret, which  she now regretted. Barry sat beside her, and he was looking at her curiously.</p>
  <p>Then  the man who had been sent to search for the jewels returned. He reported that  he had not been able to find any trace of them, but brought a note he had found  on Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s writing desk.</p>
  <p>Coroner  Lamson read the note, and passed it over to Inspector Bardon.</p>
  <p>Eventually  it was read aloud. It ran thus:</p>
  <p>GOLDENHEART:</p>
  <p>You  have a strange power over me&mdash;you can sway me to your will when I am in your  presence. But now, alone, I am my own man and my better self protests at our  secret. You know where the jewels are hidden. Take the emeralds, if you like,  and forgive and forget.</p>
  <p>ERIC.</p>
  <p>The  note fell like a bombshell. Everybody gasped at this revelation of the artist&rsquo;s  intrigue with his model. Joyce turned white to her very lips, and Barry flushed  scarlet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  Miss Vernon,&rdquo; commanded the Coroner, abruptly.</p>
  <p>Natalie  came in, looking lovelier than ever, and quite composed now. Without a word,  Lamson handed her the note.</p>
  <p>The  girl read it, and returned it. Except for the trembling of her lip, which she  bit in her endeavour to control it, she was calm and self-possessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  said the Coroner, as gentle toward her now as he had been fierce before, &ldquo;what  does that note to you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  turned the full gaze of her troubled eyes on him. If her angel face was ever  appealing, it was doubly so now, when her drooped mouth and quivering chin told  of her desperate distress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not to me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; Bobsy Roberts thought; &ldquo;stick to that, now. It&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was written to you, and left in Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s desk. Where are the emeralds?  Where are the other jewels hidden?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know. I tell you that letter is not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yours, because you didn&rsquo;t receive it. But it was written to you, and before it  was sent, the writer told you, in so many words, the purport of it here in this  very room, and in a rage, you killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  stopped her accuser with a gesture of her hand. Her rosy palm lifted in  protest, she said, &ldquo;Why do you believe Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s story and not mine? What <i>I</i> saw in this room was the jealous  wife, cowering in an agony of fear and terror at sight of her own crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lamson  paused. He remembered that the testimony of the two disinterested witnesses,  Mrs. Faulkner and Blake, went to show that these two women were both there,  near the victim, within a brief moment of the crime itself. Who should say  which was guilty, the jealous wife or the disappointed girl?</p>
  <p>And  another point. Mrs. Faulkner and Blake had told in detail the succession of  events at the critical moment of the turning off the lights, of the cry for  help, and of their entrance; might not Joyce have timed her story by this, and  claimed an entrance at the same moment? And, also, might not Natalie merely  have patterned her recital after that of Joyce? Which woman was guilty? </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>V<br>
    Blake&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>The  sapient gentlemen of the Coroner&rsquo;s Jury concluded, after a somewhat protracted  discussion, that Eric Stannard met his death at those convenient and ever  available hands of a person or persons unknown. They could not bring themselves  to accuse either Joyce or Natalie, because for each suspect they had only the  evidence of the other&rsquo;s unsupported story. And Public Opinion, as represented  by the citizens of Rensselaer Park, would have risen in a body to protest  against a verdict that implicated either or both of these two women. And yet,  there were many exceptions. Many of those whose voices were loudest in  declaring the innocence of Joyce and Natalie, expressed private views that  stultified their statements. And some, wagged their heads wisely, and whispered  a thought of Blake. But most stood out strongly for the burglar theory,  ignoring all obstacles in the way of the marauder&rsquo;s entrance, and repeatedly  insisting that the non-appearance of the jewels was sufficient proof of  robbery.</p>
  <p>It  may be that Barry&rsquo;s self-confessed scratching of the paint on the window-frame  turned the trend of thought toward a possible burglar or blackmailer, even if  he gained entrance some other way; and it may be this was the loophole through  which the two suspected people escaped accusation.</p>
  <p>But  the interest of the police in these two was strengthened rather than lessened,  and their life and conduct were under close scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Captain  Steele, who had been assigned to the case, declared that he was glad of the  verdict, for it was better to have the suspects at large, and he was a firm  believer in the principle of giving people sufficient rope and allowing them the  privilege of hanging themselves.</p>
  <p>Captain  Steele was at The Folly, as the house was always called,&mdash;in spite of the  Stannards&rsquo; attempts to use the more attractive name of Stanhurst,&mdash;on the day  after the inquest, and Detective Roberts was also there and one or two other  policemen and reporters.</p>
  <p>Steele  had appropriated the small Reception Room next the studio for his quarters, and  was going over with great care the reports of the proceedings and evidence of  the day before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, Bobsy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the burglar stunt won&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;ve tried, and Carter,  here, he&rsquo;s tried, and we couldn&rsquo;t come within a mile of getting in or out among  that art junk in the window, without making noise and commotion enough to wake  the dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; assented Bobsy. &ldquo;Knew it all the time. Let&rsquo;s cut out Mr. Burglar.  Also, Blake was on the door all the evening, and he would have looked in the  studio in case of a racket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure.  Now, I want to fix the time of the stab act. They all say about half past  eleven, but nobody knows exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they don&rsquo;t. People in evening togs never know what time it is. Why  should they? They don&rsquo;t have to punch a clock. I think the footman would just  about know, though. Servants have their hours, you know. And anyway, let&rsquo;s get  that man in here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blake  was summoned, and, though impassive as usual, seemed ready to answer questions.</p>
  <p>He  retold his story, with no appreciable deviation from what he had testified at  the inquest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure it all occurred at half past eleven?&rdquo; asked Steele.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. I heard the chimes in the studio just before the light went out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long was the light out?&rdquo; Roberts put in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say, not more&rsquo;n a minute or so. I was that scared when I heard the  sounds, I can&rsquo;t tell about the length of time properly. But it wasn&rsquo;t two  minutes, I&rsquo;m sure, between the studio light going off and me turning it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you have turned it on, if Mrs. Faulkner hadn&rsquo;t told you to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blake  considered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. I think, yes, for I heard that &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; distinctly,  for all it was so faint. And I think, if I&rsquo;d been on my own, I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; gone  ahead. At such times a servant has to use his judgment, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  you are, Blake,&rdquo; said Bobsy, who had taken a liking to the footman. &ldquo;Now, tell  us all you know of the whereabouts of every member of the family&mdash;of the  household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know much as to that. You see, I was on the hall, and I could only see  those who passed through it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  go clear back, to dinner time, and enumerate them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  dinner, everybody was in the drawing room, that&rsquo;s over the dining room, at the  East end of the house. Then they all came down the grand staircase to dinner,  and of course I saw them then. After dinner, the ladies had their coffee on the  Terrace and the gentlemen stayed at the table. Then, when the men came out of  the dining room, they pretty much scattered all over the house. Everybody was  in the studio at one time, and then some went to the Billiard Room or in this  Reception Room we&rsquo;re now in, or up to the Drawing Room. Then, about eleven, Mr.  and Mrs. Truxton went home, and I showed them out. And Mrs. Faulkner and Mr.  Wadsworth were in the hall at the same time. But after the Truxtons went, Mrs.  Faulkner and Mr. Wadsworth went up to the Drawing Room. You see,&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Blake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if I may say it, sir, he&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;sweet on her, and they two went off by  themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; and Bobsy smiled. &ldquo;Now, as to the other ladies, Mrs. Stannard and Miss  Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  those I know nothing, for they didn&rsquo;t come around where I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  any of the men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. Well, then, next, Mr. Wadsworth, he came down, and I let him out. He says,  &lsquo;Good night, Blake,&rsquo; sort of gay like, and I thought perhaps Mrs. Faulkner had  smiled on his suit, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. And then, Mrs. Faulkner came down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but you see, just the moment before, I had heard this queer noise in the  studio, and I was listening at the crack of the door. I meant no harm, and no  curiosity,&mdash;but Mrs. Faulkner came in sight of me just then, and she spoke to  me. Then, the lights went out&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you said they were out before the lady spoke to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, that&rsquo;s right, they were. Well, it&rsquo;s small wonder I get mixed up. They  were, sir, because I told Mrs. Faulkner they were, and she said it wasn&rsquo;t my  place to comment on that. And she was right, it wasn&rsquo;t my place, to be sure;  but I was worried, that&rsquo;s what I was, worried, and then we both heard the cry  of &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; and she told me to turn on the studio lights and I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they all obey one switch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, that is, there&rsquo;s one main key right at the door jamb that controls all. So  when I turned it on, the whole room was ablaze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  of course, you couldn&rsquo;t help seeing the exact state of things. Well, Blake,  which lady do you think did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir,&rdquo; and Blake&rsquo;s solemn face grew a shade more so, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say. I&rsquo;m sure I  don&rsquo;t know. But, it must have been one of them, there&rsquo;s no getting around that.  When I saw the three, as you might say, almost in a row, and the two ladies,  sir, both near to Mr. Stannard, sir, and both looking&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t describe how  they looked! Why if they were both guilty they couldn&rsquo;t have looked different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  weren&rsquo;t both guilty!&rdquo; cried Roberts. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been collusion, eh,  Steele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  of course not,&rdquo; returned Captain Steele; &ldquo;one stabbed him, and the other came  in at the sound of his voice. The terror and shock of the culprit and that of  the innocent one would both be manifested by the same expressions of horror and  fright&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe that,&rdquo; said Bobsy, after a minute&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Now, Blake, as to the  actual means of getting in and out of that studio. Let&rsquo;s go in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was rather early in the morning and the members of the household were as yet in  their rooms. It was not the intention of the Police to intrude upon them until  after the funeral, but it was desirable to make certain inquiries and  investigations while the matter was fresh in the minds of the servants.</p>
  <p>Roberts  intended to interview others of them afterward, but just now Blake was proving  so satisfactory that he continued to keep him by.</p>
  <p>In  the studio, both Steele and Roberts examined carefully the marks on the West  window casing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Idiot  boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobsy. &ldquo;To think he could fool us into believing this was  professional work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  shows a leaping mind on his part, to fly round here and fix it up so quickly,&rdquo;  said Steele, a bit admiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what Mr. Barry has, sir, the leaping mind,&rdquo; observed Blake, as if pleased with  the phrase. &ldquo;Often he jumps to a conclusion or decision that his father&rsquo;d take  hours to reach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Stannard was slow, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to say slow, in some things. He was like lightning at his work. But as to a  matter, now, that he didn&rsquo;t want to bother about, he would put it off or dawdle  about it, something awful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you see,&rdquo; Bobsy went on, &ldquo;there are only three doors and three windows in the  place. Now we have accounted for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the gallery for?&rdquo; asked Steele, gazing up at the gilded iron scrollwork of the  little balcony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  for ornament, sir,&rdquo; Blake returned. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard Mr. Stannard say, it was  necessary, to break up that wall. You see, the ceiling is some twenty feet  high, and no windows on that side, being next the main house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all one house,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no division?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  real division, sir, but this end,&mdash;the studio and Billiard Room on this floor,  and the rooms directly above,&mdash;are all Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s own, and in a way separate  from the rest of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  sleeping room is above the studio?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; and his bath and dressing-room and den. Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s rooms are next,  over the Reception Room, and all the other bedrooms are over the dining room  end, and in the third story.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;  impatiently cut in Bobsy. &ldquo;There are six ways of getting in and out. Now nobody  could have entered at the hall door where you were, Blake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, sir. I was there all the evening, and the hall lighted as bright as day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. That&rsquo;s one off. Now we&rsquo;ll go round the room. The North window is out of  the question, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said Blake, as the query was to him. &ldquo;It only opens in those high, upper  sections, by cords, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blake  showed the contrivance that opened and shut the upper panes, and it was clear  to be seen that there was no possibility of entrance that way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next  is the West window,&rdquo; Bobsy went on, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s settled by a glance. Why, look  at the chalk dust on the floor. How could any one walk through that and leave  no track?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was unanswerable, so they went on to the door to the Billiard Room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is where Mrs. Stannard came in. No other person could have entered this door  unless she had seen him. Now, we come to the East window. This was open, I am  told, but the wire fly-screen makes it safe. Also, Mr. Courtenay sat on a lawn  bench, looking this way, when the light went out. Had a person climbed in at  this window before that he must have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  couldn&rsquo;t climb in, sir, &lsquo;count of the screen,&rdquo; said Blake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a movable  screen. We put them up for the season, and take them down the middle of  October. They all come down next week.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  door, the last,&rdquo; and Bobsy paused at the door to the Terrace, &ldquo;is the one at  which Miss Vernon entered. If any one else had come in here she would have seen  him. That completes our circuit. No one could have gained access to this room  except the ones under consideration. Now we are faced by the fact that one of  those two women committed the murder, and it&rsquo;s up to us to decide which one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the fireplace,&rdquo; suggested Steele.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a fire there that night,&rdquo; Blake asserted. &ldquo;That is, there had been, for the  evening was a little chilly, and too, Mrs. Stannard is fond of an open fire. It  was burned out when&mdash;when it all happened, but the embers were smouldering when  I came into the room. And no one could come down the chimney, anyway. It&rsquo;s a  crooked flue, and it&rsquo;s full of soot beside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one ever comes down a chimney,&rdquo; said Roberts, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s always well to look  into it&rdquo; He peered up into the blackness, but the even coat of soot showed no  scratches or marks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there&rsquo;s no ingress other than those we&rsquo;ve noted,&rdquo; Steele mused. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no  skylight, no cupboards, no doors up in that balcony place,&rdquo; he ran up and  across it, as he spoke, tapping on the wainscoated wall. &ldquo;Solid,&rdquo; he said, as  he came down the other little stair. &ldquo;Now, is there any trap door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  lifted rugs and hammered on the floor but the oak was an unmarred surface, and  no opening was there of any sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted to be sure,&rdquo; said Roberts, as, a little shamefacedly he pounded on the  floorboards around the West window. &ldquo;Now, I am sure. We have only the two doors  to deal with. The door from the Terrace and the one from the studio. Let&rsquo;s look  at them both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stepping  out onto the beautiful covered Terrace, the men paused to take in the glories  of the scene. The splendid lawns sloping down to even more splendid gardens  were the plan of an artist and a Nature lover both. The October foliage was  alight and aglow, and the Autumn flowers were masses of gorgeous bloom. But  after a whiff or two of the sunlit morning air, they returned to their quest &ldquo;On  this terrace Miss Vernon and Barry Stannard sat until after eleven,&rdquo; Roberts  said; &ldquo;I got that from young Stannard himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  put too much faith in those people&rsquo;s ideas of time,&rdquo; warned Steele. &ldquo;He may  think it was after eleven and it may have been much earlier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, there. Well, anyway, he sat here with her, in the dark,&mdash;he told me had  turned off the Terrace light,&mdash;and then he went off to give the dogs some  exercise. I believe they go for a trot every night, don&rsquo;t they, Blake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; Mr. Barry almost always romps about with the dogs of an evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that leaves Miss Vernon alone here for an indefinite&mdash;I mean, an indeterminate  time. Now, why doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Courtenay see her, as he sits on that lawn seat  yonder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  dark,&rdquo; said Steele, laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right. She was back, we&rsquo;ll say, under the Terrace roof, and the night was dark.  Moreover, the Studio was brightly lighted, also the Billiard Room, which threw  the Terrace even more in shadow. Well, then,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sort of reconstructing  this,&mdash;Miss Vernon sat here, until, <i>as she  says</i>, she heard the noise in the studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  saw the light go out,&rdquo; and Steele shook his head. &ldquo;Nobody seems to know which  happened first, the sudden darkness in there or the queer sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one knows, except the murderer,&rdquo; said Roberts, seriously. &ldquo;The murderer knows,  because he&mdash;or she&mdash;turned off the light, but the others, who are innocent, are  uncertain about it, as one always is about a moment of unexpected action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; and Steele looked at the detective in admiration. &ldquo;Mighty few can give a  clear account of sudden happenings, unless it&rsquo;s a cut and dried account&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet&mdash;&rdquo; Bobsy frowned, &ldquo;you know both Miss Vernon and Mrs. Stannard became  confused about the lights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  because they both tried to copycat the footman&rsquo;s story. You see, the one who  really killed Stannard, did shut off the lights, and when she tells her story,  and has to stick to it, she gets mixed up about the sound and the lights, because  she was in the studio all the time, and not where she says she was, at all.  Then, on the other hand, the other of the two, being innocent, gets confused,  because she really can&rsquo;t tell just how things did happen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sound  enough. Now let&rsquo;s go to the Billiard Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Crossing  the studio again, they entered the Billiard Room, a large apartment with seats  round the walls and the table in the centre.</p>
  <p>Cue  racks and much smoking and other masculine paraphernalia were all about. There  were a skylight of stained glass and a few high side windows. An outside door  was on the South side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  Mr. Courtenay left Mrs. Stannard, at much the same time Barry left the girl,&rdquo;  Roberts said. &ldquo;So you see, Steele, their chances are equal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chances  of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean chances to go into the studio, unobserved of anybody, commit the deed,  turn off the lights, and then, either return to the spot she came from or to  remain in the room until the other entered. It must have been that way, for  there&rsquo;s no other way for it to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right; now, what about Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s story of overhearing the stuff her  husband said to the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  true, but if he said that to Miss Vernon and Mrs. Stannard overheard it, she <i>might</i> have run in and found the dead  man, or she <i>might</i> have run in and  stabbed the living man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  so. She knew where every bit of furniture was. But isn&rsquo;t it quite as likely  that the girl did the stabbing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  wax baby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t the baby she looks! Always distrust a blonde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  such a blonde!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Distrust  them in proportion to their blondeness, then. But we&rsquo;ve learned all we can  here. Back to think it over, and puzzle it out.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>VI<br>
    Mrs. Faulkner&rsquo;s Account</b></h2>
  <p>Now,  although the residents of the aristocratic Rensselaer Park were willing, and  even preferred to accept the burglar theory, rather than have more shocking  revelations, the newspaper reading public was avid for sensation, and  dissatisfied at the failure of the police to arrest anybody, even the  hypothetical burglar.</p>
  <p>Owing  to the prominence of the victim, both socially and in the art world, a great  hue and cry was raised for vengeance where vengeance was due. All sorts of  theories were propounded by all sorts of people and interest increased rather  than dwindled as no definite progress was reported.</p>
  <p>Captain  Steele was one of the most able men on the force, and his record for success in  murder cases was of the best. His reputation was at stake, and he was working  his very hardest in his handling of the present matter. His methods were  persistent rather than brilliant, and his slowness was often the despair of  quick-witted Robert Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo;  Bobsy would say, &ldquo;do you see that point?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw it long ago,&rdquo; would be the exasperating reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t thought it out yet&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  get busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am busy,&rdquo; the stolid Captain would answer, and go on about his business.</p>
  <p>But  the two were staunch friends and allies, and possessed the qualities that  enabled them to work side by side without friction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said Steele, as they were closeted in the Reception Room, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more or  less a psychological problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  liked this room for their confabs. The small size and convenient location  suited their purpose admirably. They could shut its two doors, and be entirely  secluded or they could open them and get a general idea of what was going on  about the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Snug  little box,&rdquo; Bobsy had said, when he first saw it, and the walls and ceiling  being all of the same general decoration in red and gold, did give it the  effect of a well lined box. It was used by the family for the reception of  transient callers, and was more formal than the studio or Billiard Room. The  Terrace, too, was used as a living place, in available weather, and even now as  the two men were deep in their discussion, there could be seen through the  south window some servants arranging a small breakfast table out there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Psychology  is out of my line,&rdquo; Roberts said, in answer to the Captain&rsquo;s assertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mean anything scientific. But, it&rsquo;s this way. One of those women is  lying and one telling the truth. Now, if we tax them with this, we&rsquo;ll get  nothing out of them, for they&rsquo;re both at the edge of a nervous breakdown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  innocent one, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure.  The guilty one is naturally all wrought up, and the innocent one is so scared  at the whole thing that she is all in, too. I think the little peach was in  love with the artist; I&rsquo;m not sure of this, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, anyway.  Also, and incidentally, I think that Courtenay man is very much in love with  Mrs. Stannard. Now, all these things are none of our business, unless they help  us to form conclusions that are our business. And so, we must be rather more  tactful and diplomatic than usual, because of dealing with highstrung and  fine-calibred natures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  murder doesn&rsquo;t connote a high-calibred nature!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may well do so. A strong impulse of revenge or jealousy could, on occasion,  sway the highest mind to the basest deed. Murderers are made, not born,  Lombroso to the contrary, notwithstanding. And it is the coincidence of opportunity  and motive that makes crime possible to an otherwise great and noble nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure I agree to all that, but if the argument is helpful let&rsquo;s use it by  all means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is. Now, here&rsquo;s the situation. As near as I can make out, Mr. Stannard was  alone in his studio after the Truxton people had gone; the Faulkner lady and  her admirer had gone to the drawing-room, the model was on the Terrace with  Barry, and Mrs. Joyce was in the Billiard Room with Courtenay. The trouble is,  we don&rsquo;t know how long this interval was. Blake says the Truxtons went at  eleven. Well, from eleven, then, till eleven-thirty covers the whole time in  question. Between those two moments the crime was led up to and committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  it have been led up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  necessarily, I admit. But suppose, let us say, that soon after eleven, one or  other of the two women we&rsquo;re considering, was left alone. Say she came into the  studio and had some sort of session with Mr. Stannard that led to the stabbing.  Then, say, she turned off the lights, and quickly returned to her post, either  in the Billiard Room or on the Terrace, and a moment later, entered again, just  as she says she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, that goes. Now, which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what we must discover by studying the two women, not by hunting clues of a  material nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whichever  did it, or whoever did it, had to cross to the other end of the room to turn  off the lights, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain  Steele remembered the switch was near the hall door, and the armchair where  Stannard died was at the South end of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he agreed, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s only a few seconds&rsquo; work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  when she did it, the man was not dead. You know he groaned after the light went  out, and later, he spoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  can you imagine that little girl having nerve enough for all that? Mrs.  Stannard is a much older woman, and a self-possessed one. My opinion leans  toward her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the dying words of the man, and also, what about that letter to the model?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  too much evidence instead of not enough! But before we sift it out, which we  can do elsewhere, let&rsquo;s try to learn something more from the people here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Servants  or the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  others, if possible. If not, then some servants beside Blake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  breakfast table on the Terrace had been visited only by Mrs. Faulkner and Barry  Stannard. The other ladies had not appeared. The two had quite evidently  finished, as the men could see from their lace curtained window, and Roberts  proposed they request an interview with one or both of them.</p>
  <p>Somewhat  to their surprise, the request was graciously granted. Mrs. Faulkner said she  should be rather glad of an opportunity to learn what the police had done or  were thinking of doing, and Barry seemed anxious to discuss matters also.</p>
  <p>But  even before they began, Barry was called away on some errand, and Mrs. Faulkner  was their only source of information.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts was disappointed, for he wanted to talk with a member of the immediate  family, but Captain Steele saw a chance to learn something personal of the two  women he wished to study.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must know, Mrs. Faulkner,&rdquo; began Steele, &ldquo;that the two women found in the room,  near the dying man, are naturally under grave suspicion of guilt. Can you tell  us anything that will help clear the innocent or indicate the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  looked at him a moment, before she spoke. She also glanced at Bobsy Roberts,  and then, in a low, calm voice she replied: &ldquo;I think I must remind you that  these two women are my dear friends. I have known Mrs. Stannard for years, and  Miss Vernon, though a recent acquaintance, is very dear to me. They are both  fine, noble women, utterly incapable of the crime, even under deepest  provocation. Therefore I do not admit, even to myself, that the circumstances  implicate either of them, although they may seem to do so. With this  declaration of my attitude in the matter, I will answer any questions that I  can, but I will not agree that your theory is the right one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  who did kill Mr. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I cannot say. But in absence of any real evidence against Mrs. Stannard or Miss  Vernon, it must seem to have been an intruder of some sort. Though it may not  be known how he entered, it is far more easy to believe that he did gain an  entrance, than to believe crime of either of those two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was plain to be seen Mrs. Faulkner was determined to stand by her friends  through thick and thin. So Bobsy started on another tack. &ldquo;Will you tell us  then something of the personal relations of this household? Was Mr. Stannard in  love with his pretty model?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he was,&rdquo; Beatrice rejoined, as if the matter were of no great import, &ldquo;but  Mr. Stannard was the type of man known as a &lsquo;lady-killer.&rsquo; He adored all  beautiful women, and was what may be called &lsquo;in love&rsquo; with many. His nature was  so volatile and so impressionable, that his love affairs were frequent and  ephemeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard made no objection to this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think these queries are unnecessarily personal, but I see, so far, no harm in  replying. Mrs. Stannard knew so well her husband&rsquo;s temperament and disposition,  that usually she laughed at his sudden adorations, knowing that he tired of  them very quickly. The Stannards were a model and a modern couple. They never  stooped to petty jealousies or bickerings, and had wide tolerance for each  other&rsquo;s actions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard is his second wife, is she not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  they were married something more than two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Stannard had other suitors, who were disappointed at her marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is usually true of any beautiful woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  in her case you know of instances?&rdquo; Bobsy smiled pleasantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally,  as I know her so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is Mr. Courtenay one of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Courtenay was one of her devoted admirers, and since the marriage he has been a  friend warmly welcomed here by both Mr. and Mrs. Stannard. No breath of  reproach may be brought against Joyce Stannard or Eugene Courtenay. Of this I  can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the young lady,&mdash;is Barry Stannard a suitor of hers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice&rsquo;s  face clouded a little. &ldquo;Yes; you cannot help seeing that, so I will tell you that  he is madly in love with Miss Vernon, but his father strongly objected to the  match, and threatened to disinherit Barry if he persisted in his attentions to  the girl. I tell you this, because I prefer you to hear the truth from me,  rather than a string of garbled gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  young Stannard persisted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. It was love at first sight on both sides, and Miss Vernon is a very  lovely girl,&mdash;of quite as lovely a nature as her pure sweet face indicates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  not Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s objection to his son&rsquo;s suit have been prompted by his own  admiration for the lovely nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might have been,&rdquo; and Beatrice sighed. &ldquo;Eric Stannard was an exceedingly  selfish man, and though his interest in the model was doubtless his usual  temporary love affair, it is quite likely that it was the main motive of his  displeasure at his son&rsquo;s interference. I am speaking very frankly, for I know  these things must all come out, and I am hoping, if you know just how matters  are, you will understand the case better and be more prepared to relieve the  two women of suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be so,&rdquo; and Captain Steele nodded his head sagely.</p>
  <p>But  Mrs. Faulkner was watching him closely. &ldquo;You are not yet very greatly  influenced by my revelations, I can see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I am sure you will  come around to my way of thinking, sooner or later. The more you see of your  suspects, the more you will realise the absurdity of your suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  possibly true: When can we have an interview with either of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard is prostrated. I am sure you cannot see her before the funeral, which  will be tomorrow. Won&rsquo;t you refrain from asking it, until after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  But Miss Vernon, may we not have a few words with her? You must realise, Mrs.  Faulkner, if the girl is innocent, it will be much better for her to see us and  answer a few straightforward questions than to appear unwilling to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you. I will go and ask her, myself, and advise her to see you. Shall  I go now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a moment, please; but first, one more question. We are trying to discover who  last saw Mr. Stannard alive, prior to the time of the murder. What can you tell  us as to this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  that I was in the studio, just before the first of the guests went away. At  that time we were all there, I think, except Barry and Natalie, who were out on  the Terrace. The two Truxtons went home, and at the same time Mr. Wadsworth and  I went up to the drawing room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  be by yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  certain kindliness in Bobsy&rsquo;s tone robbed the question of impertinence, and  Beatrice smiled a little, as she said, &ldquo;Yes, exactly. We stayed there perhaps a  half hour, and then Mr. Wadsworth went home. I did not go downstairs with him,  but sat a moment in the drawing-room,&mdash;thinking over some personal matters. Then  when I went downstairs, it was to see Blake listening at the door,&mdash;and the rest  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  now whom did you leave in the studio, when you and Mr. Wadsworth and the  Truxtons went out of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  thought a moment &ldquo;Only Mr. Stannard, his wife and Mr. Courtenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Mrs. Stannard and Mr. Courtenay went into the Billiard Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and Mr. Stannard went, too. But he went back in the studio,&mdash;Joyce told me  that,&mdash;and he must have been there alone when&mdash;the person who killed him came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  would make it, that Mr. Stannard returned to his studio from the Billiard Room  at a little after eleven, say, five or ten minutes after. The fact that he  cried out for help at about eleven-thirty narrows the time down rather close.  We have only about twenty minutes for the intruder to enter and commit the  deed. This is long enough if the crime was premeditated, but scarcely giving  time for a quarrel or argument to take place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you assume premeditation?&rdquo; and Beatrice looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I am sure you will find, Mr. Roberts, that it could not have been either of the  two you think. For even if one of them might have done such a thing in the heat  of passion, neither, I am positive, ever deliberately premeditated it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the letter found in the desk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  and Beatrice shook her head emphatically, &ldquo;that was never meant for Miss  Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  Mrs. Stannard overheard him say practically the same thing to somebody in the  studio, a moment or two before the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce  thinks she heard that. But Captain Steele, that poor woman scarcely knew what  she was saying at that awful inquest, and she&mdash;well, she had reason to think  there were women in Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s life, who would be willing,&mdash;in fact, who  wished him to be divorced from her. She knew this, she knew of that note he had  written,&mdash;it was not the first of that nature, and she imagined she heard that  speech.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  make Mr. Stannard out a very bad man, Mrs. Faulkner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to speak ill of the dead, but he was not a good man in the ways we are  talking of. In other respects, Eric Stannard had few faults. He was upright,  honest and generous. He was kind and he was truthful. And he was  extraordinarily brave and honourable. But he was inordinately selfish and of  sybaritic instincts. He would not try to curb his admiration for a new and  pretty face, and though absolutely loyal to his wife in honour and principle he  was a flirt and a gallant, much in the way of a butterfly among the flowers.  His genius it is not necessary to speak of. He is known here and abroad as one  of the greatest artists of the century. And his wide and varied experiences,  his cosmopolitan life and his waywardness of character may well have gained him  enemies, who in a secret and clever manner found means to take his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  will benefit financially by his death?&rdquo; Captain Steele asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t heard anything about the will yet, but I&rsquo;m pretty certain, that outside  of a few friendly bequests his fortune is divided between his wife and son,  about equally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his jewel collection? Is not that valuable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very.  The emeralds mentioned in that note comprise a fortune in wonderfully matched  stones. And there are many more. Yes, it is an exceedingly valuable lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  showed them to Mr. Truxton, that evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  all of us. That was right after dinner. He showed only a few cases, but of very  beautiful stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then he put them away, where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no idea. They were not in sight, that I remember, when the Truxtons took leave.  But I gave them no thought. I&rsquo;ve often seen them, and after their exhibition,  Mr. Stannard always puts them in his safe himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have not been found in the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he put them in some simple hiding-place. They will turn up. Unless, of course,  there was a real burglar, whose motive was robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you do not think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frankly,  I do not see how there could have been an intruder, unless dressed as a  gentleman. No other could have gained access to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  servants saw no stranger, in any sort of garb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  say so,&rdquo; returned Beatrice, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overtook the possibility of an  accomplice among the servants. I&rsquo;ve no reason to think this, but such things  have happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have indeed, and I assure you we have not overlooked the chance of it&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>VII</b><br>
  <b>Natalie, Not Joyce  </b></h2>
  <p>BUT  the desired interview with Natalie was not achieved before the funeral of Eric  Stannard. It was two days after before the girl would consent to see Roberts,  and then, under protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  nothing to say,&rdquo; she declared, as she came unwillingly into the Reception Room  to meet him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not under arrest, and there&rsquo;s no law that can make me talk if  I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lovely face was troubled and the scarlet lips were pouting as Miss Vernon  flounced herself into a chair, one foot tucked under her, and one little slipper  tapping the carpet. She looked so like a petulant school-girl, it was well nigh  impossible to connect her with a thought of anything really wrong. But Robert  Roberts was experienced in guile and was by no means ready to accept her  innocence at its face value.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  law ought to make you do anything you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he said smiling; &ldquo;but  suppose it&rsquo;s to your own advantage to talk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sympathetic, good-natured face of Bobsy Roberts had a pleasant effect, for  Natalie&rsquo;s pout disappeared and a look of confidence came into her blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if I can trust you,&rdquo; she said, meditatively, as she gazed at him, with  an alluring intentness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  sure can,&rdquo; returned Bobsy, but he consciously and conscientiously steeled  himself against her witcheries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think I can,&rdquo; she said, after a moment, and with a tiny sigh of  disappointment, she looked away. &ldquo;Go on; question me as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I trust you, as far as that goes. But I see you suspect me of killing Mr.  Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Bobsy believed in the efficacy of sudden, direct questions.</p>
  <p>But  Miss Vernon was not taken off guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she said, quietly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. But when I say I didn&rsquo;t, it implicates Mrs.  Stannard, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that. Can&rsquo;t you tell me what to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s this way. If Mrs. Stannard is the guilty person, you want it known, don&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed! If Joyce Stannard killed her husband, she had a good reason for it, and  I&rsquo;d rather nobody&rsquo;d know she did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was her good reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you know, Mr. Stannard was&mdash;that is,&mdash;he had eyes for other people beside his  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  for instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  and the flower face took on a look of positive hatred, and of angry  reminiscence. &ldquo;I have no kindly thought of Eric Stannard, if he <i>is</i> dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was kind to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  kind,&mdash;in some ways,&mdash;and not enough so in others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  his wife was jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wouldn&rsquo;t be! He petted her to death one day and the next he neglected her  shamefully. I will trust you, Mr. Roberts. Now, listen; if Joyce killed Eric,&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t say she did, but if she did, why can&rsquo;t we just hush up the matter, and  pry into it no more? Barry wants that and so do I. And who else is to be  considered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  law, justice, humanity, all things right and fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!  Let those things go. Consider the wishes of the people most concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  straighten out a few uncertain points. Where are the emeralds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness!  I don&rsquo;t know! That foolish letter wasn&rsquo;t written to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  whom, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that, either. Some one of Eric&rsquo;s lady friends, I suppose. Fancy my  wanting him to divorce his wife and marry me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  looked at her narrowly, distrusting every word. This girl, he felt sure, was  far from being as ingenuous as she looked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he was in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  blushed, a real, natural girl blush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help that, Mr. Roberts. I am, unfortunately, a type that men admire. It  is the cross of my life that every one is attracted by my silly doll-face!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts laughed outright, at this naive wail of woe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t laugh, I&rsquo;m in earnest. I get so sick of having men fall in love with  me, that I&rsquo;d like to go and live on a desert island!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  whom?&rdquo; and Bobsy looked at her intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Barry Stannard,&rdquo; she returned, simply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re engaged, now. We couldn&rsquo;t be,  while Mr. Stannard lived, for he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. Threatened to disinherit  Barry, and all that. But now, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon, to my mind, that speech clears you of all suspicion. If you had killed  Eric Stannard, because he wouldn&rsquo;t let his son marry you, you never would have  referred to it so frankly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I wouldn&rsquo;t. Now, don&rsquo;t you see, since I didn&rsquo;t kill him, it must have  been Joyce. It&rsquo;s been proved over and over that it could not have been a  burglar, or anybody like that. And so, I want to stop investigating, and leave  Joyce in peace. And then, after awhile, she can marry Eugene Courtenay, and be  happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she want to marry Mr. Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course she does. He was in love with her and she with him, before she knew Mr.  Stannard. Then Eric came along and stole her,&mdash;yes, stole her,&mdash;just like a Cave  Man. She was carried away by his whirlwind wooing, and&mdash;too&mdash;he was celebrated,  and&mdash;well,&mdash;you know,&mdash;masterful,&mdash;and he just took her by storm. She never really  loved him, but she has been good and faithful, though he has treated her badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if she killed him, it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was because she had reached the end of her rope, and couldn&rsquo;t stand any more.  And, too, she has seen a lot of Mr. Courtenay lately, and&mdash;oh, well,&mdash;she was mad  that Eric took such a fancy to me, and so,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Miss Vernon, just see if you can reconstruct the scene to fit in with a  theory of Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you remember about the light going out and the cry for help,&mdash;and all that,  exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve  tried to, but it&rsquo;s all mixed up in my mind. I think, if Joyce,&mdash;I mean, whoever  did it,&mdash;must have struck the blow, and then turned off the light, and then gone  out of the room, and&mdash;and come back again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that could have been you&mdash;as well as Mrs. Stannard! You were both discovered in  practically the same circumstances!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  trying to trip me, Mr. Roberts. But you can&rsquo;t do it. Now, look here, if that  note had been written to me, wouldn&rsquo;t it mean that these emeralds were mine,  and wouldn&rsquo;t I claim them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it states distinctly that you know where they are, and the presumption is, that  you have them in your possession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I haven&rsquo;t! I wish I had! I mean, I wish I had them rightfully in my possession!  They&rsquo;re wonderful stones! Look here, Mr. Roberts, why don&rsquo;t you suspect Mr.  Truxton? He&rsquo;s gem crazy,&mdash;and you know gem enthusiasts often go to any length to  get the stones they covet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hadn&rsquo;t thought of him. And, supposing he did commit crime to steal Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s  jewels, just how did he get away afterward, without discovery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  suppose he stabbed Mr. Stannard, then turned off the light, and then slipped  out through the Billiard Room when Joyce&rsquo;s back was turned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  unlikely. Besides, Mr. Courtenay, who sat on the bench on the lawn, just then,  would have seen him leave the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose he would.&rdquo; Natalie drew a deep sigh. &ldquo;Do give it up, Mr. Roberts. You  never can untangle it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to stay here long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a time. Mrs. Stannard has asked me to, and Barry wants me.&rdquo; The simplicity of  the girl&rsquo;s manner almost disarmed Bobsy, but he went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard, then, has no hard feelings toward you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Honestly, Mr. Roberts, I don&rsquo;t know whether she is keeping me here  because she suspects me, or because she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Mr. Stannard leave you anything in his will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rose-pink cheeks flushed deeper, as Natalie replied, &ldquo;Yes, he did. You probably  know that already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t. Was it a worthwhile amount?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  my point of view, yes. It was seventy thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!  Decidedly worthwhile, from almost anybody&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what you&rsquo;re thinking,&rdquo; cried Natalie as he paused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an added reason  for suspecting me of killing him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be construed so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I didn&rsquo;t! I was pretty mad, when he made that horrid etching from my Goldenrod  picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you smudged the wax impression so he couldn&rsquo;t use it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not! I would willingly have done so, if I&rsquo;d thought of it, but I didn&rsquo;t do  it, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  killed him, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that lets out Mr. Truxton, or a burglar of any sort. It leaves only Mrs.  Stannard. Mightn&rsquo;t she have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  jealous woman might do anything. But Joyce wasn&rsquo;t especially jealous of me,&mdash;no  more than of anybody Mr. Stannard might be attracted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to whom else was he attracted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  just now,&mdash;that I know of. You see, Mr. Roberts, I was just about to leave this  house, because Mr. Stannard was too devoted in his attentions to me. I tell you  this frankly, because I want you to understand the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I want to understand it. Tell me more of this matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Stannard had told me several times of his affection for me and had told me  he would remember me in his will, and, not more than a week ago, he told me of Joyce&rsquo;s  caring for Mr. Courtenay, though how he discovered that, I don&rsquo;t know, for  Joyce never showed it. She was good as gold. Well, Mr. Stannard didn&rsquo;t say so  in so many words, but he implied that if he and Joyce&mdash;separated&mdash;and it could be  arranged,&mdash;and she&mdash;you know,&mdash;married Mr. Courtenay,&mdash;would I marry him. And I was  so mad, I flew into a rage, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  scratched up your picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that wax plate hadn&rsquo;t been drawn then. It was afterward that he drew that, and  then I was madder than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in the heat of your passionate rage, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t! I tell you, whoever killed Eric Stannard, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what did he mean, when, in his dying moment, he said, &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce!&rsquo;  Tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you,&rdquo; and the girl lowered her voice and looked very serious. &ldquo;I know  exactly what he meant, and Joyce Stannard knows too. He meant,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll think I  imagine this, but it&rsquo;s true; he meant that it was Natalie and not Joyce, whom  he loved, and whom he was trying to beckon to at that moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was impossible to doubt the honesty of the speaker. The great earnest eyes were  filled with mingled pain and shame, but the girl meant what she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You see, he had said to me, several times, &lsquo;Natalie,  not Joyce,&rsquo; by way of a teasing bit of love-making. Eric was not a bad man, it  was only that he could not keep from making love to any woman he might chance  to be with. And when I would reprimand him and bid him go to his wife, he would  laugh and say &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce,&rsquo; till it became a sort of by-word with him.  And I know that&rsquo;s what he meant that night, when he was hurt,&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know he  was dying,&mdash;and he called to me in a half-conscious plea to come to his  assistance. Also, he could see me more plainly. Joyce was rather behind him,  and his clouding brain spoke out as he saw me, and called for me. As a matter  of fact, that speech, though made so much of, means nothing at all. He wasn&rsquo;t  entirely conscious and he spoke as one in a dream. But he did not mean that I  had stabbed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he know who stabbed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I tell that? But if he had known that I did it, or had thought that I did  it, he would never have said so, had he been aware of what he was saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, if you had been guilty, he would have shielded you, rather than accused  you with his last breath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or Joyce either. Or any woman. Eric Stannard would never accuse a woman of  wrongdoing. His speech meant anything rather than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon, this puts a very different light on your connection with the affair.  Why didn&rsquo;t you tell this before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you understand, Mr. Roberts? I have no love for Eric Stannard, I never had any.  His attentions annoyed me, his insistence on painting me as he wished to, also  annoyed me. I would have left him long ago, but for Barry. Also, I am fond of  Joyce. She has been most kind to me, and never jealous of me until lately. Now,  I hated to announce that those dying words meant that Mr. Stannard put me ahead  of his wife in his affection, especially as it didn&rsquo;t altogether mean that, it  was merest chance that he saw me and not her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he did see her, for he said &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know,&rdquo; and the little foot tapped the rug, impatiently,&mdash;&ldquo;but, I mean, he saw  me, and he was for the moment interested in me, and he was in pain, or a sort  of stupor, or&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what his sensations were, I&rsquo;m sure,&mdash;but I want  to show you that he spoke at random, and it didn&rsquo;t mean as much as it seems to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  had grown excited, her lip trembled, and her voice was unsteady. Either she was  desperately anxious to make the truth clear, or she was making up a  preposterous story.</p>
  <p>If  she were guilty, this was a great scheme to divert the suspicion so emphasised  by the victim&rsquo;s statement, and if she were innocent, the story she told might  well be true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me follow this up,&rdquo; said Bobsy, looking at her closely. &ldquo;Then Mr. Stannard was  so in love with you that he called on you in a desperate moment, rather than on  his wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he didn&rsquo;t know it was a desperate moment. I don&rsquo;t believe that man was  conscious at all. The stab wound was practically fatal at once. What he said  and did after it, was involuntary. Don&rsquo;t you know what I mean? He was only half  alive physically and almost not at all alive in his mind&mdash;his brain. Couldn&rsquo;t  that be true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. In fact, I think it must have been&mdash;and yet, no, it seems to me it  would be logical for him to tell, even without a clear consciousness, who his  assailant was. Remember Blake asked him outright. &lsquo;Who did this?&rsquo; and he said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; but you didn&rsquo;t see him, and I did. He was not looking at Blake, he didn&rsquo;t  even hear him. He was in a dazed state, and, seeing both Joyce and myself,&mdash;he  must have seen us both,&mdash;his sub-consciousness called out for me. I am not vain  of this preference, I wish it had all been otherwise, but I insist that  explains his words, and&mdash;Joyce knows it, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know she does? Have you talked with her on this subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. We have discussed it over and over. Mrs. Faulkner and Joyce and Barry and  I have gone over every bit of it a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it possible? What does each of the four think? Since you deny the deed, you can  tell what is the consensus of opinion in the household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I can&rsquo;t do. You see, we all hesitate to say anything that will seem  to accuse either of us. Mrs. Faulkner, I can see plainly, is uncertain whether  to suspect Joyce or me. She is convinced, of course, that it must have been one  of us, but she pretends to think it was a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is fond of you both?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she adores Joyce, and she is most friendly to me. I&rsquo;ve only known her since I&rsquo;ve  been here, but she seems to believe in me, somehow. She understands perfectly,  that Mr. Stannard meant just what I say he did, by those words. She knows how  he acted toward me, and how Joyce felt about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she suspects Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t say so. She sticks to the safe theory of an intruder. You can&rsquo;t blame  her. None of us can suspect Joyce. It&rsquo;s too absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Barry Stannard, what does he think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he vows it was an intruder. He&rsquo;s thought up a dozen ways for him to get in and  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  equally impossible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. Unless,&mdash;I hate to say it,&mdash;but mightn&rsquo;t Blake have let him out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless it was somebody known to the household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  said Natalie Vernon. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>VIII<br>
    The Emeralds</b></h2>
  <p>YOU  mean?&rdquo; prompted Bobsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing. But,&mdash;just supposing, you know. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to mention Mr.  Truxton or Mr. Wadsworth, but they were both here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd!  Why, Mr. Wadsworth was with Mrs. Faulkner in the Drawing Room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know. But he came down and went out the door alone, leaving her up there.  Now, if he had wanted to, and if he had fixed it up with Blake, couldn&rsquo;t he  have gone into the studio, stolen the jewels and killed Eric, and then turned  off the light and fled, Blake letting him out the front door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why would Mr. Wadsworth do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  would anybody? I&rsquo;m only showing you that there <i>are</i> theories that don&rsquo;t include me or Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not tenable theories. Mr. Wadsworth, I&rsquo;ve been told, was having a&mdash;a romantic t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te  with Mrs. Faulkner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was asking her, for the &lsquo;steenth time, to marry him. But she turned him down  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  even if she did, probably he didn&rsquo;t give up all hope. And a man, just from a  session of that sort, isn&rsquo;t going to commit a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Wadsworth. But why not consider Mr. Truxton? He&rsquo;s  a jewel sharp, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have considered him. But he and his wife went home earlier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could have come back,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he didn&rsquo;t. Miss Vernon, we&rsquo;ve gone into all these matters very thoroughly. What  do you suppose the Police have been doing? There isn&rsquo;t a possible theory we&rsquo;ve  overlooked, and it all comes back to the simple facts of the evidence that  incriminate either Mrs. Stannard or yourself. I see no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t  tell you this frankly. If you care to say anything further in your own defence,  I&rsquo;d be glad to hear it. Naturally, you hate to accuse Mrs. Stannard, but it  rests between you two, and it looks as if an arrest would be made soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  was drawing on his imagination a little, but he was bound to startle some  information out of this provoking beauty.</p>
  <p>And  Natalie was startled. Her face paled as she took in the significance of Roberts&rsquo;  words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t arrest me, will they?&rdquo; she whispered in a scared little voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how they can,&rdquo; and Bobsy looked at the girl, wondering. That child,  that little, tender bit of femininity&mdash;surely she could never have lifted her  hand against a man&rsquo;s life! Even had she wished to, she seemed physically  incapable of striking the blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arrest  you! Not much they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Barry Stannard strode into the room.</p>
  <p>Natalie  turned to him with a little sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t let them, will you, Barry?&rdquo; she said, as his arm slipped round her  trembling shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say not! Are you frightening her, Mr. Roberts? You know you&rsquo;ve no  authority for all this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my duty to learn all I can. If Miss Vernon is innocent, then Mrs. Stannard is  guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a choice between the two, it is far more likely to be Mrs. Stannard. But I do  not accuse her. I only insist on the impossibility of this child&rsquo;s being a  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Course  I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Natalie smiled at the perplexed Roberts. &ldquo;And if, to clear  myself, I must tell all I know, then I&rsquo;ll tell you that Mrs. Stannard has those  emeralds in her possession now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has! How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  passed her room this morning. The door was ajar, and I was about to enter, when  I saw her, at her dressing-table, looking over the case of emeralds. I  recognised it at once. I&rsquo;ve often seen them. I didn&rsquo;t like to intrude, then, so  I went on. I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, unless it was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is necessary. Has she had them all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  ask her,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;I believe Joyce can explain it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  sent for Mrs. Stannard, and she came, Mrs. Faulkner accompanying her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found these on my dressing-table this morning,&rdquo; Joyce said, simply, holding out  the case of emeralds to the view of all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Found  them! Where did they come from?&rdquo; asked Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and then, seeing the dark looks on the Detective&rsquo;s face, Joyce  exclaimed, &ldquo;You tell about it, Beatrice. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is the story,&rdquo; said Mrs. Faulkner. &ldquo;About an hour ago, Mrs. Stannard sent for  me to come to her room. I went, and she showed me the case of gems, saying she  had found it on her dressing-table when she awoke this morning. It was not  there when she retired last night. Further than that, she knows nothing about  it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, the jewels appeared there mysteriously?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She cannot account for it, herself. We have been talking it over, and it seems  to me the only explanation is that one of the servants took them, and then  decided to return them. Of course it would be practically impossible for a  servant to sell or dispose of them after the publicity that has been given to  the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. But why a servant? Why not a guest&mdash;or a member of the household,&mdash;or&mdash;or  Mrs. Stannard, herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo;  exclaimed Joyce. &ldquo;Why I&rsquo;ve just found them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you have them all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not! How dare you imply such a thing? This morning they were in my room,  last night they were not there. They were brought there during the night. It is  for you to find out who brought them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the door of your bedroom locked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It is not our habit to lock our doors,&mdash;any of us. The outer doors and windows  are securely fastened, and we have no reason to distrust any of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were the gems this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my dressing-table, in my dressing-room, adjoining my sleeping room.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  do you think put them there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  stole them the night my husband was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who do you think that was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever  killed him, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Faulkner, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Perhaps the thief and the murderer  were not the same person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be so,&rdquo; agreed Bobsy. &ldquo;Have you any theory or suspicion based on the return  of the jewels, Mrs. Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  except a general idea that the emeralds might have been stolen and returned by  a servant, and the murder committed by an intruder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not assume that the intruder also took the jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  because it would be difficult for him to get into the house and return them to  Mrs. Stannard. I can see no explanation of that act save that a servant did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  an outsider with the connivance of one of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that might be,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Faulkner. &ldquo;The mere placing of the case in Mrs.  Stannard&rsquo;s dressing-room would not be difficult. The doors all over the house  are open or unlocked at night, and a servant could easily slip in and out of  the room unheard.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard no unusual sound in the night, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo;  said Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry to disagree with the construction you put upon this incident, Mrs.  Faulkner,&rdquo; and Bobsy turned to her as to the principal spokesman, &ldquo;but to my  mind it strengthens the case against Mrs. Stannard. It seems more than likely  that she had the emeralds all the time, or knew where they were. She kept them  hidden, because she thought the letter written by her husband, tacitly gave the  gems to Miss Vernon. Then when Miss Vernon saw her, looking at the jewels, Mrs.  Stannard thought better to face the music and own up that she had them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  I didn&rsquo;t let her know that I saw her!&rdquo; exclaimed Natalie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she saw you in a mirror, or heard you. Doubtless she knew in some way that you  had seen her looking at the jewels, and concluded to tell the story that  accounted for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  Stannard looked at the speaker, and her face blanched. With a desperate cry of  distress, she turned and swiftly left the room. Roberts kept a wary eye on her  retreating figure, and as she went upstairs, he made no attempt to recall or to  follow her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has practically condemned herself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The reappearance of the emeralds  seems to settle it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Beatrice Faulkner. &ldquo;Why do you condemn her because of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at it squarely, Mrs. Faulkner. Assume for a moment my theory is right. Then,  Mrs. Stannard, being guilty, and wishing to throw suspicion on Miss Vernon,  claims that the jewels were put in her room surreptitiously during the night.  She is sure Miss Vernon will be suspected of having had the jewels, and,  frightened, restored them secretly. This will militate against Miss Vernon, and  imply her greater guilt also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what an idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Natalie. &ldquo;As if I ever had the emeralds!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  letter said you knew where they were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  letter was not written to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  whom then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no idea. But not to me. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m engaged to Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  weren&rsquo;t engaged to the son while the father was alive,&rdquo; probed Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.  But only because his father wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. I&rsquo;m going to look after Joyce,&rdquo;  and without a backward glance, Natalie ran from the room, and up the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; began Roberts, looking at Mrs. Faulkner and Barry Stannard, &ldquo;you two are  the only ones I can talk to frankly. Those two ladies suspected by the police  have to be handled carefully. You are both material witnesses, and as such are  bound to tell me truthfully all you can of anything bearing on the case. Now, however  painful it may be for you, Mr. Stannard, I must tell you that it is rapidly  coming to a show-down between the two suspects, and the probability is, it  seems to me, that the burden of evidence rests more strongly on the wife than  on the model. The direct evidence is perhaps evenly balanced, but it seems to  the police that the motive is greater and the opportunity easier for Mrs.  Stannard than for Miss Vernon. The wife, let us say, had reason for jealousy,  and had reason for wishing to be free of her uncongenial husband. The little  model, while irritated at her employer&rsquo;s attentions, was in love with another  man, and could easily get away from the artist without resorting to crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right about Natalie,&rdquo; exclaimed Barry, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s unthinkable that Joyce should  go so far as to kill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know all the provocation she may have had,&rdquo; said Roberts. &ldquo;A jealous  wife, or an unloving wife goes through many hard hours before she reaches the  point of desperation, but she sometimes gets there, and then the climax comes.  At any rate, if Miss Vernon isn&rsquo;t guilty, Mrs. Stannard is. You can&rsquo;t find two  women hovering over a dying man, and acquit them both. So it&rsquo;s one or the  other, and I incline toward the suspicion of the older woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you explain the various clues pointing to Natalie?&rdquo; asked Beatrice  Faulkner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  take them one by one. First, that note found on the man&rsquo;s desk. Even if that  were written to Miss Vernon, it needn&rsquo;t condemn her. Even if she had been in  love with the artist, it is no evidence whatever that she killed him. And the  whole tone of the note is against its being meant for her. It is unexplained so  far, but I can&rsquo;t look on it as evidence against the model.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Faulkner. &ldquo;That letter may well have been to some  other woman interested in Eric Stannard, and she may have had the emeralds,  and, through connivance with a servant, returned them to Joyce last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, Mrs. Faulkner, that isn&rsquo;t right. I don&rsquo;t understand the emerald business  altogether, but I thoroughly believe that Mrs. Stannard has had them in her  keeping all the time. Now, next, we have the evidence of the dying man&rsquo;s  exclamation. That, I think, is perfectly explained by Miss Vernon&rsquo;s assertion  that he meant he loved her and not his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is,&rdquo; declared Barry. &ldquo;I know my father was madly in love with Miss  Vernon, and though he was fond of his wife, it was not the first time he had  been interested in the pretty face of another woman. I want to say right here,  that I revere and respect my father&rsquo;s memory, but I cannot deny his faults. And  he was far too careless of his wife&rsquo;s feelings in these matters. My mother died  many years ago, and for a long time my father led a butterfly existence,  outside of his art, yes, and in it, too. Then when he married a second time he  did not settle down to the generally accepted model of a married man, but  continued to admire pretty women wherever he met them. Now, it is more than  likely that in his dying moments his brain half dazed, and seeing the two  before him, he protested his love for the model he admired and put her ahead of  his wife. I do not defend my father&rsquo;s speech but to me it is explained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be so,&rdquo; said Roberts. &ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s another point. Mrs. Stannard declares she  heard her husband talking to another woman or at least to somebody, in his  studio, as she herself stood in the Billiard Room, near the connecting door.  Shall we say this is an invented story of hers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;what were the words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the effect that he was not willing to leave his wife for her, and that as a  consolation she could have the emeralds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Practically  what was in the note,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Faulkner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo;  returned Roberts. &ldquo;Now was Miss Vernon there and were these words addressed to  her? this question being quite apart from consideration of her as the criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  so, then the letter was to her,&rdquo; said Beatrice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; maintained Barry. &ldquo;My father admired Natalie,&mdash;made love to her, we&rsquo;ll  say, but he never went so far as to offer her jewels, nor did she want him to  marry her, as the overheard conversation implies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  this be the way of it?&rdquo; said Beatrice. &ldquo;Suppose Mr. Stannard was even then  writing that note&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it was found in his desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  suppose he was thinking it over, and muttered to himself the actual wording of  it. Mrs. Stannard says she heard no other voice, so may he not have been alone  in the studio at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts turned this over in his mind. &ldquo;It is a possibility,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;And  then, let us say, after hearing those words, Mrs. Stannard entered the room,  and confronted him, and perhaps there was a quarrel and in a moment of insane  rage, Mrs. Stannard caught up the etching needle and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t at all like her,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;but I can only say it is more easily to be  conceived of in her case than in Natalie&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t want to admit the  possibility of Joyce being the criminal, but I can believe it, before I can  imagine Natalie doing such a thing. And as you say, Joyce had motive, and  Natalie had none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t subscribe entirely to that, Mr. Stannard. Miss Vernon inherits a goodly  sum, and too, she may have been incensed at the manner of the artist toward her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Natalie herself, suddenly reappearing. &ldquo;On the contrary, I had  persuaded Mr. Stannard, that very day, not to ask me to pose for him, except as  a fully draped model. He had apologised for his previous insistence, and I  looked for no more trouble on that score. I was trying to get up courage to ask  him to let Barry be engaged to me, but I hadn&rsquo;t accomplished that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Mrs. Stannard had had any angry words with her husband just before he was  attacked, could you have overheard them?&rdquo; asked Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. Not unless they had spoken very loudly. The door to the Terrace  was closed, or almost closed. And I was not thinking about what might be going  on in the house. Unless there had been an especial disturbance, I should not  have noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you heard that gasping cry for help through the closed door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But that was not a faint gasp, it was a penetrating sort of a cry. An attempted  scream, I should describe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Roberts  looked at her closely. Was she innocent or was she an infant Machiavelli?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a difficult situation,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh. &ldquo;We have but two  eye-witnesses. Each naturally accuses the other and denies her own guilt. One  speaks truth and one falsehood. How can we distinguish which one tells the  truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say eye-witnesses,&rdquo; objected Natalie. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the crime committed. If I  think Joyce did it, it&rsquo;s only because I went in and found her there and nobody  else about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo;  and Bobsy Roberts looked her straight in the face, &ldquo;suppose Eric Stannard held  in his hand your picture,&mdash;that etching, you know, and suppose he was, in a way,  talking to it. Or, say, he wasn&rsquo;t talking to it, but what he did say, and what  his wife overheard, was said while he held your picture, and she thought he  referred to you. Then she, in a jealous fury, resented the idea of his giving  you the emeralds, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t want the emeralds,&rdquo; said Natalie, coldly, &ldquo;and I certainly didn&rsquo;t want  Eric to marry me, but even granting your premises right, it takes suspicion of  the murder from me, and places it on Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does,&rdquo; agreed Barry, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s where it belongs, if on either of you two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be so,&rdquo; said Beatrice Faulkner, &ldquo;for if Natalie had known where the  emeralds were, and if that letter was written to her, and gave her the  gems,&mdash;for it really did give them to the one it was written to,&mdash;then she would  have kept them and not have given them back to Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove, that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Roberts. &ldquo;Whatever woman that letter was meant for,  is the real owner of the jewels this minute, according to Eric Stannard&rsquo;s wish,  and if she had them she would be extremely unlikely to give them up  unnecessarily. But how, then, explain their return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t a return,&rdquo; said Beatrice. &ldquo;Joyce had them herself all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe she had,&rdquo; said Roberts. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>IX<br>
    One or the Other</b></h2>
  <p>BOBSY  ROBERTS was at his wits&rsquo; end. He pondered long and deeply but he could seem to  see nothing to do but ponder. There was no trail to follow, no clue to track  down, and no new suspect to consider.</p>
  <p>He  sat by the hour in the studio, as if he could, by staring about him wring the  secret from the four walls that enclosed the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walls  have ears,&rdquo; he said to himself, whimsically, &ldquo;now if they only had eyes and a  tongue, they might tell me what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  studio furnishings included several small tables and escritoires which had  drawers and pigeonholes stuffed with old letters and papers. Like most artists  Eric Stannard was of careless habits regarding his belongings. Roberts  patiently and laboriously went over these papers, and found little of interest.  Old bills, old notes of appointment with patrons, old social invitations and  such matters made up the bulk of the findings.</p>
  <p>But  he came across a small parcel, neatly tied with fine string and looking  unmistakably like a jeweller&rsquo;s box. Bobsy opened it, and found a small gold  heart-shaped locket. With it was a card bearing the words &ldquo;For my Goldenheart.  From Eric.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was quite evidently a gift for the one to whom the letter was written, but it  had never been presented. It was easily seen that the parcel had been opened,  the card put in, and the string retied in the same punctilious fashion that the  jeweller had tied it. The paper wrapping was uncrumpled, but it was a little  faded by time, and dusty in the creases.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bought  it for her but never gave it to her,&rdquo; Bobsy surmised. &ldquo;Surely I can make  something out of this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  nothing seemed definite. A provokingly blank paper, without address of any  sort, can&rsquo;t be indicative of much. The box bore the jeweller&rsquo;s name, and  possibly a visit to the firm might tell when the trinket was bought, which  might mean some help, or, more likely, none.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  showed it to Joyce Stannard, but she took little interest in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must have been bought before I married Mr. Stannard,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know by the box. That sort of a box was used by that firm the year before I was  married. In all probability Mr. Stannard did buy it for a lady, and for some  reason or other didn&rsquo;t present it. It&rsquo;s of no great value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  agreed Bobsy, &ldquo;except as it proves that his interest in &lsquo;Goldenheart&rsquo; has  lasted for some time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Goldenheart can&rsquo;t be Miss Vernon,&rdquo; said Joyce, wearily. &ldquo;It seems to me, Mr.  Roberts, that you get nowhere. You make so much of little things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  we can&rsquo;t get any big piece of evidence. You know yourself, Mrs. Stannard, that  our principal clue is the finding of you and Miss Vernon in a situation which <i>might</i> mean the guilt of either of you,  and <i>must</i> mean the guilt of one of  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts, I want to say to you very frankly that I wish to be cleared of  suspicion. I did not kill my husband. I can&rsquo;t quite believe Miss Vernon did,  but at any rate I want the mystery cleared up. I don&rsquo;t know how to set about it  myself, and if you don&rsquo;t either, I want to employ some one else. This is, no  disparagement of your powers, but if you know of any&mdash;more experienced Detective&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are plenty of more experienced detectives, Mrs. Stannard, but I am anxious to  succeed in this quest myself. Will you not give me a longer time, and if at the  end of, say, another week, I have made little or no progress, call on whomever  you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. But I must be freed myself. I am willing to spend a fortune, if need be,  but I cannot live under this cloud of suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us work together then. Tell me anything I ask, and you may be able to give me  some help. First, can you state positively that no person came in through the  Billiard Room and went on to the studio while you were in the Billiard Room,  just before the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  of course, nobody passed through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Billiard Room was lighted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Not brilliantly, but a few lights were on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Courtenay had just left you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  short time before, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&mdash;now  think carefully,&mdash;could you not have been sitting with your back to the door, or&mdash;perhaps,  had you your face hidden in your hands, or for any such reason, could some one  have passed you without your knowing it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  hesitated a moment, and then she said, &ldquo;No; positively not. I was sitting on  one of the side seats, and I may have had my eyes closed, for I was thinking  deeply, but if any one had passed through the room I should have heard  footsteps, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the soft, thick rug?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  of the floor is bare, and my hearing is very acute. Yes, Mr. Roberts, I must  have heard the intruder, if one came in that way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think one did, but there is no other way for any one to have entered the  studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not by coming in the Terrace door, and passing Natalie instead of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  probability is less. The Terrace door was closed, and, too, Miss Vernon sat  back on the Terrace, and must have seen any one passing in front of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  suppose she did see him, and chooses to deny it for his sake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  looked at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mean Barry Stannard.  There is room for thought in that direction. He had reason to be angry at his  father, first because of his refusal to let Barry marry the girl, and also,  because of Eric Stannard&rsquo;s annoyance of the little model The father out of the  way, the son steps into a fortune and wins his bride beside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Barry never did it! I confess I&rsquo;ve thought of it as a theory, but I can&rsquo;t  believe it of Barry,&mdash;I simply can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard, somebody killed your husband. If not a common malefactor, who was  bent on robbery, then it must have been one of Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s intimates. If  that is so, Barry Stannard is no more above suspicion than Miss Vernon or  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true enough. Well, go ahead, Mr. Roberts. Do all you can, but do get somewhere.  You reason around in a circle, always coming back to the proposition that it  must have been either Miss Vernon or myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is where I stand at present,&rdquo; said Bobsy, very gravely, &ldquo;but I shall try to get  some new light on it all,&mdash;and soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  looked after him sadly as he took leave and went away, and as soon as he was  gone she threw herself on a couch and cried piteously.</p>
  <p>The  visit to the jeweller merely corroborated what Joyce had said that the gold  heart was bought shortly before her marriage to Eric. The date was looked up  and the purchase verified. So it seemed to tell nothing save that it was meant  for a gift but never given. Probably, thought Roberts, it was owing to Eric&rsquo;s  marriage that he concluded not to give a keepsake to a woman other than his  bride. But, after all, mightn&rsquo;t Goldenheart be Joyce herself? No, for the  letter found in the desk denied that. But that letter might have been written a  long time ago. Not likely, for it stated that Joyce would not be unwilling to  consider separation from her husband. That of course, pointed to the fact that  Joyce loved another, doubtless Courtenay, but more than all it pointed to  Natalie as Goldenheart. Well, it was not inconceivable that Eric Stannard, the  gay Lothario, had called more than one woman Goldenheart. Yet had it been  Natalie, would he not have said Goldenrod, especially as he had painted her in  that guise?</p>
  <p>And  so, as usual, Bobsy Roberts puzzled round in circles and came back to the old  idea that it must be one of those two women, and could not by any possibility  be any one else.</p>
  <p>And  now, to prove it. He planned to delve deeply into the recent past of the two,  and also into Eric&rsquo;s behaviour of late, and he felt he must get some hint or  some clue to go upon.</p>
  <p>Then,  too, there were the missing jewels. The emeralds had been returned to  Joyce,&mdash;that is, she said they had been returned. But the rest of the collection  was still unfound. Bobsy didn&rsquo;t think they had been stolen or lost, but merely  that Eric had hidden them so securely that they were un-findable. A queer  procedure that. It would seem that he would have left some record of their  hiding place. But he was a queer man,&mdash;careless in every way. And the jewels  might be in a bank or Safe Deposit, or might be in some desk or drawer in the  house. The whole business was unsatisfactory, nothing tangible to work on. An out  and out robbery, now, one might track down. But a jewel disappearance that  might be all right and proper, was an aggravating proposition.</p>
  <p>So  Bobsy Roberts was decidedly disgruntled and not a little chagrined. He had  welcomed this great case as an opportunity to show his powers of real detective  work. But it was not so easy as he had thought it. It was all very well to say  the criminal must be one of two people and quite another thing to bring any  real proof, or even evidence, aside from the finding of them present at the  scene of the crime.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  tried to balance up the points against each.</p>
  <p>Motive?  About equal, for Joyce didn&rsquo;t love her husband, and Natalie was angry at his  intentions to her. Inheritance? Equal again, for the seventy thousand dollars  that was Natalie&rsquo;s bequest was quite as desirable a fortune for her, as the  larger portion that Joyce received was for her. Moreover, Natalie would  doubtless marry the son and have a fortune as great as Joyce&rsquo;s. Opportunity?  Certainly equal. Both women were alone, within a few steps of the victim,  unobserved of anybody, and so familiar with the room and furnishings that they  could extinguish the light and still find the way around quietly.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  visualised the scene. Whichever one did it, after striking the blow, she had to  cross the room to the electric light switch by the front hall door, turn it off  and then go back again, doubtless meaning to leave the room as she had entered  it. But before she had left the room she heard sounds from the wounded man, and  paused,&mdash;or perhaps she heard the other woman coming in in the darkness, and  paused in sheer fright and uncertainty. Then came the sudden, blinding  illumination as Blake snapped on the key, and then&mdash;discovery by Blake and Mrs.  Faulkner both. No escape was possible then. She had to stay and face the issue.  Now, which of the two acted the part of guilt? Though not there at the time,  Bobsy had had the story repeated by all who were there, and knew it by heart.  Natalie had cowered in terror, Joyce had nearly fainted. Surely there was no  choice between these as evidence of guilt! Either woman&rsquo;s action was quite  compatible with a criminal&rsquo;s sudden action at being discovered, or an innocent  woman&rsquo;s horror at the scene before her.</p>
  <p>But  one had stabbed and one was overcome at the sight. And Bobsy vowed he&rsquo;d find  out which was which before his week was up.</p>
  <p>Returning  to The Folly, he asked permission to spend some time in Eric&rsquo;s rooms on the  second floor. Here he studied his problem afresh. The bedroom, dressing-room  and den were all as the dead man had left them. Here again were the untidy  cupboards and drawers, for servants had always been forbidden by Eric himself  to put his personal belongings in order, and since his death the police had  stipulated the same. </p>
  <p>But  nothing turned up. Sketches, photographs, old letters, all were scanned and  perused without throwing one gleam of light on the great question.</p>
  <p>Slowly  Bobsy walked down stairs, after his fruitless quest. Slowly he went down the  great staircase, admiring every inch of the way. He had made rather a study of  staircases and this splendid specimen, with its big, square landings interested  him greatly. The carved wainscoting, the beautiful newels and balusters were  things of beauty and were fully appreciated by the detective. He reached the  lower hall and stood thinking of Blake&rsquo;s experience. There the footman had  stood, listening at the studio door, when Mrs. Faulkner came down and saw him.  Then, in less than a minute they had both entered the studio. No, there was not  time for any other intruder to have been in there and to have got away, in the  dark, with those two women standing by the dying man. It was a physical  impossibility. Now, once again, which?</p>
  <p>Joyce  passed him as he stood in the hall. Then she turned back and, after a moment&rsquo;s  hesitation, she spoke to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts, I&rsquo;ve had a strange letter. I want to ask advice about it. Will you  help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  any way I can, Mrs. Stannard. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in the studio. I&rsquo;ll speak to you first about it. I was looking for Barry, to  ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  went into the great room, the room about which hung the veil of mystery, and  sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is the letter,&rdquo; said Joyce, handing it to him. &ldquo;I wish you would read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  took the letter curiously. What would he learn?</p>
  <p>It  was on mediocre paper, and written in a fairly good, though not scholarly  looking penmanship.</p>
  <p>It  ran:</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Stannard:</p>
  <p>Dear  Madam: Before writing what I am about to reveal, let me assure you that I am in  no sense a professional medium or clairvoyant. I am a woman of quiet life and  simple habits, but I am a psychic, and in a trance state I have revelations or  visions that are invariably truly prophetic or as truly reminiscent. I cannot  be reached by the general public, but when a case appeals to me, I communicate with  those interested and if they want to see me, I go to them. If not, there is no  harm done. So, if you are anxious to learn who is responsible for the death of  your late husband, I shall be glad to give you the benefit of my science and  power. If not, simply disregard this letter.</p>
  <p>Very  truly yours,<br>
    ORIENTA, </p>
  <p>The  address was given, and the whole epistle showed an honest and straightforward  air, quite different from the usual clairvoyant&rsquo;s circular letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on,&rdquo; said Bobsy, handing it back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you know? I&rsquo;ve read up on this sort of thing and while there is lots of  fraud practised on a gullible public, it&rsquo;s always done by a cheap grade of  charlatan, whose trickery is discernible at a glance. This letter is from a refined,  honest woman, and I&rsquo;ve a notion to see what she&rsquo;ll say. It can do no harm, even  if it does no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, Mrs. Stannard, if you choose to look into this matter I have nothing to  say, but you asked me for advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; and Joyce shook her head, &ldquo;but if you don&rsquo;t advise me the way I want  you to, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  somebody else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I believe I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do.  I really think if you confer with Barry Stannard or with Mrs. Faulkner, they  would give you advice both sound and disinterested. They&rsquo;d probably tell you to  let it alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to ask them, anyway. I won&rsquo;t ask Natalie, for I don&rsquo;t think she knows  anything about it. Why, Mr. Roberts, if we could just get a clue to the  mystery, it might be of incalculable help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but you can&rsquo;t get a clue from a fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe she is a fraud, but even so, I might learn something from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you do, I hope you will give me the benefit of the information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  laid the matter before Barry and Beatrice. Natalie was present also, and Joyce  was surprised to find that the girl was well versed in the whole subject of  psychics and occult lore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know an awful lot about it, Joyce,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve read some of the  best authorities, and sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought I was a little bit psychic myself.  I&rsquo;d like to see this Orienta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t seem right,&rdquo; objected Mrs. Faulkner. &ldquo;What do you suppose she does? Go  into trances?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  of course,&rdquo; said Natalie. &ldquo;And then she talks and tells things and when she  comes to again, she doesn&rsquo;t know what she has said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is, Mrs. Faulkner. I mean, it&rsquo;s likely to be. Why, if she could tell us  who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  we want her to?&rdquo; said Barry, very soberly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better to leave the whole  thing a mystery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Joyce, decidedly. &ldquo;I want to find out the truth, if there&rsquo;s any way to do  it. I don&rsquo;t think much of detectives, at least, not Mr. Roberts. Oh, he&rsquo;s a  nice man,&mdash;I like him personally. But he doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let&rsquo;s have Orienta come here,&rdquo; suggested Natalie. &ldquo;And we can see how we like  her, and if we don&rsquo;t want her to, she needn&rsquo;t try her powers in our cause.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police might object,&rdquo; said Mrs. Faulkner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; rejoined Barry. &ldquo;This is a private matter. We&rsquo;re at liberty to do a thing of  that sort, if we want to. But I don&rsquo;t approve of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to write to her, anyway,&rdquo; Joyce declared. &ldquo;I want to see what she  proposes to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  do,&rdquo; urged Natalie. &ldquo;And ask her to come here as soon as she can arrange to.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>X<br>
    Orienta</b></h2>
  <p>I WISH  you&rsquo;d use your influence with Joyce, and urge her not to have this poppycock  business go on.&rdquo; Barry looked troubled, and his round, good-natured face was  unsmiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have tried,&rdquo; returned Beatrice Faulkner, &ldquo;but she is determined. And, really,  it can&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might turn suspicion in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,  what are you afraid of? Do you fear any revelation she may make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  oh, no,&mdash;not that. But if&mdash;well, supposing she should declare positively that it  was Natalie or Joyce,&mdash;either of them, don&rsquo;t you see it couldn&rsquo;t help  influencing the police? I want the whole thing hushed up. Father is gone, it  can&rsquo;t do him any good to find out who killed him, and it may make trouble for  an innocent person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  talk to Joyce again, but I doubt if I can change her determination to ask this  Orienta here. Absurd name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and an absurd performance all round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do my best. And, Barry, I&rsquo;m thinking of leaving here to-morrow; I&rsquo;ve staid  longer than I intended, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t go away. Why, you&rsquo;re a kind of a&mdash;how shall I express it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  go-between?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  not in the usually accepted sense of that term, but you are that, in a nice  way. You can tell Joyce what I can&rsquo;t tell her&mdash;at least, what I say to her has  no effect. By the way, Joyce wants to go away, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  they let her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. But since she is thinking about this Orienta, she&rsquo;s planning to  stay here longer. I don&rsquo;t know what she will do, but don&rsquo;t you see, Beatrice,  if she goes away, even for a short time, Natalie couldn&rsquo;t stay here without a  chaperon? So won&rsquo;t you stay a while longer, until we see how things are going?  You&rsquo;ve been such a trump all through these troubled days,&mdash;why, everybody  depends on you to&mdash;to look after things, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  smiled at the boy,&mdash;for when bothered, Barry looked very boyish,&mdash;and said,  kindly, &ldquo;I will stay another week, then. You see, at first, Joyce was so  nervous and upset, she asked me to look after the housekeeping a bit, but now  her nerves are better, and I think the routine duties of the house help fill up  her time, and are really good for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you women settle those matters between yourselves. But you stay on a while, and  help me and Natalie through. The girl threatens to go away, too; in fact,  everybody wants to get out of this house, and I don&rsquo;t blame them.&rdquo; They were in  the studio and Barry looked with a shudder toward the chair where his father  had met his death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t blame them either,&mdash;and yet, it is a wonderful house. Must it go to  strangers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. It&rsquo;s Joyce&rsquo;s, of course, but she doesn&rsquo;t want to live here. I don&rsquo;t  want to take it off your hands, for Natalie won&rsquo;t live here either. You don&rsquo;t  want it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?  Oh, no. My own life here was a happy one, but the memories of those old days  and the thoughts of this recent tragedy make the place intolerable to me as a  home. But strangers could come in, and start a new life for the old place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t old. And it&rsquo;s going to be hard to sell it, because of&mdash;of the crime story  attached to it. If we could only get matters settled up, and the police off the  case, we could close the house and go away. Joyce would go back to her mother&rsquo;s  for a time, and eventually, of course, she will marry Courtenay. He&rsquo;s a good  chap, and there&rsquo;s not a slur to be cast on him. As long as my father lived,  Eugene never said a word to Joyce that all the world mightn&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only assert it, because I know the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,  you&rsquo;re very young, even younger than your years. Try to realise that I&rsquo;m not  saying a word against Joyce or Mr. Courtenay, either, but&mdash;well, since your  father himself realised how matters stood between them, you ought to see it,  too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know they cared for each other, but I mean, Joyce and Eugene both were too  high-minded to let their caring go very far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;High-mindedness  is apt to break through when people skate on thin ice. But don&rsquo;t misunderstand  me. Keep your faith in all the high ideals you can, both in yourself and  others. What did you think of your father leaving such an enormous sum to  Natalie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was more than I supposed, but father was absurdly generous, and often in  erratic ways. He probably made that bequest one day when he was especially  pleased with her posing, or, more likely, when he himself had worked with  special inspiration and had produced a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. Miss Vernon doesn&rsquo;t seem surprised about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she knew it. He told her a short time ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  the police know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear so. And those are the things that worry me. If they think Natalie killed  my father to get that money, it is a strong point against her. Of course, she  didn&rsquo;t, but all the evidence and clues in this whole business are misleading. I  never saw or heard of such a mass of contradictory and really false  appearances. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d rather hush it all up, and not try to go farther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  comes Natalie now. I&rsquo;ll leave you two alone and I&rsquo;ll go to see what I can do  with Joyce about that clairvoyant matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry  scarcely heard the last words, for the mere sight of Natalie entering the room  was enough to drive every other thought from his mind. Her white house gown was  of soft crepe material, with a draped sash of gold silk, a few shades deeper  than her wonderful hair. Gold-hued slippers and stockings completed the simple  costume, and in it Natalie looked like a princess. With all her dainty grace  and delicate lines, the girl had dignity and poise, and as she walked across  the room Barry thought he had never seen anything so lovely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  angel!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;you gold angel from a Fra Angelico picture! Natalie, my  little angel girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  held out his arms, and the girl went to him, and laid her tiny snowflake of a  hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you stay in this room, Barry? I don&rsquo;t like it in here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we won&rsquo;t stay. Let us go out on the Terrace in the sunlight&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Autumn afternoon sun was yet high enough to take the chill off the crisp air,  and on a wicker couch, covered with a fur rug, they sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  where we sat, the night of&mdash;&rdquo; began Barry, and then stopped, not wanting to stir  up awful memories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; returned Natalie. &ldquo;You left me here,&mdash;where did you go, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Off  with Thor and Woden for a short tramp. You said you were going upstairs, don&rsquo;t  you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But where did you tramp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  around the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a little inquisitor! Well, let me see. We went across this lawn first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see Mr. Courtenay on that stone bench there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think so. No, I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  just wanted to know. Where did you go next? Come, Barry, I&rsquo;ll go with you. Go  over the same path you went that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry  looked at her curiously, and said, &ldquo;Come on, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  started across the lawn, and soon Natalie turned and looked back. &ldquo;Could you  see me from here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at night, no. But I didn&rsquo;t try. I thought you had gone in the house, and I went  straight ahead. The dogs were jumping all over me, and I was thinking of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Barry! After the conversation we had just had, were you thinking of the dogs  instead of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the dogs were bothering me,&mdash;and you weren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Barry hesitated. &ldquo;By Jove. I don&rsquo;t know which way I did go next. Let me see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  waited. &ldquo;Down to the Italian gardens?&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;that  is, I don&rsquo;t think so. Where <i>did</i> I go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry!  You must know where you went. How silly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t silly. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you refuse to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t refuse,&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry!  Do remember. You must!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  a moment&rsquo;s silence, he turned and met her gaze squarely, saying, &ldquo;I have no  recollection. Don&rsquo;t ask me that again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  gave him a pained, despairing look and without a word, turned their footsteps  toward the Italian gardens, the beautiful landscape planned and laid out by a  genius. Down the stone steps they went and paused in the shadow of a clump of  carved box. Then Barry took her in his arms. &ldquo;Dear little girl,&rdquo; he breathed in  her ear, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid. It will all come out right. But we don&rsquo;t want the  truth known. Now, don&rsquo;t give way,&rdquo; as a sob shook Natalie&rsquo;s quivering shoulders.  &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk or think another word about it. Obey me, now, take your mind  right off the subject! Think of something pleasanter,&mdash;think of me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t very well help that,&mdash;when you&rsquo;re so close!&rdquo; and the lovely deep blue eyes  smiled through unshed tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heavenly thing! Natalie, have you any idea how beautiful you are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I am, I am glad, for your sake. I needn&rsquo;t ever pose again, need I, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I guess No! A photograph of you, all bundled up in furs, is the nearest I shall  ever let you come to a portrait! Dear, when will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t marry you! I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what are you doing here? This is no place for a girl who isn&rsquo;t to be my wife!&rdquo;  and Barry caressed with his fingertips the pink cheek which was all of the  flower-face that showed from the collar of his tweed jacket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  oughtn&rsquo;t to be here&mdash;but&mdash;but I love you, Barry, I do&mdash;I do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you do, my blessed infant. Now, as we didn&rsquo;t get along very well with  our marriage settlement for a topic, let&rsquo;s try again. Beatrice wants to go away  from here. Do you want her to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! Don&rsquo;t let her go. I&rsquo;d be lost without her. I want to go, you know, but I  can&rsquo;t, I suppose. Beg her to stay as long as I do,&mdash;won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pleading in the blue eyes was so tender and sweet that Barry kissed them both  before replying. &ldquo;I will, darling. I&rsquo;ll beg anybody in the world for anything  you want, if I have to become a professional mendicant. Now, brace up,  Sweetheart, for I want to talk to you about lots of things, and how can I, if  you burst into tears at every new subject I bring up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  upset to-day, Barry mine. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk. Just wander around the gardens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wander  it is,&rdquo; and Barry started off obediently, still with his arm round her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unhand  me, villain,&rdquo; she said, trying to speak gaily. But it was impossible, and the  scarlet lips trembled into a curve that broke Barry&rsquo;s heart for its sadness. He  gathered her to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart, you are all unstrung. Go to your room for a time, don&rsquo;t you want to? Let  Beatrice look after you,&mdash;she&rsquo;s kindness itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  she is. I&rsquo;ll do that And I&rsquo;ll come back, Barry, a new woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t do that! You&rsquo;d make a fine militant suffragist!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not that. But a sensible, commonplace girl, who can talk without crying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Commonplace  isn&rsquo;t exactly the word I&rsquo;d choose to describe you, you wonder-thing! But run  away and powder your nose, it needs it. Ha, I thought that would stir you up!&rdquo;  as Natalie pouted. &ldquo;Run along, and I&rsquo;ll see you at dinner time. And this evening  we&rsquo;ll have our chat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  that evening Orienta came. Joyce had refused to listen to any one&rsquo;s objections  and had made the appointment with the clairvoyant to come for a preliminary  conference whether she gave them a s&eacute;ance or not.</p>
  <p>Barry  and Natalie refused at first to meet the visitor, but Joyce persuaded them to  see her, so that they might argue intelligently for or against her. Beatrice  consented to be present, for Joyce had begged it as a special favour.</p>
  <p>And  so, when Blake ushered the stranger into the Reception Room she was greeted  pleasantly by all the members of the household.</p>
  <p>Nor  was this perfunctory, for the charm of the guest was manifest from the first.  At her entrance, at the first sound of her low, silvery voice, each hearer was  thrilled as by an unexpected bit of music.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard?&rdquo; she said, as Joyce rose and held out her hand. The long cloak of  deep pansy-coloured satin fell back showing its lining of pale violet, and the  dark Oriental face lighted with responsive cordiality, while she returned the  greetings.</p>
  <p>Selecting  a stately, tall-backed chair, Orienta sank into it, and crossed her dainty feet  on a cushion which Barry offered. Her purple hat was like a turban, but its  soft folds were neither conspicuous nor eccentric She chose to keep her hat on,  and also retained her long cloak, which, thrown back, disclosed her robe of  voluminous folds of dull white silk. Made in Oriental design, it was yet  modishly effective and suited well the type of its wearer.</p>
  <p>Though  not beautiful, the woman was wonderfully charming. In looking at her each  auditor forgot self and others in contemplation of this strange personality.  Each of the four observing her had eyes only for her, and didn&rsquo;t even glance  aside to question the others&rsquo; approval.</p>
  <p>Without  seeming to notice this mute tribute, Orienta began to speak. &ldquo;We will waste no  time in commonplaces,&rdquo; she said, her voice as perfectly modulated as that of a  great actress, &ldquo;they cannot interest us at this time. It is for you to tell me  whether or not you wish to command my services in this matter of mystery. If  so, well,&mdash;if not, I go away, and that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  name she had chosen to adopt was a perfect description of her whole  personality. Her oval face was of olive complexion; her eyes, not black, but  the darkest seal brown; her hair, as it strayed carelessly from the edges of  the confining turban, was brown, in moist tendrils at the temples, as if she  were under some mental excitement.</p>
  <p>It  was evident,&mdash;to the women, at least,&mdash;that the scarlet of her full lips, and the  flush on her cheek bones, was artificial, but it gave the impression of being  frankly so, and not with intent to deceive. It was perfectly applied, at any  rate, and the flash of her ivory white teeth made her smile fascinating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the word,&rdquo; Barry Stannard thought, as it occurred to him, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s fascinating,  that&rsquo;s what she is. Not entirely wholesome, not altogether to be trusted, but  very, <i>very</i> fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a subtle understanding, Orienta perceived that Barry had set his stamp of  approval on her, and turned her attention to the women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  in no way urge or insist upon my suggestions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I only tell you what  I can do, and it is for you to say. For you, I suppose, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Joyce, and her tone was decided. &ldquo;Yes, it is for me to say, and I say I  want you. I want you to tell us anything you can,&mdash;<i>anything</i>&mdash;about the mystery that has come to this house. I want to  know who killed my husband, and I want to know why, and all the details of the  deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Barry protested, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t begin with that, Joyce. Let Madame Orienta tell us  something of less importance first. Let us have a s&eacute;ance or a reading or  whatever the proper term may be, and test her powers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  visitor gave him a slow smile. &ldquo;It is as I am instructed,&rdquo; she said, in a  matter-of-fact, every-day sort of way. &ldquo;But I must inform you before going  further, that my fees are not small. Test my powers in any way you choose, but  I must include the test in my final statement of your indebtedness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay the test bill, and then, Joyce, if you want to go  on with your plans, you can assume the further expense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  we do anything to-night?&rdquo; asked Natalie. She had sat breathless, listening, but  now, with eyes like stars, she eagerly questioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are interested?&rdquo; and Orienta looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so much. But I fear what you will reveal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear  my revelations!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  because I know they will not be true, but you will make us think they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instead  of being annoyed or offended, Orienta looked at her and smiled from beneath her  heavy dark brows. &ldquo;You are psychic, yourself,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Natalie, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>XI<br>
    Sealed Envelopes</b></h2>
  <p>WITH  a high hand Joyce carried the matter through. She ignored opposition and met  remonstrance with a baffling disdain. She arranged for a return of Orienta for  the experiments on the following evening, and after the departure of the  medium, she declared she would listen to no comments on her actions and went  off at once to her own rooms.</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner expressed herself guardedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what revelations come,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;except as they affect you people here. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that that  woman can say anything to make me think either Joyce or Natalie committed the  crime, but I don&rsquo;t want her to say anything that will make either of them  uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she does, there&rsquo;ll be trouble,&rdquo; declared Barry, gloomily. &ldquo;I feel as you do,  and I want to try her on any ordinary subject first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we are going to do that,&rdquo; put in Natalie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy to see the whole performance,  but I&rsquo;m scared, too. I wish Joyce would promise not to go on with it if any one  of us doesn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; said Beatrice. &ldquo;Joyce is bound to see it through. I don&rsquo;t  know what she expects from it, but she has no fear, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  had stipulated that the s&eacute;ance take place in the studio, saying that the  influences of the place would go far toward producing favourable conditions for  her.</p>
  <p>So  they awaited her there, at the appointed time, and within a few minutes of the  hour she arrived. Pausing in the hall to lay off her wraps, Orienta then glided  into the great room where her group of auditors were assembled. This time she  wore a robe of dark green, as full and flowing as the white one. There was no  suggestion of Greek drapery, but an Oriental style of billowing folds that  would have been hard to imitate. A jade bracelet showed beneath the flowing  sleeve and a jade ring was on one finger of the long, psychic hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I look at it?&rdquo; said Natalie, as they sat a moment, before beginning the s&eacute;ance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  It is my talisman,&mdash;my charm. Without it, I could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?  How wonderful!&rdquo; and the girl looked earnestly at the carven stone. &ldquo;Your power  is occult, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it must be. Yet I would not be classed with the people who go by the  general title of mediums. They are, usually, frauds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  made this statement simply, as if speaking of some matter unconnected with her  own work or claims. She gave the impression that if fraudulent &ldquo;mediums&rdquo; wished  to impose upon the gullible public, it was of no interest to her, but she  declined to be considered one of them. And so secure was she in her own  sincerity, she deemed it unnecessary to emphasise or insist upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your wish?&rdquo; she asked, at length. &ldquo;Will you try me first on some outside  matters or shall we proceed at once to the question of the mystery we seek to  solve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just  then Robert Roberts was announced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall we do?&rdquo; exclaimed Natalie. &ldquo;Tell him to come some other time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Joyce, &ldquo;let him come in here with us. You don&rsquo;t mind, do you, Madame  Orienta?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  why should I? Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  detective who is working on the case.&rdquo; Orienta shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Of  course it matters not to me. But are you sure you want him to know what I may  reveal? It may incriminate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care who may be incriminated!&rdquo; exclaimed Joyce. &ldquo;I want to find out a few  things. As a matter of fact, I asked Mr. Roberts to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  turned pale. Had Joyce laid a trap? And for whom? What might they not learn  before the evening was over?</p>
  <p>Bobsy  entered, and was duly presented to the visitor. He was courteous, but  unmistakably curious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  may I call you?&rdquo; he asked, as he bowed before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Priestess,  if you please,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I refuse to be called a medium or a seeress or  even a clairvoyant. I am these things, but the titles have been so misused that  I claim only to be a Priestess of the Occult. This is no academic title, I  simply name myself a priestess of the cult I express and follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Priestess,  I greet you,&rdquo; said Bobsy, and to those who knew him a shade of mockery might be  detected in his tone. But it was the merest hint and quite unobservable to the  one he addressed. In most decorous manner he took a place in the group, and  Joyce announced the plan she had in mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;we will have an exhibition of Orienta&rsquo;s powers. We will follow her  instructions and she will give us a showing of her methods and her feats.  Then,&mdash;if I say so,&mdash;we will proceed to try the other experiment&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is well,&rdquo; said the Priestess. &ldquo;Remember, please, I make no claims to magic or  to witchcraft. I have, within myself, some inexplicable, some mysterious power  that enables me to see clairvoyantly through material substances. I have also  an occult power which allows me to see happenings at a distance or in the past  as if they were transpiring here and now. These two powers are at your  disposal, but further than that I cannot go. I cannot answer questions, unless  they come within the range of the two conditions I have mentioned to you just  now. I cannot read the future or tell fortunes. I can only see what is shown to  me, and if I disappoint you, I cannot help it. Now let us proceed. I will ask  you each to write a question on a slip of paper and enclose it in an envelope.  Sign your name to your question and seal the envelope securely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  stuff,&rdquo; said Bobsy Roberts to Barry, in a low whisper. But Barry shook his  head. He would not commit himself until the experiment was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you get some paper and envelopes?&rdquo; asked Orienta. &ldquo;Any sort will do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry  rose and went to the desk nearest to him. There was a small paper pad, and in a  pigeon-hole were several small envelopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  these do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  kind will do,&rdquo; said Orienta, wearily, rather than petulantly.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  looked at her closely. Surely she wasn&rsquo;t at all particular about the materials  used. He must watch carefully for hocus pocus, if he was to discover any.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ink  or pencil?&rdquo; said Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; and Orienta was almost irritated now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing  legerdemain tricks, with prepared paraphernalia!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry,  a little embarrassed, picked up a pencil, but in trying it, broke off its  point. So he took ink, and wrote on the top slip of the pad a short question.  This he tore off and passed the pad to Joyce.</p>
  <p>At  last, each had written a question, signed the slip, tucked it in an envelope  and sealed the envelope. Also each put a small private mark on the outside of  his or her envelope to distinguish it again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Collect  them, Mr. Roberts, please,&rdquo; said Orienta, with a gentle smile.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  put the five envelopes in a little pack and held them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Orienta, &ldquo;I propose to read these questions in the dark and without  opening the envelopes. It is no trick, as you can readily see for yourselves,  but I must ask you to sit quietly and not ask questions until I have finished.  Then ask whatever you choose. If you please, Mr. Roberts, hand me the  envelopes, and then turn off the lights. Or, stay, turn off the lights first,  that there may be no chance of my seeing even a mark on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  did exactly as directed. Orienta sat in a large chair, facing the others, who  sat in a row before her. The lights were arranged so that Bobsy might turn off  all at the main switch, save one small table light, which would give him  opportunity to regain his seat, and then this could be also turned off.</p>
  <p>With  everybody raptly watching, Roberts, holding the envelopes, turned off the  lights. The room was dark, save for the one shaded lamp glowing on a small  table. Then he handed the lot of sealed envelopes to Orienta, who took them in  a handclasp that precluded her seeing any detail of them. In another second,  Bobsy had taken his seat, and snapped off the last small light. The room was in  perfect darkness. Barry&rsquo;s hand stole out and clasped Natalie&rsquo;s, but otherwise  there was no movement on the part of any one.</p>
  <p>Not  a second seemed to have passed before Oriental soft voice was heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will read the questions,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in the order they were given me. This is  the first: &lsquo;Who is Goldenheart?&rsquo; It is signed Joyce Stannard. This is the  answer, as my mind sees it. A woman sitting on a rocky seat near a rushing  brook or river. There is a man near her. He bends above her, and speaks  endearing words. He calls her Marie, she calls him Eric. She is small and pale.  Her hair is Titian red. Though not beautiful, she is attractive in a pathetic  way. Ah, the vision is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the low voice ceased, there was a slight rustle as of some one about to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  questions, please,&rdquo; said Orienta, &ldquo;unless you want this experiment to stop  right here. I will now read the contents of the next envelope. This is, &lsquo;Who  marred my etched picture?&rsquo; signed Natalie Vernon. My mind sees the artist who  made it, himself scratching it He is in a fury. It is because he does not feel  satisfied with his own work. He mutters, &lsquo;Not right! no, not right, yet!&rsquo; There  is no one with him. He is alone. The vision fades.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  paused, and gave a little soft sigh, as if exhausted. But in a moment she spoke  again. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you prefer to have the lights, it doesn&rsquo;t  matter at all to me. I read these in the dark because I think if the room were  lighted you might suppose I saw the message in some way by means of my physical  eyes. It is not so, but if you prefer the light, turn it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; cried Roberts, and before any one could object, he snapped on the table  light and then the main key which flooded the big room with illumination.</p>
  <p>Orienta  smiled. &ldquo;I thought you were sceptical, Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; she said. And then, as if  his doubts were of little consequence, she said, &ldquo;Shall I proceed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  nodded, but she shot a gleam of annoyance and reproof at Bobsy Roberts, who  looked a little crestfallen, but determined to take no chances.</p>
  <p>Orienta  picked up the next envelope. She had laid aside on a table the two she had  read.</p>
  <p>She  did not look at the envelope she now held, but looked straight at Roberts, as  if to convince him of her honesty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is signed Beatrice Faulkner, and it says, &lsquo;Where are the lost jewels?&rsquo; My mind  sees this picture. The jewels, not lost, but safely hidden. They are in a  strong box, not a safe, more like a metal-bound trunk. I cannot tell where this  box is, but it is in a bare place, like a store room or safety place of some  sort. The vision goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  we speak?&rdquo; asked Natalie, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, please,&rdquo; and the Priestess smiled at her. &ldquo;May I not have my conditions  complied with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  still, Natalie,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;Let her have fair play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s question,&rdquo; and Orienta held another envelope in her long  fingers, &ldquo; &lsquo;Would it not be wiser not to attempt to solve the mystery, but to  hush up the whole matter?&rsquo; My mind sees a picture. It is vague, there is no  detail, but it is bright and beautiful. There are fair flowers and soft colours.  They shift, like a kaleidoscope, but always rosy and lovely. It means, yes, it  would be better to give up trying to solve the riddle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now,&rdquo; Orienta spoke in a distinctly scornful voice, &ldquo;there is but one more, Mr.  Roberts&rsquo; envelope. In it he has written, &lsquo;Are you a fraud?&rsquo; I answer this as  carefully as I do the others. My mind shows me myself, and I see my honest  attempts to do my duty and to read aright. No, I am not a fraud. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  shame, Mr. Roberts!&rdquo; cried Joyce, angrily. &ldquo;I am sorry I asked you here  to-night, and I will now ask that you go away. I am more than interested in  Orienta&rsquo;s work, I am enthralled, and I refuse to have it interrupted or  interfered with by your unjust suspicions and rude behaviour! Please go away,  and let us continue our experiments in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mrs. Stannard, please let me stay,&rdquo; begged the penitent Bobsy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good, I  promise you. You see, I&rsquo;m so interested in the thing, I wrote that to test it,  and Madame Orienta came through with flying colours. If you will let me remain,  I promise not to offend again, in any particular.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  had a way with him, and Orienta herself smiled a little as she said, &ldquo;Let him  stay. I&rsquo;m glad to convince him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>So  Bobsy staid.</p>
  <p>Then  Barry proposed that they try the same test over again, but without signing  their papers. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will feel more free to ask what we choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  agreed, and again each wrote a question, and sealed it in an envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seal  them with wax, if you wish,&rdquo; said the Priestess, smiling at Bobsy. &ldquo;I see there  is a sealing set right there on the desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Bobsy and Natalie sealed their envelopes, and stamped them with their rings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too silly. We all know there&rsquo;s no trick in  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I read these in the dark or in the light?&rdquo; asked Orienta, as Bobsy held the  five missives toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not as you did before?&rdquo; said Beatrice, &ldquo;part of them in darkness and part in  light. I think those read in the dark even more wonderful than in the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; agreed Joyce. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll try both ways. Which first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may choose,&rdquo; said the Priestess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dark,  then,&rdquo; replied Joyce.</p>
  <p>So  again the room was made totally dark, and immediately came Orienta&rsquo;s soft,  velvety tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Will  what I fear ever happen?&rsquo; &rdquo; she read slowly. Then she sighed, &ldquo;I cannot say, my  child.&rdquo; Every one present knew she spoke to Natalie, although the question had  not been signed. &ldquo;I hope not,&mdash;I think not,&mdash;but the vision is clouded. It is  better that you forget all. Forget the past, live for a bright and happy  future. The vision fades.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had come to know that that last phrase meant the end of a subject, and the next  one would ensue.</p>
  <p>With  scarcely a pause and without hesitation, Orienta went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;What  can I do to help?&rsquo; &rdquo; No hint was needed, for all felt sure this was Beatrice  Faulkner&rsquo;s question.</p>
  <p>The  Priestess spoke impersonally, in even tones; and said: &ldquo;Nothing more than you  are doing. Your kindness, cheer and sympathy are needed here and they are  appreciated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rest in the light?&rdquo; asked Bobsy Roberts, impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you choose,&rdquo; returned Joyce, and Roberts switched on the electrics.</p>
  <p>Orienta,  with closed eyes, sat holding the next envelope in readiness. She seemed not to  know or care whether it was light or dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Am  I doing right?&rsquo; &rdquo; she read. For an instant the long lashes on the cheeks of the  Priestess lifted, and she flashed a momentary glance at Joyce. &ldquo;Yes, you are  doing right. Continue in the procedure you have planned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  look of contentment passed over Joyce&rsquo;s face. She showed intense relief, and  oblivious to the others&rsquo; curious glances she drew a long sigh and relaxed in  her chair.</p>
  <p>Clearly,  it made no difference to Orienta that the questions were not signed. She knew  at once who wrote each. Next came Barry&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Still  with her eyes closed, she held it out toward him, and read, &ldquo; &lsquo;Will the truth  ever be known?&rsquo; &rdquo; There was a perceptible pause before she said, &ldquo;You do not  want it known, because you fear it. But your secret is safe. That, at least,  will never be known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts listened attentively. So Barry Stannard had a secret. Pshaw! Not  necessarily because this faker said so! And yet, was she a faker? Bobsy looked  at her. He himself had put those sealed envelopes into that long, inert hand.  There they were still, intact, seals unbroken, and the reader paying no more  attention to them than as if they were so much blank paper. Whatever her power,  it was superhuman. No physical vision could read through those opaque  envelopes, or if such sight might be, it could not operate in total darkness.  No, there was no chance for trickery. It was a supernatural gift of some sort.</p>
  <p>His  own envelope came last. He had boldly written, &ldquo;Who killed Eric Stannard?&rdquo; a  question no one else had felt like putting down in crude words.</p>
  <p>Orienta  read it, her hand clasped over the envelope and her eyes closed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  last,&rdquo; she murmured, in a strained, whispering voice, &ldquo;at last we come to the  vital question. It matters not who wrote it, it is what each one wanted to  write. Shall I answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was silence.</p>
  <p>Orienta  opened her eyes and cast a slow glance around. </p>
  <h2><a name="XII"></a>    <b>XII<br>
    A Vision</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was curious to note the various expressions that met the eyes of the Priestess.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts regarded her with awe. All his scepticism was gone; he was ready to  believe anything she might say. She had stood the severest tests, had tossed  them aside without noticing them, and had come triumphant through the  experimental ordeal. Surely, if she revealed anything hitherto unknown, it  would be the truth. But could she do that?</p>
  <p>Natalie  and Barry both showed fear. Strive to hide it as they would, it lurked in their  staring eyes, it was evident in their restless hands, and as if moved by the  same thought, they turned and gazed at each other.</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner looked troubled. She saw the two young people in their distress, and  she looked at the Detective furtively.</p>
  <p>Joyce,  however, was the one to whom all turned, breathlessly awaiting her decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, and her voice rang out with its note of determination, &ldquo;yes, Madame  Orienta, tell all you know,&mdash;all you can learn by your mystic power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  if in obedience to a command, the graceful figure of the Mystic fell into a  languid pose. Her arms fell limply, her head drooped a very little to one side.  Her eyes were open, but seemed to be unseeing, for her glance was fixed, as if  watching a mirage.</p>
  <p>She  looked directly toward the chair where Stannard had died. Her half-vacant  glance centred on it, and in a moment she began speaking. She sounded as one in  a trance. She was alive but not alert, like one sleep-walking or talking in a  dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see it all,&mdash;clearly. I see the artist in his favourite chair. He is at his  work,&mdash;no, not working, but gazing at something, criticising work that he has  done. It is not a picture&mdash;it is a small panel. He takes up a tool,&mdash;an  instrument, a sharp, pointed one. He hesitates, and then with a sudden angry  exclamation, he scratches and mars the work. It pleases him that he has done  so, and he smiles. A man enters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a stir among her audience. The tension was too great. Barry sought Natalie&rsquo;s  hand and clasped it tightly. Roberts shot glances quickly from one to another,  but returned his gaze at once to the speaker. Joyce and Beatrice leaned  forward, fairly hanging on the words of revelation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man,&mdash;he is big and dark,&mdash;confronts the artist as he sits. The intruder, without  a word, grasps the sharp tool from the fingers of the one who holds it, and  thrusts it into the breast of his victim. He darts across the room, turns off  all light, and&mdash;it is so black,&mdash;I cannot see him depart. But&mdash;I hear him&mdash;I hear  his stealthy tread. He comes back, past the dying man,&mdash;he hears a groan,&mdash;he  pauses,&mdash;I can see nothing, but I hear two come in at opposite doors. They  stand, breathing heavily in fear&mdash;in horror of&mdash;they know not what. As they  stand, half-dazed&mdash;I hear the man&mdash;the murderer slip past one of them, and out of  the room. The light flashes on. The room is dazzlingly bright. I see the two  who first entered. They are women. They gaze affrightedly at each other and  then at the man in the chair. Two others have appeared. They are at the other  end of the long room. It must have been one of these who flashed the light on.  They are a man,&mdash;a servant he is,&mdash;and a woman. Both are terrorised at what they  see. The two women near the chair of the dying man accuse each other of the  crime. But this is the frenzied cry of shock and fright. They do not mean  it&mdash;they scarce know what they utter. The dying man raises his head in a final  effort of life. He sees the scene with the clearness of the dying brain. He  hears the servant say, &lsquo;Who did this?&rsquo; He replies, with upraised, shaking  finger&mdash;&lsquo;Natalie&mdash;nor Joyce.&rsquo; He means neither of these innocent women was  concerned. He tries to tell more, to tell of his assailant, but Death claims  him. His voice ceases, his heart stops beating,&mdash;he is gone. That is all. With  his last breath he tried to say, &lsquo;Neither Natalie nor Joyce,&rsquo; but his failing  speech rendered the words unintelligible. The vision fades.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  ceased speaking, her eyes drooped shut and she lay back in her chair as one  asleep.</p>
  <p>The  silence remained unbroken for a minute or more. The beautiful voice still rang  in their ears. They were still back in the scene they had heard described. The  vividly drawn picture was still with them, and there was no reaction until  Bobsy Roberts said, in a tone of awed belief, &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  the stunned figures moved. Beatrice looked at Joyce with a smile of deep  thankfulness, and then turned to smile at Natalie. The girl was radiant. She  had sensed acutely the whole scene, and she realised perfectly what the  revelation meant. Barry was looking at her adoringly, and his face was full of  triumphant joy.</p>
  <p>Joyce  looked still a bit dazed. Had the experiment really proved so much more  successful than she had dared to hope? She looked at Roberts. He was scribbling  fast in a notebook, lest some point of the story escape his memory.</p>
  <p>Orienta  opened her eyes, roused her long, exquisite figure to an upright posture, and  passed her hand gently across her brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it enough?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  we ask questions?&rdquo; eagerly exclaimed Bobsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but only important ones. I am very weary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  please describe more fully the man who struck the blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Orienta&rsquo;s eyes fastened themselves on the big armchair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see  him clearly,&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands in her tense concentration, &ldquo;but his  back is toward me as he bends over his victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is he dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot quite tell. His figure is vague. His clothes seem merely a dark shadow  against the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  it seem to be evening dress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be. I cannot say, surely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  any rate, it is not the rough dress of a tramp or burglar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;not  that, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not masked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say he is dark? Pardon me, Madame, but it is my duty to get these details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  his hair, as I see it, is dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he has a round, smooth-shaven face?&rdquo; Roberts spoke eagerly, as if he had in  mind a distinct personality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Orienta slowly. &ldquo;No, he has a long, thin face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you see his face, then?&rdquo; Bobsy fairly shot out the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  his face, but an indication of his profile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  is he clean-shaven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he wears a beard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.  A dark beard? A heavy one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dark,  yes. But not heavy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pointed  or full?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somewhat  pointed&mdash;ah, he has turned away. I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he wearing a hat? But, no, you see his hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see no hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there a hat on the table? On a chair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell. The vision fades.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  up, Roberts,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;We are sure now the man was an intruder. Let it go  at that. If you can find such a one, it won&rsquo;t matter whether he had a hat or  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is important,&rdquo; insisted Bobsy. &ldquo;Now, Madame Orienta, tell us again of his  actions. Even if the vision has faded, tell from your memory what he did. You  saw him when he crossed the room toward the hall door. It was light then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He moved swiftly, straight to the electric switch, and pressed it. Then I could  see no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. But you heard his steps returning, you said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he went stealthily, but I heard him feel his way by the furniture and walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  at the same time you heard a sound from Mr. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a sort of gasp or groan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right.  It was this, then, that attracted the attention of Mrs. Stannard and Miss  Vernon, and they entered at about the same time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I can judge. They were both there when the lights re-appeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in that brief instant the man had slipped past one of them and escaped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as the vision revealed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  one more question. Past which woman did he go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot say. I merely heard a quick footstep at that end of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  couldn&rsquo;t have been past Miss Vernon,&rdquo; said Bobby. &ldquo;She was too near the door,  according to her own account. And I don&rsquo;t see how he could have passed Mrs.  Stannard, as there was a low light in the Billiard Room, and she must have seen  him pass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both  women were looking toward the source of the sound they heard. Also, at that  very moment, the wounded man gave a faint cry of &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; An instant after, the  servant turned on the light. In that instant the man disappeared, unnoticed by  any one. I am not explaining these occurrences, Mr. Roberts; I am describing  them. It is for you to interpret their meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  fell into a brown study, and timidly Natalie put forth a question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know he said, or tried to say, &lsquo;Neither Joyce nor Natalie&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orienta  looked at the girl with an affectionate expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo; yourself, Miss Vernon. It will not be difficult for you to  understand. By my clairvoyance I read the thought in his mind. I know he feared  one or other of the two women he saw might be suspected. The dying often have  abnormally acute prescience. To ward off any such danger, and in reply to the  servant&rsquo;s inquiry, he strove to say neither of you were implicated,&mdash;he raised  his hand in protest,&mdash;but he was physically unable to articulate clearly, and so  his words were misconstrued.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard the words,&rdquo; said Natalie to Beatrice Faulkner; &ldquo;does it seem to you he  meant that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the reply. &ldquo;Now that I think it over I feel sure he did. At the moment, you  know, I could scarcely control my senses, and his voice sounded so queer and  unnatural, it was difficult to gather his meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, too,&rdquo; broke in Joyce. &ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s what he meant. Eric&rsquo;s very  nature was against his accusing any woman of wrong-doing. He meant just what  Madame Orienta has told us. And I am glad there can be no more doubt about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  a man have brushed by you that moment, Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo; asked Bobsy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. I came from a lighted room into one of pitch blackness. I heard a  quick breathing from the opposite side of the room, where Natalie was. I  daresay I involuntarily took a step forward, and the man slipped past, behind  me. It all happened so quickly, and I was so frightened, I can&rsquo;t describe my  exact sensations. But I accept Madame Orienta&rsquo;s revelation as the truth, and&mdash;&rdquo;  Joyce&rsquo;s face paled a little, and she spoke very sternly, &ldquo;I positively forbid  any further investigation of the whole matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you suspect some one?&rdquo; asked Bobsy, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; was the haughty answer, and Joyce looked like a queen issuing  commands. &ldquo;I have no idea who the intruder was, nor do I want to know. But if  this story is made public, a dozen men will be found to fit the description,  and it will mean no end of trouble and injustice. Therefore, I request, Mr.  Roberts, that you let it go no further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t promise that,&rdquo; said Bobsy, gravely. &ldquo;I am bound to report to my chief.  But if he agrees, I will stop all investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Joyce, her dark eyes troubled. &ldquo;You must promise what I ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you need have no fear, Mrs. Stannard, of any injustice being done. One  moment, Madame Orienta. You saw the footman, Blake, followed by Mrs. Faulkner,  enter the room and turn on the light, just as they testified?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  light was flashed on, and then I saw the servant, his hand still on the switch.  Behind him, at his very shoulder, was Mrs. Faulkner, her face drawn with fear  and horror. Naturally I turned my attention at once to the other end of the  room, and there saw, for the first time, the two women whom I had heard enter a  moment before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, that is all,&rdquo; and rising, Bobsy Roberts made brief adieus and hurried  away.</p>
  <p>He  went straight to headquarters and sought Captain Steele.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  Stannard&rsquo;s murderer,&rdquo; he announced excitedly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again  or yet?&rdquo; asked his unmoved listener.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  it in the queerest way, too,&rdquo; Bobsy went on, as he fished for his notebooks in  the pocket of the overcoat he had laid off. &ldquo;Do you believe in mejums, Cap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d notice it. Spill your yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to begin at the beginning of this chapter of it, Mrs. Stannard engaged a  clairvoyant lady to see visions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spooks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly that, but to&mdash;well, to reconstruct the murder scene,&mdash;mentally, you  know,&mdash;and see who did the stabbing. And by Jove, she told us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, Bobsy, I&rsquo;ll stand for a good deal from you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  hold on, she didn&rsquo;t know she told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Didn&rsquo;t know what she told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you could listen without butting in every minute, I&rsquo;d give you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try,&rdquo; and Captain Steele folded his hands and listened without a word while  Bobsy told him every detail of the Orienta revelation.</p>
  <p>Often  he referred to his notes, and again he told vividly from memory the exact words  of the priestess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you fell for that?&rdquo; cried Steele, as the tale ended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  I did, and so would you if you&rsquo;d been there. You can sort of sense the  difference between the professional fake mediums and this&mdash;this lady. She was  the real thing, all right. I felt just as you do, before I saw her, but I was  soon convinced. Why, man, that reading the sealed messages was enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  they have lots of ways of doing that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she didn&rsquo;t use any of their &lsquo;ways.&rsquo; I, myself, handed the bunch to her, and  immediately she read them out, and in pitch dark, too. No, there was no chance  for trickery. She read them in dark or light, equally well. And not a seal  broken or an envelope torn. Now, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  chance for a confederate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the least. We sat in a row, and she sat facing us, fully eight feet away. And  what could a confederate do? I handed her the envelopes,&mdash;she gave them back to  me,&mdash;intact. Not one of us moved. When it was dark, her voice proved she was in  her chair, and when I flashed on the light suddenly, there she was, without a  change of posture, holding the envelopes exactly as I had given them to her. I  tell you she&rsquo;s the real thing. I&rsquo;ve read up on the trickery business, and all  the books say that while there is lots of fraud, there is also a certain amount  of telepathy or clairvoyance or whatever you call it, that&rsquo;s true. And that&rsquo;s  her sort.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  who is the man? Did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she didn&rsquo;t know. But I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who,  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eugene  Courtenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is. I&rsquo;ve had him in the back of my head for some time, but I couldn&rsquo;t  get a peg to hang a clue on. Now, I see how he could have done it. He did do  it, just as the lady said. He slipped in, stabbed his man, turned off the  light, and&mdash;slipped out again, past Mrs. Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t she know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did know it! Don&rsquo;t you see? Those two are in love. They wanted Stannard out of  the way. But I don&rsquo;t think there was collusion. I think it was this way. You  know, it is history that Mrs. Stannard and Courtenay were alone in the Billiard  Room. Of course he was making love to her, and bemoaning the fact of Stannard&rsquo;s  existence. Now, either he went from her into the studio, and she knew it, or  else, he went away, as they say, and returned, through the Billiard Room&mdash;and  she didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could she help seeing him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  say she was crying,&mdash;or had buried her face in a sofa cushion,&mdash;or was sitting  before the fire and he passed behind her. But admit that he <i>could</i> have gone through that room  unknown to her,&mdash;which, of course, he could. Well, he goes in, and, later, in  the dark, he goes out the same way. I don&rsquo;t know about her knowledge of any  part of this performance, but I think she knew nothing of it, or she wouldn&rsquo;t  have engaged the occult lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did that to clear herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and Miss Vernon, too. But when the Priestess, as they call her, spoke of a  tall, dark man, with a beard, Mrs. Stannard was scared to death and wanted it  all called off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  tall man, with a beard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a dark, pointed beard! Isn&rsquo;t that Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sounds  like him. Did she describe him further?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but only when I dragged it out of her. She vowed she couldn&rsquo;t see him clearly,  and I pretended I wanted her to say a round, smooth-shaven face, and little by  little I wormed it out, and it was Courtenay to the life. Then, Mrs. Stannard  weakened on the whole show, which proves it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say you&rsquo;ve thought of him before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  vaguely. But you know his story. How he sat on the lawn bench and watched the  lights go off and on! Good work, that! He himself turned them off and then  escaped to the lawn, and cleverly sat there to see what occurred, instead of  going home, and thereby being suspected,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kept still when he found those two women were accused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure.  He knew they&rsquo;d get off all right, and if he expected to marry Mrs. Stannard, he  couldn&rsquo;t let himself get into the game. So he made up his simple, clever yarn,  and stuck to it. Yes, sir, Courtenay&rsquo;s your man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  what about that conversation Mrs. Stannard overheard? She says her husband was  talking to a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  made that up. Probably she had a glimmer of suspicion toward Courtenay, and did  anything she could to make it seem somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she hired this visionary, and that brought about the very revelation she didn&rsquo;t  want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she never dreamed it would do so. She had no faith in the thing, and thought it  would merely divert suspicion to some unknown intruder. And so it would, if I  hadn&rsquo;t pinned the Seeress down to a careful description. Then, the more Mrs.  Stannard showed discomfiture the more I knew I was right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you, Bobsy. Now, how shall we go about proving it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will prove itself. It&rsquo;s a case of murder will out. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>XIII<br>
    An Alibi Needed</b></h2>
  <p>VERY  discreetly Bobsy conducted his interview with Eugene Courtenay. The detective  wanted to trap his man before he could realise any danger, so he called on him  the morning after his talk with Steele.</p>
  <p>Courtenay  was not a business man. He called himself a farmer, but his farming was of the  fancy variety and was done almost entirely by expert gardeners. His place was  not far from the Folly, and when Bobsy called, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, he was  received courteously enough by the man he desired to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  this way, Mr. Courtenay,&rdquo; said Bobsy, after a few preliminaries, &ldquo;in the  interests of law and justice, I want you to tell me a little more in detail the  story you told at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are no further details than those I related, Mr. Roberts. What have you learned  that makes you think my testimony of sudden importance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly,  this was not a man to be easily hoodwinked. Bobsy felt his way. &ldquo;Not of sudden  importance. But all testimony is important, and sometimes by elaboration it  becomes illuminative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  word, illuminative,&rdquo; remarked Courtenay. &ldquo;But I cannot help to shed light for  you, I fear. Just what do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  was an opening. Bobsy accepted it as such.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time did you leave the Stannard house that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, really. One doesn&rsquo;t note hours when not on business matters. It  must have been between eleven and half-past. That&rsquo;s as near as I can come to  it. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last word was shot at him, and Bobsy almost jumped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my duty to ask,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;At what time did you reach home? I suppose  you don&rsquo;t know that, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not. But I didn&rsquo;t come home at once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know; you sat on a bench on the Folly lawn. Were you in evening togs, Mr.  Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you on a hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eugene  Courtenay started. But he answered at once: &ldquo;Not a hat. I wore a cap over  there. I often do when I go to a neighbour&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you had it on when you sat on the bench?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  confound it, man. I don&rsquo;t know! I suppose I did. No, let me see. I believe I  was carrying it, and laid it on the bench beside me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  left it there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Courtenay  laughed a little self-consciously. &ldquo;Yes, I did. I came nearly home before I  thought of it Then I went back and gathered it in. Why?&rdquo; Again that direct,  snapped-out question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was going on at the house when you went back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  should I know? After events prove that the tragedy in the studio was then being  gone through with&mdash;but I had no idea of that at the time. I glanced at the  house, of course. There was a light in the studio&mdash;in fact, lights over most of  the house. I found my cap and came on home. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  answer your whys, Mr. Courtenay. Because the police have reason to think your  story is not entirely true. Because we think it was you, yourself, who turned  off the studio light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I understand, Mr. Roberts, you mean that I&mdash;let us speak plainly&mdash;that I killed  Eric Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you, Mr. Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to answer such an absurd question! In the first place, I was out on the  lawn, when the light went out&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you say. But who corroborates that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was also out there when the light flashed on again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that may be true, but your first statement is not. You left Mrs. Stannard in  the Billiard Room, you went into the studio&mdash;whether in the interim you had been  out on the lawn or not, doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;you stabbed Eric Stannard, you turned  off the light, and returning through the Billiard Room, you went back to that  bench, and awaited developments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must be insane!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I&rsquo;m not insane. Neither were you. It was a clever dodge. You didn&rsquo;t know  the women would be implicated, but when they were, however you might regret  that, you couldn&rsquo;t confess your own guilt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  Bobsy looked squarely at him, &ldquo;because you love Mrs. Stannard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  Don&rsquo;t you dare to speak her name! You mischief-maker! You absolute and  unqualified&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop,  yourself, Mr. Courtenay! These heroics harm your case&mdash;they don&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s false! It isn&rsquo;t true! I didn&rsquo;t do it! I was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was on that bench all the time, till I went home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see any one, any servant or gardener, perhaps, who can vouch for your  story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t remember that I did. But, man, alive, how could I get in and out of that  room? It has been proved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been proved that you could have entered unseen and could have left unseen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Answer  this question truthfully. What was Mrs. Stannard doing, when you left her in  the Billiard Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was sitting on one of the leather seats that are built to the wall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she looking at you, as you left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She had buried her face in a pillow against which she leaned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did she do this? Was she feeling ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why the act?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean you will not. Was it because you had said something to her that caused her  emotion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to answer, and you have no right to ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, don&rsquo;t answer. But, you must admit, that if her face was buried in the  pillow, she could not see if a man passed through the Billiard Room to the  studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  no one did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I should have seen him from the bench where I sat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you would not, because you were the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  accuse me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  deny it. But I shall say no more to you. Have you a warrant for my arrest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go&mdash;and go quickly, before I tell you what I think of you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Bobsy Roberts was no fool. He said, quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you would tell me what  you think of me. It may help me to get at the truth. There are reasons why we  are inquiring into your connection with this matter&mdash;you will hear the reasons  soon enough. There is peculiar but direct evidence that you are the man who stabbed  Mr. Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidence?  What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I say. But never mind that. You have nothing else to tell me? No proof to  adduce that you were just where you claim to have been when the studio was  darkened?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No proof, because none is needed. You can&rsquo;t have evidence&mdash;it is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  that is all, Mr. Courtenay. You needn&rsquo;t tell me what you think of me. Your  opinion doesn&rsquo;t interest me. But perhaps after you hear the evidence I speak  of, you&rsquo;ll sing another tune. Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you about it. Ask Mrs.  Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  asked you not to mention that lady&rsquo;s name. Good-morning, Mr. Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning.&rdquo; And Bobsy went away, filled with conviction of Eugene Courtenay&rsquo;s  guilt</p>
  <p>Courtenay  went at once over to see Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  missed you so,&rdquo; she said, simply, as she met him on the Terrace. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t  you been here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought better not, darling. I can&rsquo;t control myself sufficiently to hide my  love for you. And I feared it might bring embarrassment on you if I let it be  seen by any one. Oh, Joyce, it seems so long to wait! Must it be two years? I  can&rsquo;t live through it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Eugene. It seems sacrilege even to speak of our love and poor Eric dead so  short a time. Be patient, dear heart. We are both young. You couldn&rsquo;t love me,  or respect me, if I failed in ordinary behaviour toward a husband&rsquo;s memory. And  Eric was good to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  to you! Losing his head over every pretty woman he met! Joyce, how could you  ever marry him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  made me. Don&rsquo;t you know how some women succumb to cave-man wooing? I don&rsquo;t  understand it myself, but his whirlwind love-making carried me off my feet, and  I had promised him before I knew it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had been here at the time, it would never have happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it would. I was fascinated by his very vehemence. Now, I know better. I  want only your gentle, dear love, that will comfort and content me as he never  could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  poor little darling. I wish I could give it to you now. Mayn&rsquo;t I kiss you  once&mdash;just once, Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Eugene. Not yet. Some day&mdash;when I can&rsquo;t be patient any longer. When the hunger  for your big, sweet affection becomes too intense&mdash;the craving too  uncontrollable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned away from him and looked off toward the glowing richness of the autumn  foliage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the robins nest again,&rdquo; she said, with a little pathetic smile at the  quotation. &ldquo;But now, dear, sit down, I&rsquo;ve a lot to tell you. I&rsquo;m glad you came  over, I was going to send for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then, without further preamble, Joyce told him the whole story of Orienta and  her revelations.</p>
  <p>Courtenay  listened, his eyes growing dark with anxiety as the story progressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was the man?&rdquo; he asked quietly, as she finished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I don&rsquo;t know. Not a tramp, of course. But, perhaps some blackmailer. You  know&mdash;Eric&rsquo;s life wasn&rsquo;t spotless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  Joyce. The man, you say, was dark and with a pointed beard. He was in evening  clothes, and wore no hat. He had reason to hate Eric Stannard. Do you know of  any one who fulfils those conditions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  looked at him, and a cloud of fear came to her beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Eugene,&rdquo; she cried, putting up her white hand, as if to ward off a blow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must, Joyce. And you must listen. When I left you, did you keep your head down  on that pillow&mdash;or, did you raise it? Tell me truly, dearest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  kept it down there. I was crying a little&mdash;after what&mdash;you know&mdash;what we had been  talking about. I staid that way a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  you heard the sounds from the studio?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  until that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  some one could have passed you&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t have heard a soft step?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I probably shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;but, Eugene, it wasn&rsquo;t you? Say it wasn&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not. But I have to prove this, Joyce&mdash;and it will be difficult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  does any one think it was you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the police think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police! That Roberts man! Oh, why&mdash;why did I ever have Madame Orienta come here?  But we will prove it was not you, my Eugene&mdash;we will prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Joyce, my darling, we will, for we must. To whom have you told this story of  sitting with your face bowed in the pillow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  no one. Oh, yes, to the people in the house, of course. Barry and Beatrice,  and, of course, little Natalie. Oh, Eugene, I was so glad when the Priestess&rsquo;  story seemed to clear Natalie and me of all suspicion of guilt But if it has  implicated you, that is a thousand times worse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not worse. A man can fight injustice better than a woman. Have you told  Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the pillow? No, I don&rsquo;t think so. But he&rsquo;ll find it out. That man digs into  everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  invited him, yourself, to the s&eacute;ance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I thought it wise. I thought it would implicate some stranger and I wanted him  to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you think it would accuse a stranger? Look here, Joyce, you didn&rsquo;t employ  that woman to cook up a yarn, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy,  no!&rdquo; and Joyce opened her eyes full at him. &ldquo;Eugene! What an idea! Of course I  didn&rsquo;t. Why, I believe in her as fully as&mdash;as I do in you! I can&rsquo;t say more than  that! She is honest and earnest in what she tells. Whether she sees truly, is  another thing, and one over which she has no control. But all she says is in sincerity  and truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be. But she has surely woven a web around me. That is, if others share your  belief in her. Now, I&rsquo;m going to work, Joyce, to find my alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to scare up somebody who saw me on that bench and will swear to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swear  falsely?&rdquo; Joyce whispered the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  need be. But I hope to get an honest witness. May I speak to your outdoor  servants? And the house staff, too, if necessary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. Find the head gardener, Mason, he&rsquo;ll round up the rest. Oh, Eugene, you  will find some one, surely. They are about the grounds every night And perhaps  Barry saw you. He was out with the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  find some one, dear. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Courtenay went away, and Joyce went into the  house. She went to Beatrice Faulkner&rsquo;s room, and found her there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I come in?&rdquo; asked Joyce, at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always,  any time. Why, what is the matter, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beatrice!  You don&rsquo;t think Eugene killed Eric, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not! What nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  they suspect him of it, and he&rsquo;s going to make up an alibi&mdash;or whatever you call  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  make one up! Don&rsquo;t ever say that, Joyce. You mean, he&rsquo;s going to find proof of  his own testimony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s all the same. But, oh, Beatrice, if he did do it&mdash;I can never marry him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Joyce! You mustn&rsquo;t talk like that! Don&rsquo;t you want to save Eugene?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do, if he&rsquo;s innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  believe him innocent! You wrong-minded woman, to doubt the man who loves you,  at the first breath of suspicion!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  is he innocent, Beatrice? Is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  in your heart and answer that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do look,&rdquo; said Joyce, solemnly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t read the answer.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>XIV<br>
    From Seven to Seventy</b></h2>
  <p>LISTEN,  Joyce, dear. You are nervous and excited, or you never would do Mr. Courtenay  such injustice. Think back; remember how he has always loved you&mdash;long before  you married Eric. How patient and good he has been, never showing any undue  interest in you or any animosity toward Eric. Why, then, imagine that he would  do this desperate thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just it, Beatrice. He restrained his feelings as long as he could, and that  night&mdash;in the Billiard Room, he&mdash;he lost control&mdash;and he said he&mdash;he c-couldn&rsquo;t  stand it. You know he thought Eric didn&rsquo;t treat me right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Eric didn&rsquo;t. But even if Mr. Courtenay did lose his head for a moment, that  doesn&rsquo;t mean he was the murderer, and you mustn&rsquo;t suspect him, Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you know what Orienta said&mdash;about a dark man with a pointed beard. Who else  could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other  men have dark hair and beards. And Orienta couldn&rsquo;t see him clearly, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. And you are a comfort, Beatrice. But I never can marry Eugene if he has  even a shadow of doubt hanging over him. I want him cleared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you do. And as he is innocent, he will clear himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  not. If he can&rsquo;t find anybody who saw him out there on the bench, he will be  arrested, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, he won&rsquo;t. Why, somebody must have seen him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  any of the servants had, they would have said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  weren&rsquo;t asked. What about Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think Barry was off in the other direction, down by the orchards. But,  Beatrice, maybe Mr. Wadsworth saw him. Didn&rsquo;t he leave you just about that  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or a few moments sooner. Shall I ask him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. He&rsquo;s a fine man, and if he did see Eugene, his word will stand. Are you  going to&mdash;do you care for him, Beatrice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Joyce. He is, as you say, a fine man, and he has asked me many times to marry  him, but I do not love him in that way. I admire and respect him, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Mr. Wadsworth. He worships the ground you walk on. Perhaps later, when all this  horror is a thing of the past, you may change your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,  Joyce. But I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Wadsworth about Eugene. You telephone him to come over here.  If I do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  take it as encouragement. Yes, I know. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  called him up on the telephone, and Wadsworth came over to the Folly that  evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, I think so,&rdquo; he said, when questioned by Beatrice. &ldquo;Let me see; when I  left here, I walked a couple of times round the Italian garden paths,  hesitating as to whether I should come back for one last appeal, or accept your  refusal as final. I decided on the latter course, and was planning to go away  on a long trip, to&mdash;to make myself keep away from you.&rdquo; He looked tenderly into  the troubled face gazing into his own. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to persist too hard, dear,  but I am of a determined nature, and I can&rsquo;t give you up. So, I&rsquo;m going away,  but I warn you I shall yet return and ask you once more&mdash;yes, once more,  Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is in the future,&rdquo; she returned, gravely, &ldquo;but now, let us see if we can help  poor Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Courtenay, as well! Now, I think I did see him, as I came along the South lawn.  I&rsquo;m sure I saw some man on the bench out there, and it was much the outline of  Courtenay. And then, yes, I remember now, just then the light went out, and I couldn&rsquo;t  see him clearly. Of course, I thought nothing of the light being put out. I  assumed the people were going to bed, but it was that that decided me not to  return to see you again that night. Had the lights staid on, I fancy, after  all, I should have entered the house again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were alone in the studio. It was but partially lighted, and Beatrice shuddered  as she looked around the great apartment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  out of here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I hate the place, it seems to be haunted by Eric&rsquo;s  spirit. Come into the Reception Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wadsworth  followed as she went through the hall, but detained her a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has become of your portrait painted on the staircase?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  in the studio,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite finished, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t  I see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  now. Some time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand  on the stairs, the way the picture is painted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Humouring  his whim, Beatrice went up three steps and posed her hand on the balustrade, as  Eric had painted her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beautiful.  Stannard was a wonderful genius. I want that picture, dear. I don&rsquo;t care if it  is unfinished. If I can&rsquo;t have the original&mdash;yet&mdash;will you give me the duplicate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  oh, no!&rdquo; and Beatrice looked startled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate you to have it, with this  staircase and all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you loved this staircase&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  an architectural gem, yes. Mr. Faulkner prided himself on its design. But  now&mdash;Eric&rsquo;s death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you stood right there, when your attention was first drawn to the footman&rsquo;s  queer actions, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I was just on this very step when I heard that faint moan&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t remind me  of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t. I was a brute to be so thoughtless. Dear heart, can&rsquo;t you leave this  house? Why do you stay in a place of such sad memories?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do want to go away&mdash;and I must. And yet, Joyce needs me. She leans on me for  everything. Come into this little room, and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  went into the cosy, low-ceiled Reception Room, and Beatrice continued. &ldquo;I was  just thinking I could leave her, when she became worried about Mr. Courtenay.  Now, if you can convince the police that you saw him out there, just at that  critical moment when the light disappeared, you will establish his alibi. Can  you do this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I can. The more I think about it, the more I feel sure that it was  Courtenay I saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he a hat on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but his hand on the back of the bench held a cap. I saw this clearly, for the  light from the studio window was very strong. But as I looked at the man, the  light went out. Understand, I was not looking at him with any curiosity or even  interest. Merely he was in my line of vision, that is all. When I could not see  him because of the sudden darkness, I thought no more of him, and I went home  then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will go to the police and tell them this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly will, the first thing to-morrow morning. To-night, if you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  wait till morning. Stay here a little longer. I feel lonely to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  heart, can&rsquo;t you learn to look to me to cheer that loneliness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;you  promised you wouldn&rsquo;t. But let&rsquo;s chat a bit. Tell me, do you believe at all in  spiritism?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spiritualism?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  spiritism. They&rsquo;re quite different. Spiritualism is the old-fashioned  table-tipping, rapping performance. Spiritism is the scientific consideration  of life after death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I believe in life after death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  do you think the dead can return and communicate with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  rapping and tipping tables?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not at all. By silent communion, or by a restless haunting of places they used  to occupy? There! didn&rsquo;t you hear a faint sound then? A soft rustle, as of  wings?&rdquo; &lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t, and neither did you. That Orienta person has you all unnerved. I won&rsquo;t  stand it. I insist on your leaving this house. If I see to it, that the police  are fully informed of my evidence regarding Courtenay, will you get away at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  be glad to, if Joyce is willing I should go. Natalie is fond of me, too. But  Barry will look after her. Yes, if Mr. Courtenay is freed of all suspicion, I  will go away at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Roger  Wadsworth&rsquo;s story carried weight with the police, who were already rather  sceptical of testimony obtained from a clairvoyant.</p>
  <p>And  as Courtenay himself said to Captain Steele, &ldquo;Your precious detective, Roberts,  forced that woman to describe me. Even granting she had an hallucination, or  whatever those people have, she didn&rsquo;t say anything about a pointed beard, or  evening clothes and no hat, until he suggested it. Then she said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; If he&rsquo;d  said, &lsquo;hasn&rsquo;t he red hair and freckles?&rsquo; she would have said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; also! It&rsquo;s  auto-suggestion. Her mind was a blank, and any hint took form of a picture  which she thought she saw. But since you&rsquo;ve put me on the rack, I&rsquo;m going into  this thing myself. For reasons of my own, I&rsquo;m going to hunt down the murderer  of Eric Stannard. There&rsquo;s nobody on the job that has any push or perseverance.  Young Stannard doesn&rsquo;t want the truth known. Why, I can&rsquo;t say. Nobody suspects  him. But from now on, count on my untiring efforts. I&rsquo;m ready to work with you,  Captain Steele, or with Roberts, or any one you say. Or I&rsquo;ll work alone. But  solve the mystery I&rsquo;m bound to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Courtenay&rsquo;s  manner went far to convince all who heard him of his own innocence, though  Bobsy Roberts afterward growled something about &ldquo;protesting too much.&rdquo; But when  Courtenay said he would be at their bidding if they learned anything against  him, they agreed to let him go in peace to pursue his own inquiries.</p>
  <p>And  he went first to Lawyer Stiles, to look into the matter of Stannard&rsquo;s will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first motive to consider,&rdquo; Courtenay said to the surprised lawyer, &ldquo;is always a  money motive. Who benefits by this will, aside from the principals?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiles  produced the document, and they went over its possibilities. Suddenly Courtenay  started in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you noticed anything peculiar about this will?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  lawyer looked at him with a somewhat blank expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what do you mean?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  then you have seen it! Were you going to let it pass unnoted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must ask you to explain your enigmatical remarks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I will do so. That will has been tampered with, and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tampered  with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  repeat my words like a parrot! Yes, tampered with. The original, written in Mr.  Stannard&rsquo;s own hand, has been added to by some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so, I know so. Now, why haven&rsquo;t you made it known? You must have  seen it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the fancied alteration?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Courtenay  looked at the stern face of the lawyer, and wondered if he could be dishonest  or if he had been blind. He laid his finger on one clause, the one stating  Natalie Vernon&rsquo;s bequest, and said, &ldquo;There, that is the place. That was written  seven thousand dollars, it has been changed to read seventy thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawyer  Stiles peered at the words through his rubber-rimmed glasses. &ldquo;It is in letters  and figures both,&rdquo; he demurred, &ldquo;it would be difficult&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it is. And it was not very difficult to add <i>ty</i> to the written seven, and there chanced to be room for an extra  cipher after the original naughts, thus giving the inheritor ten times as much  as was intended by the testator.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  do you, as a reputable lawyer, admit that you overlook a palpable fraud like  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry you saw that, Mr. Courtenay. In explanation, I have nothing to say, but  justice to myself compels me to remind you that I am in the confidence of the  Stannard family, and this is their affair&mdash;not yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  Courtenay gave a short whistle. &ldquo;I begin to see. They know it, and make no  objection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry  Stannard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. She read the will, but made no comment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure Barry knows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he stands for it because Miss Vernon did it! That baby! Who&rsquo;d think her capable  of such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Mr. Courtenay. You&rsquo;ve no right to accuse her. You&rsquo;ve no evidence that she did  it. In fact, I&rsquo;m told Miss Vernon writes a large, dashing hand, and this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Eric Stannard&rsquo;s hand is small and cramped. Yes, a clever forgery. It looks  quite a bit like his own writing. But the ink is different, the slant is  different, why, a half blind man could see the words have been changed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Granting  that. What matter, if Barry Stannard doesn&rsquo;t care? Moreover, he is going to  marry Miss Vernon, and the fortune will be theirs jointly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  don&rsquo;t you see? If Natalie Vernon altered that will, she wanted that larger sum,  and&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say it. At least, don&rsquo;t say it to me. If you want to put the matter up to  Barry, go ahead. But I decline to express an opinion or form a conclusion&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does Barry say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  ignores it. I called his attention to it, and he said, &lsquo;Changed figures? Oh, I  guess not. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, anyway; that, and more, will be at Miss Vernon&rsquo;s  disposal some day.&rsquo; So I said no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eugene  Courtenay went straight to Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know anything about a changed figure in Eric&rsquo;s will?&rdquo; he asked, bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she returned; &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natalie  Vernon altered her bequest from seven thousand dollars to seventy thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t difficult. Eric wrote the will himself. He wrote seven and she made it  seventy&mdash;the words, I mean. Then he wrote a figure seven and three ciphers, and  she squeezed in another cipher. Mighty clever work, but as plain to be seen as  a blot on a letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  possessed the child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call her a child. The woman who could and would do that, is a Machiavelli in petticoats.  But don&rsquo;t you see where the knowledge of her act leads us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean&mdash;&rdquo; Joyce could not say it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do. I&rsquo;ve thought all along there was still a doubt of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I haven&rsquo;t. Even if she did alter the will, that doesn&rsquo;t prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t prove&mdash;anything. But you know this will was made very recently&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; Natalie has only been here two months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it. Well, say, Eric made this bequest to her, soon after she came&mdash;you  know, Joyce, he was crazy over her from the very beginning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it, Eugene.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then, when she got a chance, she changed it, and, why, <i>why</i> would she do this, except to inherit&mdash;at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natalie!  That dear little thing! Never! I did suspect her the least mite, just at  first&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry  does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no! He can&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does. And that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t want any fuss made about her forgery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call it that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is that. What else can I call it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t believe it. Maybe&mdash;maybe somebody else did it. Barry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  Why should Barry do it, when he fully intended to marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know! It&rsquo;s all so confusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  confusing; there&rsquo;s no doubt she did the forging. But it&rsquo;s a terrible state of  affairs. I don&rsquo;t want to be the one to accuse her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;d determined to sift things to the bottom to lay my hand on Eric&rsquo;s murderer.  Primarily to clear myself&mdash;for your sake. And, too, for the sake of justice and  right. I&rsquo;ll go now, Joyce, I must think this out alone. Good-bye, darling. Don&rsquo;t  worry. I&rsquo;ll do only what is right, and&mdash;what you approve.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>XV<br>
    Natalie in Danger</b></h2>
  <p>NATALIE!  What <i>are </i>you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  entered Natalie&rsquo;s room, to find her on her knees before an open trunk. Hats and  gowns lay about the room, the wardrobe shelves were empty, and as the girl was  fairly flinging wearing apparel into the tills, the question was superfluous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  packing,&rdquo; the model answered, &ldquo;to go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what has happened? Why do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  rose to her feet. A negligee of pale green Liberty silk fell in lovely folds  about her, her slender arms were bare, and her gold hair hung in two long  braids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t stand it any longer, Joyce,&rdquo; she said, her voice quivering. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so dreadful.  Suspicion everywhere, and everybody looking on me as a murderer, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Natalie, dear, don&rsquo;t talk like that. And, anyway, you can&rsquo;t go. I don&rsquo;t believe  they&rsquo;d let you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? I&rsquo;m not under arrest, or surveillance, or whatever they call it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would be, if you tried to go away. Don&rsquo;t you know we are all watched&mdash;whatever  we do or wherever we go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they don&rsquo;t suspect <i>you</i>, any more,  Joyce, and you were found just as near Eric as I was, when&mdash;when he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Natalie, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Why, now they suspect  Eugene.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know they do, but he didn&rsquo;t do it. He&rsquo;ll soon convince them of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure that he can. And&mdash;suppose he did do it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kill  Eric? Joyce, you&rsquo;re crazy! Why would he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, well enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he loved you, yes, but that wouldn&rsquo;t make him commit crime. Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t  marry him if he won you in that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, I wouldn&rsquo;t. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s worrying me. If he and Eric quarrelled  about me, and if&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you just what I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. If Eugene reproved Eric for his neglect of you, or&mdash;for his attentions to  me, it might have led to high words, and Mr. Courtenay is a very impetuous man,  and Eric never would brook a word of criticism&mdash;oh, of course I understand,  Joyce!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Eugene must be cleared&mdash;he must be, at any cost. Look here, Natalie, did you  know Eric had left you such a big bequest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  flushed, and began to walk nervously up and down the room. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, not  looking at Joyce, &ldquo;he told me he&rsquo;d leave me a nice little sum, but he said he  wasn&rsquo;t going to die till he was ninety, so I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the  matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  didn&rsquo;t you know the sum he mentioned in his will? Had he never told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  that will was altered. The sum he wrote for you was made ten times greater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it?&rdquo; Natalie spoke slowly, as if to gain time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was. You knew this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could I know it? I never saw the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  think you did. They think you altered it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  thinks so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police and Mr. Stiles. And Eugene asked me about it. I thought I&rsquo;d ask you  before anybody else did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was dear of you, Joyce.&rdquo; Natalie sat down on a couch, and taking her chin in  her two palms, sat silent a moment. &ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; she said, at last, &ldquo;why are you  good to me? You think I killed Eric&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t, Natalie&mdash; But, oh, don&rsquo;t you see? I don&rsquo;t want to think it was Eugene,  and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which way to turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not in such a terrible strait as I am, Joyce,&rdquo; and Natalie&rsquo;s blue eyes turned  dark with sadness unutterable. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> to do&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no one to ask, no one to confide in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  least of all. Mrs. Faulkner is a dear, but she is so unwilling to admit she  suspects anybody&mdash;I mean, anybody we know. She insists it was some stranger&mdash;and,  it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean&mdash;oh&mdash;what am I saying? Joyce, I shall go crazy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  looked distraught. Her eyes had a wild look, as of a hunted animal. Her little  fingers plucked at the silk of her robe, and her slippered foot tapped the rug  continuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t love Eric, did you?&rdquo; and Joyce looked at the girl, as if seized with a  new idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I hated him! Forgive me, Joyce, but I can&rsquo;t help it. He was almost repulsive to  me. Not physically&mdash;he was handsome, and most correct-mannered, and all that.  But I was afraid of him. I&rsquo;ve only posed for a few artists, but they were  all&mdash;you know&mdash;impersonal in their relations with me. But Eric made love to me  from the first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it. I saw it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you didn&rsquo;t resent it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  felt more pity for you than jealousy of you. I know Eric, and oh, Natalie, I  tried so hard to be good, and to do my duty&mdash;but Eugene was always around, you  know&mdash;and, must I confess it? I was rather glad that Eric&rsquo;s attention was taken  up with his model.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. I saw all that. But you see, I care for Barry. And Eric told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Natalie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t tell you. Oh, Joyce, I am in danger. I can&rsquo;t ward it off, and I can&rsquo;t  meet it. What shall I do? What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I come in?&rdquo; and Barry appeared at the door of the boudoir.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Joyce answered. &ldquo;Come on in. This child says she is going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Barry slammed the trunk lid shut, turned the key, removed it and  put it in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  cried Natalie, forced to smile at this highhanded piece of business. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a  lot of things in there I want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  have &lsquo;em,&rdquo; returned Barry, &ldquo;unless you promise to put &lsquo;em back in that very  empty wardrobe I see yawning at us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,  I <i>must </i>go away. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve good  reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  had left the room, and Barry sat down beside the trembling little figure and  put an arm round her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  speak of going away, Natalie. Don&rsquo;t think of it. It would look like confession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard about the will?&rdquo; she asked, an awestruck note in her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but never mind about that. When we can get married, all my half the fortune  will be yours anyway. That item of seven thousand or seventy thousand makes no  difference to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think I&mdash;forged it&mdash;do you, Barry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not, darling. I don&rsquo;t think you ever did a wrong thing in your life, of  any sort or description&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t care if you had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t  you care if I had committed&mdash;crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you put it that way, I suppose I&rsquo;d care&mdash;but I&rsquo;d love you just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Just</i> the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  exactly, darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you don&rsquo;t think I changed that will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know anybody did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce  says so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  never mind about it. If I know who did it, I won&rsquo;t tell you&mdash;and you needn&rsquo;t  ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a very strange thing for anybody to do, Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  except me! Oh, you <i>do</i> think I did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  sweetheart, don&rsquo;t talk so loud. Now, listen, Natalie. You&rsquo;re in a tight place.  There&rsquo;s no use denying it, you are. Now I want you to promise me to do exactly  as I tell you, in every instance. You trust me to do only what is best for both  of us, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  both of us&mdash;yes, Barry.&rdquo; The blue eyes were very sad, but the soft voice did not  falter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a trump, my own little trump! There are some dark hours ahead, darling. I don&rsquo;t  know just how things will turn. But I&rsquo;m trying to head off trouble, and I hope  to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,  Eugene Courtenay didn&rsquo;t kill Eric, did he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Natalie, he didn&rsquo;t That clairvoyant business was all poppycock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did she read those questions, Barry? I think that was wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was, Natalie. I concede you that She couldn&rsquo;t have used any trickery there&mdash;there  was absolutely no chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  really read them, then, by clairvoyant sight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see any other explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  do I. Then, why wasn&rsquo;t her vision of the&mdash;the scene in the studio, the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t say but what somebody did slip past Joyce and get  into the room that way. But it wasn&rsquo;t Courtenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it was, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you don&rsquo;t. Now, my own little girl, remember, you&rsquo;ve promised me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  love, honour and obey you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  darling!&rdquo; and Natalie&rsquo;s speech was interrupted by an impulsive kiss. &ldquo;You  blessed angel! But you mustn&rsquo;t say such things, they unnerve me&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve a hard  row to hoe, my girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  by doing the things you just promised to do. I want you to, of course; it was  only the suggestion in the phrase you used that drove me crazy! Some day,  sweetheart, you shall promise before witnesses; but just now, swear to me  alone, that you will obey my least dictate in this&mdash;this trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, Barry,&rdquo; and, solemnly, Natalie lifted her scarlet, curved lips for the  kiss that sealed the compact. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts is here,&rdquo; said Joyce, looking in at the door; &ldquo;he wants to see Natalie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t see him!&rdquo; and Natalie clung tremblingly to Barry, &ldquo;what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  just as I tell you, dearest. See him, of course. And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll have to dress. Go on down, Barry, and talk to him till I come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  seemed to turn brave all in a moment at Barry&rsquo;s words. Stannard went  downstairs, and Joyce helped the girl to slip into a house-gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pretty one,&rdquo; she stipulated. &ldquo;I want him to like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if any one could help doing that,&rdquo; and Joyce selected a little grey velvet,  with lots of soft lace falling away from the round-cut bodice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  she said, as Natalie hastily twisted up her hair and thrust a couple of shell  pins in it, &ldquo;you look a dream! a demure little dream. Natalie, be careful, won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl gave Joyce a long look, and said softly, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;for his sake.&rdquo; Then she went  slowly downstairs.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts was talking with Mrs. Faulkner as Natalie entered. He jumped up, and  greeted the lovely girl with an impulsive, &ldquo;So sorry to trouble you, but I must  ask you a question or two, and I promise to cut it short.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; and Natalie gave him one of her confiding smiles.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  hesitated. How could he ask a fairy like that, a rude, blunt question. But it  had to be done, and he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s about Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s will. Did you ever  see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clearly,  Natalie was surprised. It seemed to be not the query she had looked for. But  she was calm. After the slightest pause, she said slowly, very slowly, as if  choosing her words, &ldquo;No, Mr. Roberts, I have never seen Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s will.  Why should I see it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know he left you a large sum of money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I know that. Mr. Stiles informed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not know of it before Mr. Stiles told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  glanced at Barry, who smiled at her. &ldquo;Yes; that is, I knew Mr. Stannard had  left me a bequest, but I did not know how much. Nor did I care!&rdquo; Natalie lost  her self-control. &ldquo;Do you suppose I wanted that money? I did not, and I do not!  I refuse to take it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear child,&rdquo; said Beatrice Faulkner, rising and going to sit beside her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  say such things. The money is honestly yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so fast, Mrs. Faulkner,&rdquo; said Roberts, amazed at Natalie&rsquo;s excited words; &ldquo;we  cannot feel sure the money honestly belongs to Miss Vernon until we know who  altered Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s will. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned quickly to Natalie with his question, as if anxious to get the miserable  business over. &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; she replied, with disdain in every line of her  face. &ldquo;In the first place, Mr. Bobsy&mdash;I mean, Mr. Roberts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  light laugh that greeted her slip of the tongue served to break the tension of  the moment. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said, and her dimpling smile of embarrassment  would have turned the head of an anchorite. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve heard you called  that, and, though I didn&rsquo;t mean to be familiar, I&mdash;I got sort of mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, Miss Vernon, it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. One Robert&rsquo;s as good as the  other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  funny to have two names alike, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and Natalie&rsquo;s voice shook a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and then with an effort, Bobsy returned to the attack. &ldquo;You know nothing of the  change in the will, then, Miss Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly don&rsquo;t. Did somebody change the text?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It&rsquo;s a mysterious affair. But if you know nothing about it, we must ferret it  out as best we can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke lightly, but his eyes never left Natalie&rsquo;s face. In fact, Roberts was by  no means asking her because he attached any importance to her spoken answer, but  because he hoped by her expression or by some inadvertent slip, to learn the  truth, even though she tried to conceal it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Roberts,&rdquo; she said, suddenly, &ldquo;if I wish to go away from this house, is there  any reason I should not do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather you would ask somebody else that, Miss Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom  shall I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Steele, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am answered. You mean I would not be allowed to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it would be better for you to remain where you are. There may be  developments shortly, that will call for your presence, though they may not  affect you seriously. Please don&rsquo;t plan to go away just now, but, also, don&rsquo;t  think my advice more indicative than it is meant to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Roberts  went off, and the four people he left behind him sat in a constrained silence.</p>
  <p>At  last, Beatrice spoke. &ldquo;We must all band together to save Natalie,&rdquo; she said,  very seriously. &ldquo;There is no use deceiving ourselves; Natalie is in danger. We  know and love her, so we can&rsquo;t connect her in our minds with any wrong-doing,  but to outsiders the case looks different. Let us, then, face conditions that  exist, and plan how we can best help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  only one way,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;and that is to find the real murderer. I wish I had  never let that Orienta mix herself into the matter. It&rsquo;s her talk that turned  suspicion toward Eugene. And we all know he&rsquo;s innocent. But when we try to find  out who is the criminal, Eugene&rsquo;s name comes up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sorry we had the clairvoyant,&rdquo; said Beatrice, thoughtfully. &ldquo;As you say, we  all know Mr. Courtenay is innocent, but if there was an intruder, Orienta  explained how he could have entered. You wouldn&rsquo;t have heard any one pass you  in the Billiard Room that night, would you, Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m sure not; I was&mdash;I was crying&mdash;and I gave no thought to anything but my own  troubles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  somebody may have slipped by you&mdash;of course, not Mr. Courtenay, but somebody&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish that woman had seen the intruder&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; said Natalie, suddenly. &ldquo;You  know, I believe in clairvoyance&mdash;I&rsquo;m psychic myself&mdash;I wonder&mdash;oh, I wonder if I  could find out anything&mdash;in that way!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about?&rdquo; said Barry, impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mix yourself up in  those witchcraft things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t  witchcraft And, anyway, I&rsquo;ve a notion to try it. Don&rsquo;t you think I might, Mrs.  Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might  what, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  out something about the mysteries that are growing deeper and more numerous all  the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; began Beatrice, with a helpless look, but Barry said,  sternly, &ldquo;I forbid it,&rdquo; and turning on his heel, he left the room. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>XVI<br>
    Confession and Arrest</b></h2>
  <p>THAT  evening Barry Stannard was not at home, and Natalie declared her intention of  trying to learn something by psychic or clairvoyant revelation. The three women  sat in the Billiard Room, and were for the thousandth time discussing the tense  situation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  if you want to try it, Natalie, go ahead,&rdquo; said Joyce, wearily. &ldquo;It certainly  can&rsquo;t do any harm. Barry only objects because he thinks it will get you into a  nervous state&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  It makes me more nervous to be forbidden to do what I wish. Come on, let&rsquo;s go  in the studio, and try it, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather not,&rdquo; said Beatrice Faulkner. &ldquo;In a way, Barry has asked me to keep you  from this sort of thing, and I feel a certain responsibility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Natalie; &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t take any part. Just sit by and look  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;d rather not if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll go to my room. I&rsquo;ve letters to write,  and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get along better without a disturbing element.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with Beatrice,&rdquo; Joyce said, after she had gone. &ldquo;If you can do anything  at all, you can do it better with only approving minds present. What are you  going to do, anyway? I mean, how are you going to attempt it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sure, but I think I can go into a trance, like Orienta did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t go into a trance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly. But she had a sort of trancelike condition come over her. Well, come  on in the studio, and I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two went into the big room, and Natalie sat down in a small chair, directly  facing the chair in which Eric Stannard had died. She held in her hand the  scratched and defaced etched picture of herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  sit beside me, Joyce. I somehow feel if you hold my hand it will help. Now I&rsquo;ll  concentrate on the etching, and perhaps there will be a manifestation of some  sort from Eric, or I may have a vision&mdash;of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Interested,  but not very hopeful of success, Joyce sat beside the girl, and they concentrated  their thoughts on the empty chair in front of them and the man who used to use  it.</p>
  <p>For  ten minutes they sat in silence. Natalie quivered and occasional shudderings  shook her slender frame, but there was no trance or vision. And then, just as  Joyce was about to exclaim that she could bear it no longer, her nerves were  giving way, they heard a sound that was exactly the same as the sighing groan  that had reached their ears when Eric was dying. Startled, they gazed wildly at  each other, then back to the great armchair. Was his spirit still hovering  about the place it had last been in the flesh? Again they waited, and again they  heard that ghastly sound. Faint, almost inaudible, but unmistakably the voice  of the dying man. It seemed to say &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; but so low was the tone they could  scarce be sure. And then the light went out and they were in utter darkness.</p>
  <p>Natalie  gasped out a faint scream, and Joyce gripped her hand, with a whispered, &ldquo;Hush!  Don&rsquo;t scream! The servants will come in. I&rsquo;ll make a light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  rose and tremblingly made her way across the room to the main switch. It was  turned off, and with a twist, she flashed on the light. Quickly she stepped out  into the hall. There was no one there but Blake, and as the door had been  closed, he had noticed nothing. He said nobody had passed through the hall.</p>
  <p>Upstairs  Joyce ran, conscious only of a desire to find some one who would admit having  turned off the light. She ran to Beatrice Faulkner&rsquo;s room and entered without  knocking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Faulkner, looking up from the letter she was writing, &ldquo;Oh,  Joyce, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somebody  turned off the studio lights! Beatrice, who could have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turned  off the lights! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Natalie and I sat there, Natalie thought she would go into a trance, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  foolish girl! Did she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But we heard&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you now! Come with me back there, do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rising  hastily from her desk, Beatrice followed Joyce downstairs and into the studio.  There they found Natalie standing by a table in the middle of the room, looking  with a staring gaze at a large leather case that was on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  jewels!&rdquo; cried Joyce. &ldquo;Eric&rsquo;s jewels! Where did you find them, Natalie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  here on this table. I haven&rsquo;t touched them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; and Beatrice looked curiously at the girl. &ldquo;How did they get  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Natalie, dully. She seemed as one bereft of her senses. &ldquo;When  Joyce turned on the lights&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  turned them off?&rdquo; put in Beatrice, unable to hold back the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eric  did,&rdquo; said Natalie, her eyes wide with awed wonder. &ldquo;He&mdash;that is, his spirit,  was here&mdash;we heard him sigh&mdash;and he turned the lights off and then put the jewels  on the table&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Natalie, what nonsense! It couldn&rsquo;t have been Eric&rsquo;s spirit that brought that  box in here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  looked at the girl, and said, &ldquo;Did you do it, Natalie? Did you know where they  were all the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t do it. Neither did Joyce. We sat right there by Eric&rsquo;s chair&mdash;and Eric  was present&mdash;we heard him, didn&rsquo;t we, Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  did, Beatrice, we surely did. I&rsquo;d know that voice among a thousand. It was the  same groan&mdash;the same cry for help that he uttered that&mdash;that awful night. Can it  be that he came back at Natalie&rsquo;s wish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too incredible,&rdquo; returned Beatrice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it Joyce, it must have  been one of the servants, who turned off the light and put the box in here. One  who had stolen it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Blake saw nobody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  just where he was that other night. Oh, it&rsquo;s too weird. I don&rsquo;t know what to  think!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  some one came in from outside&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we were as silent as death itself. We would have heard a window or door open.  There was no sound whatever, was there, Natalie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Spirits make no sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl was still in a half-dazed state. Almost in a trance she was, even now, or,  rather, she appeared so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I feel giddy. I&rsquo;ll go to my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  went away, and the two other women stood, looking at each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must have been Natalie,&rdquo; said Joyce, reluctantly. &ldquo;You see, she did know where  the jewels were and got them out of some hiding-place when I ran up to your room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how could she turn off the lights?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, unless she has an accomplice among the servants. Sometimes I think  Blake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Joyce, don&rsquo;t implicate Blake. I feel sure he is entirely innocent. Did you hear  that voice clearly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  clearly, but unmistakably. As I say, it was so still that every sound seemed  exaggerated. But I heard Eric&rsquo;s voice as truly as I stand here. Explain it,  Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I? Except to say that there must have been some human agency. I don&rsquo;t  believe for a minute that Eric&rsquo;s ghost returned the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Natalie says he has haunted this studio ever since he died. She says he will  continue to do so, until his murderer is found and punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard of such things, but I can&rsquo;t believe it in this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will Barry say? He was so imperative that Natalie should not try the trance  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it. But I can&rsquo;t see that she has done any real harm. The jewels are  here&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it marvellous, Joyce? How could they have been brought in without  your knowing it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that, I&rsquo;m sure Natalie produced them after I left the room. I wish now I&rsquo;d  stayed here. My one thought was to get somebody else to corroborate the  mysterious happenings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure the jewels were not here on the table when you went out of the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say positively. They might have been. You see, I never thought of looking  for them. I looked about the room to see if any person were present, and I  looked thoroughly, too. But I didn&rsquo;t look on the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  could have come in at the Billiard Room door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we sat right there, you know. The case is just the same as on the night of the  murder. That&rsquo;s why Natalie insists that Eric&rsquo;s spirit turned off the lights and  put the jewels on the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  the jewels all there? Are any missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  not looked them over. At a first glance, they seem to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be that some one stole them, and just now returned them. There&rsquo;s no other  possible explanation, Joyce. It throws suspicion back to Mr. Truxton or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  Eugene Courtenay, you were going to say! Now, he didn&rsquo;t do it, Beatrice&mdash;I know  he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Weary and afraid, full of nameless horrors and uncertainties, Joyce  locked the jewels in her dressing-room safe, and went to bed.</p>
  <p>She  and Beatrice both felt they could stand no more that night, and notifying the  police of the finding of the jewels must wait until the next day.</p>
  <p>And  next day, when Bobsy Roberts came and heard the strange story he was probably  the most bewildered man on the force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it all over again,&rdquo; he said, after hearing the tale from Joyce.</p>
  <p>Patiently  she repeated the details.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Vernon?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t see her to-day,&rdquo; returned Joyce, &ldquo;the poor child is prostrated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she hope to gain by her trance performance?&rdquo; asked Roberts, mulling over  Joyce&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hoped to get some sort of manifestation that would tell her who was the  murderer. She never thought of having the jewels restored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mrs. Stannard, there&rsquo;s no use trying to dodge the issue. We&rsquo;ve been pretty  suspicious of Miss Vernon from the first. This last matter settles it, to my  mind. You know that unsent letter found in Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s desk was without  doubt meant for Miss Vernon. You know it said that she knew where the jewels  were hidden. Now, she has proved that she did know, and she produced them in  this hocus-pocus way, to hide her theft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, Mr. Roberts, I cannot believe it! Natalie is not bad enough for all that  maneuvering; nor would she, I&rsquo;m sure, be capable of it. Again, granting you&rsquo;re  right in suspecting her of making up last evening&rsquo;s events, how could she  imitate Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s voice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that was hypnotism. Miss Vernon is psychic, and, too, she evidently possesses  the power of hypnotising at will. She made you believe you heard those sounds.  She made you believe the lights went out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know the light went out! I couldn&rsquo;t be mistaken as to that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I mean she went and turned them out while you thought she still sat by your  side. Weren&rsquo;t your eyes closed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they were wide open. She did not leave her seat. The lights were turned off by  a hand other than hers, whether mortal or spirit, I cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the whole affair was of her invention and carrying out. She is responsible for  your husband&rsquo;s death, Mrs. Stannard. There is no doubt whatever of Miss Vernon&rsquo;s  guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  take that back, Roberts,&rdquo; and Barry Stannard came into the Reception Room where  the speakers were sitting. &ldquo;Miss Vernon is as innocent as an angel in this  business. I&rsquo;m ready to confess. I killed my father, and I own up to it, rather  than have Natalie suspected. If you had been any sort of a detective you would  have known from the first that I did it. But you had your head set in one  direction and nothing could change you. You know perfectly well I had motive  and opportunity. It was not premeditated, I did it on the spur of sudden  indignation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,&rdquo;  cried Joyce, &ldquo;what are you saying? You didn&rsquo;t kill Eric!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did. I thought it might blow over, and remain an unsolved mystery. But if  Natalie is to be suspected of my crime, I would be less than a man to keep  still. Take me along, Roberts, I give myself up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts stared at him. &ldquo;My plan worked,&rdquo; be said, slowly. &ldquo;I thought it was  you, really, all along, but I thought, too, the only way to get a confession  from you, was to seem to suspect Miss Vernon. As you say, no man could sit  still and see a woman bearing the blame that belongs to him. You came in  through the Billiard Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Barry. &ldquo;Mrs. Stannard didn&rsquo;t see or hear me pass her. I went on through to  the studio. I accused my father of persecuting Miss Vernon, and he turned on me  in a furious rage. We are both impetuous, we said little, but those few low  words roused all my worst nature, and, snatching up the etching needle, I  stabbed him, scarce knowing what I did. It was all over in a moment, and I had  but one thought, how to escape from that room. I flew across and turned off the  lights as a precautionary measure, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did you get out?&rdquo; asked Bobsy, breathless with interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was behind the hall door, when Blake opened it, and after he turned on the  light, I slipped behind him and Mrs. Faulkner out into the hall. They were so  bewildered at the sudden flash of light&mdash;and&mdash;what it revealed, that they didn&rsquo;t  see me at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry!&rdquo;  exclaimed Joyce, &ldquo;I would have seen you if you had done that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you had eyes for nothing but Eric&rsquo;s wounded body. You couldn&rsquo;t have torn your  gaze from that if you had wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do after leaving the room?&rdquo; asked Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went out and walked about the lawn. My head was spinning round from excitement  and shock at my own deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  stayed near the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Halpin came out and found me. He told me what had happened and I went right  back into the studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have kept this secret so long. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  you can understand. I love Miss Vernon. I want to marry her. Can I ask her to  marry a murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean if she knows it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean if she knows it. I wanted to keep the secret forever, I hoped to do so.  When she was suspected last week, I felt sure she would be cleared. Then when  the will was seen to be changed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment. Did you change the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of what has just now happened. If I had to confess, of course, I could never  marry Miss Vernon. And in that case, I wanted her to be provided for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will cannot stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care anything about that. I&rsquo;ve confessed now, my life is practically  ended. I can will my own fortune to Miss Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the jewels? Did you return those last night? And the emeralds to Mrs. Stannard  last week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Barry, slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about the jewels. Perhaps there was  a robber, after all. Say a jewel fancier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  say a little girl who was fond of jewelry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  and Barry shook his head, &ldquo;Miss Vernon knew nothing of the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the letter to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  letter wasn&rsquo;t to her, it was to some woman my father knew and feared. He never  would have given the emeralds to Natalie. The idea is preposterous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  must be found out. Then the rigamarole the clairvoyant told was true, about a  man coming into the studio&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was all true. I was the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barry&rsquo;s  voice was infinitely sad and despairing. Joyce looked at him pityingly. His  white face was drawn and his eyes were full of grief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think, Mr. Stannard, if all you&rsquo;ve told me is true, I must ask you to go with  me to Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready,&rdquo; said Barry, simply, and the two men went out </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>XVII<br>
    Alan Ford</b></h2>
  <p>JOYCE  went up to Natalie&rsquo;s room and found the girl sitting up in bed trying to eat  some of the dainty breakfast a maid had just brought her. A cap of lace and  tiny rosebuds confined the gold hair, and a breakfast jacket of pale blue  brocade was round her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo;  she said, staring at her with big blue eyes, &ldquo;where did those jewels come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, Natalie. It&rsquo;s the most mysterious thing I ever heard of. But  listen, dear, I&rsquo;ve something to tell you. Barry has confessed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  Natalie almost shrieked the word. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what I say. Barry has confessed that he killed his father. You suspected him  all the time, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and yet who else could it have been? I did think of Barry at first,  and then I decided it couldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then you suspected me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Natalie, how can I say? I did and I didn&rsquo;t. I had no notion which way to turn.  But now, even though he says so, I can&rsquo;t believe it was Barry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry!  Of course it wasn&rsquo;t Barry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he confessed, Natalie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he confessed. He couldn&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; As she spoke, Natalie was getting  out of bed, and seating herself at her dressing table began to do up her hair. &ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t mind going, Joyce, I want to dress. Run along now, I&rsquo;ll be down very  soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do?&rdquo; Joyce looked at the girl uncertainly, for she was  brushing her hair with unwonted vigour. Her eyes were tear-filled, but her face  showed a brave, determined expression, and she hurried her toilet as if  important matters impended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  now, Joyce,&rdquo; and rising, Natalie pushed her gently toward the door.</p>
  <p>Some  minutes later, Natalie came downstairs, in a trim out-of-door costume. Her  smart little hat was veiled, and she had a motor coat over her arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I take the little electric, Joyce, and drive it myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  yes, of course. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  to see Mr. Roberts. And if I&rsquo;m not home for some hours, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I may  go to&mdash;well, I may take a long drive. But I&rsquo;ll be back to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a moment Joyce saw the little electric coupe whirling down the drive.</p>
  <p>Straight  to Headquarters Natalie went, and found Bobsy Roberts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry  Stannard didn&rsquo;t kill his father,&rdquo; she said, without preamble. &ldquo;You had no right  to arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he confessed the crime, Miss Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know why he did that?&rdquo; The lovely eyes fell before Bobsy&rsquo;s surprised  glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  why? If he is not the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he isn&rsquo;t. He said all that to&mdash;to save me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  looked sharply at her. &ldquo;Is that so? And how am I to know that you&rsquo;re not  telling me this to save him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t know! That&rsquo;s just it You&rsquo;ve not wit enough to know what is the truth and  what isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you for the implied compliment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be sarcastic. This isn&rsquo;t the time for it. Please help me, Mr. Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  would have been a far less impressionable man than the detective who could have  refused the pleading glance of those pansy-blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can I help you, Miss Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way. Tell me of some detective, some really great one, who can unravel this  tangle. I didn&rsquo;t kill Mr. Stannard. Barry didn&rsquo;t, either. But he says he did,  to save me. Now, I want some one who can find the real criminal and so clear  both Barry and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you expect me to recommend somebody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I do, Mr. Roberts, I do. I know you&rsquo;re big enough and honest enough to admit  that you are at the end of your rope, and if you know of any one&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care  how much he costs, I must have him&mdash;I <i>must!</i> Tell me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ll tell you, because I can&rsquo;t refuse you, but also because I know he will only  verify our conclusions. You must know, Miss Vernon, we&rsquo;ve had our eye on young  Stannard all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I thought you were sure the criminal must be Mrs. Stannard or myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  did think that at first&mdash;you see, we have to think what the evidence shows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  never mind that now. Who is this man you have in mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alan  Ford. He&rsquo;s not one of the story-book wizards, but he&rsquo;s a big light in the  detective field, and he can find out if any one can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  gave her the New York address of the detective, and Natalie rose to go. Then,  acting on a sudden impulse, &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  New York?&rdquo; cried the amazed Bobsy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It&rsquo;s only a couple of hours&rsquo; run, and I don&rsquo;t want to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I&rsquo;m glad to go, if I can arrange it&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  arrange it. I want you so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now,  when a little flower-faced girl looks pleadingly out of heavenly colored eyes,  and her red mouth quivers with fear of being refused, few men have the power to  say no. Anyway, Bobsy hadn&rsquo;t, and he managed to &ldquo;arrange&rdquo; it, and in a few  moments they were on their way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you&rsquo;d want to see Stannard,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;d rather not, until I see if I can get the great Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little car ate up the miles, and soon they were in the crowded streets of the  city.</p>
  <p>Alan  Ford was in his office, and received them with his characteristic quiet  dignity.</p>
  <p>The  tall, big man looked taller than ever as he stood beside the petite model, his  grey eyes looking down into her eager blue ones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked, kindly, and smiled at her because he couldn&rsquo;t help  it. The winsome face made everybody smile from sheer gladness of looking at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you take a case, Mr. Ford? An important murder case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Stannard case?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to say yes, but I am just starting on a Western trip, and I shall be gone  at least a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Great  crystal tears formed in Natalie&rsquo;s eyes and one rolled down her cheek. She  couldn&rsquo;t possibly help this, the teardrops were beyond her control. But they  stood her in good stead, for Alan Ford couldn&rsquo;t bear to see a woman cry. It  unnerved him as no danger or terror could do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  please,&rdquo; he said, impulsively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;m so disappointed! You see Barry Stannard has confessed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Young Stannard confessed! Then what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Barry didn&rsquo;t do it. He confessed to save me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did you do it?&rdquo; The question was in the tone of a casual every-day inquiry, but  few people would have replied anything but the truth with Alan Ford&rsquo;s gaze upon  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t. You must come up there and find out who did do it. Oh, can&rsquo;t you  manage somehow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coaxing face was brightened by a sudden hope, and Alan Ford couldn&rsquo;t bring  himself to dash that hope from the lovely beseeching girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  makes a difference, now that they&rsquo;ve arrested Stannard,&rdquo; he said, slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course it does! Arrested him wrongfully, too. You see, he had to say he did  it, or I would have been arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me the main facts,&rdquo; said Ford to Bobsy. And in straightforward terms, Bobsy  told the great detective all that the force had been able to accomplish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would seem,&rdquo; said Alan Ford, speaking with deliberation, &ldquo;that the criminal  must be one of the four people most nearly connected with the dead man. His  wife, Miss Vernon here, Barry, the son, or Mr. Courtenay, the lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like for you to use that term,&rdquo; said Natalie, gently. &ldquo;For Mr. Courtenay  and Mrs. Stannard could not be called lovers during Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  for you, for standing up for her. Well, I will postpone my Western trip for a  few days at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  coming,&rdquo; said Natalie, briefly, as in the late afternoon she arrived at The  Folly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is?&rdquo; asked Joyce, &ldquo;and where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  and Beatrice were having tea in the Reception Room, for by common consent all  the household avoided the Studio.</p>
  <p>The  servants shuddered as they were obliged to pass it or go through it, and  Natalie declared it was haunted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been to New York,&rdquo; the girl replied, as she flung off her motor coat, and threw  herself into a big armchair. &ldquo;Give me some tea, please, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all  about it. I&rsquo;ve engaged Alan Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is he?&rdquo; asked Beatrice, fixing a cup of tea as Natalie liked it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a great, big, splendid detective&mdash;I mean big in his profession&mdash;and he&rsquo;s also the  biggest man I ever saw, physically.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I am glad!&rdquo; exclaimed Joyce. &ldquo;I think Mr. Roberts has done all he could, but I  don&rsquo;t think he has much real cleverness. Do you, Beatrice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And yet, we oughtn&rsquo;t to judge him too harshly. He&rsquo;s had a hard time of it, for  every new bit of evidence he gets, or thinks he gets, seems to point to some  one of the family here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it,&rdquo; agreed Natalie, &ldquo;but Alan Ford will find the real murderer and then  we&rsquo;ll all be freed of suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that, Natalie? Alan Ford!&rdquo; And into the room strode Barry Stannard.</p>
  <p>Natalie&rsquo;s  face shone with welcome. &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I thought you were  arrested!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  a murder suspect can get bail if he has money enough,&rdquo; said Barry, &ldquo;and there  were other reasons. They wouldn&rsquo;t swallow my confession whole. But never mind  that now; tell me, did you say Alan Ford is coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, Barry, dear. I went and got him. And just in time, too, for he was going  West at once. But he&rsquo;s staying over for us, and he&rsquo;s coming out here to-morrow  morning. Isn&rsquo;t it fine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!  You&rsquo;re a trump, Natalie. You know, girl, don&rsquo;t you, why I confessed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do. I was sure you couldn&rsquo;t make the police believe you, and then I  knew it would swing back to me. So I had to take desperate measures, and I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barry,&rdquo;  said Joyce, &ldquo;your attempts to get suspicion turned your way, or any way, are  too transparent. You scratched up the window frame to make it appear a burglar  had entered there, and nobody believed it for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it, I&rsquo;m no good as a deceiver. But, oh, Natalie, don&rsquo;t think I suspected  you, but I knew others would, and did, and I was frantic And I vowed I did it,  in an effort to distract their attention from you. But your going yourself for  Ford, clears you in every one&rsquo;s eyes, and now he&rsquo;ll find the man. It was some  man who came in&mdash;it has to be. There is no other explanation&mdash;positively none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t Eugene!&rdquo; whispered Joyce, her face drawn with new apprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Beatrice, soothingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry over that, Joyce,  dear. Mr. Wadsworth has exculpated Mr. Courtenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  nothing seems sure,&rdquo; Joyce said, with a sad shake of her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it will be sure, once Alan Ford gets here,&rdquo; declared Barry. &ldquo;I can hardly wait  to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alan  Ford arrived the next morning. When he entered the Reception Room, his tall,  commanding presence seemed to fill the whole room. With perfect courtesy, he  greeted Joyce first, and then the others, and finally seated himself, facing  the group.</p>
  <p>Though  not to be called handsome, his face was fine and scholarly, and his iron grey  hair made him look older than his fifty years. His manner was quiet, but alert,  as if no hint or lightest word could escape his attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us waste no time,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;for my business engagements are pressing, and  what I do here must be done as quickly as possible. I can promise you nothing,  for the accounts I have read of this case make it seem to me that your local  workers have done all that could be expected of them. The whole affair is  mysterious, but sometimes a new point of view or the opinions of a different  mind may lead to something of importance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the main details, then?&rdquo; asked Barry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  main details as told in the papers, yes. Also, I&rsquo;ve seen Mr. Roberts this  morning, and I&rsquo;ve discussed matters with him and with Captain Steele. But never  mind those sources of information. I want the stories of each one of you here.  And, if you please, I want them separately, and in each instance, alone.  Otherwise, I cannot take the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  of course, Mr. Ford,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;we will agree to anything you stipulate.  Please direct us, and we will obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  first, I will talk with Mr. Stannard, and later with the ladies. &nbsp;Also, I must ask that the interviews be in the  Studio, the room where the crime took place. This is not only because it is  more appropriate, but I can think better in a large room. This little  low-ceiled box of a room doesn&rsquo;t give me space to think!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ford&rsquo;s  winsome smile took all hint of rudeness from the words, and as he rose, his  great height and proportionate bulk seemed to bear out his statement, and the  assumption that his mind was of wide scope and far-reaching limits, made it  seem plausible that he felt stifled in a small or low room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you haven&rsquo;t yet been in the studio,&rdquo; said Natalie. &ldquo;How do you know it is big  and high?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was so described in the newspaper accounts. That is why I took an interest in  the case. Also, I am willing to admit, I paused for a glance in at the studio  door, as I came into the house, and before I entered this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  queer man,&rdquo; thought Natalie. &ldquo;Why should a great detective talk about such  foolish details as large or small rooms? Why should he take an interest in a  case because of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  others had similar thoughts, but no comment was made on the visitor&rsquo;s  peculiarities, save that Beatrice Faulkner seemed to feel obliged to defend her  husband&rsquo;s architectural ideas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rooms are carefully proportioned,&rdquo; she said, pleasantly, but with a touch of  pride in the fact. &ldquo;The architect who designed them knew just what measurements  were most effective from a technical and artistic point of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rooms are all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Ford, smiling kindly at the speaker, &ldquo;the  trouble is with my own foolish vagaries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  led by Barry, they all went into the studio. Alan Ford looked around him, with  the most intense admiration expressed on his fine face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Faulkner, your late husband was indeed a genius. I have never  seen a more perfectly proportioned room, or one more appropriately and  effectively decorated. The windows are marvels and the furniture is in every  respect fitting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Joyce, &ldquo;Mr. Stannard furnished the room. It was not built for a studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is, then, the joint product of two geniuses. I know of Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s  reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  a few moments Alan Ford seem to forget the errand on which he had come. He was,  it was plain to be seen, deeply impressed with the beautiful apartment, and his  dark, deep-set grey eyes roved about from pictures to statues, from furniture  to decorations with admiring and approving gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you a picture of Mr. Stannard?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and Joyce took a photograph from a small chest full of portraits. &ldquo;This is a  photograph of a painting done by himself. It was made about four years ago, but  he changed little since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ford  took the card and studied it. He saw a noble head and brow, fine features, and  a general air of self-appreciation that was, however, not to be called conceit.  The mouth had a few weak lines about its corners, but on the whole it was the  presentment of a man of genius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you a photograph of the subject in life?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;not taken from a painting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but not a recent one,&rdquo; replied Joyce. &ldquo;Except for some little snapshots,&rdquo; and  she put a half-dozen small pictures in the hands of the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  yet,&rdquo; Ford said, and he carefully scrutinized the papers.</p>
  <p>But  all the pictures of Eric Stannard gave the same impression of power,  self-confidence and dominance. </p>

    Questions and Answers</b></h2>
  <p>STILL  studying the face of the artist, Alan Ford indicated his desire to begin the successive  interviews with the members of the household. All but Barry left the room, and  the young man sat down near the absorbed detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  father was a handsome man,&rdquo; Ford said, as he laid aside the pictures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed Barry. &ldquo;I wish I might have been more nearly his type.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Physically,  you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and mentally, too. I admit my father&rsquo;s moral weakness, yet he was not a bad  man, as men go. His artistic temperament was responsible for his being blamed  far more than was just or right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is probably true,&rdquo; said Ford, seriously. &ldquo;To a man of that sensitiveness to  beauty many things seemed right that were not. Now, Mr. Stannard, will you  please tell me everything about the actual facts as you know them, regarding  the hour or half hour in which the crime was committed? Don&rsquo;t shade or colour  your story to shield Miss Vernon, for such a bias will only prejudice my  judgment against her. Tell me exactly the events as they followed one another  to your positive knowledge, and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Mr. Ford, I will do just as you ask. But let me say this first; there are  three suspects&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, there are four suspects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you count Mr. Courtenay, yes. But the three in the house, my stepmother, Miss  Vernon and myself, have been definitely suspected and, probably, are still. So  I want to say, that if one of us must remain under suspicion, let it be me. It  is impossible that a woman did this deed. So investigate along the line of  Courtenay or myself, but as I feel quite sure you can get no real evidence  against him, use me for a scapegoat, while you are finding the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you are not the criminal, Mr. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were, would I be apt to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  couldn&rsquo;t help telling me. Not in words, but in manner, in glance, in intonation,  in a dozen ways, over which you have no control.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I told you so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not. I know positively you did not kill your father. But, go on, please,  with your recital.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  after dinner, Miss Vernon and I sat on the terrace&mdash;&rdquo; Barry paused. &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo;  he broke out, &ldquo;how can I tell you the straight truth? It sounds exactly as if  Natalie did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alan  Ford almost smiled at the boy&rsquo;s impetuous exclamation, but merely prompted him,  &ldquo;Yes. Go right on, remember the truth will help Miss Vernon more than any  falsehood possibly could. Have you never heard of seemingly incriminatory  evidence of one leading straight to another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right, then. We sat there a long time, and then we talked about&mdash;about getting  married. I was bothered about it, for Dad had vowed if I married Natalie, he&rsquo;d  cut me out of his will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  why you altered the will in Miss Vernon&rsquo;s favour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t alter that will! This is man to man, now, Mr. Ford. I&rsquo;m telling you the  truth. I didn&rsquo;t change that will, and Miss Vernon didn&rsquo;t, either. I don&rsquo;t know  who did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  find that out. It won&rsquo;t be a great surprise to learn the truth about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know it won&rsquo;t? Do you know who did the forgery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. Or perhaps there wasn&rsquo;t any forgery. But go on, my dear boy, with your  story. I told you, you know, I&rsquo;ve not much time to give you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. We talked about getting married, and I got awful mad and I said if  Father didn&rsquo;t stop his nonsense with her, I&rsquo;d kidnap her and run away. And  Natalie knew that if we did that, Dad would cut us both out of his will,&mdash;and  she isn&rsquo;t a bit mercenary, it wasn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was it, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  only that we&rsquo;re&mdash;why, hang it all, decent people don&rsquo;t do those things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Decent  people don&rsquo;t commit murder, either,&rdquo; said Ford, very gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I know that. Well, Natalie begged me not to quarrel with father,&mdash;said she could  manage him herself. And I thought she meant by being sweet to him, and all  that, and I got mad at her, and&mdash;I walked off and left her there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  a word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I told her I was going to give the dogs a run. I was going to, too, but as I  walked away, I fell a-thinking, and I just strolled round the place alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom  did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody  at all. Maybe Courtenay or Mr. Wadsworth or some of those people passed me, I  don&rsquo;t know. I was just thinking about Natalie, and then Halpin came running out  and told me to come in the house, my father was ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you went right in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and when I saw what had happened, I felt afraid Natalie had killed him&mdash;and I  ran out and tried to make the window frame look as if a burglar had broken in.  I suppose it was foolish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly was. But I don&rsquo;t blame you. It was natural to try to shield the girl  you loved from possible suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possible  suspicion! If you had seen the situation! There were the two women, both  shivering with fear and terror, and there was the dead or dying man between  them! Why, Mr. Ford, it wasn&rsquo;t suspicion, it was certainty that one or the  other had stabbed him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why have you changed your mind since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly  because of that clairvoyant person. I don&rsquo;t believe in those things,  but&mdash;well&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not. But I can see how she would turn suspicion away from the two women in  question. Who sent for the clairvoyant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stannard did, but, first, the Priestess, as she likes to be called, wrote and  asked for a s&eacute;ance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did! How did she know she was wanted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t know. Said she read about the case, and got interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  a professional medium.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  said not. Said she only offers to help in cases that appeal especially to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.  Well, then she turned all your thoughts toward Mr. Courtenay, I am told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she didn&rsquo;t intend to. I mean, she described a man who entered the room, and who  stabbed my father, but it was Bobsy Roberts&rsquo; questions that made anybody think  of Eugene Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he kept saying, Bobsy did, &lsquo;Has he a pointed beard?&rsquo; and &lsquo;is he tall and dark?&rsquo;  and such leading hints. The woman said &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; every time, but I don&rsquo;t believe  she knew what she was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  her mysterious reading of those sealed papers? You see, I know all the main  facts, I just want your opinions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you&rsquo;ve got me there! That woman <i>had</i> to read those by supernatural power, because there&rsquo;s no other explanation. I  know a bit about legerdemain and parlour magic and there was no opportunity  whatever for any trickery. We wrote the things, sealed them, Bobsy Roberts  collected them and handed them to her. Then in the same instant he switched off  the light, and it wasn&rsquo;t half a minute before she was reading them aloud to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely  dark. And she hadn&rsquo;t moved from her chair, for her voice came from the place  she was sitting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ventriloquism?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. Not a chance. Anyway, where could she go to have a light? The studio doors  were all closed, and&mdash;why, of course, she didn&rsquo;t leave her chair, for when Bobsy  switched on the light, suddenly, there she sat, eyes closed, hands quiet,  composed and unruffled. No, sir, there&rsquo;s no explanation for that reading  business but honest-to-goodness second sight! And, she gave us back our  envelopes intact, seals unbroken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  but, Mr. Stannard, if she had power to do all that, and I don&rsquo;t doubt your word  in the least particular, isn&rsquo;t it strange that she couldn&rsquo;t see exactly who  that murderer was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  it was some one she didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  oughtn&rsquo;t her powers of second sight, if she has such, reveal to her the  identity of the man? She didn&rsquo;t know what was in your envelopes, but she told  you. Why didn&rsquo;t her supernatural powers inform her the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Ford. I&rsquo;m only telling you what I saw and heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all I want.&rdquo; And after a short further conversation, Alan Ford dismissed Barry  and asked Mrs. Stannard to come to him next.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be hard for you, I know,&rdquo; he said gently, as he placed a chair for her, &ldquo;but  I want you to tell me just what occurred at the time of Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s death.  Tell only your own part, only what you, yourself, did or saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  suspect I killed my husband?&rdquo; said Joyce, in a choking whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will depend on your story, what I suspect. Do not be afraid and do not distrust  me, Mrs. Stannard. I want to help you, in any case. Whatever the truth, I can  help you, and I want to assure you of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  infinite gentleness of his tone, the kind light in his eyes and the utter  sympathy evident in his whole manner reassured Joyce, and in a low voice she  began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have told it so many times, I know it by heart. I was in the Billiard Room with  Mr. Courtenay. I will not explain or defend the fact that I was there alone  with him, but merely state that I was. He left me, and as I was heartsick over  my own private and personal affairs, I buried my head in a sofa-cushion and  cried. Not a real crying spell of sobs and tears, but an emotion which I  endeavoured to restrain or control that I might meet others without causing  comment. As I bowed my head there, I am positive I heard my husband talking to  some woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so at first, now I am not sure it was she.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. She was in the drawing-room at the other end of the house. No, it must have  been either my imagination or some woman who had somehow entered and who  afterward disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard him say, or I thought I did, that she could have the emeralds, but he refused  to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  a little impatiently. &ldquo;I know about that. Tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I heard a strange, gasping sound, and I rushed in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the room light then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dark. The light went out that instant or a moment before. I pushed in, and I  heard a sound opposite&mdash;on the other side of the room. At first, I thought it  was my husband, but it was a quick, frightened breathing, and then the light  flashed on and I saw it was Miss Vernon, huddled against the wall&mdash;no, against a  small table, and looking scared to death. Do you wonder that I thought she had  done something wrong? For just then I caught sight of my husband, stabbed,  dying&mdash;oh, I knew in that first glance that he had been murdered. Then, I saw  Blake and Mrs. Faulkner at the other end of the room. They were shocked and  frightened, too, but I paid no attention to them, I looked right back to Eric.  And he&mdash;well, the footman did ask him who did it&mdash;and he raised his hand and said  &lsquo;Neither Natalie nor Joyce.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure that&rsquo;s what he said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure now. At the time he said it, he spoke so thickly I could scarcely  understand him, and I thought he said &lsquo;Natalie, not Joyce.&rsquo; But we had a  clairvoyant here, and she said he said &lsquo;nor&rsquo; and then I realized at once that  that was what he did say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning,  of course, that you two women were innocent, and that some other hand had  struck the blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that was what he meant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  do you not think, Mrs. Stannard, that he would have said that to shield you  both, even if one had been guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  Stannard turned white. &ldquo;I&mdash;I never thought of that,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Perhaps he  would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you feel sure, at this moment, that it was not Miss Vernon who killed your  husband?&rdquo; Joyce looked utterly miserable. Her eyes were frightened like those  of a hunted animal. But she said, bravely, &ldquo;I feel sure of that, Mr. Ford. Miss  Vernon is not one who could do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t seem to be. Will you go now, Mrs. Stannard, and please send Miss Vernon  in here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  went slowly out of the studio, and in a moment Natalie Vernon came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I afraid of you?&rdquo; she asked, as she sat facing Alan Ford. &ldquo;Need I be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  questions were not prompted by coquetry, that was evident Her tone was serious,  and she looked at the detective wistfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Miss Vernon,&rdquo; he answered, seriously, &ldquo;you have no reason to be afraid of me,  but I will tell you frankly, you have great reason to fear the consequences if  you tell me anything but the exact truth. Pardon me, if that seems a rude  speech, but great issues are at stake and prevarication on your part to the  slightest degree would baffle all my plans and hopes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell the truth,&rdquo; Natalie sighed, &ldquo;so far as I know it. But sometimes it&rsquo;s  very hard to be sure of what is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know it Now, Miss Vernon, just one word about the time and scene of the  crime. When you came into the studio, because you heard&mdash;what did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alan  Ford&rsquo;s manner was calculated to set the nervous girl at her ease, and his  kindliness made her calm and unselfconscious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard Eric moan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know at once it was Mr. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. It sounded like him, and I suppose he was in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you think ailed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe I thought of that. I just heard the curious gasping sound, as of  somebody choking, and I ran in. I didn&rsquo;t think,&mdash;I only wondered what was the  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when you entered the room was it light or dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honestly,  I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Ford. I&rsquo;ve been so quizzed and questioned about it, that I  can&rsquo;t seem to remember clearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the lights went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  just as I entered, or a minute before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, what was the first thing you saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  I tell that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  the first thing I saw, as the light flashed on,&mdash;and it rather blinded me at  first, you know. You see, I had been sitting on the Terrace, which was almost  dark, then I entered the dark room, and so when the light came suddenly, it  dazzled me, and I naturally looked straight ahead of me. I saw Mrs. Stannard,  behind her husband, and near the Billiard Room door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if she had just come in from that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so,&mdash;now. I didn&rsquo;t think so then. I thought she had killed him, and had  sort of stepped back, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  because of Madame Orienta. Haven&rsquo;t you heard about her? She cleared up the  mystery as far as Joyce,&mdash;Mrs. Stannard and I are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve heard all about her. You believe in her supernatural powers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Only I don&rsquo;t use that word. I call them psychic powers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it was supernatural to read the sealed messages as she did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I suppose it was. I suppose clairvoyance is supernatural, but we psychics  prefer other terms. You know I&rsquo;m a psychic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  is that so? And you can read sealed messages in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed, I can&rsquo;t. I wish I could. But perhaps I shall be able to some day. I  can&mdash;Mr. Ford, you believe me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  looked at him, and a slight flush came to her pale cheek as she saw his  slightly quizzical expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Vernon, I believe all you&rsquo;ve said, so far. I want to continue my confidence in  your statements, so please be very careful not to exaggerate or over-colour the  least mite. Now, just to what extent do you <i>know</i> you&rsquo;re a psychic? Not imagine or hope or think, but <i>know.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I only know that I&rsquo;ve heard the voice of Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s spirit since his death,  as clearly as I heard his mortal voice that night he died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure, Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me the exact circumstances.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>XIX<br>
    Ford&rsquo;s Day</b></h2>
  <p>MRS.  STANNARD and I were alone, here in the studio&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was Mr. Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. He wasn&rsquo;t in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Mrs. Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but she wouldn&rsquo;t stay here with us. She doesn&rsquo;t approve of any of these psychic  investigations, but she doesn&rsquo;t say much against them, out of respect to Mrs.  Stannard&rsquo;s and my wishes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  told the story of hearing faint groans, as of a dying man, and of the sudden  extinguishing of the lights.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Miss Vernon. When the lights went out, the room was quite still, was it  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deathly  silent, Mr. Ford. Joyce and I were breathless, listening for further sounds of  any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  tell me, did you hear the click of the switch as the light went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did. I heard it distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did that mean nothing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what could it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  meant, Miss Vernon, that the light was switched off by a mortal,&mdash;flesh and  blood hand. Had it been supernaturally extinguished there would have been no  sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard it,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I heard it. But I think the spirit of Mr. Stannard haunts  the whole room, and it was he who turned the light off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  means of a material switch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Natalie  looked a little uncertain. Varying expressions passed over her face as she  thought it out. Then she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spirits ever use material means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to my individual knowledge,&rdquo; returned Alan Ford gravely. &ldquo;I fear, Miss Vernon,  your belief in the spiritual influences at work in this affair is about to be  rudely shattered. Now, did you hear any other sound,&mdash;a click or thud,&mdash;after the  light went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You see, Joyce,&mdash;Mrs. Stannard jumped right up and ran across the room and  turned on the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turned  it on? It had been really turned off, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. And she turned it on. Then she opened the door and Blake was in the hall,  where he belonged. He had seen no one and had heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must have a chat with Blake. And Mrs. Faulkner, she knew nothing of it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  till Mrs. Stannard told her. She ran at once to Mrs. Faulkner&rsquo;s room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the other end of the house, on the third floor. And there she found Mrs.  Faulkner writing letters. And Mrs. Stannard told her and they came down stairs  together. Well, and after Mrs. Stannard left the room, of course, I looked  around, and there was the case of jewels on the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did they come from? How did they get there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  spirit of Mr. Stannard placed them there,&rdquo; said Natalie, solemnly. &ldquo;You may  scoff, Mr. Ford, you may suspect Blake of being mixed up in it, but you&rsquo;re all  wrong. The studio doors were locked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  you and Mrs. Stannard were in there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I locked them myself. All three. There are but three, you know. See, the one to  the front hall, the outside one to the Terrace and the one to the Billiard  Room. I locked them, and the windows were fastened too. Nobody mortal could  have come into that room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it would seem. Now, who else has these leanings toward spirit forces beside  you? Who sent for the clairvoyant lady?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody.  That is, she wrote herself to Mrs. Stannard, asking if she might come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  liked her? You believed in her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Orienta? Oh, yes. She is not an ordinary person,&mdash;I mean she is refined,  educated, cultured,&mdash;as correct in every way as we are ourselves. She&rsquo;s not a  professional medium, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. And did Mr. Barry Stannard want her to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he strongly opposed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mrs. Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  deferred to Mrs. Stannard&rsquo;s wishes. But she had no faith in her. Of course,  after Orienta read the sealed letters, Mrs. Faulkner had to believe in that,  she couldn&rsquo;t well help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Now, Miss Vernon, when you heard the groan or sigh as if the spirit of Mr.  Stannard were expressing itself, where did the sound come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seemed to come from that chair,&mdash;the chair he died in. Joyce and I sat facing it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  backs to the hall door, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but nobody could open that door, it was locked. Mrs. Stannard unlocked it when  she ran out of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positive.  We&rsquo;ve gone over the scene a dozen times or more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  seems to let Blake out, doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, that&rsquo;s all for the present, Miss  Vernon, and thank you for your courteous attention. Now, there&rsquo;s no one to  interview but the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Faulkner? She expects you to talk to her, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could she tell me? She wasn&rsquo;t in this part of the house at the spiritual s&eacute;ance,  and as to the moment of the crime, she tells no more than Blake. However, I&rsquo;ll  see her for a brief interview. It&rsquo;s always well to get all the accounts  possible.&rdquo; Natalie left the studio, and in a few moments Beatrice Faulkner came  in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a question or two, Mrs. Faulkner,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;I know you people are all nearly  distraught with these strange and sudden developments. But, tell me, what do  you think of Miss Vernon&rsquo;s story of the spirit manifestations in this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it was all the girl&rsquo;s imagination, Mr. Ford. She is not only of an  exaggerated artistic temperament, but excessively nervous and susceptible to  hallucinations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is all that, I think. Now, please tell me, very honestly and very carefully,  exactly how Mrs. Stannard looked and acted when she ran up to your room to tell  you of the strange occurrence in the studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was terribly excited, Mr. Ford,&rdquo; and she could scarcely speak. She stumbled up  the stairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I heard her. I was at my writing desk, and the house was still. Then she flew  into my room, without knocking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it her custom to knock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, she always does. And she begged me to go down stairs with her, and I did.  The rest you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and a strange tale it is. How do you suppose the jewels came to be on that  table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot say,&rdquo; Beatrice looked sad. &ldquo;There seems to be only one explanation. That  whoever had them or knew where they were, placed them there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how did the bearer of the box get into the locked room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine. The only thing I can think of is that Natalie didn&rsquo;t lock the  door as thoroughly as she thinks she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Faulkner, tell me this. I assure you I will not use your information unless  absolutely necessary. Do you suspect the footman Blake of any connivance&mdash;or of  any wrong doing in the whole matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner hesitated. Then she said, &ldquo;No, Mr. Ford, I do not. I think Blake a  thoroughly honest and trustworthy servant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who is the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I cannot say. I am, as you know, merely a visitor, who chanced to be here at  this unfortunate time. I have hesitated to express my opinions lest I do harm  to the innocent or retard the quest of the guilty. I can only answer your  questions in so far as they are not leading up to suspicion of any of my  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the right attitude, Mrs. Faulkner. I thought there was no necessity for  troubling you at all, but one or two minor points I prefer to ask of you rather  than Mrs. Stannard. Do you know the identity of &lsquo;Goldenheart&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  imagine her to be one of Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s early inamoratas. He had many, and,  moreover, I should not be surprised to learn that he called more than one by  that name. You know there was a small gift found in his desk addressed to some  one of that name, which had never been sent. It has occurred to me that the  Goldenheart of that matter, and the one to whom he wrote more recently, were  not the same person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may well be. You have a logical mind, Mrs. Faulkner. I say this to you, because  I want your help. If I should tell you that I do not suspect Mrs. Stannard or  Miss Vernon or Barry Stannard, would you then be willing to assist me in my  investigation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner looked at the detective an instant, and then said, in a low tone, &ldquo;Mr.  Courtenay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  Don&rsquo;t mention names. Let us close this conversation right here, and I will tell  you at some other time what I want you to do for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  went away, and locking the door after her exit, Alan Ford remained alone in the  studio for an hour or more.</p>
  <p>Then  he went for a walk which lasted another hour, and when he joined the family at  luncheon, he was merely a courteous, friendly guest, with no suggestion of a  detective.</p>
  <p>In  the afternoon, he requested permission to go over all of Eric Stannard&rsquo;s papers  and correspondence and spent his time until dusk at this work.</p>
  <p>At  tea time, he rejoined the others, and during the tea hour he talked of the  visit of Orienta and her wonderful performance. Over and over it was discussed,  and at each fresh detail or opinion Alan Ford grew more and more interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me of her costume,&rdquo; he said, at last, when it seemed he had heard about every  other bit of possible interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed Natalie. &ldquo;A long, full robe of a sort of sage green&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  material?&rdquo; asked Ford, and Barry looked at him in surprise. What kind of a  great detective was this who inquired concerning the texture of a costume?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  it was silk, I think,&mdash;yes, heavy silk, wasn&rsquo;t it, Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  or a silk poplin. It was not a modem, modish gown at all; it was like a draped  shawl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drapery  hanging from the shoulders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Natalie answered, her mind so intent on giving Ford the right idea, that she  didn&rsquo;t think of the queerness of the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Double  skirt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;or,  that is, a skirt, and then an over drapery in full long folds. Oh, it was  lovely!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you apt with your pencil, Miss Vernon? Could you draw a rough sketch of that  gown?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t but Mrs. Faulkner can. She&rsquo;s good at sketching draperies. Here&rsquo;s a paper  pad, Beatrice. Will you draw it for Mr. Ford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  and taking the paper, Beatrice rapidly sketched an indication of Orienta, in  her flowing robe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just right,&rdquo; said Natalie, &ldquo;but the folds were fuller, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;this will do. I only wanted to get a mental picture of how  she looked,&rdquo; and tearing the picture into strips he tossed them into a waste  basket.</p>
  <p>The  talk drifted to the house and its architecture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole house is a gem,&rdquo; said Alan Ford, enthusiastically, &ldquo;but the staircase is  a marvel. Nowhere in this country have I seen its equal. Your husband studied  abroad, Mrs. Faulkner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  years. He took great pride in building this house, as he intended it to be a  masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  it certainly is. Have you the plans of it? I should like to see them.  Architecture is one of my hobbies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I haven&rsquo;t the plans, Mr. Ford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course, they went to Mr. Stannard with the title deeds. Have you them, Mrs.  Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we never had them. I never thought about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless  they are among Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s belongings. They must have been given to him. It  doesn&rsquo;t matter. I oughtn&rsquo;t to take time to look at them, anyway. But one thing  I do want to see, and that is the picture of Mrs. Faulkner that Mr. Stannard  was engaged on at the time of his death. I&rsquo;m told it is an example of his best  work. May I have a glimpse of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beatrice  Faulkner looked a little flattered at this request, but she said only, &ldquo;Certainly,  Mr. Ford. It is in the studio.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  all went in to see it, and Barry arranged the portrait on an easel and adjusted  a light for it</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is indeed splendid,&rdquo; said Ford, in genuine admiration. The portrait was  excellent and lifelike, but more than that it was a work of art. Beatrice, in a  gown of deep ruby velvet, with the great staircase for a background, was at her  very best. Her face, always handsome, was imbued with a fine spiritual grace,  and she looked the embodiment of happiness. The whole conception was, perhaps,  a little idealised, but it was a magnificent portrait, and a stunning picture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so glad you have it, Beatrice,&rdquo; said Joyce, softly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so good and  dear, and have done so much for us all ever since Eric&rsquo;s death, I&rsquo;m happy for  you to have this remembrance of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad, too,&rdquo; and Beatrice looked at the reflection of herself through misty  eyes.</p>
  <p>Bobsy  Roberts came in while they were looking at the portrait, and he, too, was  charmed with its beauty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  staircase makes a wonderful setting. I&rsquo;m a fancier of staircases, and I think  this one beats any I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fancier of staircases, what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Natalie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve studied architecture, more or less, but the stairs have always especially  interested me. I&rsquo;ve just run across an old book, called &lsquo;Staircases and Steps,&rsquo;  and it&rsquo;s most interesting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you,&rdquo; said Alan Ford. &ldquo;And the staircase here is a gem. That&rsquo;s why I  wanted to see the plans of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t  we see them?&rdquo; asked Bobsy, turning to Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I haven&rsquo;t them, Mr. Roberts. Perhaps they&rsquo;re among my husband&rsquo;s belongings, but  I&rsquo;ve never seen them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; observed Ford, stepping out into the hall, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the wonderful proportion  of one part to another that makes the beauty of it. The stairwell, clear to the  roof, the arcaded hall, the noble high-ceiled studio and this little low-ceiled  Reception Room, fitted in just here, make up a splendid whole. Did not your  late husband feel this?&rdquo; Ford added, turning to Beatrice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she replied, briefly, and then Bobsy tore himself away from the fascinating  subject of architecture to ask Alan Ford if he had made any progress in his  investigations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have,&rdquo; replied Ford. &ldquo;I have found out a lot of things that seem to me  indicative. But it all hinges on whether there are spiritual influences at work  or not. It seems to me, if the spirit of Mr. Stannard could return to earth and  manifest itself in any way, it would prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prove  what?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Faulkner, as the detective paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I may be foolish, but it would seem to me to prove that he wanted us to stop  these investigations and let the matter remain a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  really think that!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobsy, as his estimation of Alan Ford&rsquo;s genius  for detective work received a sudden setback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I agree with Mr. Ford,&rdquo; said Beatrice, thoughtfully. &ldquo;If Eric wanted us  to continue our inquiries he would rest quiet in his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr. Ford,&rdquo; and Natalie gave a little gasp, &ldquo;do you really think, then, it was  Mr. Stannard&rsquo;s spirit that I heard in the studio? Do you think I am enough of a  sensitive to bring about a real manifestation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  things are hard to tell, Miss Vernon. But I am going to ask the privilege of  spending to-night alone in the studio. Then if any demonstration occurs, I  shall, as I told you, think there is reason to believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ford&rsquo;s  pause was eloquent of deep feeling. Truly the man was in earnest, whether he  was right or not</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I not stay there with you?&rdquo; asked Roberts, a little diffidently. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  please. I want to be alone. I shall lock myself in, and I must ask not to be  disturbed in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could stay with you,&rdquo; and Natalie sighed. &ldquo;But I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t  want me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  please,&rdquo; said Ford, gently. &ldquo;I must be alone.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>XX<br>
    On the Staircase</b></h2>
  <p>AT  Ford&rsquo;s request, the evening was spent without reference to the matter that was  uppermost in every mind. At dinner the detective was merely a pleasant and  entertaining guest Afterward, in the Drawing Room he proved himself a good  talker and a good listener, and the conversation, on all sorts of topics, was  casual and interesting.</p>
  <p>It  was nearly midnight when Ford bade them good night, and went to the studio to  hold his vigil. The others followed him in, Joyce asking if he would like any  refreshment served during the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he replied. &ldquo;It will not be so very long until daylight. And, too, perhaps  nothing will happen, and I may fall asleep. Don&rsquo;t worry about me, Mrs.  Stannard, I shall not be at all uncomfortable. See, I shall sit just where Miss  Vernon sat the other night. Right here, facing the chair in which Mr. Stannard  died. Thus, I have my back to the hall door, and the North window, but I shall  make sure that all are securely locked, and then if any manifestation occurs, I  shall have every reason to be sure it is of supernatural origin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that would make you give up the case?&rdquo; asked Beatrice, incredulously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so,&rdquo; returned Ford. &ldquo;I should probably leave here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  of all queer detectives!&rdquo; said Barry Stannard, as they went from the room and  heard the click of the key as it was turned in the door behind them.</p>
  <p>True  to his word, Alan Ford examined with minutest care every door and window. He  made sure no lock or catch was left unfastened, and then, the lights burning  brightly, he took his seat just where he had said he would, facing the chair in  which Eric Stannard had met his fate. Also, he faced the two doors that led  respectively to the Billiard Room and the Terrace. This left more than half the  room behind him and out of his line of vision. But the detective paid no  attention to that part of the studio, and rested his contemplative gaze on the  great armchair which had helped to stage the tragedy.</p>
  <p>The  hours went by. Alan Ford scarcely moved from the easy, relaxed position he had  taken at first. He closed his eyes for the most of the time, now and then  slowly opening them for a moment.</p>
  <p>His  left hand, lying on his knee, clasped some small object.</p>
  <p>It  was shortly after three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when there was the sound of a  click and the lights went out.</p>
  <p>The  studio was in absolute darkness.</p>
  <p>Ford  rose quickly and crossed the room to the light switch by the hall door. He knew  the position of the furniture, and felt his way by the chairs. As he did so, he  heard a long, gasping sigh, and a faint cry of &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time he had reached the switch and turned it on. The sudden flash of light  showed no one in the room save himself, but not pausing to look about, he  unlocked the hall door, passed quickly through and ran up the first steps of  the stairs.</p>
  <p>On  he went to the second great square landing, and there he paused. He did not  stand still, but stepped about on the landing, making exclamations to himself,  and breathing heavily. He leaned against the baluster, tapping on the newel  post with his fingers. Then, he sat down on the lowest step of the third or  upper division of the flight. He sat, tapping his foot against the stair, he  even whistled a little under his breath. He seemed anxious not to be silent.</p>
  <p>There  was a low light in all the halls, and occasionally Ford leaned his head over  the baluster and commanded a view of the hall below.</p>
  <p>Half  an hour passed, and then Joyce Stannard appeared from the hall above. She wore  a boudoir gown and slippers, and her weary eyes betokened a sleepless night.</p>
  <p>She  started with surprise at sight of Alan Ford on the stairs. But he made a motion  requesting her to be silent, and taking a bit of paper from his pocket he  wrote:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  no word. Go back to the hall above and remain there, but out of sight of this  spot, until I summon you. Overhear all you can, but on no account let yourself  be seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  read the strange message, and going back up the few steps she had descended,  she sat on a hall window seat, concealed by a light curtain.</p>
  <p>Then  Alan Ford, with a short, sad sigh, stood up and approached the panelled wall of  the staircase. Down the flights the panels of course slanted, but on the  landing they were in level row.</p>
  <p>Placing  his lips to the wall itself, Ford said in a clear low whisper, &ldquo;Will you come  out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  behind the wall he heard an agonised moan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be better,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;Do come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  moment passed, and then, a panel of the wainscot slid open and Beatrice  Faulkner stepped forth onto the landing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know all?&rdquo; she said, and her great despairing eyes looked into those of the  detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost  all,&rdquo; he returned, and his glance at her was infinitely sad. &ldquo;You killed  Stannard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, and swayed as if she would fall to the floor.</p>
  <p>Ford  assisted her to stand and then gently aided her to a seat on the stair where he  had sat a moment since.</p>
  <p>Beatrice  sank to the step and Ford closed the panel she had left open. He did not look  into the place to which the panel gave entrance, for he knew what it was. It  was the space above the Reception Room. He had seen when he entered the house  that since the Reception Room and the studio were next each other and yet there  was five or six feet difference in the height of their respective ceilings,  that space must be a sort of loft or waste room. It showed from none of the  sides. Both hall and studio were high ceiled. The staircase well reached to the  roof. There was no explanation of the discrepancy but a waste space the size of  the Reception Room and about six feet in height.</p>
  <p>This  space, of course, abutted on the studio, the hall, the stairs, and, on the  other side, the outer or Terrace wall.</p>
  <p>In  the studio the balcony ran along the wall at about the height of the stair  landing on the other side. Ford guessed at once that ingress to that waste  space must be had from the studio or the stair landing or both. He now was sure  that panels from both opened into it.</p>
  <p>As  he closed the panel, he noted that there was no secret or concealed fastening.  Merely an ordinary flush spring catch, inconspicuous but not hidden.</p>
  <p>Ford  turned to the woman on the stairs. He sat down beside her. &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo;  he said, and his voice was so gentle, his face so sad, that Beatrice turned to  him as to a friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is little to tell,&rdquo; she said, wearily. &ldquo;It is the story of a great love, a love  too big and strong to be conquered by a weak-willed woman. I tried&mdash;oh, I tried&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  give way, Mrs. Faulkner, just tell me the main facts. You knew Mr. Stannard  years ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was his first love. We were schoolmates. I always loved him&mdash;more than loved  him. I worshipped, adored him. He loved me,&mdash;but he was always fickle. He loved  every woman he saw. Then,&mdash;he married&mdash;his first wife, I mean, and I thought I  should die. But never mind the past. I married, and I tried to forget Eric. My  husband built this beautiful home, but he had financial troubles and couldn&rsquo;t  keep it. Eric Stannard bought it, and meanwhile his wife had died, and he  married my friend Joyce. I tried to be reconciled, but the demon of jealousy  tore my very heart out. I gave over this house to them and went away. A  portrait of myself was to be part of the purchase price, and&mdash;even though I knew  it would be acute torment to see Eric happy here with Joyce, I came to stay a  month and have the picture painted. As I feared, the necessarily intimate  association between the artist and myself quickened my never-dying love for  him, until I was almost frantic. I could have stood it, though, had it been  only his wife. But when he fell desperately in love with the model, I resented  it for Joyce and myself both. But I had no thought of killing him,&mdash;don&rsquo;t think  that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was done on a sudden impulse, then.&rdquo; Ford was watching her closely. He knew  that her enforced calm might give way at any instant and he strove to speak  quietly and lead her gently on to a confession. Moreover, he trusted that Joyce  was listening, as he had asked her to do. Thus the confession would be  witnessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was this way,&rdquo; and Beatrice looked piteously into his kind eyes. &ldquo;Mr. Wadsworth  asked me that night to marry him. We were in the drawing room, as you know. I  wouldn&rsquo;t say yes, for I still had a faint hope of winning Eric. It was absurd  for me to think it, but I was desperate. After Mr. Wadsworth left me, I sat a  moment in the drawing room, and then I resolved to go to Eric, by the secret  passage, of which only he and I knew, and beg him to put Joyce away and take  me. I say this without shame, for I was&mdash;and am, still, so madly in love with  him, that I had no shame regarding it, and would have suffered any ignominy or  humiliation to win him. I went through that small space; it is not really  secret, but no one has ever noticed it, and I went through to the studio, and  stepping in the room, on the little balcony, I saw Eric below me, gazing at the  etching of Natalie with an adoring look. He bent down and kissed the picture,  and then I descended the stairs and spoke to him. I told him that Natalie loved  Barry and hated him. I urged him to divorce Joyce and let her marry Eugene  Courtenay and I begged him to marry me. He laughed at me! I shall never forget  that laugh! But that wasn&rsquo;t why I killed him. It was because he turned again to  that picture of Natalie and into his face came a look that I had never seen  there. A look of love such as I had never been able to call forth on his face,  a worshipping passion that transcended all love I had ever dreamed of. And that  he felt for a little girl who hated him. Jealousy maddened me, and snatching up  an etching tool I marred the wax beyond recognition. He turned on me, his face  livid with rage. The contrast,&mdash;the look of love he had for the girl, the look  of venomous hate he gave me, bereft me of my senses. No, I do not mean I did  not know what I was doing,&mdash;I did know. I fully meant at that moment to kill  him, and then to kill myself, that we might at least die together. I should not  have thought of killing him if I hadn&rsquo;t chanced to have that tool in my hand.  Nor should I have wanted to kill him but for his scorn of me and his love for  her. The two together drove me wild, and I stabbed him in a moment of fierce  passion that was love, not hate. Then, as I was about to draw forth the needle  and stab myself, I saw that he was not dead. He looked at me, and I couldn&rsquo;t  say it was with hatred. I think&mdash;I honestly think&mdash;that he gloried in my  deed,&mdash;you cannot understand,&mdash;it is a strange idea, but I think he realised at  last the depth of my love and appreciated it. Anyway, I read that in his face,  and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to leave a world that still held him. I didn&rsquo;t dare  remove the needle, lest it bring about his death,&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t dare remain and be  found there with him. My mind fairly flew. I thought so fast and so clearly, I  concluded to escape by the panel and return quickly through the hall and thus  coming upon him, apparently innocently, save his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  crossed the room,&rdquo; Ford prompted, for the speaker&rsquo;s strength was failing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I crossed the room, as deliberately as if nothing had happened. I turned off  the light, that I might make good my escape. I flew through the panelled space,  and in a few seconds I was out at this end, here on this landing and down the  stairs. I saw at once that Blake had heard something, but whether it was a  sound from Eric, or the noise of my departure I did not then know. I spoke to  the man,&mdash;and the rest you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were surprised when the light was turned on to see the two women there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was dumfounded. I couldn&rsquo;t think at first what it would mean to me&mdash;or to them.  I had no thought of allowing them to be suspected of the crime, but  circumstances were too strong for me. They were found there, near the dying  man,&mdash;I had, to all appearances come in from the other end of the  room,&mdash;naturally they were suspected. And then reaction had come; no longer was  I keyed up by that torment of jealousy, that spur of scorned love. I had time  to think,&mdash;even when all were wondering and questioning, I had time to think.  And I concluded I would never confess unless I was obliged to do so, to save  some one else. I decided to devote every energy and use every effort to divert  suspicion from all in the household. It was I who really arranged for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the clairvoyant,&rdquo; said Ford, as Beatrice paused from sheer weakness of breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you understand that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hired her, instructed her to write to Mrs. Stannard, and you told her what to  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I wanted her to make it appear that the murderer was a man who had entered  through the Billiard Room. I meant for the man&rsquo;s identity to be absolutely  unknown. But they managed to fasten it on Mr. Courtenay and my plan failed  utterly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I had about decided to tell the truth. When they arrested Barry, I quite  decided. And then you came. I knew that was my death knell. But when you said  if the spirit manifestation appeared in the studio to-night&mdash;that was a trap,  wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mrs. Faulkner, it was a trap. I knew whoever had been playing &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; by the  use of the panelled space, would do it again to-night at my words, and I felt  sure it would be you. I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you are, Mr. Ford. I know from your whole attitude you are sorry for  me. Otherwise, I could not have told you all this as I have done. You are more  like a father confessor than a detective. It helps a little to know you are  sorry for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did Orienta read the papers? The pocket-light method?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She is very clever; I&rsquo;ve known her for years. She is not a medium at all. I  persuaded her that to do as I asked would save innocent people from being  suspected. Of course, she didn&rsquo;t know I was guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you were &lsquo;Goldenheart&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It was Eric&rsquo;s old pet name for me. He wrote that letter to me, giving me the  emeralds if I would cease asking for his love. He said I knew where the jewels  were, because he always kept them in the panelled space,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we called  it,&mdash;and Joyce did overhear him saying to me in the studio practically what he  had written in the letter. Had she not been so wrapped up in her own heart  trouble, she would have heard it clearly. Of course, too, that little golden  heart that was bought and never presented was meant for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told Orienta to say that Mr. Stannard said &lsquo;Neither Natalie <i>nor</i> Joyce&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for I really think that was what he did mean to say. He wouldn&rsquo;t implicate me,  even with his dying breath, but he tried to clear them. He was a wonderful man,  Mr. Ford. Not a good man, perhaps, but a brave one. He would have defended any  or all of us, but he had no chance. My love for him has been the mainspring of  my whole life. Instead of forgetting him, I grew more madly in love with him  year by year. I had no business to come here, and let him paint me. Those hours  when I posed for him were the happiest I have ever known. That&rsquo;s why the  portrait is of a happy woman. I hoped against hope that I could yet win him  back. But I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I can only follow him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  quietness of Beatrice&rsquo;s voice had lulled any suspicions Ford might have had of  her intent, and when she drew from the folds of her bodice an etching needle,  exactly like the one that had killed Eric, and drove it into her own breast,  Ford wheeled suddenly and grasped her hand,&mdash;but too late. The deed was done.</p>
  <p>At  his exclamation, Joyce ran down from the hall above, where she had been  listening to Beatrice&rsquo;s story. She sank down beside the wounded woman and took  the drooping figure in her arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive  &ldquo; moaned Beatrice. &ldquo;Joyce,&mdash;forgive,&mdash;I&mdash;I loved him so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;yes,&rdquo;  soothed Joyce, scarce knowing what she said. &ldquo;What can we do, Mr. Ford? Oh,  what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  I fear. Call help. Shall I ring?&rdquo; Ford hastened to the nearest bell he could  notice and rang it. Immediately people began to gather, servants, family,&mdash;and  all sorts of contradictory orders were given. But with his finger on the pulse  of the dying woman the detective tried to learn yet more facts. &ldquo;The will,&rdquo; he  asked, bending above her. &ldquo;Who changed it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eric  himself,&rdquo; Beatrice answered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why&mdash;oh, Eric!&rdquo; Her faced beamed with a  strange radiance, and then sinking back in Joyce&rsquo;s arms, Beatrice Faulkner  breathed her last.</p>
  <p>The  next day Alan Ford declared he must hasten away as his engagements were  pressing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  tell us more of your work,&rdquo; implored Bobsy Roberts, &ldquo;give us a few moments  more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  tell us about that clairvoyant woman,&rdquo; said Barry. &ldquo;If she was a fake, how did  she read those papers in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  realised, before I came up here at all,&rdquo; said Ford, &ldquo;that there had to be some  secret means of entrance to the studio. I see now, it was never meant to be secret.  The architect made the Reception Room ceiling lower than the studio ceiling,  because it was a smaller room and he observed due proportions. This left a  space there, but it was not concealed or hidden. The catches on both doors are  merely small ones and inconspicuous but not concealed. Mr. Faulkner left all  the house plans in that loft and Eric Stannard knew of it. He chose to conceal  his jewels there as being a convenient place. Only he and Mrs. Faulkner knew of  the space, but that was merely a chance happening. He, in no sense, kept it a  secret. When I read the accounts in New York papers I felt the case must hinge  on another entrance of some sort. When I reached here I saw at once that there  was a discrepancy in the heights of those two ceilings, and I worked from that.  I was sure the spirit manifestations were made possible by human means working  through that concealed space, and I found I was right. I assumed it was  probably Mrs. Faulkner who played the spirit as she refused to show the plans  of the house, and my theories, based on those plans, left her free to do all  she did do, without being discovered. I found she could have placed the jewels  on the table that night and returned to her room through the little loft, and  be seated at her desk, writing, when Mrs. Stannard reached her room. She said  she heard Mrs. Stannard coming up stairs, but as the door was shut and the  stairs thickly carpeted, this was unlikely. So I assume she was expecting her.  All facts pointed to the guilt of Mrs. Faulkner, but they were by no means  obvious. So, when I said if spirits came to the studio last night I should drop  the case to-day, I meant because it would be solved. But Mrs. Faulkner thought  I would give it up as unsolvable, so she played &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; again. I had in my  hand a tiny mirror of the sort that shows what is passing at one&rsquo;s back. I  heard, as I sat there, the soft opening of the panel in the studio balcony, and  I knew she was coming down the little stair. I heard her click off the light,  and just as she did so, I caught a glimpse of her in my mirror. So I went out  at the hall door, snapping on the light as I passed, and went up on the grand  staircase, knowing I would head her off, and have her practically penned in  there. Mrs. Stannard found me waiting there, and I arranged for her to witness  the confession that I knew must come. I did not foresee that Mrs. Faulkner  would take her own life, but perhaps it is as well. There was no happiness or  peace for her in this world, it was better she should expiate her own sin. Poor  soul, she was a victim of a love that proved too great for her human nature to  strive against. As to the will, I felt sure Mr. Stannard had made that change  himself. It looked like his writing, and I felt sure neither Miss Vernon nor  Mr. Barry Stannard would have done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you picked out the truth from the maze of probabilities and suspicion and false  evidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bobsy  looked at the great detective in an awed way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gained most of my information and formed most of my conclusions from my talks  with each one separately. I am a fairly good judge of character, and I saw at  once neither Mrs. Stannard nor Miss Vernon was guilty. They were both uncertain  and indefinite in their testimony. They scarcely knew even the sequence of  events at the time of the tragedy; if they had been telling untruths, they  would have been positive in their statements. Also, I saw at once Barry  Stannard and Miss Vernon more than half feared each other guilty and each was  ready for any sacrifice or effort to save the other. This let them both out,  for neither could be guilty and suspect some one else! Mr. Courtenay had  practically no real evidence against him, so it came back to Mrs. Faulkner. I  talked to her enough to strengthen my suspicion in that direction and then tested  her by the night in the studio. She proved herself the source of the &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo;  manifestations, and showed how she did it. That left only the matter of getting  her confession. I feel deep pity for the poor woman; she led a sad, miserable  existence because of a mistaken love. Also, I must admit that she was of a  different stamp from the people here. Mrs. Faulkner was capable of strong  passion that did not stop at crime. I judge the rest of you would not be, and I  do not think I am mistaken in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alan  Ford looked around at the pure sweet face of Natalie, the noble countenance of  Joyce, and the brave boyish frankness that shone in Barry&rsquo;s glance and sighed  as he thought of the smouldering fires in the deep eyes of the woman who was  conquered by her own evil passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  tell us about the sealed reading,&rdquo; insisted Bobsy, as Ford rose to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; cried Natalie, &ldquo;how was that done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the tricks of the trade,&rdquo; said Ford. &ldquo;You know there are dozens of ways to  read sealed writings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but what way did she use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way. You know, I insisted on a full description of her dress. When I found it  was of full pattern and made of an opaque material, I understood. You see, if a  message is written with ink, and if the paper is slipped, unfolded, into a  moderately thin envelope, the writing can be read with ease in the dark by  holding an electric pocket flashlight behind the envelope. Orienta, the room  being darkened, drew the loose folds of her gown over her head, and thus  shielded, took a little flashlight from her pocket, read them all, by its aid,  then returning the light to her pocket, remembered the questions and spoke them  out, both with and without a light. The second time, I believe, she read the  first ones in the dark and the others in the light. There were no signatures,  but she had learned each one&rsquo;s hand-writing from the first lot. The thing is  simple, and is the most mystifying of all sealed paper readings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  it always work?&rdquo; asked Roberts, greatly interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  total darkness, yes. Go into a dark closet and try it. Of course, Orienta&rsquo;s  drapery served to aid her and also to conceal the light from her audience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  all the answers she made up,&mdash;or Beatrice had told her,&rdquo; said Natalie,  thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Ford. &ldquo;And now I must go. I shall hope to meet you all again some day, and  if I can tell you anything more you care to learn about these make-believe  wizards, I shall be glad to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went away, and Barry and Natalie went off by themselves, to rejoice in the fact  that all veils of suspicion were lifted from them and that they had long years  ahead to help one another to forget the past and make a radiant, happy future.</p>
  <p>Joyce  had a quiet knowledge that some time in the coming years she, too, would again  know happiness, and all united in a sad pity for the beautiful but misguided  woman whose hand wrought the tragedy of Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly.</p>
