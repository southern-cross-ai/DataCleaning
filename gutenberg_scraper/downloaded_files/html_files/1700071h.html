    The Drama Of Little Things</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Gypsies!  How very delightful! I really must have my fortune told. The dear things know  all about the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Mrs. Belgrove spoke she peered through her lorgnette to see if anyone at the  breakfast-table was smiling. The scrutiny was necessary, since she was the  oldest person present, and there did not appear to be any future for her, save  that very certain one connected with a funeral. But a society lady of sixty,  made up to look like one of forty (her maid could do no more), with an  excellent digestion and a constant desire, like the Athenians of old, for &ldquo;Something  New!&rdquo; can scarcely be expected to dwell upon such a disagreeable subject as  death. Nevertheless, Mrs. Belgrove could not disguise from herself that her  demise could not be postponed for many more years, and examined the faces of  the other guests to see if they thought so too. If anyone did, he and she  politely suppressed a doubtful look and applauded the suggestion of a  fortune-telling expedition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us make up a party and go,&rdquo; said the hostess, only too thankful to find  something to amuse the house-party for a few hours. &ldquo;Where did you say the  gypsies were, Garvington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood,&rdquo; replied her husband, a fat, small round-faced man, who was  methodically devouring a large breakfast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  only three miles away. We can drive or ride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  motor, or bicycle, or use Shanks&rsquo; mare,&rdquo; remarked Miss Greeby rather vulgarly.  Not that any one minded such a speech from her, as her vulgarity was merely  regarded as eccentricity, because she had money and brains, an exceedingly long  tongue, and a memory of other people&rsquo;s failings to match.</p>
  <p>Lord  Garvington made no reply, as breakfast, in his opinion, was much too serious a  business to be interrupted. He reached for the marmalade, and requested that a  bowl of Devonshire cream should be passed along. His wife, who was lean and  anxious-looking even for an August hostess, looked at him wrathfully. He never  gave her any assistance in entertaining their numerous guests, yet always  insisted that the house should be full for the shooting season. And being poor  for a titled pair, they could not afford to entertain even a shoeblack, much  less a crowd of hungry sportsmen and a horde of frivolous women, who required  to be amused expensively. It was really too bad of Garvington.</p>
  <p>At  this point the reflections of the hostess were interrupted by Miss Greeby, who  always had a great deal to say, and who always tried, as an American would  observe, &ldquo;to run the circus.&rdquo; &ldquo;I suppose you men will go out shooting as usual?&rdquo;  she said in her sharp, clear voice.</p>
  <p>The  men present collectively declared that such was their intention, and that they  had come to &ldquo;The Manor&rdquo; for that especial purpose, so it was useless to ask  them, or any one of them, to go on a fortune-telling expedition when they could  find anything of that sort in Bond Street. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all a lot of rot, anyhow,&rdquo;  declared one sporting youth with obviously more muscle and money than brains; &ldquo;no  one can tell my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can, Billy. You will be Prime Minister,&rdquo; flashed out Miss Greeby, at which  there was a general laugh. Then Garvington threw a bombshell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better get your fortunes told to-day, if you want to,&rdquo; he grunted, wiping his  mustache; &ldquo;for to-morrow I&rsquo;m going to have these rotters moved off my land  straight away. They&rsquo;re thieves and liars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  are many other people,&rdquo; snapped Miss Greeby, who had lost heavily at bridge on  the previous night and spoke feelingly.</p>
  <p>Her  host paid no attention to her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of burglaries in this  neighborhood of late. I daresay these gypsies are mixed up in them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burglaries!&rdquo;  cried Mrs. Belgrove, and turned pale under her rouge, as she remembered that  she had her diamonds with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s all right! Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said Garvington, pushing back his chair. &ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t try on any games in this house while I&rsquo;m here. If any one tries to get in  I&rsquo;ll shoot the beast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that allowed by law?&rdquo; asked an army officer with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; retorted Garvington. &ldquo;An Englishman&rsquo;s house is  his castle, you know, and he can jolly well shoot any one who tries to get into  it. Besides, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind potting a burglar. Great sport.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  ask his intentions first, I presume,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington tartly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me. Any one getting into the house after dark doesn&rsquo;t need his intentions to be  asked. I&rsquo;d shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Romeo?&rdquo; asked a poetic-looking young man. &ldquo;He got into Juliet&rsquo;s house,  but did not come as a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  came as a guest, I believe,&rdquo; said a quiet, silvery voice at the end of the  table, and every one turned to look at Lady Agnes Pine, who had spoken.</p>
  <p>She  was Garvington&rsquo;s sister, and the wife of Sir Hubert Pine, the millionaire, who  was absent from the house party on this occasion. As a rule, she spoke little,  and constantly wore a sad expression on her pale and beautiful face. And Agnes  Pine really was beautiful, being one of those tall, slim willowy-looking women  who always look well and act charmingly. And, indeed, her undeniable charm of  manner probably had more to do with her reputation as a handsome woman than her  actual physical grace. With her dark hair and dark eyes, her Greek features and  ivory skin faintly tinted with a tea-rose hue, she looked very lovely and very  sad. Why she should be, was a puzzle to many women, as being the wife of a  superlatively rich man, she had all the joys that money could bring her. Still  it was hinted on good authority&mdash;but no one ever heard the name of the  authority&mdash;that Garvington being poor had forced her into marrying Sir Hubert,  for whom she did not care in the least. People said that her cousin Noel  Lambert was the husband of her choice, but that she had sacrificed herself, or  rather had been compelled to do so, in order that Garvington might be set on  his legs. But Lady Agnes never gave any one the satisfaction of knowing the  exact truth. She moved through the social world like a gentle ghost, fulfilling  her duties admirably, but apparently indifferent to every one and everything. &ldquo;Clippin&rsquo;  to look at,&rdquo; said the young men, &ldquo;but tombs to talk to. No sport at all.&rdquo; But  then the young men did not possess the key to Lady Agnes Pine&rsquo;s heart. Nor did  her husband apparently.</p>
  <p>Her  voice was very low and musical, and every one felt its charm. Garvington  answered her question as he left the room. &ldquo;Romeo or no Romeo, guest or no  guest,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot any beast who tries to enter my house.  Come on, you fellows. We start in half an hour for the coverts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the men left the room, Miss Greeby came and sat down in a vacant seat near her  hostess. &ldquo;What did Garvington mean by that last speech?&rdquo; she asked with a significant  look at Lady Agnes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, when does Garvington ever mean anything?&rdquo; said the other woman  fretfully. &ldquo;He is so selfish; he leaves me to do everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled Miss Greeby with a pensive look on her masculine features, &ldquo;he looked  at Agnes when he spoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Lady Garvington sharply.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby gave a significant laugh. &ldquo;I notice that Mr. Lambert is not in the  house,&rdquo; she said carelessly. &ldquo;But some one told me he was near at hand in the  neighborhood. Surely Garvington doesn&rsquo;t mean to shoot him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara.&rdquo;  The hostess sat up very straight, and a spot of color burned on either sallow  cheek. &ldquo;I am surprised at you. Noel is staying in the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage, and  indulging in artistic work of some sort. But he can come and stay here, if he  likes. You don&rsquo;t mean to insinuate that he would climb into the house through a  window after dark like a burglar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just what I do mean,&rdquo; retorted Miss Greeby daringly, &ldquo;and if he does,  Garvington will shoot him. He said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said nothing of the sort,&rdquo; cried Lady Garvington, angrily rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he meant it. I saw him looking at Agnes. And we know that Sir Hubert is as  jealous as Othello. Garvington is on guard I suppose, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you hold your tongue?&rdquo; whispered the mistress of the Manor furiously, and she  would have shaken Miss Greeby, but that she had borrowed money from her and did  not dare to incur her enmity. &ldquo;Agnes will hear you; she is looking this way;  can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if I cared,&rdquo; laughed Miss Greeby, pushing out her full lower lip in a  contemptuous manner. However, for reasons best known to herself, she held her  peace, although she would have scorned the idea that the hint of her hostess  made her do so.</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington saw that her guests were all chattering with one another, and that  the men were getting ready to leave for the day&rsquo;s shooting, so she went to  discuss the dinner in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room. But all the time she and the  housekeeper were arguing what Lord Garvington would like in the way of food,  the worried woman was reflecting on what Miss Greeby had said. When the menu  was finally settled&mdash;no easy task when it concerned the master of the house&mdash;Lady  Garvington sought out Mrs. Belgrove. That juvenile ancient was sunning herself  on the terrace, in the hope of renewing her waning vitality, and, being alone,  permitted herself to look old. She brisked up with a kittenish purr when  disturbed, and remarked that the Hengishire air was like champagne. &ldquo;My spirits  are positively wild and wayward,&rdquo; said the would-be Hebe with a desperate  attempt to be youthful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you haven&rsquo;t got the house to look after,&rdquo; sighed Lady Garvington, with a weary  look, and dropped into a basket chair to pour out her woes to Mrs. Belgrove.  That person was extremely discreet, as years of society struggling had taught  her the value of silence. Her discretion in this respect brought her many  confidences, and she was renowned for giving advice which was never taken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, my dear? You look a hundred,&rdquo; said Mrs. Belgrove, putting up her  lorgnette with a chuckle, as if she had made an original observation. But she  had not, for Lady Garvington always appeared worn and weary, and sallow, and  untidy. She was the kind of absent-minded person who depended upon pins to hold  her garments together, and who would put on her tiara crookedly for a  drawing-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara  Greeby&rsquo;s a cat,&rdquo; said poor, worried Lady Garvington, hunting for her pocket  handkerchief, which was rarely to be found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she been making love to Garvington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  No woman attracts Garvington unless she can cook, or knows something about a  kitchen range. I might as well have married a soup tureen. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t  know why I ever did marry him,&rdquo; lamented the lady, staring at the changing  foliage of the park trees. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pauper and a pig, my dear, although I wouldn&rsquo;t  say so to every one. I wish my mother hadn&rsquo;t insisted that I should attend  cooking classes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth has that to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  do with what?&rdquo; asked Lady Garvington absentmindedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re  talking about, I&rsquo;m sure. But mother knew that Garvington was fond of a good  dinner, and made me attend those classes, so as to learn to talk about French  dishes. We used to flirt about soups and creams and haunches of venison, until  he thought that I was as greedy as he was. So he married me, and I&rsquo;ve been  attending to his meals ever since. Why, even for our honeymoon we went to Mont  St. Michel. They make splendid omelettes there, and Garvington ate all the  time. Ugh!&rdquo; and the poor lady shuddered.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Belgrove saw that her companion was meandering, and would never come to the  point unless forced to face it, so she rapped her knuckles with the lorgnette. &ldquo;What  about Clara Greeby?&rdquo; she demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  a cat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;re all cats, mewing or spitting as the fit takes us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Belgrove  comfortably. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why cat should be a term of opprobrium when applied  to a woman. Cats are charmingly pretty animals, and know what they want, also  how to get it. Well, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe she was in love with Noel herself,&rdquo; ruminated Lady Garvington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was in love? Come to the point, my dear Jane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara  Greeby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Belgrove laughed. &ldquo;Oh, that ancient history. Every one who was anybody knew  that Clara would have given her eyes&mdash;and very ugly eyes they are&mdash;to have  married Noel Lambert. I suppose you mean him? Noel isn&rsquo;t a common name. Quite  so. You mean him. Well, Clara wanted to buy him. He hasn&rsquo;t any money, and as a  banker&rsquo;s heiress she is as rich as a Jew. But he wouldn&rsquo;t have her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Lady Garvington, waking up&mdash;she had been reflecting about a  new soup which she hoped would please her husband. &ldquo;Clara has quite six  thousand a year, and doesn&rsquo;t look bad when her maid makes her dress in a proper  manner. And, talking about maids, mine wants to leave, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  too like Boadicea,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Belgrove, keeping her companion to the  subject of Miss Greeby. &ldquo;A masculine sort of hussy. Noel is far too artistic to  marry such a maypole. She&rsquo;s six foot two, if she&rsquo;s an inch, and her hands and  feet&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Belgrove shuddered with a gratified glance at her own slim fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the nonsense that Garvington was talking; about shooting a burglar,&rdquo; said  the other woman vaguely. &ldquo;Such nonsense, for I&rsquo;m sure no burglar would enter a  house filled with nothing but Early Victorian furniture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?  Well? Well?&rdquo; said Mrs. Belgrove impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara  Beeby thought that Garvington meant to shoot Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  in heaven&rsquo;s name! Because Noel is his heir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I can&rsquo;t help it if I&rsquo;ve no children,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, going off on  another trail&mdash;the one suggested by Mrs. Belgrove&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a happier  woman if I had something else to attend to than dinners. I wish we all lived on  roots, so that Garvington could dig them up for himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, he&rsquo;d send you out with a trowel to do that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Belgrove  humorously. &ldquo;But why does Garvington want to shoot Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he doesn&rsquo;t. I never said he did. Clara Greeby made the remark. You see, Noel  loved Agnes before she married Hubert, and I believe he loves her still, which  isn&rsquo;t right, seeing she&rsquo;s married, and isn&rsquo;t half so good-looking as she was.  And Noel stopping at that cottage in the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood painting in water-colors.  I think he is, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it isn&rsquo;t in oils, and the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?  Well? Well?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Belgrove again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t well at all, when you think what a tongue Clara Greeby has,&rdquo; snapped Lady  Garvington. &ldquo;She said if Noel came to see Agnes by night, Garvington, taking  him for a burglar, might shoot him. She insisted that he looked at Agnes when  he was talking about burglars, and meant that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Belgrove vigorously, at last having arrived at a  knowledge of why Lady Garvington had sought her. &ldquo;Noel can come here openly, so  there is no reason he should steal here after dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he&rsquo;s romantic, you know, dear. And romantic people always prefer windows to  doors and darkness to light. The windows here are so insecure,&rdquo; added Lady  Garvington, glancing at the facade above her untidy hair. &ldquo;He could easily get  in by sticking a penknife in between the upper and lower sash of the window. It  would be quite easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense you talk, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Belgrove, impatiently. &ldquo;Noel is not the man  to come after a married woman when her husband is away. I have known him since  he was a Harrow schoolboy, so I have every right to speak. Where is Sir Hubert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is at Paris or Pekin, or something with a &lsquo;P,&rsquo;&ldquo; said Lady Garvington in her  usual vague way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why he can&rsquo;t take Agnes with him. They  get on very well for a married couple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same she doesn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  loves her, for I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s that jealous that he can&rsquo;t scarcely bear her out  of his sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that he can,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Belgrove dryly. &ldquo;Since he is at Paris  or Pekin and she is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington  is looking after her, and he owes Sir Hubert too much, not to see that Agnes is  all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Belgrove peered at Lady Garvington through her lorgnette. &ldquo;I think you talk a  great deal of nonsense, Jane, as I said before,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose  for one moment that Agnes thinks of Noel, or Noel of Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara  Greeby says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know what she says and what she wishes. She would like to get Noel into  trouble with Sir Hubert over Agnes, simply because he will not marry her. As to  her chatter about burglars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington&rsquo;s  chatter,&rdquo; corrected her companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, Garvington&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s all rubbish. Agnes is a sweet girl, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girl?&rdquo;  Lady Garvington laughed disdainfully. &ldquo;She is twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mere baby. People cannot be called old until they are seventy or eighty. It is  a bad habit growing old. I have never encouraged it myself. By the way, tell me  something about Sir Hubert Pine. I have only met him once or twice. What kind  of a man is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tall,  and thin, and dark, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know his appearance. But his nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  jealous, and can be very disagreeable when he likes. I don&rsquo;t know who he is, or  where he came from. He made his money out of penny toys and South African  investments. He was a member of Parliament for a few years, and helped his  party so much with money that he was knighted. That&rsquo;s all I know of him, except  that he is very mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean?  What you tell me doesn&rsquo;t sound mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  talking of his behavior to Garvington,&rdquo; explained the hostess, touching her  ruffled hair, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t give us enough money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should he give you any?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Belgrove bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see, dear, Garvington would never have allowed his sister to marry a  nobody, unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  the nobody paid for his footing. I quite understand. Every one knows that Agnes  married the man to save her family from bankruptcy. Poor girl!&rdquo; Mrs. Belgrove  sighed. &ldquo;And she loved Noel. What a shame that she couldn&rsquo;t become his wife!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that would have been absurd,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington pettishly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use  of Hunger marrying Thirst? Noel has no money, just like ourselves, and if it  hadn&rsquo;t been for Hubert this place would have been sold long ago. I&rsquo;m telling  you secrets, mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, you tell me nothing that everybody doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what is your advice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what I have been telling you. The burglar, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have told you before, that it is rubbish. If a burglar does come here I hope  Lord Garvington will shoot him, as I don&rsquo;t want to lose my diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if the burglar is Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t be Noel. Clara Greeby has simply made a nasty suggestion which is worthy  of her. But if you&rsquo;re afraid, why not get her to marry Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t have her,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington dolefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know he won&rsquo;t. Still a persevering woman can do wonders, and Clara Greeby has  no self-respect. And if you think Noel is too near, get Agnes to join her  husband in Pekin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it&rsquo;s Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  then, Paris. She can buy new frocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes  doesn&rsquo;t care for new frocks. Such simple tastes she has, wanting to help the  poor. Rubbish, I call it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  when her husband helps Lord Garvington?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Belgrove artlessly.</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington frowned. &ldquo;What horrid things you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only repeat what every one is saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; cried Lady Garvington recklessly, and rose to depart on  some vague errand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only in the world to look after dinners and breakfasts.  Clara Greeby&rsquo;s a cat making all this fuss about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  There she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington fluttered round, and drifted towards Miss Greeby, who had just  stepped out on to the terrace. The banker&rsquo;s daughter was in a tailor-made gown  with a man&rsquo;s cap and a man&rsquo;s gloves, and a man&rsquo;s boots&mdash;at least, as Mrs.  Belgrove thought, they looked like that&mdash;and carried a very masculine stick,  more like a bludgeon than a cane. With her ruddy complexion and ruddy hair, and  piercing blue eyes, and magnificent figure&mdash;for she really had a splendid figure  in spite of Mrs. Belgrove&rsquo;s depreciation&mdash;she looked like a gigantic Norse  goddess. With a flashing display of white teeth, she came along swinging her  stick, or whirling her shillalah, as Mrs. Belgrove put it, and seemed the  embodiment of coarse, vigorous health.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taking  a sun-bath?&rdquo; she inquired brusquely and in a loud baritone voice. &ldquo;Very wise of  you two elderly things. I am going for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Belgrove was disagreeable in her turn. &ldquo;Going to the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  clever of you to guess,&rdquo; Miss Greeby smiled and nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to look  up Lambert&rdquo;; she always spoke of her male friends in this hearty fashion. &ldquo;He  ought to be here enjoying himself instead of living like a hermit in the wilds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  painting pictures,&rdquo; put in Lady Garvington. &ldquo;Do hermits paint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Only society women do that,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby cheerfully, and Mrs. Belgrove&rsquo;s  faded eyes flashed. She knew that the remark was meant for her, and snapped  back. &ldquo;Are you going to have your fortune told by the gypsies, dear?&rdquo; she  inquired amiably. &ldquo;They might tell you about your marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I daresay, and if you ask they will prophesy your funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am in perfect health, Miss Greeby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I should think, since your cheeks are so red.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington hastily intervened to prevent the further exchange of compliments. &ldquo;Will  you be back to luncheon, or join the men at the coverts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither.  I&rsquo;ll drop on Lambert for a feed. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the hostess vaguely. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots to do. I shall know  what&rsquo;s to be done, when I think of it,&rdquo; and she drifted along the terrace and  into the house like a cloud blown any way by the wind. Miss Greeby looked after  her limp figure with a contemptuous grin, then she nodded casually to Mrs.  Belgrove, and walked whistling down the terrace steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cat,  indeed!&rdquo; commented Mrs. Belgrove to herself when she saw Miss Greeby&rsquo;s broad  back disappear behind the laurels. &ldquo;Nothing half so pretty. She&rsquo;s like a great  Flanders mare. And I wish Henry VIII was alive to marry her,&rdquo; she added the  epithet suggesting that king, &ldquo;if only to cut her head off.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II<br>
    In The Wood</b></h2>
  <p>Miss  Greeby swung along towards her destination with a masculine stride and in as  great a hurry as though she had entered herself for a Marathon race. It was a  warm, misty day, and the pale August sunshine radiated faintly through the  smoky atmosphere. Nothing was clear-cut and nothing was distinct, so hazy was  the outlook. The hedges were losing their greenery and had blossomed forth into  myriad bunches of ruddy hips and haws, and the usually hard road was soft  underfoot because of the penetrating quality of the moist air. There was no  wind to clear away the misty greyness, but yellow leaves without its aid  dropped from the disconsolate trees. The lately-reaped fields, stretching on  either side of the lane down which the lady was walking, presented a stubbled  expanse of brown and dim gold, uneven and distressful to the eye. The dying  world was in ruins and Nature had reduced herself to that necessary chaos, out  of which, when the coming snow completed its task, she would build a new heaven  and a new earth.</p>
  <p>An  artist might have had some such poetic fancy, and would certainly have looked  lovingly on the alluring colors and forms of decay. But Miss Greeby was no  artist, and prided herself upon being an aggressively matter-of-fact young  woman. With her big boots slapping the ground and her big hands thrust into the  pockets of her mannish jacket, she bent her head in a meditative fashion and  trudged briskly onward. What romance her hard nature was capable of, was  uppermost now, but it had to do strictly with her personal feelings and did not  require the picturesque autumn landscape to improve or help it in any way. One  man&rsquo;s name suggested romance to bluff, breezy Clara Greeby, and that name was  Noel Lambert. She murmured it over and over again to her heart, and her hard  face flushed into something almost like beauty, as she remembered that she  would soon behold its owner. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she said aloud, and threw  back her head defiantly: then after a pause, she breathed softly, &ldquo;But I shall  make him care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  she hoped to do so, the task was one which required a great amount of skill and  a greater amount of womanly courage, neither of which qualities Miss Greeby  possessed. She had no skill in managing a man, as her instincts were  insufficiently feminine, and her courage was of a purely rough-and-tumble kind.  She could have endured hunger and thirst and cold: she could have headed a  forlorn hope: she could have held to a sinking ship: but she had no store of  that peculiar feminine courage which men don&rsquo;t understand and which women can&rsquo;t  explain, however much they may exhibit it. Miss Greeby was an excellent  comrade, but could not be the beloved of any man, because of the very  limitations of semi-masculinity upon which she prided herself. Noel Lambert  wanted a womanly woman, and Lady Agnes was his ideal of what a wife should be.  Miss Greeby had in every possible way offered herself for the post, but Lambert  had never cared for her sufficiently to endure the thought of passing through  life with her beside him. He said she was &ldquo;a good sort&rdquo;; and when a man says  that of a woman, she may be to him a good friend, or even a platonic chum, but  she can never be a desirable wife in his eyes. What Miss Greeby lacked was sex,  and lacking that, lacked everything. It was strange that with her rough common  sense she could not grasp this want. But the thought that Lambert required what  she could never give&mdash;namely, the feminine tenderness which strong masculine  natures love&mdash;never crossed her very clear and mathematical mind.</p>
  <p>So  she was bent upon a fool&rsquo;s errand, as she strode towards the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood,  although she did not know it. Her aim was to capture Lambert as her husband;  and her plan, to accomplish her wish by working on the heart-hunger he most  probably felt, owing to the loss of Agnes Pine. If he loved that lady in a  chivalrous fashion&mdash;and Miss Greeby believed that he did&mdash;she was absolutely lost  to him as the wife of another man. Lambert would never degrade her into a divorce  court appearance. And perhaps, after all, as Miss Greeby thought hopefully, his  love for Sir Hubert&rsquo;s wife might have turned to scorn that she had preferred  money to true love. But then, again, as Miss Greeby remembered, with a  darkening face, Agnes had married the millionaire so as to save the family  estates from being sold. Rank has its obligation, and Lambert might approve of  the sacrifice, since he was the next heir to the Garvington title. &ldquo;We shall  see what his attitude is,&rdquo; decided Miss Greeby, as she entered the Abbot&rsquo;s  Wood, and delayed arranging her future plans until she fully understood his  feelings towards the woman he had lost. In the meantime, Lambert would want a  comrade, and Miss Greeby was prepared to sink her romantic feelings, for the  time being, in order to be one.</p>
  <p>The  forest&mdash;which belonged to Garvington, so long as he paid the interest on the  mortgage&mdash;was not a very large one. In the old days it had been of greater size  and well stocked with wild animals; so well stocked, indeed, that the abbots of  a near monastery had used it for many hundred years as a hunting ground. But  the monastery had vanished off the face of the earth, as not even its ruins  were left, and the game had disappeared as the forest grew smaller and the  district around became more populous. A Lambert of the Georgian period&mdash;the  family name of Lord Garvington was Lambert&mdash;had acquired what was left of the  monastic wood by winning it at a game of cards from the nobleman who had then  owned it. Now it was simply a large patch of green in the middle of a somewhat  naked county, for Hengishire is not remarkable for woodlands. There were  rabbits and birds, badgers, stoats, and such-like wild things in it still, but  the deer which the abbots had hunted were conspicuous by their absence.  Garvington looked after it about as much as he did after the rest of his  estates, which was not saying much. The fat, round little lord&rsquo;s heart was  always in the kitchen, and he preferred eating to fulfilling his duties as a  landlord. Consequently, the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood was more or less public property, save  when Garvington turned crusty and every now and then cleared out all  interlopers. But tramps came to sleep in the wood, and gypsies camped in its  glades, while summer time brought many artists to rave about its sylvan  beauties, and paint pictures of ancient trees and silent pools, and rugged  lawns besprinkled with rainbow wild flowers. People who went to the Academy and  to the various art exhibitions in Bond Street knew the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood fairly  well, as it was rarely that at least one picture dealing with it did not  appear.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby had explored the wood before and knew exactly where to find the cottage  mentioned by Lady Garvington. On the verge of the trees she saw the blue smoke  of the gypsies&rsquo; camp fires, and heard the vague murmur of Romany voices, but,  avoiding the vagrants, she took her way through the forest by a winding path.  This ultimately led her to a spacious glade, in the centre of which stood a  dozen or more rough monoliths of mossy gray and weather-worn stones, disposed  in a circle. Probably these were all that remained of some Druidical temple,  and archaeologists came from far and near to view the weird relics. And in the  middle of the circle stood the cottage: a thatched dwelling, which might have  had to do with a fairy tale, with its whitewashed walls covered with ivy, and  its latticed windows, on the ledges of which stood pots of homely flowers.  There was no fence round this rustic dwelling, as the monoliths stood as  guardians, and the space between the cottage walls and the gigantic stones was  planted thickly with fragrant English flowers. Snapdragon, sweet-william,  marigolds, and scented clove carnations, were all to be found there: also there  was thyme, mint, sage, and other pot-herbs. And the whole perfumed space was  girdled by trees old and young, which stood back from the emerald beauty of  untrimmed lawns. A more ideal spot for a dreamer, or an artist, or a hermit, or  for the straying prince of a fairy tale, it would have been quite impossible to  find. Miss Greeby&rsquo;s vigorous and coarse personality seemed to break in a noisy  manner&mdash;although she did not utter a single word&mdash;the enchanted silence of the  solitary place.</p>
  <p>However,  the intruder was too matter-of-fact to trouble about the sequestered liveliness  of this unique dwelling. She strode across the lawns, and passing beyond the  monoliths, marched like an invader up the narrow path between the radiant  flower-beds. From the tiny green door she raised the burnished knocker and brought  it down with an emphatic bang. Shortly the door opened with a pettish tug, as  though the person behind was rather annoyed by the noise, and a very tall,  well-built, slim young man made his appearance on the threshold. He held a  palette on the thumb of one hand, and clutched a sheaf of brushes, while  another brush was in his mouth, and luckily impeded a rather rough welcome. The  look in a pair of keen blue eyes certainly seemed to resent the intrusion, but  at the sight of Miss Greeby this irritability changed to a glance of suspicion.  Lambert, from old associations, liked his visitor very well on the whole, but  that feminine intuition, which all creative natures possess, warned him that it  was wise to keep her at arm&rsquo;s length. She had never plainly told her love; but  she had assuredly hinted at it more or less by eye and manner and undue  hauntings of his footsteps when in London. He could not truthfully tell himself  that he was glad of her unexpected visit. For quite half a minute they stood  staring at one another, and Miss Greeby&rsquo;s hard cheeks flamed to a poppy red at  the sight of the man she loved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Hermit.&rdquo; she observed, when he made no remark. &ldquo;As the mountain would not come  to Mahomet, the prophet has come to the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  mountain is welcome,&rdquo; said Lambert diplomatically, and stood aside, so that she  might enter. Then adopting the bluff and breezy, rough-and-ready-man-to-man  attitude, which Miss Greeby liked to see in her friends, he added: &ldquo;Come in,  old girl! It&rsquo;s a pal come to see a pal, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo;  assented Miss Greeby, although, woman-like, she was not entirely pleased with  this unromantic welcome. &ldquo;We played as brats together, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she added meditatively, when following Lambert into his studio, &ldquo;I think we are  as chummy as a man and woman well can be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough. You were always a good sort, Clara. How well you are looking&mdash;more of a  man than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  stop that!&rdquo; said Miss Greeby roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Lambert raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;As a girl you always liked to be thought manly,  and said again and again that you wished you were a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  find that I am a woman, after all,&rdquo; sighed the visitor, dropping into a chair  and looking round; &ldquo;with a woman&rsquo;s feelings, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  very nice those feelings are, since they have influenced you to pay me a visit  in the wilds,&rdquo; remarked the artist imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing in the wilds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Painting,&rdquo;  was the laconic retort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I see. Still-life pictures?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly.&rdquo; He pointed toward the easel. &ldquo;Behold and approve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby did behold, but she certainly did not approve, because she was a woman  and in love. It was only a pictured head she saw, but the head was that of a  very beautiful girl, whose face smiled from the canvas in a subtle, defiant  way, as if aware of its wild loveliness. The raven hair streamed straightly  down to the shoulders&mdash;for the bust of the model was slightly indicated&mdash;and  there, bunched out into curls. A red and yellow handkerchief was knotted round  the brows, and dangling sequins added to its barbaric appearance. Nose and lips  and eyes, and contours, were all perfect, and it really seemed as though the  face were idealized, so absolutely did it respond to all canons of beauty. It  was a gypsy countenance, and there lurked in its loveliness that wild, untamed  look which suggested unrestricted roamings and the spacious freedom of the  road.</p>
  <p>The  sudden, jealous fear which surged into Miss Greeby&rsquo;s heart climbed to her  throat and choked her speech. But she had wisdom enough to check unwise words,  and glanced round the studio to recover her composure. The room was small and  barely furnished; a couch, two deep arm-chairs, and a small table filled its  limited area. The walls and roof were painted a pale green, and a carpet of the  same delicate hue covered the floor. Of course, there were the usual painting  materials, brushes and easel and palettes and tubes of color, together with a  slightly raised platform near the one window where the model could sit or  stand. The window itself had no curtains and was filled with plain glass,  affording plenty of light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  other windows of the cottage are latticed,&rdquo; said Lambert, seeing his visitor&rsquo;s  eyes wander in that direction. &ldquo;I had that glass put in when I came here a  month ago. No light can filter through lattices&mdash;in sufficient quantity that  is&mdash;to see the true tones of the colors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bother the window!&rdquo; muttered Miss Greeby restlessly, for she had not yet gained  command of her emotions.</p>
  <p>Lambert  laughed and looked at his picture with his head on one side, and a very handsome  head it was, as Miss Greeby thought. &ldquo;It bothered me until I had it put right,  I assure you. But you don&rsquo;t seem pleased with my crib.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not good enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  when have I been a sybarite, Clara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean you ought to think of your position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too unpleasant to think about,&rdquo; rejoined Lambert, throwing himself on the couch  and producing his pipe. &ldquo;May I smoke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and if you have any decent cigarettes I&rsquo;ll join you. Thanks!&rdquo; She deftly caught  the silver case he threw her. &ldquo;But your position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  hundred a year and no occupation, since I have been brought up to neither trade  nor profession,&rdquo; said Lambert leisurely. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the heir to a title and to a large property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is heavily mortgaged. As to the title&rdquo;&mdash;Lambert shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;Garvington&rsquo;s  wife may have children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. They have been married ten years and more. You are certain to  come in for everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  consists of nothing,&rdquo; said the artist coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled Miss Greeby, puffing luxuriously at her cigarette, which was Turkish  and soothing, &ldquo;nothing may turn into something when these mortgages are cleared  off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is going to clear them off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s  brows contracted, as she knew they would when this name was mentioned, and he  carefully attended to filling his pipe so as to avoid meeting her hard,  inquisitive eyes. &ldquo;Pine is a man of business, and if he pays off the mortgages  he will take over the property as security. I don&rsquo;t see that Garvington will be  any the better off in that case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lambert,&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby very decidedly, and determined to know precisely what he felt  like, &ldquo;Garvington only allowed his sister to marry Sir Hubert because he was  rich. I don&rsquo;t know for certain, of course, but I should think it probable that  he made an arrangement with Pine to have things put straight because of the  marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possible  and probable,&rdquo; said the artist shortly, and wincing; &ldquo;but old friend as you  are, Clara, I don&rsquo;t see the necessity of talking about business which does not  concern me. Speak to Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes  concerns you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  objectionably direct you are,&rdquo; exclaimed Lambert in a vexed tone. &ldquo;And how  utterly wrong. Agnes does not concern me in the least. I loved her, but as she  chose to marry Pine, why there&rsquo;s no more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  there was nothing more to be said,&rdquo; observed Miss Greeby shrewdly, &ldquo;you would  not be burying yourself here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? I am fond of nature and art, and my income is not enough to permit my  living decently in London. I had to leave the army because I was so poor.  Garvington has given me this cottage rent free, so I&rsquo;m jolly enough with my  painting and with Mrs. Tribb as housekeeper and cook. She&rsquo;s a perfect dream of  a cook,&rdquo; ended Lambert thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby shook her red head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deceive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wants to, anyhow?&rdquo; demanded the man, unconsciously American.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do. You wish to make out that you prefer to camp here instead of admitting that  you would like to be at The Manor because Agnes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  jumped up crossly. &ldquo;Oh, leave Agnes out of the question. She is Pine&rsquo;s wife, so  that settles things. It&rsquo;s no use crying for the moon, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you still wish for the moon,&rdquo; interpolated the woman quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even you have the right to ask me such a question,&rdquo; replied Lambert in a quiet  and decisive tone. &ldquo;Let us change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby pointed to the beautiful face smiling on the easel. &ldquo;I advise you to,&rdquo;  she said significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have come here to give me good advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  you won&rsquo;t take,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it isn&rsquo;t needed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man&rsquo;s a man and a woman&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  as true as taxes, as Mr. Barkis observed, if you are acquainted with the  writings of the late Charles Dickens. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Miss Greeby pointed to the picture. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t have painted her otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then the original of that portrait does exist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could  you call it a portrait if an original didn&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; demanded the young man  tartly. &ldquo;Since you want to know so much, you may as well come to the gypsy  encampment on the verge of the wood and satisfy yourself.&rdquo; He threw on a Panama  hat, with a cross look. &ldquo;Since when have you come to the conclusion that I need  a dry nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t talk bosh!&rdquo; said Miss Greeby vigorously, and springing to her feet. &ldquo;You  take me at the foot of the letter and too seriously. I only came here to see  how my old pal was getting on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  all right and as jolly as a sandboy. Now are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite.  Only don&rsquo;t fall in love with the original of your portrait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  rather late in the day to warn me,&rdquo; said Lambert dryly, &ldquo;for I have known the  girl for six months. I met her in a gypsy caravan when on a walking tour, and  offered to paint her. She is down here with her people, and you can see her  whenever you have a mind to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no time like the present,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, accepting the offer with alacrity.  &ldquo;Come along, old boy.&rdquo; Then, when they stepped out of the cottage garden on to  the lawns, she asked pointedly, &ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  That is the name of the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never denied that, my dear girl. But Chaldea was born in the country whence she  takes her name. Down Mesopotamia way, I believe. These gypsies wander far and  wide, you know. She&rsquo;s very pretty, and has the temper of the foul fiend  himself. Only Kara can keep her in order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Kara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Servian gypsy who plays the fiddle like an angel. He&rsquo;s a crooked-backed,  black-faced, hairy ape of a dwarf, but highly popular on account of his music.  Also, he&rsquo;s crazy about Chaldea, and loves her to distraction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she love him?&rdquo; Miss Greeby asked in her direct fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Lambert, coloring under his tan, and closed his lips firmly. He was a  very presentable figure of a man, as he walked beside the unusually tall woman.  His face was undeniably handsome in a fair Saxon fashion, and his eyes were as  blue as those of Miss Greeby herself, while his complexion was much more  delicate. In fact, she considered that it was much too good a complexion for  one of the male sex, but admitted inwardly that its possessor was anything but  effeminate, when he had such a heavy jaw, such a firm chin, and such set lips.  Lambert, indeed, at first sight did indeed look so amiable, as to appear for  the moment quite weak; but danger always stiffened him into a dangerous  adversary, and his face when aroused was most unpleasantly fierce. He walked  with a military swing, his shoulders well set back and his head crested like  that of a striking serpent. A rough and warlike life would have brought out his  best points of endurance, capability to plan and strike quickly, and iron  decision; but the want of opportunity and the enervating influences of  civilized existence, made him a man of possibilities. When time, and place, and  chance offered he could act the hero with the best; but lacking these things he  remained innocuous like gunpowder which has no spark to fire it.</p>
  <p>Thinking  of these things, Miss Greeby abandoned the subject of Chaldea, and of her  possible love for Lambert, and exclaimed impulsively, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you chuck  civilization and strike the out-trail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; he asked, unmoved, and rather surprised by the change of the  subject. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite comfortable here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  comfortable,&rdquo; she retorted with emphasis. &ldquo;This loafing life of just-enough-to-live-on  doesn&rsquo;t give you a chance to play the man. Go out and fight and colonize and  prove your qualities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s  color rose again, and his eyes sparkled. &ldquo;I would if the chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah, Hercules and Omphale!&rdquo; interrupted his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; retorted Miss Greeby, who guessed that he knew what she meant very well.  His quick flush showed her how he resented this classical allusion to Agnes  Pine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d carry her off if you were a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea?&rdquo;  asked Lambert, wilfully misunderstanding her meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you like. Only don&rsquo;t try to carry her off at night. Garvington says he will  shoot any burglar who comes along after dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew Garvington had anything to do with Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  did I. Oh, I think you know very well what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I do,&rdquo; said the young man with an angry shrug, for really her interference with  his affairs seemed to be quite unjustifiable. &ldquo;But I am not going to bring a  woman I respect into the Divorce Court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respect?  Love, you mean to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  stopped, and faced her squarely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to quarrel with you, Clara, as  we are very old friends. But I warn you that I do possess a temper, and if you  wish to see it, you are going the best way to get what you evidently want. Now,  hold your tongue and talk of something else. Here is Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watching  for you,&rdquo; muttered Miss Greeby, as the slight figure of the gypsy girl was seen  advancing swiftly. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; and she snorted suspiciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rye!&rdquo;  cried Chaldea, dancing toward the artist. &ldquo;Sarishan rye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby didn&rsquo;t understand Romany, but the look in the girl&rsquo;s eyes was enough to  reveal the truth. If Lambert did not love his beautiful model, it was perfectly  plain that the beautiful model loved Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  baro duvel atch&rsquo; pa leste!&rdquo; said Chaldea, and clapped her slim hands.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
    An Unexpected Recognition</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you wouldn&rsquo;t speak the calo jib to me, Chaldea,&rdquo; said Lambert, smiling on  the beautiful eager face. &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I,&rdquo; put in Miss Greeby in her manly tones. &ldquo;What does Oh baro devil, and all  the rest of it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Great God be with you,&rdquo; translated Chaldea swiftly, &ldquo;and duvel is not devil as  you Gorgios call it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the difference of a letter,&rdquo; replied the Gentile lady good-humoredly. &ldquo;Show us round  your camp, my good girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  mere fact that the speaker was in Lambert&rsquo;s company, let alone the offensively  patronizing tone in which she spoke, was enough to rouse the gypsy girl&rsquo;s  naturally hot temper. She retreated and swayed like a cat making ready to  spring, while her black eyes snapped fire in a most unpleasant manner.</p>
  <p>But  Miss Greeby was not to be frightened by withering glances, and merely laughed  aloud, showing her white teeth. Her rough merriment and masculine looks showed  Chaldea that, as a rival, she was not to be feared, so the angry expression on  the dark face changed to a wheedling smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali!  Avali! The Gorgios lady wants her fortune told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the sake of diplomacy Miss Greeby nodded and fished in her pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give  you half a crown to tell it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me&mdash;not me, dear lady. Mother Cockleshell is our great witch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  me to her then,&rdquo; replied the other, and rapidly gathered into her brain all she  could of Chaldea&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
  <p>Lambert  had painted a very true picture of the girl, although to a certain extent he  had idealized her reckless beauty. Chaldea&rsquo;s looks had been damaged and  roughened by wind and rain, by long tramps, and by glaring sunshine. Yet she  was superlatively handsome with her warm and swarthy skin, under which the scarlet  blood circled freely. To an oval face, a slightly hooked nose and two vermilion  lips, rather full, she added the glossy black eyes of the true Romany, peaked  at the corners. Her jetty hair descended smoothly from under a red handkerchief  down to her shoulders, and there, at the tips, became tangled and curling. Her  figure was magnificent, and she swayed and swung from the hips with an easy  grace, which reminded the onlookers of a panther&rsquo;s lithe movements. And there  was a good deal of the dangerous beast-of-prey beauty about Chaldea, which was  enhanced by her picturesque dress. This was ragged and patched with all kinds  of colored cloths subdued to mellow tints by wear and weather. Also she jingled  with coins and beads and barbaric trinkets of all kinds. Her hands were  perfectly formed, and so doubtless were her feet, although these last were  hidden by heavy laced-up boots. On the whole, she was an extremely picturesque  figure, quite comforting to the artistic eye amidst the drab sameness of  latterday civilization.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, I suspect she is a sleeping volcano,&rdquo; whispered Miss Greeby in her  companion&rsquo;s ear as they followed the girl through the camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely  sleeping,&rdquo; answered Lambert in the same tone. &ldquo;She explodes on the slightest  provocation, and not without damaging results.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you ought to know. But if you play with volcanic fire you&rsquo;ll burn more than  your clever fingers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  The girl is only a model.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  Not much of the lay figure about her, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert,  according to his custom, shrugged his shoulders and did not seek to explain  further. If Miss Greeby chose to turn her fancies into facts, she was at  liberty to do so. Besides, her attention was luckily attracted by the vivid  life of the vagrants which hummed and bustled everywhere. The tribe was a  comparatively large one, and&mdash;as Miss Greeby learned later&mdash;consisted of Lees,  Loves, Bucklands, Hernes, and others, all mixed up together in one gypsy stew.  The assemblage embraced many clans, and not only were there pure gypsies, but  even many diddikai, or half-bloods, to be seen. Perhaps the gradually  diminishing Romany clans found it better to band together for mutual benefit  than to remain isolated units. But the camp certainly contained many elements,  and these, acting co-operatively, formed a large and somewhat reckless  community, which justified Garvington&rsquo;s alarm. A raid in the night by one or  two, or three, or more of these lean, wiry, dangerous-looking outcasts was not  to be despised. But it must be admitted that, in a general way, law and order  prevailed in the encampment.</p>
  <p>There  were many caravans, painted in gay colors and hung round with various goods,  such as brushes and brooms, goat-skin rugs, and much tinware, together with  baskets of all sorts and sizes. The horses, which drew these rainbow-hued  vehicles, were pasturing on the outskirts of the camp, hobbled for the most  part. Interspersed among the travelling homes stood tents great and small,  wherein the genuine Romany had their abode, but the autumn weather was so fine that  most of the inmates preferred to sleep in the moonshine. Of course, there were  plenty of dogs quarrelling over bones near various fires, or sleeping with one  eye open in odd corners, and everywhere tumbled and laughed and danced,  brown-faced, lithe-limbed children, who looked uncannily Eastern. And the men,  showing their white teeth in smiles, together with the fawning women, young and  handsome, or old and hideously ugly, seemed altogether alien to the quiet, tame  domestic English landscape. There was something prehistoric about the scene,  and everywhere lurked that sense of dangerous primeval passions held in  enforced check which might burst forth on the very slightest provocation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a migrating tribe of Aryans driven to new hunting grounds by hunger or  over-population,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, for even her unromantic nature was stirred  by the unusual picturesqueness of the scene. &ldquo;The sight of these people and the  reek of their fires make me feel like a cave-woman. There is something  magnificent about this brutal freedom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  sordid magnificence,&rdquo; replied Lambert, raising his shoulders. &ldquo;But I understand  your feelings. On occasions we all have the nostalgia of the primitive life at  times, and delight to pass from ease to hardship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  civilization isn&rsquo;t much catch, so far as I can see,&rdquo; argued his companion. &ldquo;It  makes men weaklings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not women,&rdquo; he answered, glancing sideways at her Amazonian figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you. For some reason, men are going down while women are going up,  both physically and mentally. I wonder what the future of civilized races will  be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is Mother Cockleshell. Best ask her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  trio had reached a small tent at the very end of the camp by this time, snugly  set up under a spreading oak and near the banks of a babbling brook. Their  progress had not been interrupted by any claims on their attention or purses,  for a wink from Chaldea had informed her brother and sister gypsies that the  Gentile lady had come to consult the queen of the tribe. And, like Lord Burleigh&rsquo;s  celebrated nod, Chaldea&rsquo;s wink could convey volumes. At all events, Lambert and  his companion were unmolested, and arrived in due course before the royal  palace. A croaking voice announced that the queen was inside her Arab tent, and  she was crooning some Romany song. Chaldea did not open her mouth, but simply  snapped her fingers twice or thrice rapidly. The woman within must have had  marvellously sharp ears, for she immediately stopped her incantation&mdash;the songs  sounded like one&mdash;and stepped forth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby, stepping back, &ldquo;I am disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had every reason to be after the picturesqueness of the camp in general, and  Chaldea in particular, for Mother Cockleshell looked like a threadbare  pew-opener, or an almshouse widow who had seen better days. Apparently she was  very old, for her figure had shrivelled up into a diminutive monkey form, and  she looked as though a moderately high wind could blow her about like a  feather. Her face was brown and puckered and lined in a most wonderful fashion.  Where a wrinkle could be, there a wrinkle was, and her nose and chin were of  the true nutcracker order, as a witch&rsquo;s should be. Only her eyes betrayed the  powerful vitality that still animated the tiny frame, for these were large and  dark, and had in them a piercing look which seemed to gaze not at any one, but  through and beyond. Her figure, dried like that of a mummy, was surprisingly  straight for one of her ancient years, and her profuse hair was scarcely  touched with the gray of age. Arrayed in a decent black dress, with a decent  black bonnet and a black woollen shawl, the old lady looked intensely  respectable. There was nothing of the picturesque vagrant about her. Therefore  Miss Greeby, and with every reason, was disappointed, and when the queen of the  woodland spoke she was still more so, for Mother Cockleshell did not even  interlard her English speech with Romany words, as did Chaldea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  day to you, my lady, and to you, sir,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell in a stronger  and harsher voice than would have been expected from one of her age and  diminished stature. &ldquo;I hope I sees you well,&rdquo; and she dropped a curtsey, just  like any village dame who knew her manners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Miss Greeby again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look a bit like a gypsy queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  my lady, looks ain&rsquo;t everything. But I&rsquo;m a true-bred Romany&mdash;a Stanley of  Devonshire. Gentilla is my name and the tent my home, and I can tell fortunes  as no one else on the road can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali,  and that is true,&rdquo; put in Chaldea eagerly. &ldquo;Gentilla&rsquo;s a bori chovihani.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child means that I am a great witch, my lady,&rdquo; said the old dame with another  curtsey. &ldquo;Though she&rsquo;s foolish to use Romany words to Gentiles as don&rsquo;t  understand the tongue which the dear Lord spoke in Eden&rsquo;s garden, as the good  Book tells us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what part of the Bible do you find that?&rdquo; asked Lambert laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my sweet gentleman, it ain&rsquo;t for the likes of me to say things to the likes of  you,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell, getting out of her difficulty very cleverly, &ldquo;but  the dear lady wants her fortune told, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you say dukkerin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like them wicked words, sir,&rdquo; answered Mother Cockleshell piously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wicked  words,&rdquo; muttered Chaldea tossing her black locks. &ldquo;And them true Romany as was  your milk tongue. No wonder the Gentiles don&rsquo;t fancy you a true one of the  road. If I were queen of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  vicious little devil flashed out of the old woman&rsquo;s eyes, and her respectable  looks changed on the instant. &ldquo;Tol yer chib, or I&rsquo;ll heat the bones of you with  the fires of Bongo Tem,&rdquo; she screamed furiously, and in a mixture of her  mother-tongue and English. &ldquo;Ja pukenus, slut of the gutter,&rdquo; she shook her  fist, and Chaldea, with an insulting laugh, moved away. &ldquo;Bengis your see!  Bengis your see! And that, my generous lady,&rdquo; she added, turning round with a  sudden resumption of her fawning respectability, &ldquo;means &lsquo;the devil in your  heart,&rsquo; which I spoke witchly-like to the child. Ah, but she&rsquo;s a bad one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby laughed outright. &ldquo;This is more like the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Chaldea,&rdquo; said Lambert. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too hard on her, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, my sweet gentleman, ain&rsquo;t hard enough. She&rsquo;ll sell you, and get Kara to  put the knife between your ribs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should he? I&rsquo;m not in love with the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  tree don&rsquo;t care for the ivy, but the ivy loves the tree,&rdquo; said Mother  Cockleshell darkly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good and kind gentleman, and I don&rsquo;t want to see  that slut pick your bones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I think,&rdquo; whispered Miss Greeby in his ear. &ldquo;You play with fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,  my good lady,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell, catching the whisper&mdash;she had the  hearing of a cat. &ldquo;With the fire of Bongo Tern, the which you may call The  Crooked Land,&rdquo; and she pointed significantly downward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hell,  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby in her bluff way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Crooked Land we Romany calls it,&rdquo; insisted the old woman. &ldquo;And the child will  go there, for her witchly doings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  too good-looking to lose as a model, at all events,&rdquo; said Lambert, hitching his  shoulders. &ldquo;I shall leave you to have your fortune told, Clara, and follow  Chaldea to pacify her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he went toward the centre of the camp, Miss Greeby took a hesitating step as  though to follow him. In her opinion Chaldea was much too good-looking, let  alone clever, for Lambert to deal with alone. Gentilla Stanley saw the look on  the hard face and the softening of the hard eyes as the cheeks grew rosy red.  From this emotion she drew her conclusions, and she chuckled to think of how  true a fortune she could tell the visitor on these premises. Mother Cockleshell&rsquo;s  fortune-telling was not entirely fraudulent, but when her clairvoyance was not  in working order she made use of character-reading with good results.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  the Gorgios lady have her fortune told?&rdquo; she asked in wheedling tones. &ldquo;Cross  Mother Cockleshell&rsquo;s hand with silver and she&rsquo;ll tell the coming years truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do they call you Mother Cockleshell?&rdquo; demanded Miss Greeby, waiving the  question of fortune-telling for the time being.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  your wisdom, it was them fishermen at Grimsby who did so. I walked the beaches  for years and told charms and gave witchly spells for fine weather. Gentilla  Stanley am I called, but Mother Cockleshell was their name for me. But the  fortune, my tender Gentile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want it told,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Greeby abruptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in such  rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is rubbish and there is truth,&rdquo; said the ancient gypsy darkly. &ldquo;And them as  knows can see what&rsquo;s hidden from others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you will have an opportunity this afternoon of making money. Some fools from  The Manor are coming to consult you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell nodded and grinned to show a set of beautifully preserved teeth. &ldquo;I  know The Manor,&rdquo; said she, rubbing her slim hands. &ldquo;And Lord Garvington, with  his pretty sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Agnes Pine?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby. &ldquo;How do you know, her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been in these parts before, my gentle lady, and she was good to me in a sick  way. I would have died in the hard winter if she hadn&rsquo;t fed me and nursed me,  so to speak. I shall love to see her again. To dick a puro pal is as commoben  as a aushti habben, the which, my precious angel, is true Romany for the  Gentile saying, &lsquo;To see an old friend is as good as a fine dinner.&rsquo; Avali!  Avali!&rdquo; she nodded smilingly. &ldquo;I shall be glad to see her, though here I use  Romany words to you as doesn&rsquo;t understand the lingo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby was not at all pleased to hear Lady Agnes praised; as, knowing that  Lambert had loved her, and probably loved her still, she was jealous enough to  wish her all possible harm. However, it was not diplomatic to reveal her true  feelings to Mother Cockleshell, lest the old gypsy should repeat her words to  Lady Agnes, so she turned the conversation by pointing to a snow-white cat of  great size, who stepped daintily out of the tent. &ldquo;I should think, as a witch,  your cat ought to be black,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby. Mother Cockleshell screeched  like a night-owl and hastily pattered some gypsy spell to avert evil. &ldquo;Why, the  old devil is black,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And why should I have him in my house to work  evil? This is my white ghost.&rdquo; Her words were accompanied by a gentle stroking  of the cat. &ldquo;And good is what she brings to my roof-tree. But I don&rsquo;t eat from  white dishes, or drink from white mugs. No! No! That would be too witchly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby mused. &ldquo;I have heard something about these gypsy superstitions before,&rdquo;  she remarked meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avo!  Avo! They are in a book written by a great Romany Rye. Leland is the name of  that rye, a gypsy Lee with Gentile land. He added land to the lea as he was  told by one of our people. Such a nice gentleman, kind, and free of his money  and clever beyond tellings, as I always says. Many a time has he sat pal-like  with me, and &lsquo;Gentilla,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;your&rsquo;re a bori chovihani&rsquo;; and that, my  generous lady, is the gentle language for a great witch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea  said that you were that,&rdquo; observed Miss Greeby carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child speaks truly. Come, cross my hand, sweet lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby passed along half a crown. &ldquo;I only desire to know one thing,&rdquo; she said,  offering her palm. &ldquo;Shall I get my wish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell peered into the hands, although she had already made up her mind  what to say. Her faculties, sharpened by years of chicanery, told her from the  look which Miss Greeby had given when Lambert followed Chaldea, that a desire  to marry the man was the wish in question. And seeing how indifferent Lambert  was in the presence of the tall lady, Mother Cockleshell had no difficulty in  adjusting the situation in her own artful mind. &ldquo;No, my lady,&rdquo; she said,  casting away the hand with quite a dramatic gesture. &ldquo;You will never gain your  wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby looked angry. &ldquo;Bah! Your fortune-telling is all rubbish, as I have  always thought,&rdquo; and she moved away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me that in six months,&rdquo; screamed the old woman after her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  six months?&rdquo; demanded the other, pausing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s a dark saying,&rdquo; scoffed the gypsy. &ldquo;Call it seven, my  hopeful-for-what-you-won&rsquo;t-get, like the cat after the cream, for seven&rsquo;s a  sacred number, and the spell is set.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gypsy  jargon, gypsy lies,&rdquo; muttered Miss Greeby, tossing her ruddy mane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  believe a word. Tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no time to say more,&rdquo; interrupted Mother Cockleshell rudely, for, having  secured her money, she did not think it worth while to be polite, especially in  the face of her visitor&rsquo;s scepticism. &ldquo;One of our tribe&mdash;aye, and he&rsquo;s a great  Romany for sure&mdash;is coming to camp with us. Each minute he may come, and I go to  get ready a stew of hedgehog, for Gentile words I must use to you, who are a  Gorgio. And so good day to you, my lady,&rdquo; ended the old hag, again becoming the  truly respectable pew-opener. Then she dropped a curtsey&mdash;whether ironical or  not, Miss Greeby could not tell&mdash;and disappeared into the tent, followed by the  white cat, who haunted her footsteps like the ghost she declared it to be.</p>
  <p>Clearly  there was nothing more to be learned from Mother Cockleshell, who, in the face  of her visitor&rsquo;s doubts, had become hostile, so Miss Greeby, dismissing the  whole episode as over and done with, turned her attention toward finding  Lambert. With her bludgeon under her arm and her hands in the pockets of her  jacket, she stalked through the camp in quite a masculine fashion, not  vouchsafing a single reply to the greetings which the gypsies gave her. Shortly  she saw the artist chatting with Chaldea at the beginning of the path which led  to his cottage. Beside them, on the grass, squatted a queer figure.</p>
  <p>It  was that of a little man, very much under-sized, with a hunch back and a large,  dark, melancholy face covered profusely with black hair. He wore corduroy  trousers and clumsy boots&mdash;his feet and hands were enormous&mdash;together with a  green coat and a red handkerchief which was carelessly twisted round his hairy  throat. On his tangled locks&mdash;distressingly shaggy and unkempt&mdash;he wore no hat,  and he looked like a brownie, grotesque, though somewhat sad. But even more did  he resemble an ape&mdash;or say the missing link&mdash;and only his eyes seemed human.  These were large, dark and brilliant, sparkling like jewels under his  elf-locks. He sat cross-legged on the sward and hugged a fiddle, as though he  were nursing a baby. And, no doubt, he was as attached to his instrument as any  mother could be to her child. It was not difficult for Miss Greeby to guess  that this weird, hairy dwarf was the Servian gypsy Kara, of whom Lambert had  spoken. She took advantage of the knowledge to be disagreeable to the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this your husband?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby amiably.</p>
  <p>Chaldea&rsquo;s  eyes flashed and her cheeks grew crimson. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she said  contemptuously. &ldquo;I have no rom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  your are not married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  declared Chaldea curtly, and shot a swift glance at Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is waiting for the fairy prince,&rdquo; said that young gentleman smiling. &ldquo;And he is  coming to this camp almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ishmael  Hearne is coming,&rdquo; replied the gypsy. &ldquo;But he is no rom of mine, and never will  be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is he, then?&rdquo; asked Lambert carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the great Romany.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby remembered that Mother Cockleshell had also spoken of the expected  arrival at the camp in these terms. &ldquo;A kind of king?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  laughed satirically. &ldquo;Yes; a kind of king,&rdquo; she assented; then turned her back  rudely on the speaker and addressed Lambert: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come, rye. Ishmael will  want to see me. I must wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a nuisance,&rdquo; said Lambert, looking annoyed. &ldquo;Fancy, Clara. I have an idea of  painting these two as Beauty and the Beast, or perhaps as Esmeralda and  Quasimodo. I want them to come to the cottage and sit now, but they will wait  for this confounded Ishmael.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can come to-morrow,&rdquo; put in Chaldea quickly. &ldquo;This afternoon I must dance for  Ishmael, and Kara must play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ishmael  will meet with a fine reception,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, and then, anxious to have a  private conversation with Chaldea so as to disabuse her mind of any idea she  may have entertained of marrying Lambert, she added, &ldquo;I think I shall stay and  see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, I shall return to my cottage,&rdquo; replied Lambert, sauntering up the  pathway, which was strewn with withered leaves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  are you coming to The Manor?&rdquo; called Miss Greeby after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!  I am too busy,&rdquo; he replied over his shoulder and disappeared into the wood. This  departure may seem discourteous, but then Miss Greeby liked to be treated like  a comrade and without ceremony. That is, she liked it so far as other men were  concerned, but not as regards Lambert. She loved him too much to approve of his  careless leave-taking, and therefore she frowned darkly, as she turned her  attention to Chaldea.</p>
  <p>The  girl saw that Miss Greeby was annoyed, and guessed the cause of her annoyance.  The idea that this red-haired and gaunt woman should love the handsome Gorgio  was so ludicrous in Chaldea&rsquo;s eyes that she laughed in an ironical fashion.  Miss Greeby turned on her sharply, but before she could speak there was a sound  of many voices raised in welcome. &ldquo;Sarishan pal! Sarishan ba!&rdquo; cried the  voices, and Chaldea started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ishmael!&rdquo;  she said, and ran toward the camp, followed leisurely by Kara.</p>
  <p>Anxious  to see the great Romany, whose arrival caused all this commotion, Miss Greeby  plunged into the crowd of excited vagrants. These surrounded a black horse, on  which sat a slim, dark-faced man of the true Romany breed. Miss Greeby stared  at him and blinked her eyes, as though she could not believe what they beheld,  while the man waved his hand and responded to the many greetings in gypsy  language. His eyes finally met her own as she stood on the outskirts of the  crowd, and he started. Then she knew. &ldquo;Sir Hubert Pine,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby,  still staring. &ldquo;Sir Hubert Pine!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    Secrets</b></h2>
  <p>The  scouting crowd apparently did not catch the name, so busy were one and all in  welcoming the newcomer. But the man on the horse saw Miss Greeby&rsquo;s startled  look, and noticed that her lips were moving. In a moment he threw himself off  the animal and elbowed his way roughly through the throng.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert,&rdquo; began Miss Greeby, only to be cut short hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  give me away,&rdquo; interrupted Pine, who here was known as Ishmael Hearne. &ldquo;Wait  till I settle things, and then we can converse privately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; answered the lady, nodding, and gripped her bludgeon crosswise behind  her back with two hands. She was so surprised at the sight of the millionaire  in the wood, that she could scarcely speak.</p>
  <p>Satisfied  that she grasped the situation, Pine turned to his friends and spoke at length  in fluent Romany. He informed them that he had some business to transact with the  Gentile lady who had come to the camp for that purpose, and would leave them  for half an hour. The man evidently was such a favorite that black looks were  cast on Miss Greeby for depriving the Romany of his society. But Pine paid no  attention to these signs of discontent. He finished his speech, and then pushed  his way again toward the lady who, awkwardly for him, was acquainted with his  true position as a millionaire. In a hurried whisper he asked Miss Greeby to  follow him, and led the way into the heart of the wood. Apparently he knew it  very well, and knew also where to seek solitude for the private conversation he  desired, for he skirted the central glade where Lambert&rsquo;s cottage was placed,  and finally guided his companion to a secluded dell, far removed from the camp  of his brethren. Here he sat down on a mossy stone, and stared with piercing  black eyes at Miss Greeby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded imperiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  the question I was about to put to you,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby amiably. She could  afford to be amiable, for she felt that she was the mistress of the situation.  Pine evidently saw this, for he frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have guessed long ago that I was a gypsy,&rdquo; he snapped restlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I didn&rsquo;t, nor, I should think, did any one else. I thought you had nigger blood  in you, and I have heard people say that you came from the West Indies. But  what does it matter if you are a gypsy? There is no disgrace in being one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  disgrace, certainly,&rdquo; rejoined the millionaire, leaning forward and linking his  hands together, while he stared at the ground. &ldquo;I am proud of having the gentle  Romany blood. All the same I prefer the West Indian legend, for I don&rsquo;t want  any of my civilized friends to know that I am Ishmael Hearne, born and bred in  a tent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s natural, Pine. What would Garvington say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  curse Garvington!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  the whole family by all means,&rdquo; retorted Miss Greeby coolly.</p>
  <p>Pine  looked up savagely, &ldquo;I except my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally.  You always were uxorious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said Pine gloomily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool where Agnes is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby quite agreed with this statement, but did not think it worth while to  indorse so obvious a remark. She sat down in her turn, and taking Lambert&rsquo;s  cigarette case, which she had retained by accident, out of her pocket, she  prepared to smoke. The two were entirely alone in the fairy dell, and the trees  which girdled it were glorious with vivid autumnal tints. A gentle breeze  sighing through the wood, shook down yew, crisp leaves on the woman&rsquo;s head, so that  she looked like Danae in a shower of gold. Pine gazed heavily at the ground and  coughed violently. Miss Greeby knew that cough, and a medical friend of hers  had told her several times that Sir Hubert was a very consumptive individual.  He certainly looked ill, and apparently had not long to live. And if he died,  Lady Agnes, inheriting his wealth, would be more desirable as a wife than ever.  And Miss Greeby, guessing whose wife she would be, swore inwardly that the  present husband should look so delicate. But she showed no sign of her  perturbations, but lighted her cigarette with a steady hand and smoked quietly.  She always prided herself on her nerve.</p>
  <p>The  millionaire was tall and lean, with a sinewy frame, and an oval,  olive-complexioned face. It was clean-shaven, and with his aquiline nose, his  thin lips, and brilliant black eyes, which resembled those of Kara, he looked  like a long-descended Hindoo prince. The Eastern blood of the Romany showed in  his narrow feet and slim brown hands, and there was a wild roving look about  him, which Miss Greeby had not perceived in London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose it&rsquo;s the dress,&rdquo; she said aloud, and eyed Pine critically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say, Miss Greeby?&rdquo; he asked, looking up in a sharp, startled manner, and  again coughing in a markedly consumptive way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cowl makes the monk in your case,&rdquo; replied the woman quietly. &ldquo;Your corduroy  breeches and velveteen coat, with that colored shirt, and the yellow  handkerchief round your neck, seem to suit you better than did the frock coats  and evening dress I have seen you in. You did look like a nigger of sorts when  in those clothes; now I can tell you are a gypsy with half an eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is because you heard me called Ishmael and saw me among my kith and kin,&rdquo; said  the man with a tired smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I? It&rsquo;s none of my business if you chose to masquerade as a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  masquerade as Sir Hubert Pine,&rdquo; retorted the millionaire, slipping off the  stone to sprawl full-length on the grass. &ldquo;I am truly and really one of the lot  in the camp yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they know you by your Gentile name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  laughed. &ldquo;You are picking up the gypsy lingo, Miss Greeby. No. Every one on the  road takes me for what I am, Ishmael Hearne, and my friends in the civilized  world think I am Sir Hubert Pine, a millionaire with colored blood in his  veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you come to have a double personality and live a double life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is easily explained, and since you have found me out it is just as well  that I should explain, so that you may keep my secret, at all events from my  wife, as she would be horrified to think that she had married a gypsy. You  promise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I shall say nothing. But perhaps she would prefer to know that she had  married a gypsy rather than a nigger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  polite things you say,&rdquo; said Pine sarcastically. &ldquo;However, I can&rsquo;t afford to  quarrel with you. As you are rich, I can&rsquo;t even bribe you to silence, so I must  rely on your honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I have some,&rdquo; Miss Greeby assured him lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  it suits you,&rdquo; he retorted doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does on this occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you that when you have related your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is really none to tell. I was born and brought up on the road, and thinking I  was wasting my life I left my people and entered civilization. In London I  worked as a clerk, and being clever I soon made money. I got hold of a man who  invented penny toys, and saw the possibilities of making a fortune. I really  didn&rsquo;t, but I collected enough money to dabble in stocks and shares. The South  African boom was on, and I made a thousand. Other speculations created more  than a million out of my thousand, and now I have over two millions, honestly  made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;  queried Miss Greeby significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I assure you, honestly. We gypsies are cleverer than you Gentiles, and we have  the same money-making faculties as the Jews have. If my people were not so fond  of the vagrant life they would soon become a power in the money markets of the  world. But, save in the case of myself, we leave all such grubbing to the Jews.  I did grub, and my reward is that I have accumulated a fortune in a remarkably  short space of time. I have land and houses, and excellent investments, and a  title, which,&rdquo; he added sarcastically, &ldquo;a grateful Government bestowed on me  for using my money properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bought the title by helping the political party you belonged to,&rdquo; said Miss  Greeby with a shrug. &ldquo;There was quite a talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  there was. As if I cared for talk. However, that is my story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  all of it. You are supposed to be in Paris, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you find me here,&rdquo; interrupted Pine with a faint smile. &ldquo;Well you see, being a  gypsy, I can&rsquo;t always endure that under-the-roof life you Gentiles live. I must  have a spell of the open road occasionally. And, moreover, as my doctor tells  me that I have phthisis, and that I should live as much as possible in the open  air, I kill two birds with one stone, as the saying is. My health benefits by  my taking up the old Romany wandering, and I gratify my nostalgia for the tent  and the wild. You understand, you und&mdash;&rdquo; His speech was interrupted by a fresh  fit of coughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t seem to do you much good this gypsying,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby with a swift  look, for his life was of importance to her plans. &ldquo;You look pretty rocky I can  tell you, Pine. And if you die your wife will be free to&mdash;&rdquo; The man sat up and  took away from his mouth a handkerchief spotted with blood. His eyes glittered,  and he showed his white teeth. &ldquo;My wife will be free to what?&rdquo; he demanded  viciously, and the same devil that had lurked in Mother Cockleshell&rsquo;s eye, now  showed conspicuously in his.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby had no pity on his manifest distress and visible wrath, but answered  obliquely: &ldquo;You know that she was almost engaged to her cousin before you  married her,&rdquo; she hinted pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know, d&mdash;&mdash; him,&rdquo; said Pine with a groan, and rolled over to clutch at the  grass in a vicious manner. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not at The Manor now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes  doesn&rsquo;t speak of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  drew a deep breath and rose slowly to his feet, with a satisfied nod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad of that. She&rsquo;s a good woman is Agnes, and would never encourage him in any  way. She knows what is due to me. I trust her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you? When your secretary is also stopping at The Manor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver!&rdquo;  Pine laughed awkwardly, and kicked at a tuft of moss. &ldquo;Well I did ask him to  keep an eye on her, although there is really no occasion. Silver owes me a  great deal, since I took him out of the gutter. If Lambert worried my wife,  Silver would let me know, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby hastily.</p>
  <p>The  man clenched his fists and his face grew stormy, as his blood untamed by  civilization surged redly to the surface. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d twist his neck, I&rsquo;d smash his  skull, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t ask me what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should keep my temper if I were you,&rdquo; Miss Greeby warned him, and alarmed by  the tempest she had provoked. She had no wish for the man she loved to come  into contact with this savage, veneered by civilization. Yet Lambert was in the  neighborhood, and almost within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the husband who was so  jealous of him. &ldquo;Keep your temper,&rdquo; repeated Miss Greeby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there anything else you would like me to do?&rdquo; raged Pine fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Leave this place if you wish to keep the secret of your birth from your wife.  Lady Garvington and Mrs. Belgrove, and a lot of people from The Manor, are  coming to the camp to get their fortunes told. You are sure to be spotted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall keep myself out of sight,&rdquo; said Pine sullenly and suspiciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of your gypsy friends may let the cat out of the bag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  one of them knows there is a cat in the bag. I am Ishmael Hearne to them, and  nothing else. But I shan&rsquo;t stay here long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you came at all, seeing that your wife is with her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the daring of my coming lies my safety,&rdquo; said Pine tartly. &ldquo;I know what I am  doing. As to Lambert, if he thinks to marry my wife when I am dead he is  mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I hope you won&rsquo;t die, for my sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  for your sake?&rdquo; asked Pine sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love Lambert and I want to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marry  him,&rdquo; said the millionaire hoarsely, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you thousands of pounds.  Oh! I forgot that you have a large income. But marry him, marry him, Miss  Greeby. I shall help you all I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can do without assistance,&rdquo; said the woman coolly. &ldquo;All I ask you to do is to  refrain from fighting with Lambert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  Pine&rsquo;s face became lowering again. &ldquo;Is he at The Manor? You said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what I said. He is not at The Manor, but he is stopping in the cottage a  stone&rsquo;s throw from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  breathed hard, and again had a spasm of coughing. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Painting  pictures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not been near The Manor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And what is more, he told me to-day that he did not intend to go near the  house. I don&rsquo;t think you need be afraid, Pine. Lambert is a man of honor, and I  hope to get him to be my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall never be my wife&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; said the millionaire between his teeth and  scowling heavily. &ldquo;I know that I shan&rsquo;t live to anything like three score and  ten. Your infernal hot-house civilization has killed me. But if Lambert thinks  to marry my widow he shall do so in the face of Garvington&rsquo;s opposition, and  will find Agnes a pauper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean exactly?&rdquo; Miss Greeby flung away the stump of her cigarette and  rose to her feet.</p>
  <p>Pine  wiped his brow and breathed heavily. &ldquo;I mean that I have left Agnes my money,  only on condition that she does <i>not</i> marry Lambert. She can marry any one else she has a mind to. I except her  cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she loves him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and because he loves her, d&mdash;n him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Miss Greeby, lying fluently, and heartily wishing that her lie  could be a truth. &ldquo;He loves me, and I intend to marry him. Now you can  understand what I meant when I declared that I had honor enough to keep your  secret. Lambert is my honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then I believe in your honor,&rdquo; sneered Pine cynically. &ldquo;It is a selfish quality  in this case, which can only be gratified by preserving silence. If Agnes knew  that I was a true Romany tramp, she might run away with Lambert, and as you  want him to be your husband, it is to your interest to hold your tongue. Thank  you for nothing, Miss Greeby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you Lambert loves me,&rdquo; cried the woman doggedly, trying to persuade her  heart that she spoke truly. &ldquo;And whether you leave your money to your wife, or  to any one else, makes no manner of difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think otherwise,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;And it is just as well to be on the safe side.  If my widow marries Lambert, she loses my millions, and they go to&mdash;&rdquo; He checked  himself abruptly. &ldquo;Never mind who gets them. It is a person in whom you can  take no manner of interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby pushed the point of her bludgeon into the spongy ground, and looked  thoughtful. &ldquo;If Lambert loves Agnes still, which I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; she  observed, after a pause, &ldquo;he would marry her even if she hadn&rsquo;t a shilling.  Your will excluding him as her second husband is merely the twisting of a rope  of sand, Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget,&rdquo; said the man quickly, &ldquo;that I declared also, he would have to marry  her in the face of Garvington&rsquo;s opposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you guess? Garvington only allowed me to marry his sister because I am a  wealthy man. I absolutely bought my wife by helping him, and she gave herself  to me without love to save the family name from disgrace. She is a good woman,  is Agnes, and always places duty before inclination. Marriage with her pauper  cousin meant practically the social extinction of the Lambert family, and  nothing would have remained but the title. Therefore she married me, and I felt  mean at the time in accepting the sacrifice. But I was so deeply in love with  her that I did so. I love her still, and I am mean enough still to be jealous  of this cousin. She shall never marry him, and I know that Garvington will  appeal to his sister&rsquo;s strong desire to save the family once more; so that she  may not be foolish enough to lose the money. And two millions, more or less,&rdquo;  ended Pine cynically, &ldquo;is too large a sum to pay for a second husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Agnes know these conditions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Nor do I intend that she should know. You hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby pulled on her heavy gloves and nodded. &ldquo;I told you that I had some  notion of honor. Will you let Lambert know that you are in this neighborhood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  There is no need. I am stopping here only for a time to see a certain person.  Silver will look after Agnes, and is coming to the camp to report upon what he  has observed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver  then knows that you are Ishmael Hearne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He knows all my secrets, and I can trust him thoroughly, since he owes  everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby laughed scornfully. &ldquo;That a man of your age and experience should  believe in gratitude. Well, it&rsquo;s no business of mine. You may be certain that  for my own purpose I shall hold my tongue and shall keep Lambert from seeking  your wife. Not that he loves her,&rdquo; she added hastily, as Pine&rsquo;s brows again drew  together. &ldquo;But she loves him, and may use her arts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you dare to speak of arts in connection with my wife,&rdquo; broke in the man  roughly. &ldquo;She is no coquette, and I trust her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  long as Silver looks after her,&rdquo; finished Miss Greeby contemptuously. &ldquo;What  chivalrous confidence. Well, I must be going. Any message to your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! No!&rdquo; broke in Pine once more. &ldquo;She is not to know that I am here, or  anything about my true position and name. You promised, and you will keep your  promise. But there, I know that you will, as self-interest will make you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  now you talk common sense. It is a pity you don&rsquo;t bring it to bear in the case  of Silver, whom you trust because you have benefited him. Good-day, you very  unsophisticated person. I shall see you again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  London as Hubert Pine,&rdquo; said the millionaire abruptly, and Miss Greeby, with a  good-humored shrug, marched away, swinging her stick and whistling gayly. She  was very well satisfied with the knowledge she had obtained, as the chances  were that it would prove useful should Lambert still hanker after the  unattainable woman. Miss Greeby had lulled Pine&rsquo;s suspicions regarding the  young man&rsquo;s love for Agnes, but she knew in her heart that she had only done so  by telling a pack of miserable lies. Now, as she walked back to The Manor, she  reflected that by using her secret information dexterously, she might improve  such falsehood into tolerable truth.</p>
  <p>Pine  flung himself down again when she departed, and coughed in his usual violent  manner. His throat and lungs ached, and his brow was wet with perspiration.  With his elbows on his knees and his face between his hands, he sat miserably  thinking over his troubles. There was no chance of his living more than a few  years, as the best doctors in Europe and England had given him up, and when he  was placed below ground, the chances were that Agnes would marry his rival. He  had made things as safe as was possible against such a contingency, but who  knew if her love for Lambert might not make her willing to surrender the  millions. &ldquo;Unless Garvington can manage to arouse her family pride,&rdquo; groaned  Pine drearily. &ldquo;She sacrificed herself before for that, and perhaps she will do  so again. But who knows?&rdquo; And he could find no answer to this question, since  it is impossible for any man to say what a woman will do where her deepest  emotions are concerned.</p>
  <p>A  touch on Pine&rsquo;s shoulder made him leap to his feet with the alertness of a wild  animal on the lookout for danger. By his side stood Chaldea, and her eyes  glittered, as she came to the point of explanation without any preamble. The  girl was painfully direct. &ldquo;I have heard every word,&rdquo; she said triumphantly. &ldquo;And  I know what you are, brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you come here?&rdquo; demanded Pine sharply, and frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted to hear what a Romany had to do with a Gorgio lady, brother. And what do  I hear. Why, that you dwell in the Gentile houses, and take a Gentile name, and  cheat in a Gentile manner, and have wed with a Gentile romi. Speaking Romanly,  brother, it is not well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is as I choose, sister,&rdquo; replied Pine quietly, for since Chaldea had got the  better of him, it was useless to quarrel with her. &ldquo;And from what I do good  will come to our people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  laughed, and blew from her fingers a feather, carelessly picked up while in the  thicket which had concealed her eavesdropping. &ldquo;For that, I care that,&rdquo; said  she, pointing to the floating feather slowly settling. &ldquo;I looks to myself and  to my love, brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;  Pine raised his eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a Gorgio my heart is set on,&rdquo; pursued Chaldea steadfastly. &ldquo;A regular Romany  Rye, brother. Do you think Lambert is a good name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the name of the devil, sister,&rdquo; cried Pine hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very devil I love. To me sweet, as to you sour. And speaking Romanly, brother,  I want him to be my rom in the Gentile fashion, as you have a romi in your  Gorgious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will Kara say?&rdquo; said Pine, and his eyes flashed, for the idea of getting rid of  Lambert in this way appealed to him. The girl was beautiful, and with her added  cleverness she might be able to gain her ends, and these accomplished, would  certainly place a barrier between Agnes and her cousin, since the woman would  never forgive the man for preferring the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kara  plays on the fiddle, but not on my heart-strings,&rdquo; said Chaldea in a cool  manner, and watched Pine wickedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better help me, brother, if you don&rsquo;t  want that Gorgious romi of yours to pad the hoof with the rye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  blood rushed to Pine&rsquo;s dark cheeks. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  harm to my rye and I tell you, brother. Don&rsquo;t use the knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I will not do, if a wedding-ring from him to you will do as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will do, brother,&rdquo; said Chaldea calmly. &ldquo;My rye doesn&rsquo;t love me yet, but he  will, when I get him away from the Gentile lady&rsquo;s spells. They draw him,  brother, they draw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  do they draw him to?&rdquo; demanded Pine, his voice thick with passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the Gorgious house of the baro rai, the brother of your romi. Like an owl does  he go after dusk to watch the nest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Owl,&rdquo;  muttered Pine savagely. &ldquo;Cuckoo, rather. Prove this, my sister, and I help you  to gain the love you desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a bargain, brother&rdquo;&mdash;she held out her hand inquiringly&mdash;&ldquo;but no knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  shook hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain, sister. Your wedding-ring will part them as  surely as any knife. Tell me more!&rdquo; And Chaldea in whispers told him all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    The Woman And The Man</b></h2>
  <p>Quite  unaware that Destiny, that tireless spinner, was weaving sinister red threads  of hate and love into the web of his life, Lambert continued to live quietly in  his woodland retreat. In a somewhat misanthropic frame of mind he had retired  to this hermitage, after the failure of his love affair, since, lacking the  society of Agnes, there was nothing left for him to desire. From a garden of  roses, the world became a sandy desert, and denied the sole gift of fortune,  which would have made him completely happy, the disconsolate lover foreswore  society for solitude. As some seek religion, so Lambert hoped by seeking Nature&rsquo;s  breast to assuage the pains of his sore heart. But although the great Mother  could do so much, she could not do all, and the young man still felt restless  and weary. Hard work helped him more than a little, but he had his dark hours  during those intervals when hand and brain were too weary to create pictures.</p>
  <p>In  one way he blamed Agnes, because she had married for money; in another way he  did not blame her, because that same money had been necessary to support the  falling fortunes of the noble family to which Lambert belonged. An ordinary  person would not have understood this, and would have seen in the mercenary  marriage simply a greedy grasping after the loaves and fishes. But Lambert,  coming at the end of a long line of lordly ancestors, considered that both he  and his cousin owed something to those of the past who had built up the family.  Thus his pride told him that Agnes had acted rightly in taking Pine as her  husband, while his love cried aloud that the sacrifice was too hard upon their  individual selves. He was a Lambert, but he was also a human being, and the two  emotions of love and pride strove mightily against one another. Although quite  three years had elapsed since the victim had been offered at the altar&mdash;and a  willing victim to the family fetish&mdash;the struggle was still going on. And  because of its stress and strain, Lambert withdrew from society, so that he  might see as little as possible of the woman he loved. They had met, they had  talked, they had looked, in a conventionally light-hearted way, but both were  relieved when circumstances parted them. The strain was too great.</p>
  <p>Pine  arranged the circumstances, for hearing here, there, and everywhere, that his  wife had been practically engaged to her cousin before he became her husband,  he looked with jealous eyes upon their chance meetings. Neither to Agnes nor  Lambert did he say a single word, since he had no reason to utter it, so  scrupulously correct was their behavior, but his eyes were sufficiently  eloquent to reveal his jealousy. He took his wife for an American tour, and  when he brought her back to London, Lambert, knowing only too truly the reason  for that tour, had gone away in his turn to shoot big game in Africa. An attack  of malaria contracted in the Congo marshes had driven him back to England, and  it was then that he had begged Garvington to give him The Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage.  For six months he had been shut up here, occasionally going to London, or for a  week&rsquo;s walking tour, and during that time he had done his best to banish the  image of Agnes from his heart. Doubtless she was attempting the same conquest,  for she never even wrote to him. And now these two sorely-tried people were  within speaking distance of one another, and strange results might be looked  for unless honor held them sufficiently true. Seeing that the cottage was near  the family seat, and that Agnes sooner or later would arrive to stay with her  brother and sister-in-law, Lambert might have expected that such a situation  would come about in the natural course of things. Perhaps he did, and  perhaps&mdash;as some busybodies said&mdash;he took the cottage for that purpose; but so  far, he had refrained from seeking the society of Pine&rsquo;s wife. He would not  even dine at The Manor, nor would he join the shooting-party, although  Garvington, with a singular blindness, urged him to do so. While daylight  lasted, the artist painted desperately hard, and after dark wandered round the  lanes and roads and across the fields, haunting almost unconsciously the Manor  Park, if only to see in moonlight and twilight the casket which held the rich  jewel he had lost. This was foolish, and Lambert acknowledged that it was  foolish, but at the same time he added inwardly that he was a man and not an  angel, a sinner and not a saint, so that there were limits, etc., etc., etc.,  using impossible arguments to quieten a lively conscience that did not approve  of this dangerous philandering.</p>
  <p>The  visit of Miss Greeby awoke him positively to a sense of danger, for if she  talked&mdash;and talk she did&mdash;other people would talk also. Lambert asked himself if  it would be better to visit The Manor and behave like a man who has got over  his passion, or to leave the cottage and betake himself to London. While  turning over this problem in his mind, he painted feverishly, and for three  days after Miss Greeby had come to stir up muddy water, he remained as much as  possible in his studio. Chaldea visited him, as usual, to be painted, and  brought Kara with his green coat and beloved violin and hairy looks. The girl  chatted, Kara played, and Lambert painted, and all three pretended to be very  happy and careless. This was merely on the surface, however, for the artist was  desperately wretched, because the other half of himself was married to another  man, while Chaldea, getting neither love-look nor caress, felt savagely  discontented. As for Kara, he had long since loved Chaldea, who treated him  like a dog, and he could not help seeing that she adored the Gentile artist&mdash;a  knowledge which almost broke his heart. But it was some satisfaction for him to  note that Lambert would have nothing to do with the siren, and that she could  not charm him to her feet, sang she ever so tenderly. It was an unhappy trio at  the best.</p>
  <p>The  gypsies usually came in the morning, since the light was then better for  artistic purposes, but they always departed at one o&rsquo;clock, so that Lambert had  the afternoon to himself. Chaldea would fain have lingered in order to charm  the man she loved into subjection; but he never gave her the least  encouragement, so she was obliged to stay away. All the same, she often haunted  the woods near the cottage, and when Lambert came out for a stroll, which he  usually did when it became too dark to paint, he was bound to run across her.  Since he had not the slightest desire to make love to her, and did not fathom  the depth of her passion, he never suspected that she purposely contrived the  meetings which he looked upon as accidental.</p>
  <p>Since  Chaldea hung round the house, like a moth round a candle, she saw every one who  came and went from the woodland cottage. On the afternoon of the third day  since Pine&rsquo;s arrival at the camp in the character of Ishmael Hearne, the gypsy  saw Lady Agnes coming through the wood. Chaldea knew her at once, having often  seen her when she had come to visit Mother Cockleshell a few months previously.  With characteristic cunning, the girl dived into the undergrowth, and there  remained concealed for the purpose of spying on the Gentile lady whom she  regarded as a rival. Immediately, Chaldea guessed that Lady Agnes was on her  way to the cottage, and, as Lambert was alone as usual for the afternoon, the  two would probably have a private conversation. The girl swiftly determined to  listen, so that she might learn exactly how matters stood between them. It  might be that she would discover something which Pine&mdash;Chaldea now thought of  him as Pine&mdash;might like to know. So having arranged this in her own unscrupulous  mind, the girl behind a juniper bush jealously watched the unsuspecting lady.  What she saw did not please her overmuch, as Lady Agnes was rather too  beautiful for her unknown rival&rsquo;s peace of mind.</p>
  <p>Sir  Hubert&rsquo;s wife was not really the exquisitely lovely creature Chaldea took her  to be, but her fair skin and brown hair were such a contrast to the gypsy&rsquo;s  swarthy face and raven locks, that she really looked like an angel of light  compared with the dark child of Nature. Agnes was tall and slender, and moved  with a great air of dignity and calm self-possession, and this to the  uncontrolled Chaldea was also a matter of offence. She inwardly tried to  belittle her rival by thinking what a milk-and-water useless person she was,  but the steady and resolute look in the lady&rsquo;s brown eyes gave the lie to this  mental assertion. Lady Agnes had an air of breeding and command, which, with  all her beauty, Chaldea lacked, and as she passed along like a cold, stately goddess,  the gypsy rolled on the grass in an ecstasy of rage. She could never be what  her rival was, and what her rival was, as she suspected, formed Lambert&rsquo;s ideal  of womanhood. When she again peered through the bush, Lady Agnes had  disappeared. But there was no need for Chaldea to ask her jealous heart where  she had gone. With the stealth and cunning of a Red Indian, the gypsy took up  the trail, and saw the woman she followed enter the cottage. For a single  moment she had it in her mind to run to the camp and bring Pine, but reflecting  that in a moment of rage the man might kill Lambert, Chaldea checked her first  impulse, and bent all her energies towards getting sufficiently near to listen  to a conversation which was not meant for her ears.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Agnes had been admitted by Mrs. Tribb, a dried-up little woman with the rosy  face of a winter apple, and a continual smile of satisfaction with herself and  with her limited world. This consisted of the cottage, in the wood, and of the  near villages, where she repaired on occasions to buy food. Sometimes, indeed,  she went to The Manor, for, born and bred on the Garvington estates, Mrs. Tribb  knew all the servants at the big house. She had married a gamekeeper, who had  died, and unwilling to leave the country she knew best, had gladly accepted the  offer of Lord Garvington to look after the woodland cottage. In this way  Lambert became possessed of an exceedingly clean housekeeper, and a wonderfully  good cook. In fact so excellent a cook was Mrs. Tribb, that Garvington had  frequently suggested she should come to The Manor. But, so far, Lambert had  managed to keep the little woman to himself. Mrs. Tribb adored him, since she  had known him from babyhood, and declined to leave him under any circumstances.  She thought Lambert the best man in the world, and challenged the universe to  find another so handsome and clever, and so considerate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me, my lady, is it yourself?&rdquo; said Mrs. Tribb, throwing up her dry little hands  and dropping a dignified curtsey. &ldquo;Well, I do call it good of you to come and  see Master Noel. He don&rsquo;t go out enough, and don&rsquo;t take enough interest in his  stomach, if your ladyship will pardon my mentioning that part of him. But you  don&rsquo;t know, my lady, what it is to be a cook, and to see the dishes get cold,  while he as should eat them goes on painting, not but what Master Noel don&rsquo;t  paint like an angel, as I&rsquo;ve said dozens of times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  Mrs. Tribb ran on in this manner her lively black eyes twinkled anxiously. She  knew that her master and Lady Agnes had been, as she said herself, &ldquo;next door  to engaged,&rdquo; and knew also that Lambert was fretting over the match which had  been brought about for the glorification of the family. The housekeeper,  therefore, wondered why Lady Agnes had come, and asked herself whether it would  not be wise to say that Master Noel&mdash;from old associations, she always called  Lambert by this juvenile title&mdash;was not at home. But she banished the thought as  unworthy, the moment it entered her active brain, and with another curtsey in response  to the visitor&rsquo;s greeting, she conducted her to the studio. &ldquo;Them two angels  will never do no wrong, anyhow,&rdquo; was Mrs. Tribb&rsquo;s reflection, as she closed the  door and left the pair together. &ldquo;But I do hope as that black-faced husband won&rsquo;t  ever learn. He&rsquo;s as jealous as Cain, and I don&rsquo;t want Master Noel to be no  Abel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  Mrs. Tribb, instead of going to the kitchen, which she did, had gone out of the  front door, she would have found Chaldea lying full length amongst the flowers  under the large window of the studio. This was slightly open, and the girl  could hear every word that was spoken, while so swiftly and cleverly had she  gained her point of vantage, that those within never for one moment suspected  her presence. If they had, they would assuredly have kept better guard over  their tongues, for the conversation was of the most private nature, and did not  tend to soothe the eavesdropper&rsquo;s jealousy.</p>
  <p>Lambert  was so absorbed in his painting&mdash;he was working at the Esmeralda-Quasimodo  picture&mdash;that he scarcely heard the studio door open, and it was only when Mrs.  Tribb&rsquo;s shrill voice announced the name of his visitor, that he woke to the  surprising fact that the woman he loved was within a few feet of him. The blood  rushed to his face, and then retired to leave him deadly pale, but Agnes was  more composed, and did not let her heart&rsquo;s tides mount to high-water mark. On  seeing her self-possession, the man became ashamed that he had lost his own,  and strove to conceal his momentary lapse into a natural emotion, by pushing  forward an arm-chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a surprise, Agnes,&rdquo; he said in a voice which he strove vainly to render  steady. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; and she took her seat like a queen on her throne, looking fair and  gracious as any white lily. What with her white dress, white gloves and shoes,  and straw hat tied under her chin with a broad white ribbon in old Georgian  fashion, she looked wonderfully cool, and pure, and&mdash;as Lambert inwardly  observed&mdash;holy. Her face was as faintly tinted with color as is a tea-rose, and  her calm, brown eyes, under her smooth brown hair, added to the suggestive  stillness of her looks. She seemed in her placidity to be far removed from any  earthly emotion, and resembled a picture of the Madonna, serene, peaceful, and  somewhat sad. Yet who could tell what anguished feelings were masked by her  womanly pride?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you do not find the weather too warm for walking,&rdquo; said Lambert, reining  in his emotions with an iron hand, and speaking conventionally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I enjoyed the walk. I am staying at The Manor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are staying here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  can be no doubt on that point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think you are acting wisely?&rdquo; she asked with great calmness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might put the same question to you, Agnes, seeing that you have come to live  within three miles of my hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is because you are living in what you call your hermitage that I have come,&rdquo;  rejoined Agnes, with a slight color deepening her cheeks. &ldquo;Is it fair to me  that you should shut yourself up and play the part of the disappointed lover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert,  who had been touching up his picture here and there, laid down his palette and  brushes with ostentatious care, and faced her doggedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand  what you mean,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think you do; and in the hope that I may induce you, in justice to me, to  change your conduct, I have come over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you should have come,&rdquo; he observed in a low voice, and threw  himself on the couch with averted eyes.</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes colored again. &ldquo;You are talking nonsense,&rdquo; she said with some sharpness. &ldquo;There  is no harm in my coming to see my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  were more than cousins once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,  and unfortunately people know that. But you needn&rsquo;t make matters worse by so  pointedly keeping away from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  looked up quickly. &ldquo;Do you wish me to see you often?&rdquo; he asked, and there was a  new note in his voice which irritated her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Personally  I don&rsquo;t, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what?&rdquo; He rose and stood up, very tall and very straight, looking down on her  with a hungry look in his blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People  are talking,&rdquo; murmured the lady, and stared at the floor, because she could not  face that same look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  them talk. What does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  to you, perhaps, but to me a great deal. I have a husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I know to my cost,&rdquo; he interpolated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t let me know it to my cost,&rdquo; she said pointedly. &ldquo;Sit down and let us talk  common sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  did not obey at once. &ldquo;I am only a human being, Agnes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and a man at that. Act like a man, then, and don&rsquo;t place the burden on a  woman&rsquo;s shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  burden?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Noel, can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay I can if you will explain. I wish you hadn&rsquo;t come here to-day. I have  enough to bear without that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  have I nothing to bear?&rdquo; she demanded, a flash of passion ruffling her enforced  calm. &ldquo;Do you think that anything but the direst need brought me here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what brought you here. I am waiting for an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the use of explaining what you already know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing,&rdquo; he repeated doggedly. &ldquo;Explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Lady Agnes with some bitterness, &ldquo;it seems to me that an explanation is  really necessary, as apparently I am talking to a child instead of a man. Sit  down and listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time Lambert obeyed, and laughed as he did so. &ldquo;Your taunts don&rsquo;t hurt me in  the least,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I love you too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I love in return. No! Don&rsquo;t rise again. I did not come here to revive the  embers of our dead passion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Embers!&rdquo;  cried Lambert with bitter scorn. &ldquo;Embers, indeed! And a dead passion; how well  you put it. So far as I am concerned, Agnes, the passion is not dead and never  will be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am aware of that, and so I have come to appeal to that passion. Love means  sacrifice. I want you to understand that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, by experience. Did I not surrender you for the sake of the family name?  Understand! I should think I did understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;not,&rdquo;  said Lady Agnes slowly and gently. &ldquo;It is necessary to revive your  recollections. We loved one another since we were boy and girl, and we  intended, as you know, to marry. There was no regular engagement between us,  but it was an understood family arrangement. My father always approved of it;  my brother did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Because he saw in you an article of sale out of which he hoped to make money,&rdquo;  sneered Lambert, nursing his ankle.</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes winced. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it too hard for me,&rdquo; she said plaintively. &ldquo;My life  is uncomfortable enough as it is. Remember that when my father died we were  nearly ruined. Only by the greatest cleverness did Garvington manage to keep  interest on the mortgages paid up, hoping that he would marry a rich wife&mdash;an  American for choice&mdash;and so could put things straight. But he married Jane, as  you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he is a glutton, and she knows all about cooking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  gluttony may be as powerful a vice as drinking and gambling, and all the rest  of it. It is with Garvington, although I daresay that seeing the position he  was in, people would laugh to think he should marry a poor woman, when he  needed a rich wife. But at that time Hubert wanted to marry me, and Garvington  got his cook-wife, while I was sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seeing  that I loved you and you loved me, I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know you wondered, but you finally accepted my explanation that I did it to  save the family name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, and, much as I hated your sacrifice, it was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  necessary than you think,&rdquo; said Lady Agnes, sinking her voice to a whisper and  glancing round, &ldquo;In a moment of madness Garvington altered a check which Hubert  gave him, and was in danger of arrest. Hubert declared that he would give up  the check if I married him. I did so, to save my brother and the family name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Agnes!&rdquo; Lambert jumped up. &ldquo;I never knew this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not necessary to tell you. I made the excuse of saving the family name and  property generally. You thought it was merely the bankruptcy court, but I knew  that it meant the criminal court. However, I married Hubert, and he put the  check in the fire in my presence and in Garvington&rsquo;s. He has also fulfilled his  share of the bargain which he made when he bought me, and has paid off a great  many of the mortgages. However, Garvington became too outrageous in his  demands, and lately Hubert has refused to help him any more. I don&rsquo;t blame him;  he has paid enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are worth it,&rdquo; said Lambert emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you may think so, and perhaps he does also. But does it not strike you, Noel,  what a poor figure I and Garvington, and the whole family, yourself included,  cut in the eyes of the world? We were poor, and I was sold to get money to save  the land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but this changing of the check also&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  world doesn&rsquo;t know of that,&rdquo; said Agnes hurriedly. &ldquo;Hubert has been very loyal  to me. I must be loyal to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are. Who dares to say that you are not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one&mdash;as yet,&rdquo; she replied pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo; he demanded, flushing through his fair skin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that if you met me in the ordinary way, and behaved to me as an ordinary  man, people would not talk. But you shun my society, and even when I am at The  Manor, you do not come near because of my presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is so hard to be near you and yet, owing to your marriage, so far from you,&rdquo;  muttered the man savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is hard for you, think how hard it must be for me,&rdquo; said the woman  vehemently, her passion coming to the surface. &ldquo;People talk of the way in which  you avoid me, and hint that we love one another still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true! Agnes, you know it is true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need  the whole world know that it is true?&rdquo; cried Agnes, rising, with a gust of  anger passing over her face. &ldquo;If you would only come to The Manor, and meet me  in London, and accept Hubert&rsquo;s invitations to dinner, people would think that  our attachment was only a boy and girl engagement, that we had outgrown. They  would even give me credit for loving Hubert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Lambert with a jealous pang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do. He is my chosen husband, and has carried out his part of the bargain by  freeing many of Garvington&rsquo;s estates. Surely the man ought to have something  for his money. I don&rsquo;t love him as a wife should love her husband, not with  heart-whole devotion, that is. But I give him loyalty, and I respect him, and I  try to make him happy in every way. I do my part, Noel, as you do yours. Since  I have been compelled to sacrifice love for money, at least let us be true to  the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t sacrifice yourself wholly for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not. It was because of Garvington&rsquo;s crime. But no one knows of that, and  no one ever shall know. In fact, so happy am I and Hubert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo;  said Lambert wincing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she declared firmly. &ldquo;He thinks so, and whatever unhappiness I may feel, I  conceal from him. But you must come to The Manor, and meet me here, there, and  everywhere, so that people shall not say, as they are doing, that you are dying  of love, and that, because I am a greedy fortune-hunter, I ruined your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do not dare. I have not heard any&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can you hear in this jungle?&rdquo; interrupted Lady Agnes with scorn. &ldquo;You stop your  ears with cotton wool, but I am in the world, hearing everything. And the more  unpleasant the thing is, the more readily do I hear it. You can end this  trouble by coming out of your lovesick retirement, and by showing that you no  longer care for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be acting a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do I not act a lie?&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;Is not my whole marriage a lie? I  despise myself for my weakness in yielding, and yet, God help me, what else  could I do when Garvington&rsquo;s fair fame was in question? Think of the disgrace,  had he been prosecuted by Hubert. And Hubert knows that you and I loved; that I  could not give him the love he desired. He was content to accept me on those  terms. I don&rsquo;t say he was right; but am I right, are you right, is Garvington  right? Is any one of us right? Not one, not one. The whole thing is horrible,  but I make the best of it, since I did what I did do, openly and for a serious  purpose of which the world knows nothing. Do your part, Noel, and come to The  Manor, if only to show that you no longer care for me. You understand&rdquo;&mdash;she  clasped her hands in agony. &ldquo;You surely understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Lambert in a low voice, and suddenly looked years older. &ldquo;I understand at  last, Agnes. You shall no longer bear the burden alone. I shall be a loyal  friend to you, my dear,&rdquo; and he took her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you be a loyal friend to my husband?&rdquo; she asked, withdrawing it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Lambert, and he bit his lip. &ldquo;God helping me, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    The Man And The Woman</b></h2>
  <p>The  interview between Lady Agnes and Lambert could scarcely be called a love-scene,  since it was dominated by a stern sense of duty. Chaldea, lying at length  amongst the crushed and fragrant flowers, herself in her parti-colored attire  scarcely distinguishable from the rainbow blossoms, was puzzled by the way in  which the two reined in their obvious passions. To her simple, barbaric nature,  the situation appeared impossible. If he loved her and she loved him, why did  they not run away to enjoy life together? The husband who had paid money for  the wife did not count, nor did the brother, who had sold his sister to hide  his criminal folly. That Lady Agnes should have traded herself to save  Garvington from a well-deserved punishment, seemed inexcusable to the gypsy. If  he had been the man she loved, then indeed might she have acted rightly. But  having thrown over that very man in this silly fashion, for the sake of what  did not appear to be worth the sacrifice, Chaldea felt that Agnes did not  deserve Lambert, and she then and there determined that the Gentile lady should  never possess him.</p>
  <p>Of  course, on the face of it, there was no question of possession. The man being  weaker than the woman would have been only too glad to elope, and thus cut the  Gordian knot of the unhappy situation. But the woman, having acted from a high  sense of duty, which Chaldea could not rise to, evidently was determined to  continue to be a martyr. The question was, could she keep up that pose in the  face of the undeniable fact that she loved her cousin? The listening girl  thought not. Sooner or later the artificial barrier would be broken through by  the held-back flood of passion, and then Lady Agnes would run away from the man  who had bought her. And quite right, too, thought Chaldea, although she had no  notion of permitting such an elopement to take place. That Agnes would hold to  her bargain all her life, because Hubert had fulfilled his part, never occurred  to the girl. She was not civilized enough to understand this problem of a  highly refined nature.</p>
  <p>Since  the situation was so difficult, Lambert was glad to see the back of his cousin.  He escorted her to the door, but did not attend her through the wood. In fact,  they parted rather abruptly, which was wise. All had been said that could be  said, and Lambert had given his promise to share the burden with Agnes by  acting the part of a lover who had never really been serious. But it did not do  to discuss details, as these were too painful, so the woman hurried away  without a backward glance, and Lambert, holding his heart between his teeth,  returned to the studio. Neither one of the two noticed Chaldea crouching amongst  the flowers. Had they been less pre-occupied, they might have done so; as it  was she escaped observation.</p>
  <p>As  soon as the coast was clear, Chaldea stole like a snake along the ground,  through the high herbage of the garden, and beyond the circle of the mysterious  monoliths. Even across the lawns of the glade did she crawl, so as not to be  seen, although she need not have taken all this trouble, since Lambert, with a  set face and a trembling hand, was working furiously at a minor picture he  utilized to get rid of such moods. But the gypsy did not know this, and so  writhed into the woods like the snake of Eden&mdash;and of that same she was a very  fair sample&mdash;until, hidden by the boles of ancient trees, she could stand  upright. When she did so, she drew a long breath, and wondered what was best to  be done.</p>
  <p>The  most obvious course was to seek Ishmael and make a lying report of the  conversation. That his wife should have been with Lambert would be quite enough  to awaken the civilized gypsy&rsquo;s jealousy, for after all his civilization was  but skin deep. Still, if she did this, Chaldea was clever enough to see that  she would precipitate a catastrophe, and either throw Agnes into Lambert&rsquo;s  arms, or make the man run the risk of getting Pine&rsquo;s knife tickling his fifth  rib. Either result did not appeal to her. She wished to get Lambert to herself,  and his safety was of vital importance to her. After some consideration, she  determined that she would boldly face the lover, and confess that she had  overheard everything. Then she would have him in her power, since to save the  wife from the vengeance of the husband, although there was no reason for such  vengeance, he would do anything to keep the matter of the visit quiet. Of  course the interview had been innocent, and Chaldea knew that such was the  case. Nevertheless, by a little dexterous lying, and some vivid word-painting,  she could make things extremely unpleasant for the couple. This being so,  Lambert would have to subscribe to her terms. And these were, that he should  leave Agnes and marry her. That there was such a difference in their rank  mattered nothing to the girl. Love levelled all ranks, in her opinion.</p>
  <p>But  while arranging what she should do, if Lambert proved obstinate, Chaldea also  arranged to fascinate him, if possible, into loving her. She did not wish to  use her power of knowledge until her power of fascination failed. And this for  two reasons. In the first place, it was not her desire to drive the man into a  corner lest he should defy her and fight, which would mean&mdash;to her limited  comprehension&mdash;that everything being known to Pine, the couple would confess all  and elope. In the second place, Chaldea was piqued to think that Lambert should  prove to be so indifferent to her undeniable beauty, as to love this pale shadow  of a Gentile lady. She would make certain, she told herself, if he really  preferred the lily to the full-blown rose, and on his choice depended her next  step. Gliding back to the camp, she decided to attend to one thing at a time,  and the immediate necessity was to charm the man into submission. For this  reason Chaldea sought out the Servian gypsy, who was her slave.</p>
  <p>Her  slave Kara certainly was, but not her rom. If he had been her husband she would  not have dared to propose to him what she did propose. He was amiable enough as  a slave, because he had no hold over her, but if she married him according to  the gypsy law, he would then be her master, and should she indulge her fancy  for a Gentile, he would assuredly use a very nasty-looking knife, which he wore  under the green coat. Even as it was, Kara would not be pleased to fiddle to  her dancing, since he already was jealous of Lambert. But Chaldea knew how to  manage this part of the business, risky though it was. The hairy little ape  with the musician&rsquo;s soul had no claim on her, unless she chose to give him that  of a husband. Then, indeed, things would be different, but the time had not  come for marital slavery.</p>
  <p>The  schemer found Kara at the hour of sunset sitting at the door of the tent he  occupied, drawing sweet tones from his violin. This was the little man&rsquo;s way of  conversing, for he rarely talked to human beings. He spoke to the fiddle and  the fiddle spoke to him, probably about Chaldea, since the girl was almost  incessantly in his thoughts. She occupied them now, and when he raised his  shaggy head at the touch on his hump-back, he murmured with joy at the sight of  her flushed beauty. Had he known that the flush came from jealousy of a rival,  Kara might not have been so pleased. The two conversed in Romany, since the  Servian did not speak English.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;  questioned Chaldea, standing in the glory of the rosy sunset which slanted  through the trees. &ldquo;What of Ishmael?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is with Gentilla in her tent, sister. Do you wish to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  shook her proud head. &ldquo;What have I to do with the half Romany? Truly, brother,  his heart is Gentile, though his skin be of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should that be, sister, when his name signifies that he is of the gentle breed?&rdquo;  asked Kara, laying down his violin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentile  but not gentle,&rdquo; said Chaldea punning, then checked herself lest she should say  too much. She had sworn to keep Pine&rsquo;s secret, and intended to do so, until she  could make capital out of it. At present she could not, so behaved honorably. &ldquo;But  he&rsquo;s Romany enough to split words with the old witch by the hour, so let him  stay where he is. Brother, would you make money?&rdquo; Kara nodded and looked up  with diamond eyes, which glittered and gloated on the beauty of her dark face. &ldquo;Then,  brother,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;the Gorgio who paints gives me gold to dance for  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Servian&rsquo;s face&mdash;what could be seen of it for hair&mdash;grew sombre, and he spat  excessively. &ldquo;Curses on the Gentile!&rdquo; he growled low in his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  him, but not on the money, brother,&rdquo; coaxed the girl, stooping to pat his face.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine work, cheating the rye. But jealous you must not be, if the gold is  to chink in our pockets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kara  still frowned. &ldquo;Were you my romi, sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,  if I were. Then indeed. But your romi I am not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  day you will be. It would be a good fortune, sister. I am as ugly as you are  lovely, and we two together, you dancing to my playing, would make pockets of  red gold. White shows best when placed on black.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a mine of wisdom you are,&rdquo; jeered Chaldea, nodding. &ldquo;Yes. It is so, and my rom  you may be, if you obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if you let the Gorgio make love to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey!  Am I not a free Roman, brother? You have not yet caught the bird. It still  sings on the bough. If I kiss him I suck gold from his lips. If I put fond arms  around his neck I but gather wealth for us both. Can you snare a mouse without  cheese, brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kara  looked at her steadily, and then lifted his green coat to show the gleam of a  butcher knife. &ldquo;Should you go too far,&rdquo; he said significantly; and touched the  blade.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  bent swiftly, and snatching the weapon from his belt, flung it into the coarse  grass under the trees. &ldquo;So I fling you away,&rdquo; said she, and stamped with rage. &ldquo;Truly,  brother, speaking Romanly, you are a fool of fools, and take cheating for honesty.  I lure the Gorgio at my will, and says you whimpering-like, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s my romi,&rsquo;  the which is a lie. Bless your wisdom for a hairy toad, and good-bye, for I go  to my own people near Lundra, and never will he who doubted my honesty see me  more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned away, and Kara limped after her to implore forgiveness. He assured her  that he trusted her fully, and that whatever tricks she played the Gentile  would not be taken seriously by himself. &ldquo;Poison him I would,&rdquo; grumbled the  little gnome in his beard. &ldquo;For his golden talk makes you smile sweetly upon  him. But for the gold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for the gold we must play the fox. Well, brother, now that you talk so, wait  until the moon is up, then hide in the woods round the cottage dell with your  violin to your chin. I lure the rabbit from its hole, and then you play the  dance that delights the Gorgios. But what I do, with kisses or arm-loving, my  brother,&rdquo; she added shaking her finger, &ldquo;is but the play of the wind to shake  the leaves. Believe me honest and my rom you shall be&mdash;some day!&rdquo; and she went  away laughing, to eat and drink, for the long watching had tired her. As for  Kara he crawled again into the underwood to search for his knife. Apparently he  did not trust Chaldea as much as she wanted him to.</p>
  <p>Thus  it came about that when the moon rolled through a starry sky like a golden  wheel, Lambert, sighing at his studio window, saw a slim and graceful figure  glide into the clear space of lawn beyond the monoliths. So searching was the  thin moonlight that he recognized Chaldea at once, as she wandered here and  there restless as a butterfly, and apparently as aimless. But, had he known it,  she had her eyes on the cottage all the time, and had he failed to come forth  she would have come to inquire if he was at home. But the artist did come  forth, thinking to wile away an hour with the fascinating gypsy girl. Always  dressing for dinner, even in solitude, for the habit of years was too strong to  lay aside&mdash;and, moreover, he was fastidious in his dress to preserve his  self-respect&mdash;he appeared at the door looking slender and well-set up in his  dark clothes. Although it was August the night was warm, and Lambert did not  trouble to put on cap or overcoat. With his hands in his pockets and a cigar  between his lips he strolled over to the girl, where she swayed and swung in  the fairy light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo,  Chaldea,&rdquo; he said leisurely, and leaning against one of the moss-grown  monoliths, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rye,&rdquo; exclaimed Chaldea, with a well-feigned start of surprise. &ldquo;Avali the rye.  Sarishan, my Gorgious gentleman, you, too, are a nightbird. Have you come out  mousing like an owl? Ha! ha! and you hear the nightingale singing, speaking in  the Gentile manner,&rdquo; and clapping her hands she lifted up a full rich voice.</p>
  <p align="center">&ldquo;Dyal o pani repedishis,<br>
  &nbsp;M&rsquo;ro pirano hegedishis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does that mean, Chaldea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is an Hungarian song, and means that while the stream flows I hear the violin  of my love. Kara taught me the ditty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Kara is your love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Oh, no; oh, no,&rdquo; sang Chaldea, whirling round and round in quite a magical  manner. &ldquo;No rom have I, but a mateless bird I wander. Still I hear the violin  of my true love, my new love, who knows my droms, and that means my habits,  rye,&rdquo; she ended, suddenly speaking in a natural manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t hear the violin, however,&rdquo; said Lambert lazily, and thinking what a  picturesque girl she was in her many-hued rag-tag garments, and with the golden  coins glittering in her black hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will, rye, you will,&rdquo; she said confidentially. &ldquo;Come, my darling gentleman,  cross my hand with silver and I dance. I swear it. No hokkeny baro will you  behold when the wind pipes for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hokkeny  baro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great swindle, my wise sir. Hai, what a pity you cannot patter the gentle  Romany tongue. Kek! Kek! What does it matter, when you speak Gentile gibberish  like an angel. Sit, rye, and I dance for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  like Carmen and Don Jos&eacute; in the opera,&rdquo; murmured Lambert, sliding down to the  foot of the rude stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of her and of him? Were they Romans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carmen  was and Jos&eacute; wasn&rsquo;t. She danced herself into his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea&rsquo;s  eyes flashed, and she made a hasty sign to attract the happy omen of his saying  to herself. &ldquo;Kushto bak,&rdquo; cried Chaldea, using the gypsy for good luck. &ldquo;And to  me, to me,&rdquo; she clapped her hand. &ldquo;Hark, my golden rye, and watch me dance your  love into my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  wind was rising and sighed through the wood, shaking myriad leaves from the  trees. Blending with its faint cry came a long, sweet, sustained note of music.  Lambert started, so weird and unexpected was the sound. &ldquo;Kara, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he  asked, looking inquiringly at Chaldea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  talks to the night&mdash;he speaks with the wind. Oh-ah-ah-ah. Ah-oha-oha-oha-ho,&rdquo;  sang the gypsy, clapping her hands softly, then, as the music came breathing  from the hidden violin in dreamy sensuous tones, she raised her bare arms and  began to dance. The place, the dancer, the hour, the mysterious music, and the  pale enchantments of the moon&mdash;it was like fairyland.</p>
  <p>Lambert  soon let his cigar go out, so absorbed did he become in watching the dance. It  was a wonderful performance, sensuous and weirdly unusual. He had never seen a  dance exactly like it before. The violin notes sounded like actual words, and  the dancer answered them with responsive movements of her limbs, so that  without speech the onlooker saw a love-drama enacted before his eyes.  Chaldea&mdash;so he interpreted the dance&mdash;swayed gracefully from the hips, without  moving her feet, in the style of a Nautch girl. She was waiting for some one,  since to right and left she swung with a delicate hand curved behind her ear.  Suddenly she started, as if she heard an approaching footstep, and in maidenly  confusion glided to a distance, where she stood with her hands across her  bosom, the very picture of a surprised nymph. Mentally, the dance translated  itself to Lambert somewhat after this fashion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  waits for her lover. That little run forward means that she sees him coming.  She falls at his feet; she kisses them. He raises her&mdash;I suppose that panther  spring from the ground means that he raises her. She caresses him with much  fondling and many kisses. By Jove, what pantomime! Now she dances to please  him. She stops and trembles; the dance does not satisfy. She tries another. No!  No! Not that! It is too dreamy&mdash;the lover is in a martial mood. This time she  strikes his fancy. Kara is playing a wild Hungarian polonaise. Wonderful!  Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  might well say so, and he struggled to his feet, leaning against the pillar of  stone to see the dancer better. From the wood came the fierce and stirring Slav  music, and Chaldea&rsquo;s whole expressive body answered to every note as a needle  does to a magnet. She leaped, clicking her heels together, advanced, as if on  the foe, with a bound&mdash;was flung back&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;and again sprang to the  assault. She stiffened to stubborn resistance&mdash;she unexpectedly became pliant  and yielding and graceful, and voluptuous, while the music took on the dreamy  tones of love. And Lambert translated the change after his own idea:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  music does not please the dancer&mdash;it is too martial. She fears lest her lover  should rush off to the wars, and seeks to detain him by the dance of Venus. But  he will go. He rises; he speeds away; she breaks off the dance. Ah! what a cry  of despair the violin gave just now. She follows, stretching out her empty  arms. But it is useless&mdash;he is gone. Bah! She snaps her fingers. What does she  care! She will dance to please herself, and to show that her heart is yet  whole. What a Bacchanalian strain. She whirls and springs and swoops and leaps.  She comes near to me, whirling like a Dervish; she recedes, and then comes  spinning round again, like a mad creature. And then&mdash;oh, hang it! What do you  mean? Chaldea, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  had some excuse for suddenly bursting into speech, when he cried out vigorously:  &ldquo;Oh, hang it!&rdquo; for Chaldea whirled right up to him and had laid her arms round  his neck, and her lips against his cheek. The music stopped abruptly, with a  kind of angry snarl, as if Kara, furious at the sight, had put his wrath into  the last broken note. Then all was silent, and the artist found himself  imprisoned in the arms of the woman, which were locked round his neck. With an  oath he unlinked her fingers and flung her away from him fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  fool&mdash;you utter fool!&rdquo; cried Lambert, striving to calm down the beating of his  heart, and restrain the racing of his blood, for he was a man, and the sudden  action of the gypsy had nearly swept away his self-restraint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you&mdash;I love you,&rdquo; panted Chaldea from the grass, where he had thrown her. &ldquo;Oh,  my beautiful one, I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are crazy,&rdquo; retorted Lambert, quivering with many emotions to which he could  scarcely put a name, so shaken was he by the experience. &ldquo;What the devil do you  mean by behaving in this way?&rdquo; and his voice rose in such a gust of anger that  Kara, hidden in the wood, rejoiced. He could not understand what was being  said, but the tone of the voice was enough for him. He did not know whether  Chaldea was cheating the Gentile, or cheating him; but he gathered that in  either case, she had been repulsed. The girl knew that also, when her ardent  eyes swept across Lambert&rsquo;s white face, and she burst into tears of anger and  disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  rye, I give you all, and you take nothing,&rdquo; she wailed tearfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want anything. You silly girl, do you think that for one moment I was  ever in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;want  you&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;love me,&rdquo; sobbed Chaldea, grovelling on the grass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you want an impossibility,&rdquo; and to Lambert&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;s eye there appeared the  vision of a calm and beautiful face, far removed in its pure looks from the  flushed beauty of the fiery gypsy. To gain control of himself, he took out a  cigar and lighted it. But his hand trembled. &ldquo;You little fool,&rdquo; he muttered,  and sauntered, purposely, slowly toward the cottage.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  gathered herself up with the spring of a tigress, and in a moment was at his  elbow with her face black with rage. Her tears had vanished and with them went  her softer mood. &ldquo;You&mdash;you reject me,&rdquo; she said in grating tones, and shaking  from head to foot as she gripped his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  away your hand,&rdquo; commanded Lambert sharply, and when she recoiled a pace he  faced her squarely. &ldquo;You must have been drinking,&rdquo; he declared, hoping to  insult her into common sense. &ldquo;What would Kara say if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want Kara. I want you,&rdquo; interrupted Chaldea, her breast heaving, and  looking sullenly wrathful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can&rsquo;t have me. Why should you think of me in this silly way? We were very  good friends, and now you have spoiled everything. I can never have you to sit  for me again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea&rsquo;s  lip drooped. &ldquo;Never again? Never again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It is impossible, since you have chosen to act in this way. Come, you silly  girl, be sensible, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly  girl! Oh, yes, silly girl,&rdquo; flashed out Chaldea. &ldquo;And what is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She?&rdquo;  Lambert stiffened himself. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean the Gentile lady. I was under the window this afternoon. I heard all you  were talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man stepped back a pace and clenched his hands. &ldquo;You&mdash;listened?&rdquo; he asked  slowly, and with a very white face.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  nodded with a triumphant smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali!  And why not? You have no right to love another man&rsquo;s romi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not love her,&rdquo; began Lambert, and then checked himself, as he really could  not discuss so delicate a matter with this wildcat. &ldquo;Why did you listen, may I  ask?&rdquo; he demanded, passing his tongue over his dry lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love you, and love is jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  restrained himself by a violent effort from shaking her. &ldquo;You are talking  nonsense,&rdquo; he declared with enforced calmness. &ldquo;And it is ridiculous for you to  love a man who does not care in the least for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will come&mdash;I can wait,&rdquo; insisted Chaldea sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you wait until Doomsday it will make no difference. I don&rsquo;t love you, and I  have never given you any reason to think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chee-chee!&rdquo;  bantered the girl. &ldquo;Is that because I am not a raclan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  raclan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  married Gentile lady, that is. You love her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;see,  here, Chaldea, I am not going to talk over such things with you, as my affairs  are not your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are the business of the Gorgious female&rsquo;s rom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rom?  Her husband, you mean. What do you know of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that the Gentle Pine is really one of us,&rdquo; interrupted the girl quickly. &ldquo;Ishmael  Hearne is his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert Pine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ishmael  Hearne,&rdquo; insisted Chaldea pertly. &ldquo;He comes to the fire of the Gentle Romany  when he wearies of your Gorgious flesh-pots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pine  a gypsy,&rdquo; muttered Lambert, and the memory of that dark, lean, Eastern face  impressed him with the belief that what the girl said was true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali.  A true son of the road. He is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;  Lambert started violently. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say what I mean, rye. He you call Pine is in our camp enjoying the old life.  Shall I bring him to you?&rdquo; she inquired demurely.</p>
  <p>In  a flash Lambert saw his danger, and the danger of Agnes, seeing that the  millionaire was as jealous as Othello. However, it seemed to him that honesty  was the best policy at the moment. &ldquo;I shall see him myself later,&rdquo; he declared  after a pause. &ldquo;If you listened, you must know that there is no reason why I  should not see him. His wife is my cousin, and paid me a friendly visit&mdash;that is  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that is all,&rdquo; mocked the girl contemptuously. &ldquo;But if I tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  him what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you love his romi!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  knows that,&rdquo; said Lambert quietly. &ldquo;And knows also that I am an honorable man.  See here, Chaldea, you are dangerous, because this silly love of yours has  warped your common sense. You can make a lot of mischief if you so choose, I  know well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I shall choose, my golden rye, if you love me not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  set about it at once,&rdquo; said Lambert boldly. &ldquo;It is best to be honest, my girl.  I have done nothing wrong, and I don&rsquo;t intend to do anything wrong, so you can  say what you like. To-night I shall go to London, and if Pine, or Hearne, or  whatever you call him, wants me, he knows my town address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  defy me?&rdquo; panted Chaldea, her breast rising and falling quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  truth must prevail in the end. I make no bargain with a spy,&rdquo; and he gave her a  contemptuous look, as he strode into the cottage and shut the door with an  emphatic bang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai!&rdquo;  muttered the gypsy between her teeth. &ldquo;Hatch till the dood wells apr&eacute;,&rdquo; which  means: &ldquo;Wait until the moon rises!&rdquo; an ominous saying for Lambert.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    The Secretary</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  ever a man in so uncomfortable a position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  asked himself this question as soon as he was safe in his studio, and he found  it a difficult one to answer. It was true that what he had said to Agnes, and  what Agnes had said to him, was perfectly honest and extremely honorable,  considering the state of their feelings. But the conversation had been  overheard by an unscrupulous woman, whose jealousy would probably twist  innocence into guilt. It was certain that she would go to Pine and give him a  garbled version of what had taken place, in which case the danger was great,  both to himself and to Agnes. Lambert had spoken bravely enough to the marplot,  knowing that he had done no wrong, but now he was by no means sure that he had  acted rightly. Perhaps it would have been better to temporize but that would  have meant a surrender young to Chaldea&rsquo;s unmaidenly wooing. And, as the man  had not a spark of love for her in a heart given entirely to another woman, he  was unwilling even to feign playing the part of a lover.</p>
  <p>On  reflection he still held to his resolution to go to London, thinking that it  would be best for him to be out of reach of Agnes while Pine was in the  neighborhood. The news that the millionaire was a gypsy had astonished him at  first; but now that he considered the man&rsquo;s dark coloring and un-English looks,  he quite believed that what Chaldea said was true. And he could understand also  that Pine&mdash;or Hearne, since that was his true name&mdash;would occasionally wish to  breathe the free air of heath and road since he had been cradled under a tent,  and must at times feel strongly the longing for the old lawless life. But why  should he revert to his beginnings so near to his brother-in-law&rsquo;s house, where  his wife was staying? &ldquo;Unless he came to keep an eye on her,&rdquo; murmured Lambert,  and unconsciously hit on the very reason of the pseudo-gypsy&rsquo;s presence at  Garvington.</p>
  <p>After  all, it would be best to go to London for a time to wait until he saw what  Chaldea would do. Then he could meet Pine and have an understanding with him.  The very fact that Pine was a Romany, and was on his native heath, appealed to  Lambert as a reason why he should not seek out the man immediately, as he  almost felt inclined to do, in order to forestall Chaldea&rsquo;s story. As Hearne,  the millionaire&rsquo;s wild instincts would be uppermost, and he would probably not  listen to reason, whereas if the meeting took place in London, Pine would  resume to a certain extent his veneer of civilization and would be more willing  to do justice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  decided Lambert, rising and stretching himself. &ldquo;I shall go to London and wait  to turn over matters in my own mind. I shall say nothing to Agnes until I know  what is best to be done about Chaldea. Meanwhile, I shall see the girl and get  her to hold her tongue for a time&mdash;Damn!&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s making the best of a  dangerous situation, but I don&rsquo;t see my way to a proper adjustment yet. The  most necessary thing is to gain time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this in his mind he hastily packed a gladstone bag, changed into tweeds, and  told Mrs. Tribb that he was going to London for a day or so. &ldquo;I shall get a  trap at the inn and drive to the station,&rdquo; he said, as he halted at the door. &ldquo;You  will receive a wire saying when I shall return,&rdquo; and leaving the dry little  woman, open-mouthed at this sudden departure, the young man hastened away.</p>
  <p>Instead  of going straight to the village, he took a roundabout road to the camp on the  verge of Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. Here he found the vagrants in a state of great  excitement, as Lord Garvington had that afternoon sent notice by a gamekeeper  that they were to leave his land the next day. Taken up with his own private  troubles, Lambert did not pay much attention to those of the tribe, and looked  about for Chaldea. He finally saw her sitting by one of the fires, in a  dejected attitude, and touched her on the shoulder. At once, like a disturbed  animal, she leaped to her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rye!&rdquo; said Chaldea, with a gasp, and a hopeful look on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me three days before you say anything to Pine,&rdquo; said Lambert in a low voice,  and a furtive look round. &ldquo;You understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the girl boldly. &ldquo;Unless you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind what I mean,&rdquo; interrupted the man hastily, for he was determined not to  commit himself. &ldquo;Will you hold your tongue for three days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  looked hard at his face, upon which the red firelight played brightly, but  could not read what was in his mind. However, she thought that the request  showed a sign of yielding, and was a mute confession that he knew he was in her  power. &ldquo;I give you three days,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have your promise then, so good-bye,&rdquo; interrupted Lambert abruptly, and walked  away hastily in the direction of Garvington village. His mind was more or less  of a chaos, but at all events he had gained time to reduce the chaos to some  sort of order. Still as yet he could not see the outcome of the situation and  departed swiftly in order to think it over.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  made a step or two, as if to follow, but a reflection that she could do no good  by talking at the moment, and a certainty that she held him in the hollow of  her hand, made her pause. With a hitch of her shapely shoulders she resumed her  seat by the fire, brooding sombrely on the way in which this Gentile had  rejected her love. Bending her black brows and showing her white teeth like an  irritated dog, she inwardly cursed herself for cherishing so foolish a love.  Nevertheless, she did not try to overcome it, but resolved to force the Gorgio  to her feet. Then she could spurn him if she had a mind to, as he had spurned  her. But she well knew, and confessed it to herself with a sigh, that there  would be no spurning on her part, since her wayward love was stronger than her  pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  the Gentile bring the gold, my sister?&rdquo; asked a harsh voice, and she raised her  head to see Kara&rsquo;s hairy face bent to her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  brother. He goes to Lundra to get the gold. Did I not play my fish in fine  style?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took it for truth, sister!&rdquo; said Kara, looking at her searchingly.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  nodded wearily. &ldquo;I am a great witch, as you can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be my romi when the gold chinks in our pockets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  for certain, brother. It&rsquo;s a true fortune!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  our camp is changed, sister?&rdquo; persisted the man greedily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  for to-morrow we may take the road, since the great lord orders us off his  land. And yet&mdash;&rdquo; Chaldea stood up, suddenly recollecting what had been said by  Pine&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;Why should we leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rabbit can&rsquo;t kick dust in the fox&rsquo;s face, sister,&rdquo; said Kara, meaning that  Garvington was too strong for the gypsies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are rabbits and rabbits,&rdquo; said Chaldea sententiously. &ldquo;Where is Hearne,  brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Gentilla&rsquo;s tent with a Gorgious gentleman. He&rsquo;s trading a horse with the swell  rye, and wants no meddling with his time, sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  meddle now,&rdquo; snapped Chaldea, and walked away in her usual free and graceful  manner. Kara shrugged his shoulders and then took refuge in talking to his  violin, to which he related his doubts of the girl&rsquo;s truth. And he smiled  grimly, as he thought of the recovered knife which was again snugly hidden  under his weather-worn green coat.</p>
  <p>Chaldea,  who did not stand on ceremony, walked to the end of the camp without paying any  attention to the excited gypsies, and flung back the flap of the old woman&rsquo;s  tent. Mother Cockleshell was not within, as she had given the use of her abode  to Pine and his visitor. This latter was a small, neat man with a smooth,  boyish face and reddish hair. He had the innocent expression of a fox-terrier,  and rather resembled one. He was neatly and inoffensively dressed in blue  serge, and although he did not look exactly like a gentleman, he would have  passed for one in a crowd. When Chaldea made her abrupt entrance he was talking  volubly to Pine, and the millionaire addressed him&mdash;when he answered&mdash;as Silver.  Chaldea, remembering the conversation she had overheard between Pine and Miss Greeby,  speedily reached the conclusion that the neat little man was the secretary  referred to therein. Probably he had come to report about Lady Agnes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, sister?&rdquo; demanded Pine sharply, and making a sign that Silver should  stop talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  the camp travel to-morrow, brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  yes,&rdquo; retorted Pine abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  perhaps no, brother, if you use your power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  raised his faint eyebrows and looked questioningly at his employer, as if to  ask what this cryptic sentence meant. Pine knew only too well, since Chaldea  had impressed him thoroughly with the fact that she had overheard many of his  secrets. Therefore he did not waste time in argument, but nodded quietly. &ldquo;Sleep  in peace, sister. The camp shall stay, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do wish it!&rdquo; She glanced at Silver and changed her speech to Romany. &ldquo;The ring  will be here,&rdquo; tapping her finger, &ldquo;in one week if we stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  be it, sister,&rdquo; replied Pine, also in Romany, and with a gleam of satisfaction  in his dark eyes. &ldquo;Go now and return when this Gentile goes. What of the golden  Gorgious one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  seeks Lundra this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the ring, sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  looked hard at him. &ldquo;For the ring&rdquo; she said abruptly, then dropping the  tent-flap which she had held all the time, she disappeared.</p>
  <p>Silver  looked at his master inquiringly, and noted that he seemed very satisfied. &ldquo;What  did she say in Romany?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  news and new news, and news you never heard of,&rdquo; mocked Pine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask  questions, Mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  since I am your secretary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are secretary to Hubert Pine, not to Ishmael Hearne,&rdquo; broke in the other man. &ldquo;And  when Romany is spoken it concerns the last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver&rsquo;s  pale-colored, red-rimmed eyes twinkled in an evil manner. &ldquo;You are afraid that  I may learn too much about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know all that is to be known,&rdquo; retorted Pine sharply. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t have you  meddle with my Romany business. A Gentile such as you are cannot understand the  chals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need. You are my secretary&mdash;my trusted secretary&mdash;that is quite enough. I pay  you well to keep my secrets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t keep them because you pay me,&rdquo; said Silver quickly, and with a look of  meekness belied by the sinister gleam in his pale bluish eyes. &ldquo;It is devotion  that makes me honest. I owe everything to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you do,&rdquo; observed Pine quietly. &ldquo;When I found you in Whitechapel you were  only a pauper toymaker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  inventor of toys, remember. You made your fortune out of my inventions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  three clever toys you invented laid the foundations of my wealth,&rdquo; corrected  the millionaire calmly. &ldquo;But I made my money in the South African share  business. And if I hadn&rsquo;t taken up your toys, you would have been now  struggling in Whitechapel, since there was no one but me to exploit your brains  in the toy-making way. I have rescued you from starvation; I have made you my  secretary, and pay you a good salary, and I have introduced you to good  society. Yes, you do indeed owe everything to me. Yet&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Greeby observed that those who have most cause to be grateful are generally the  least thankful to those who befriend them. I am not sure but what she is right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  pushed up his lower lip contemptuously, and a derisive expression came over his  clean-shaven face. &ldquo;Does a clever man like you go to that emancipated woman for  experience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Emancipated  women are usually very clever,&rdquo; said Pine dryly, &ldquo;as they combine the logic of  the male with the intuition of the female. And I have observed myself, in many  cases, that kindness brings out ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  looked sullen and uneasy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should talk to me in this  strain,&rdquo; he said irritably. &ldquo;I appreciate what you have done for me, and have  no reason to treat you badly. If I did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would break you,&rdquo; flamed out his employer, angered by the mere thought. &ldquo;So  long as you serve me well, Silver, I am your friend, and I shall treat you as I  have always done, with every consideration. But you play any tricks on me, and&mdash;&rdquo;  he paused expressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I won&rsquo;t betray you, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the millionaire with emphasis. &ldquo;For if you do,  you return to your original poverty. And remember, Mark, that there is nothing  in my life which has any need of concealment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  cast a look round the tent and at the rough clothes of the speaker. &ldquo;No need of  any concealment?&rdquo; he asked significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; rejoined Pine violently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish my gypsy origin to be known in the  Gentile world. But if the truth did come to light, there is nothing to be  ashamed of. I commit no crime in calling myself by a Gorgio name and in  accumulating a fortune. You have no hold over me.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s look was so  threatening that Silver winced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t hint at any hold over you,&rdquo; he observed mildly. &ldquo;I am bound to you both  by gratitude and self-interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha.  That last is better. It is just as well that we have come to this  understanding. If you&mdash;&rdquo; Pine&rsquo;s speech was ended by a sharp fit of coughing, and  Silver looked at his contortions with a thin-lipped smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  kill yourself if you live this damp colonial sort of tent-life,&rdquo; was his  observation. &ldquo;Here, take a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  did so, and wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his rough coat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a  Gorgio,&rdquo; he said, weakly, for the fit had shaken him, &ldquo;and can&rsquo;t understand how  a bred and born Romany longs for the smell of the smoke, the space of the open  country, and the sound of the kalo jib. However, I did not ask you here to  discuss these things, but to take my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  Lady Agnes?&rdquo; asked the secretary, his eyes scintillating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have had those long ago, although, trusting my wife as I do, there was really  no need for me to ask you to watch her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is very true. Lady Agnes is exceedingly circumspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  lifted his shoulders. &ldquo;As happy as a woman can be who is married to one man  while she loves another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  expected an outburst of anger from his employer, but none came. On the  contrary, Pine sighed, restlessly. &ldquo;Poor soul. I did her a wrong in making her  my wife. She would have been happier with Lambert in his poverty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably!  Her tastes don&rsquo;t lie like those of other women in the direction of squandering  money. By the way, I suppose, since you are here, that you know Lambert is  staying in the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know that. And what of it?&rdquo; demanded the millionaire sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing;  only I thought you would like to know. I fancied you had come here to see if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. I can trust you to see that my wife and Lambert do not meet without  spying myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you love and trust your wife so entirely, I wonder you ask me to spy on her at  all,&rdquo; said Silver with a faint sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a woman, and we gypsies have sufficient of the Oriental in us to mistrust  even the most honest women. Lambert has not been to The Manor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  That&rsquo;s a bad sign. He can&rsquo;t trust himself in her presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  choke the life out of you, rat that you are, if you talk in such a way about my  wife. What you think doesn&rsquo;t matter. Hold your tongue, and come to business. I  asked you here to take my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  was rather cowed by this outburst, as he was cunning enough to know precisely  how far he could venture with safety. &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; he observed in sullen  tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington&mdash;as  I knew he would&mdash;has ordered us off the land. As the wood is really mine, since  I hold it as security, having paid off the mortgage, I don&rsquo;t choose that he  should deal with it as though it were his own. Here&rdquo;&mdash;he passed along a letter&mdash;&ldquo;I  have written that on my office paper, and you will see that it says, I have  heard how gypsies are camping here, and that it is my wish they should remain.  Garvington is not to order them off on any pretext whatsoever. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Silver nodded, and slipped the paper into his breast pocket after a hasty  glance at the contents, which were those the writer had stated. &ldquo;But if  Garvington wishes to know why you take such an interest in the gypsies, what am  I to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  nothing. Simply do what I have told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington  may suspect that you are a Romany.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t. He thinks that I&rsquo;m in Paris, and will never connect me with Ishmael  Hearne. If he asks questions when we meet I can tell him my own tale. By the  way, why is he so anxious to get rid of the tribe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  have been many burglaries lately in various parts of Hengishire,&rdquo; explained the  secretary. &ldquo;And Garvington is afraid lest the gypsies should be mixed up with  them. He thinks, this camp being near, some of the men may break into the  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense! Gypsies steal, I don&rsquo;t deny, but in an open way. They are not  burglars, however, and never will be. Garvington has never seen any near The  Manor that he should take fright in this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. Once or twice I have seen that girl who came to you  hanging about the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea?&rdquo;  Pine started and looked earnestly at his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She told Mrs. Belgrove&rsquo;s fortune one day when she met her in the park, and also  tried to make Lady Agnes cross her hand with silver for the same purpose.  Nothing came of that, however, as your wife refused to have her fortune told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  frowned and looked uneasy, remembering that Chaldea knew of his Gentile  masquerading. However, as he could see no reason to suspect that the girl had  betrayed him, since she had nothing to gain by taking such a course, he passed  the particular incident over. &ldquo;I must tell Chaldea not to go near The Manor,&rdquo;  he muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be wise; and tell the men also. Garvington has threatened to shoot any one  who tries to enter his house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington&rsquo;s  a little fool,&rdquo; said Pine violently. &ldquo;There is no chance that the Romany will  enter his house. He can set his silly mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you&rsquo;re warned,&rdquo; said Silver with an elaborate pretence of indifference.</p>
  <p>Pine  looked up, growling. &ldquo;What the devil do you mean, Mark? Do you think that I  intend to break in. Fool! A Romany isn&rsquo;t a thief of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancied from tradition that they were thieves of all sorts,&rdquo; retorted the  secretary coolly. &ldquo;And suppose you took a fancy to come quietly and see your  wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should never do that in this dress,&rdquo; interrupted the millionaire in a sharp  tone. &ldquo;My wife would then know my true name and birth. I wish to keep that from  her, although there is nothing disgraceful in the secret. I wonder why you say  that?&rdquo; he said, looking searchingly at the little man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  because Lambert is in the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lambert!  Lambert! You are always harping on Lambert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have your interest at heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  laughed doubtfully. &ldquo;I am not so sure of that. Self-interest rather. I trust my  wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do, since you make me spy on her,&rdquo; said Silver caustically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust my wife so far,&rdquo; pursued the other man, &ldquo;if you will permit me to finish  my sentence. There is no need for her to see her cousin, and&mdash;as they have kept  apart for so long&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think there is any chance of their seeking one another&rsquo;s  company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absence  makes the heart grow fonder,&rdquo; remarked the secretary sententiously. &ldquo;And you  may be living in a fool&rsquo;s paradise. Lambert is within running-away distance of  her, remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pine  laughed in a raucous manner. &ldquo;An elopement would have taken place long ago had  it been intended,&rdquo; he snapped tartly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine impossibilities, Mark.  Agnes married me for my money, so that I might save the credit of the Lambert  family. But for me, Garvington would have passed through the Bankruptcy Court long  ago. I have paid off certain mortgages, but I hold them as security for my wife&rsquo;s  good behavior. She knows that an elopement with her cousin would mean the ruin  of her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do, indeed, trust her,&rdquo; observed Silver sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust her so far and no further,&rdquo; repeated Pine with an angry snarl. &ldquo;A Gentile  she is, and Gentiles are tricky.&rdquo; He stretched out a slim, brown hand  significantly and opened it. &ldquo;I hold her and Garvington there,&rdquo; and he tapped  the palm lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t hold Lambert, and he is the dangerous one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  dangerous if Agnes consents to run away with him, and she won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo;  replied Pine coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she certainly doesn&rsquo;t care for money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  cares for the credit of her family, and gave herself to me, so that the same  might be saved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  shrugged his narrow shoulders. &ldquo;What fools these aristocrats are,&rdquo; he observed  pleasantly. &ldquo;Even if Garvington were sold up he would still have his title and  enough to live on in a quiet way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably.  But it was not entirely to save his estates that he agreed to my marriage with  his sister,&rdquo; said Pine pointedly and quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  What?&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s foxy face became alive with eager inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  said Pine roughly, and rose heavily to his feet. &ldquo;Mind your own infernal  business, and mine also. Go back and show that letter to Garvington. I want my  tribe to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> tribe,&rdquo; laughed Silver, scrambling to  his feet; and when he took his departure he was still laughing. He wondered  what Garvington would say did he know that his sister was married to a  full-blooded Romany.</p>
  <p>Pine,  in the character of a horse-coper, saw him out of the camp, and was staring  after him when Chaldea, on the watch, touched his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  come to your tent, brother,&rdquo; she said with very bright eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  Yes!&rdquo; Pine aroused himself out of a brown study. &ldquo;Avali, miri pen. You have  things to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Golden  things, which have to do with your happiness and mine, brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai?  A wedding-ring, sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truly,  brother, if you be a true Romany and not the Gentile you call yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VIII"></a>Chapter VIII<br>
    At Midnight</b></h2>
  <p>Silver&rsquo;s  delivery of his employer&rsquo;s orders to Lord Garvington were apparently carried  out, for no further intimation was given to the gypsies that they were to  vacate Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. The master of The Manor grumbled a good deal at the high  tone taken by his brother-in-law, as, having the instincts of a landlord, he  strongly objected to the presence of such riff-raff on his estates. However, as  Pine had the whip-hand of him, he was obliged to yield, although he could not  understand why the man should favor the Romany in this way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of his infernal philanthropy, I suppose,&rdquo; said Garvington, in a tone of  disgust, to the secretary. &ldquo;Pine&rsquo;s always doing this sort of thing, and people  ain&rsquo;t a bit grateful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Silver dryly, &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s his look-out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is, let him keep to his own side of the road,&rdquo; retorted the other. &ldquo;Since I  don&rsquo;t interfere with his business, let him not meddle with mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  he holds the mortgage and can foreclose at any moment, it is his business,&rdquo;  insisted Silver tartly. &ldquo;And, after all, the gypsies are doing no very great  harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will if they get the chance. I&rsquo;d string up the whole lot if I had my way,  Silver. Poachers and blackguards every one of them. I know that Pine is always  helping rotters in London, but I didn&rsquo;t know that he had any cause to interfere  with this lot. How did he come to know about them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Lambert might have told him,&rdquo; answered the secretary, not unwilling to draw  that young man into the trouble. &ldquo;He is at Abbot&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I lent him the cottage, and this is my reward. He meddles with my business  along with Pine. Why can&rsquo;t he shut his mouth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say that Mr. Lambert did tell him, but he might have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure that he did,&rdquo; said Garvington emphatically, and growing red all  over his chubby face. &ldquo;Otherwise Pine would never have heard, since he is in  Paris. I shall speak to Lambert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t find him at home. I looked in at his cottage to pass the time, and his  housekeeper said that he had gone to London all of a sudden, this very evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;ll turn up again,&rdquo; said Garvington carelessly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick of town, Silver,  since&mdash;&rdquo; The little man hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  when?&rdquo; asked the secretary curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; retorted the other gruffly, for he did not wish to mention the enforced  marriage of his sister, to Silver. Of course, there was no need to, as  Garvington, aware that the neat, foxy-faced man was his brother-in-law&rsquo;s  confidential adviser, felt sure that everything was known to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave  those blamed gypsies alone meanwhile,&rdquo; finished Garvington, changing and  finishing the conversation. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll speak to Pine when I see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  returns from Paris in three weeks,&rdquo; remarked Silver, at which information the  gross little lord simply hunched his fat shoulders. Much as Pine had done for  him, Garvington hated the man with all the power of his mean and narrow mind,  and as the millionaire returned this dislike with a feeling of profound contempt,  the two met as seldom as possible. Only Lady Agnes was the link between them,  the visible object of sale and barter, which had been sold by one to the other.</p>
  <p>It  was about this time that the house-party at The Manor began to break up; since  it was now the first week in September, and many of the shooters wished to go  north for better sport. Many of the men departed, and some of the women, who  were due at other country houses; but Mrs. Belgrove and Miss Greeby still  remained. The first because she found herself extremely comfortable, and  appreciated Garvington&rsquo;s cook; and the second on account of Lambert being in  the vicinity. Miss Greeby had been very disappointed to learn that the young  man had gone to London, but heard from Mrs. Tribb that he was expected back in  three days. She therefore lingered so as to have another conversation with him,  and meanwhile haunted the gypsy camp for the purpose of keeping an eye on  Chaldea, who was much too beautiful for her peace of mind. Sometimes Silver  accompanied her, as the lady had given him to understand that she knew Pine&rsquo;s  real rank and name, so the two were made free of the Bohemians and frequently  chatted with Ishmael Hearne. But they kept his secret, as did Chaldea; and  Garvington had no idea that the man he dreaded and hated&mdash;who flung money to him  as if he were tossing a bone to a dog&mdash;was within speaking distance. If he had  known, he would assuredly have guessed the reason why Sir Hubert Pine had  interested himself in the doings of a wandering tribe of undesirable creatures.</p>
  <p>A  week passed away and still, although Miss Greeby made daily inquiries, Lambert  did not put in an appearance at the forest cottage. Thinking that he had  departed to escape her, she made up her impatient mind to repair to London, and  to hunt him up at his club. With this idea she intimated to Lady Garvington  that she was leaving The Manor early next morning. The ladies had just left the  dinner-table, and were having coffee in the drawing-room when Miss Greeby made  this abrupt announcement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, in dismay. &ldquo;I wish you would change your mind.  Nearly everyone has gone, and the house is getting quite dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  ever so much,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Belgrove lightly. She sat near the fire, for the  evening was chilly, and what with paint and powder, and hair-dye, to say  nothing of her artistic and carefully chosen dress, looked barely thirty-five  in the rosy lights cast by the shaded lamps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean you, dear,&rdquo; murmured the hostess, who was even more untidy and  helpless than usual. &ldquo;You are quite a host in yourself. And that recipe you  gave me for Patagonian soup kept Garvington in quite a good humor for ever so  long. But the house will be dull for you without Clara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes  is here, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear Agnes is not much of an entertainer,&rdquo; said that lady, smiling in a weary  manner, for this society chatter bored her greatly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not to be wondered at,&rdquo; struck in Miss Greeby abruptly. &ldquo;For of course you are  thinking of your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes colored slightly under Miss Greeby&rsquo;s very direct gaze, but replied  equably enough, to save appearances, &ldquo;He is still in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you last hear from him, dear?&rdquo; questioned Lady Garvington, more to  manufacture conversation than because she really cared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  to-day I had a letter. He is carrying out some special business and will return  in two or three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be glad to see him, no doubt,&rdquo; sneered Miss Greeby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am always glad to see my husband and to be with him,&rdquo; answered Lady Agnes in a  dignified manner. She knew perfectly well that Miss Greeby hated her, and  guessed the reason, but she was not going to give her any satisfaction by  revealing the true feelings of her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I intend to stay here, Jane, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Belgrove  in her liveliest manner and with a side glance, taking in both Miss Greeby and  Lady Agnes. &ldquo;Only this morning I received a chit-chat letter from Mr.  Lambert&mdash;we are great friends you know&mdash;saying that he intended to come here for  a few days. Such a delightful man he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me, yes,&rdquo; cried Lady Garvington, starting. &ldquo;I remember. He wrote yesterday  from London, asking if he might come. I told him yes, although I mentioned that  we had hardly anyone with us just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby looked greatly annoyed, as Mrs. Belgrove maliciously saw, for she knew  well that the heiress would now regret having so hastily intimated her  approaching departure. What was the expression on Lady Agnes&rsquo;s face, the old  lady could not see, for the millionaire&rsquo;s wife shielded it&mdash;presumably from the  fire&mdash;with a large fan of white feathers. Had Mrs. Belgrove been able to read  that countenance she would have seen satisfaction written thereon, and would  probably have set down the expression to a wrong cause. In reality, Agnes was  glad to think that Lambert&rsquo;s promise was being kept, and that he no longer  intended to avoid her company so openly.</p>
  <p>But  if she was pleased, Miss Greeby was not, and still continued to look annoyed,  since she had burnt her boats by announcing her departure. And what annoyed her  still more than her hasty decision was, that she would leave Lambert in the  house along with the rival she most dreaded. Though what the young man could  see in this pale, washed-out creature Miss Greeby could not imagine. She  glanced at a near mirror and saw her own opulent, full-blown looks clothed in a  pale-blue dinner-gown, which went so well&mdash;as she inartistically decided, with  her ruddy locks, Mrs. Belgrove considered that Miss Greeby looked like a  paint-box, or a sunset, or one of Turner&rsquo;s most vivid pictures, but the heiress  was very well pleased with herself. Lady Agnes, in her favorite white, with her  pale face and serious looks, was but a dull person of the nun persuasion. And  Miss Greeby did not think that Lambert cared for nuns, when he had an Amazonian  intelligent pal&mdash;so she put it&mdash;at hand. But, of course, he might prefer dark  beauties like Chaldea. Poor Miss Greeby; she was pursuing her wooing under very  great difficulties, and became silent in order to think out some way of  revoking in some natural manner the information of her departure.</p>
  <p>There  were other women in the room, who joined in the conversation, and all were glad  to hear that Mr. Lambert intended to pay a visit to his cousin, for, indeed,  the young man was a general favorite. And then as two or three decided&mdash;Mrs.  Belgrove amongst the number&mdash;there really could be nothing in the report that he  loved Lady Agnes still, else he would scarcely come and stay where she was. As  for Pine&rsquo;s wife, she was a washed-out creature, who had never really loved her  cousin as people had thought. And after all, why should she, since he was so  poor, especially when she was married to a millionaire with the looks of an  Eastern prince, and manners of quite an original nature, although these were  not quite conventional. Oh, yes, there was nothing in the scandal that said  Garvington had sold his sister to bolster up the family property. Lady Agnes  was quite happy, and her husband was a dear man, who left her a great deal to  her own devices&mdash;which he wouldn&rsquo;t have done had he suspected the cousin; and  who gave her pots of money to spend. And what more could a sensible woman want?</p>
  <p>In  this way those in the drawing-room babbled, while Agnes stared into the fire,  bracing herself to encounter Lambert, who would surely arrive within the next  two or three days, and while Miss Greeby savagely rebuked herself for having so  foolishly intimated her departure. Then the men straggled in from their wine,  and bridge became the order of the night with some, while others begged for  music. After a song or so and the execution of a Beethoven sonata, to which no  one paid any attention, a young lady gave a dance after the manner of Maud  Allan, to which everyone attended. Then came feats of strength, in which Miss  Greeby proved herself to be a female Sandow, and later a number of the guests  sojourned to the billiard-room to play. When they grew weary of that,  tobogganing down the broad staircase on trays was suggested and indulged in  amidst shrieks of laughter. Afterwards, those heated by this horse-play strayed  on to the terrace to breathe the fresh air, and flirt in the moonlight. In  fact, every conceivable way of passing the time was taken advantage of by these  very bored people, who scarcely knew how to get through the long evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  seem to be enjoying themselves, Freddy,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington to her husband,  when she drifted against him in the course of attending to her guests. &ldquo;I  really think they find this jolly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care a red copper what they find,&rdquo; retorted the little man, who was  looking worried, and not quite his usual self. &ldquo;I wish the whole lot would get  out of the house. I&rsquo;m sick of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  you well, Freddy? I knew that Patagonian soup was too rich for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the soup was all right&mdash;ripping soup,&rdquo; snorted Freddy, smacking his lips over  the recollection. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m bothered over Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  isn&rsquo;t ill, is he?&rdquo; questioned Lady Garvington anxiously. She liked her  brother-in-law, who was always kind to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  hang him; nothing worse than his usual lung trouble, I suppose. But he is in  Paris, and won&rsquo;t answer my letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Letters,  Freddy dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Jane dear,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;Hang it, I want money, and he won&rsquo;t stump up. I can&rsquo;t  even get an answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  to Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  Mr. Silver!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m sure, Frederick, you needn&rsquo;t swear at me,&rdquo; said poor, wan Lady Garvington,  drawing herself up. &ldquo;Mr. Silver is very kind. He went to that gypsy camp and  found out how they cook hedgehog. That will be a new dish for you, dear. You  haven&rsquo;t eaten hedgehog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t intend to eat it. But you may as well tell me how  these gypsies cook it,&rdquo; and Freddy listened with both his red ears to the  description, on hearing which he decided that his wife might instruct the cook  how to prepare the animal. &ldquo;But no one will eat it but me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington shuddered. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t touch it myself. Those horrid snails you  insisted on being cooked a week ago made me quite ill. You are always trying  new experiments, Freddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I get so tired of every-day dishes,&rdquo; growled Lord Garvington. &ldquo;These cooks have  no invention. I wish I&rsquo;d lived in Rome when they had those banquets you read of  in Gibbon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he write a book on cookery?&rdquo; asked Lady Garvington very naturally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He turned out a lot of dull stuff about wars and migrations of tribes: you are  silly, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that about migration of tribes?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Belgrove, who was in a good humor,  as she had won largely at bridge. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean those dear gypsies at Abbot&rsquo;s  Wood do you, Lord Garvington? I met one of them the other day&mdash;quite a girl and  very pretty in a dark way. She told my fortune, and said that I would come in  for a lot of money. I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Belgrove. &ldquo;Celestine is so  expensive, but no one can fit me like she can. And she knows it, and takes  advantage, the horrid creature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish the tribe of gypsies would clear out,&rdquo; snapped Freddy, standing before the  fire and glaring at the company generally. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;ll break in here and  rob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled Silver, who was hovering near, dressed so carefully that he looked more  of a foxy, neat bounder than ever. &ldquo;I have noticed that some of the brutes have  been sneaking round the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Belgrove shrieked. &ldquo;Oh, how lucky I occupy a bedroom on the third floor. Just  like a little bird in its tiny-weeny nest. They can&rsquo;t get at me there, can  they, Lord Garvington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; observed Miss Greeby in her deep voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your diamonds  they&rsquo;d like to get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Mrs. Belgrove shrieked again. &ldquo;Lock my diamonds up in your strong room, Lord  Garvington. Do! do! do! To please poor little me,&rdquo; and she effusively clasped  her lean hands, upon which many of the said diamonds glittered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think there is likely to be any trouble with these poor gypsies, Mrs.  Belgrove,&rdquo; remarked Lady Agnes negligently. &ldquo;Hubert has told me a great deal  about them, and they are really not so bad as people make out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  husband can&rsquo;t know anything of such ragtags,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, looking at the  beautiful, pale face, and wondering if she really had any suspicion that Pine  was one of the crew she mentioned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but Hubert does,&rdquo; answered Lady Agnes innocently. &ldquo;He has met many of them when  he has been out helping people. You have no idea, any of you, how good Hubert  is,&rdquo; she added, addressing the company generally. &ldquo;He walks on the Embankment  sometimes on winter nights and gives the poor creatures money. And in the  country I have often seen him stop to hand a shilling to some tramp in the  lanes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  gypsy for choice,&rdquo; growled Miss Greeby, marvelling that Lady Agnes could not  see the resemblance between the tramps&rsquo; faces and that of her own husband. &ldquo;However,  I hope Pine&rsquo;s darlings won&rsquo;t come here to rob. I&rsquo;ll fight for my jewels, I can  promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One  of the men laughed. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to get a blow from your fist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby smiled grimly, and looked at his puny stature. &ldquo;Women have to protect  themselves from men like you,&rdquo; she said, amidst great laughter, for the  physical difference between her and the man was quite amusing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very well talking,&rdquo; said Garvington crossly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t trust these  gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you clear them off your land then?&rdquo; asked Silver daringly.</p>
  <p>Garvington  glared until his gooseberry eyes nearly fell out of his red face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clear  everyone to bed, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he retorted, crossing the room to the  middle French window of the drawing-room. &ldquo;I wish you fellows would stop your  larking out there,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s close upon midnight, and all decent people  should be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  when have you joined the Methodists, Garvington?&rdquo; asked an officer who had come  over from some twelve-mile distant barracks to pass the night, and a girl  behind him began to sing a hymn.</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes frowned. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do that, Miss Ardale,&rdquo; she said in sharp  rebuke, and the girl had the sense to be silent, while Garvington fussed over  the closing of the window shutters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  to stand a siege?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby, laughing. &ldquo;Or do you expect burglars,  particularly on this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t expect them at all,&rdquo; retorted the little man. &ldquo;But I tell you I hate the  idea of these lawless gypsies about the place. Still, if anyone comes,&rdquo; he  added grimly, &ldquo;I shall shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the attacking person or party needn&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; cried the officer. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t  mind standing up to your fire, myself, Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  laughter and chatter and much merriment at the host&rsquo;s expense, the guests went  their several ways, the women to chat in one another&rsquo;s dressing-rooms and the  men to have a final smoke and a final drink. Garvington, with two footmen, and  his butler, went round the house, carefully closing all the shutters, and  seeing that all was safe. His sister rather marvelled at this excessive  precaution, and said as much to her hostess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the gypsies did break in,&rdquo; she said when alone with Lady  Garvington in her own bedroom. &ldquo;It would be some excitement, for all these  people must find it very dull here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I do my best, Agnes,&rdquo; said the sister-in-law plaintively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, you do, you poor dear,&rdquo; said the other, kissing her. &ldquo;But Garvington  always asks people here who haven&rsquo;t two ideas. A horrid, rowdy lot they are. I  wonder you stand it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington  asks those he likes, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. He hasn&rsquo;t any brains, and his guests suit him for the same reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  eat a great deal,&rdquo; wailed Lady Garvington. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I might as well be a cook.  All my time is taken up with feeding them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Freddy married you, Jane, because you had a genius for looking after food. Your  mother was much the same; she always kept a good table.&rdquo; Lady Agnes laughed. &ldquo;Yours  was a most original wooing, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to live on bread and water for my part, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  Freddy on it, dear. He&rsquo;s getting too stout. I never thought that gluttony was a  crime. But when I look at Freddy&rdquo;&mdash;checking her speech, she spread out her hands  with an ineffable look&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that Noel is coming,&rdquo; she ended, rather  daringly. &ldquo;At least he will be more interesting than any of these frivolous  people you have collected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington looked at her anxiously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind Noel coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you see, Agnes, I fancied&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  fancy anything. Noel and I entirely understand one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope,&rdquo; blurted out the other woman, &ldquo;that it is a right understanding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  winced, and looked at her with enforced composure. &ldquo;I am devoted to my husband,&rdquo;  she said, with emphasis. &ldquo;And I have every reason to be. He has kept his part  of the bargain, so I keep mine. But,&rdquo; she added with a pale smile, &ldquo;when I  think how I sold myself to keep up the credit of the family, and now see Freddy  entertaining this riff-raff, I am sorry that I did not marry Noel, whom I loved  so dearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would have meant our ruin,&rdquo; bleated Lady Garvington, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  ruin is only delayed, Jane. Freddy is a weak, self-indulgent fool, and is  eating his way into the next world. It will be a happy day for you when an  apoplectic fit makes you a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; the wife was shocked, &ldquo;he is your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;s  the pity. I have no illusions about Freddy, Jane, and I don&rsquo;t think you have  either. Now, go away and sleep. It&rsquo;s no use lying awake thinking over to-morrow&rsquo;s  dinner. Give Freddy the bread and water you talked about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington laughed in a weak, aimless way, and then kissed her sister-in-law  with a sigh, after which she drifted out of the room in her usual vague manner.  Very shortly the clock over the stables struck midnight, and by that time  Garvington the virtuous had induced all his men guests to go to bed. The women  chatted a little longer, and then, in their turn, sought repose. By half-past  twelve the great house was in complete darkness, and bulked a mighty mass of  darkness in the pale September moonlight.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes got to bed quickly, and tired out by the boredom of the evening, quickly  fell asleep. Suddenly she awoke with all her senses on the alert, and with a  sense of vague danger hovering round. There were sounds of running feet and  indistinct oaths and distant cries, and she could have sworn that a pistol-shot  had startled her from slumber. In a moment she was out of bed and ran to open  her window. On looking out she saw that the moonlight was very brilliant, and  in it beheld a tall man running swiftly from the house. He sped down the broad  path, and just when he was abreast of a miniature shrubbery, she heard a second  shot, which seemed to be fired there-from. The man staggered, and stumbled and  fell. Immediately afterwards, her brother&mdash;she recognized his voice raised in  anger&mdash;ran out of the house, followed by some of the male guests. Terrified by  the sight and the sound of the shots, Lady Agnes huddled on her dressing-gown  hastily, and thrust her bare feet into slippers. The next moment she was out of  her bedroom and down the stairs. A wild idea had entered her mind that perhaps  Lambert had come secretly to The Manor, and had been shot by Garvington in  mistake for a burglar. The corridors and the hall were filled with guests more  or less lightly attired, mostly women, white-faced and startled. Agnes paid no  attention to their shrieks, but hurried into the side passage which terminated  at the door out of which her brother had left the house. She went outside also  and made for the group round the fallen man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it? who is it?&rdquo; she asked, gasping with the hurry and the fright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back, Agnes, go back,&rdquo; cried Garvington, looking up with a distorted face,  strangely pale in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who is it? who has been killed?&rdquo; She caught sight of the fallen man&rsquo;s  countenance and shrieked. &ldquo;Great heavens! it is Hubert; is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Silver, who stood at her elbow. &ldquo;Shot through the heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    Afterwards</b></h2>
  <p>With  amazing and sinister rapidity the news spread that a burglar had been shot dead  while trying to raid The Manor. First, the Garvington villagers learned it;  then it became the common property of the neighborhood, until it finally  reached the nearest county town, and thus brought the police on the scene. Lord  Garvington was not pleased when the local inspector arrived, and intimated as  much in a somewhat unpleasant fashion. He was never a man who spared those in  an inferior social position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is no use your coming over, Darby,&rdquo; he said bluntly to the red-haired police  officer, who was of Irish extraction. &ldquo;I have sent to Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  in good time, my lord,&rdquo; replied the inspector coolly. &ldquo;As the murder has taken  place in my district I have to look into the matter, and report to the London  authorities, if it should be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  right have you to class the affair as a murder?&rdquo; inquired Garvington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only go by the rumors I have heard, my lord. Some say that you winged the man  and broke his right arm. Others tell me that a second shot was fired in the  garden, and it was that which killed Ishmael Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, Darby. I only fired the first shot, as those who were with me will  tell you. I don&rsquo;t know who shot in the garden, and apparently no one else does.  It was this unknown individual in the garden that killed Hearne. By the way,  how did you come to hear the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half  a dozen people have told me, my lord, along with the information I have just  given you. Nothing else is talked of far and wide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it is just twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; muttered the stout little lord, wiping his scarlet  face pettishly. &ldquo;Ill news travels fast. However, as you are here, you may as  well take charge of things until the London men arrive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  London men aren&rsquo;t going to usurp my privileges, my lord,&rdquo; said Darby, firmly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no sense in taking matters out of my hands. And if you will pardon my saying  so, I should have been sent for in the first instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; snapped Garvington, coolly. &ldquo;But the matter is too important to be  left in the hands of a local policeman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darby  was nettled, and his hard eyes grew angry. &ldquo;I am quite competent to deal with  any murder, even if it is that of the highest in England, much less with the  death of a common gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just where it is, Darby. The common gypsy who has been shot happens to be my  brother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert Pine?&rdquo; questioned the inspector, thoroughly taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Of course I didn&rsquo;t know him when I fired, or I should not have done so, Darby.  I understood, and his wife, my sister, understood, that Sir Hubert was in  Paris. It passes my comprehension to guess why he should have come in the dead  of night, dressed as a gypsy, to raid my house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it was a bet,&rdquo; said Darby, desperately puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet,  be hanged! Pine could come openly to this place whenever he liked. I never was  so astonished in my life as when I saw him lying dead near the shrubbery. And  the worst of it is, that my sister ran out and saw him also. She fainted and  has been in bed ever since, attended by Lady Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had no idea that the man you shot was Sir Hubert, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, no! Would I have shot him had I guessed who he was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, my lord! of course not,&rdquo; said the officer hastily. &ldquo;But as I have come to  take charge of the case, you will give me a detailed account of what has taken  place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather wait until the Scotland Yard fellows come,&rdquo; grumbled Garvington, &ldquo;as  I don&rsquo;t wish to repeat my story twice. Still, as you are on the spot, I may as  well ask your advice. You may be able to throw some light on the subject. I&rsquo;m  hanged if I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darby  pulled out his notebook. &ldquo;I am all attention, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  plunged abruptly into his account, first having looked to see if the library  door was firmly closed. &ldquo;As there have been many burglaries lately in this part  of the world,&rdquo; he said, speaking with deliberation, &ldquo;I got an idea into my head  that this house might be broken into.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural  enough, my lord,&rdquo; interposed Darby, glancing round the splendid room. &ldquo;A  historic house such as this is, would tempt any burglar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I thought,&rdquo; remarked the other, pleased that Darby should agree with him so  promptly. &ldquo;And I declared several times, within the hearing of many people,  that if a raid was made, I should shoot the first man who tried to enter. Hang  it, an Englishman&rsquo;s house is his castle, and no man has a right to come in  without permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, my lord. But the punishment of the burglar should be left to the law,&rdquo; said  the inspector softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the deuce take the law! I prefer to execute my own punishments. However, to  make a long story short, I grew more afraid of a raid when these gypsies came  to camp at Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, as they are just the sort of scoundrels who would  break in and steal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you order them off your land?&rdquo; asked the policeman, alertly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, and then my brother-in-law sent a message through his secretary, who is  staying here, asking me to allow them to remain. I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did Sir Hubert send that message, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, man, that&rsquo;s just what I am trying to learn, and I am the more puzzled  because he came last night dressed as a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must be one,&rdquo; said Darby, who had seen Pine and now recalled his dark  complexion and jetty eyes. &ldquo;It seems, from what I have been told, that he  stopped at the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood camp under the name of Ishmael Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Silver informed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pine&rsquo;s  secretary, who knows all his confidential affairs. Silver declared, when the  secret could be kept no longer, that Pine was really a gypsy, called Ishmael  Hearne. Occasionally longing for the old life, he stepped down from his  millionaire pedestal and mixed with his own people. When he was supposed to be  in Paris, he was really with the gypsies, so you can now understand why he sent  the message asking me to let these vagrants stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told me a few moments ago, that you could not understand that message, my lord,&rdquo;  said Darby quickly, and looking searchingly at the other man. Garvington grew a  trifle confused. &ldquo;Did I? Well, to tell you the truth, Darby, I&rsquo;m so mixed up  over the business that I can&rsquo;t say what I do know, or what I don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;d  better take all I tell you with a grain of salt until I am quite myself again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Natural  enough, my lord,&rdquo; remarked the inspector again, and quite believed what he  said. &ldquo;And the details of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to bed as usual,&rdquo; said Garvington, wearily, for the events of the night  had tired him out, &ldquo;and everyone else retired some time about midnight. I went  round with the footmen and the butler to see that everything was safe, for I  was too anxious to let them look after things without me. Then I heard a noise  of footsteps on the gravel outside, just as I was dropping off to sleep&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what time was that, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half-past  one o&rsquo;clock; I can&rsquo;t be certain as to a minute. I jumped up and laid hold of my  revolver, which was handy. I always kept it beside me in case of a burglary.  Then I stole downstairs in slippers and pajamas to the passage,&mdash;oh, here.&rdquo;  Garvington rose quickly. &ldquo;Come with me and see the place for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  Darby put on his cap, and with his notebook still in his hand, followed the  stout figure of his guide. Garvington led him through the entrance hall and  into a side-passage, which terminated in a narrow door. There was no one to spy  on them, as the master of the house had sent all the servants to their own  quarters, and the guests were collected in the drawing-room and smoking-room,  although a few of the ladies remained in their bedrooms, trying to recover from  the night&rsquo;s experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came down here,&rdquo; said Garvington, opening the door, &ldquo;and heard the burglar, as  I thought he was, prowling about on the other side. I threw open the door in  this way and the man plunged forward to enter. I fired, and got him in the  right arm, for I saw it swinging uselessly by his side as he departed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he in a hurry?&rdquo; asked Darby, rather needlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  went off like greased lightning. I didn&rsquo;t follow, as I thought that others of  his gang might be about, but closing the door again I shouted blue murder. In a  few minutes everyone came down, and while I was waiting&mdash;it all passed in a  flash, remember, Darby&mdash;I heard a second shot. Then the servants and my friends  came and we ran out, to find the man lying by that shrubbery quite dead. I  turned him over and had just grasped the fact that he was my brother-in-law,  when Lady Agnes ran out. When she learned the news she naturally fainted. The  women carried her back to her room, and we took the body of Pine into the  house. A doctor came along this morning&mdash;for I sent for a doctor as soon as it  was dawn&mdash;and said that Pine had been shot through the heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who shot him?&rdquo; asked Darby sagely.</p>
  <p>Garvington  pointed to the shrubbery. &ldquo;Someone was concealed there,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know, that, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  sister, attracted by my shot, jumped out of bed and threw up her window. She  saw the man&mdash;of course she never guessed that he was Pine&mdash;running down the path  and saw him fall by the shrubbery when the second shot was fired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  bedroom is then on this side of the house, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  there,&rdquo; said Garvington, pointing directly over the narrow door, which was  painted a rich blue color, and looked rather bizarre, set in the puritanic  greyness of the walls. &ldquo;My own bedroom is further along towards the right. That  is why I heard the footsteps so plainly on this gravel.&rdquo; And he stamped hard,  while with a wave of his hand he invited the inspector to examine the  surroundings.</p>
  <p>Darby  did so with keen eyes and an alert brain. The two stood on the west side of the  mansion, where it fronted the three-miles distant Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. The Manor was a  heterogeneous-looking sort of place, suggesting the whims and fancies of many  generations, for something was taken away here, and something was taken away  there, and this had been altered, while that had been left in its original  state, until the house seemed to be made up of all possible architectural  styles. It was a tall building of three stories, although the flattish  red-tiled roofs took away somewhat from its height, and spread over an amazing  quantity of land. As Darby thought, it could have housed a regiment, and must  have cost something to keep up. As wind and weather and time had mellowed its  incongruous parts into one neutral tint, it looked odd and attractive. Moss and  lichen, ivy and Virginia creeper&mdash;this last flaring in crimson glory&mdash;clothed the  massive stone walls with a gracious mantle of natural beauty. Narrow stone  steps, rather chipped, led down from the blue door to the broad, yellow path,  which came round the rear of the house and swept down hill in a wide curve,  past the miniature shrubbery, right into the bosom of the park.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  path,&rdquo; explained Garvington, stamping again, &ldquo;runs right through the park to a  small wicket gate set in the brick wall, which borders the high road, Darby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that runs straightly past Abbot&rsquo;s Wood,&rdquo; mused the inspector. &ldquo;Of course, Sir  Hubert would know of the path and the wicket gate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  don&rsquo;t be an ass, Darby,&rdquo; cried Garvington petulantly. &ldquo;He has been in this  house dozens of times and knows it as well as I do myself. Why do you ask so  obvious a question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was only wondering if Sir Hubert came by the high road to the wicket gate you  speak of, Lord Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  also is obvious,&rdquo; retorted the other, irritably. &ldquo;Since he wished to come here,  he naturally would take the easiest way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did he not enter by the main avenue gates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  at that hour they would be shut, and&mdash;since it is evident that his visit was a  secret one&mdash;he would have had to knock up the lodge-keeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  was his visit a secret one?&rdquo; questioned Darby pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the thing that puzzles me. Anything more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?  Why should Sir Hubert come to the blue door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t answer that question, either. The whole reason of his being here, instead  of in Paris, is a mystery to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that last, the reply is easy,&rdquo; remarked the inspector. &ldquo;Sir Hubert wished  to revert to his free gypsy life, and pretended to be in Paris, so that he  would follow his fancy without the truth becoming known. But why he should come  on this particular night, and by this particular path to this particular door,  is the problem I have to solve!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, and I only hope that you will solve it, for the sake of my sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darby  reflected for a moment or so. &ldquo;Did Lady Agnes ask her husband to come here to  see her privately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, no man!&rdquo; cried Garvington, aghast. &ldquo;She believed, as we all did, that her  husband was in Paris, and certainly never dreamed that he was masquerading as a  gypsy three miles away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no masquerading about the matter, my lord,&rdquo; said Darby, dryly; &ldquo;since Sir  Hubert really was a gypsy called Ishmael Hearne. That fact will come out at the  inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has come out now: everyone knows the truth. And a nice thing it is for me and  Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you need worry about that, Lord Garvington. The honorable way in  which the late Sir Hubert attained rank and gained wealth will reflect credit  on his humble origin. When the papers learn the story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  the papers!&rdquo; interrupted Garvington fretfully. &ldquo;I sincerely hope that they won&rsquo;t  make too great a fuss over the business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little man&rsquo;s hope was vain, as he might have guessed that it would be, for when  the news became known in Fleet Street, the newspapers were only too glad to  discover an original sensation for the dead season. Every day journalists and  special correspondents were sent down in such numbers that the platform of  Wanbury Railway Station was crowded with them. As the town&mdash;it was the chief  town of Hengishire&mdash;was five miles away from the village of Garvington, every  possible kind of vehicle was used to reach the scene of the crime, and The  Manor became a rendezvous for all the morbid people, both in the neighborhood  and out of it. The reporters in particular poked and pried all over the place,  passing from the great house to the village, and thence to the gypsy camp on  the borders of Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. From one person and another they learned facts,  which were published with such fanciful additions that they read like fiction.  On the authority of Mother Cockleshell&mdash;who was not averse to earning a few  shillings&mdash;a kind of Gil Blas tale was put into print, and the wanderings of  Ishmael Hearne were set forth in the picturesque style of a picarooning  romance. But of the time when the adventurous gypsy assumed his Gentile name,  the Romany could tell nothing, for obvious reasons. Until the truth became  known, because of the man&rsquo;s tragic and unforeseen death, those in the camp were  not aware that he was a Gorgio millionaire. But where the story of Mother  Cockleshell left off, that of Mark Silver began, for the secretary had been  connected with his employer almost from the days of Hearne&rsquo;s first exploits as  Pine in London. And Silver&mdash;who also charged for the blended fact and fiction  which he supplied&mdash;freely related all he knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hearne  came to London and called himself Hubert Pine,&rdquo; he stated frankly, and not  hesitating to confess his own lowly origin. &ldquo;We met when I was starving as a  toymaker in Whitechapel. I invented some penny toys, which Pine put on the  market for me. They were successful and he made money. I am bound to confess  that he paid me tolerably well, although he certainly took the lion&rsquo;s share.  With the money he made in this way, he speculated in South African shares, and,  as the boom was then on, he simply coined gold. Everything he touched turned  into cash, and however deeply he plunged into the money market, he always came  out top in the end. By turning over his money and re-investing it, and by fresh  speculations, he became a millionaire in a wonderfully short space of time.  Then he made me his secretary and afterwards took up politics. The Government  gave him a knighthood for services rendered to his party, and he became a  well-known figure in the world of finance. He married Lady Agnes Lambert,  and&mdash;and&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were aware that he was a gypsy, Mr. Silver?&rdquo; asked the reporter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. I knew all about his origin from the first days of our acquaintanceship.  He asked me to keep his true name and rank secret. As it was none of my  business, I did so. At times Hearne&mdash;or rather Pine, as I know him best by that  name&mdash;grew weary of civilization, and then would return to his own life of the  tent and road. No one suspected amongst the Romany that he was anything else  but a horse-coper. He always pretended to be in Paris, or Berlin, on financial  affairs, when he went back to his people, and I transacted all business during  his absence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew that he was at the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood camp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I saw him there once or twice to receive instructions about business. I  expostulated with him for being so near the house where his brother-in-law and  wife were living, as I pointed out that the truth might easily become known.  But Pine merely said that his safety in keeping his secret lay in his daring to  run the risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any idea that Sir Hubert intended to come by night to Lord Garvington&rsquo;s  house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the slightest. In fact, I told him that Lord Garvington was afraid of burglars,  and had threatened to shoot any man who tried to enter the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  this Silver said in a perfectly frank, free-and-easy manner, and also related  how the dead man had instructed him to ask Garvington to allow the gypsies to  remain in the wood. The reporter published the interview with sundry comments  of his own, and it was read with great avidity by the public at large and by  the many friends of the millionaire, who were surprised to learn of the double  life led by the man. Of course, there was nothing disgraceful in Pine&rsquo;s past as  Ishmael Hearne, and all attempts to discover something shady about his  antecedents were vain. Yet&mdash;as was pointed out&mdash;there must have been something  wrong, else the adventurer, as he plainly was, would not have met so terrible a  death. But in spite of every one&rsquo;s desire to find fire to account for the  smoke, nothing to Pine&rsquo;s disadvantage could be learned. Even at the inquest,  and when the matter was thoroughly threshed out, the dead man&rsquo;s character  proved to be honorable, and&mdash;save in the innocent concealment of his real name  and origin&mdash;his public and private life was all that could be desired. The whole  story was not criminal, but truly romantic, and the final tragedy gave a grim  touch to what was regarded, even by the most censorious, as a picturesque  narrative.</p>
  <p>In  spite of all his efforts, Inspector Darby, of Wanbury, could produce no  evidence likely to show who had shot the deceased. Lord Garvington, under the  natural impression that Pine was a burglar, had certainly wounded him in the  right arm, but it was the second shot, fired by some one outside the house,  which had pierced the heart. This was positively proved by the distinct  evidence of Lady Agnes herself. She rose from her sick-bed to depose how she  had opened her window, and had seen the actual death of the unfortunate man,  whom she little guessed was her husband. The burglar&mdash;as she reasonably took him  to be&mdash;was running down the path when she first caught sight of him, and after  the first shot had been fired. It was the second shot, which came from the  shrubbery&mdash;marked on the plan placed before the Coroner and jury&mdash;which had laid  the fugitive low. Also various guests and servants stated that they had arrived  in the passage in answer to Lord Garvington&rsquo;s outcries, to find that he had  closed the door pending their coming. Some had even heard the second shot while  descending the stairs. It was proved, therefore, in a very positive manner,  that the master of the house had not murdered the supposed robber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never intended to kill him,&rdquo; declared Garvington when his evidence was taken. &ldquo;All  I intended to do, and all I did do, was to wing him, so that he might be  captured on the spot, or traced later. I closed the door after firing the shot,  as I fancied that he might have had some accomplices with him, and I wished to  make myself safe until assistance arrived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had no idea that the man was Sir Hubert Pine?&rdquo; asked a juryman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. I should not have fired had I recognized him. The moment I opened the door  he flung himself upon me. I fired and he ran away. It was not until we all went  out and found him dead by the shrubbery that I recognized my brother-in-law. I  thought he was in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  Darby deposed that he had examined the shrubbery, and had noted broken twigs  here and there, which showed that some one must have been concealed behind the  screen of laurels. The grass&mdash;somewhat long in the thicket&mdash;had been trampled.  But nothing had been discovered likely to lead to the discovery of the assassin  who had been ambushed in this manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  there no footmarks?&rdquo; questioned the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  has been no rain for weeks to soften the ground,&rdquo; explained the witness, &ldquo;therefore  it is impossible to discover any footmarks. The broken twigs and trampled grass  show that some one was hidden in the shrubbery, but when this person left the  screen of laurels, there is nothing to show in which direction the escape was  made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed all the evidence was useless to trace the criminal. The Manor had been  bolted and barred by Lord Garvington himself, along with some footmen and his  butler, so no one within could have fired the second shot. The evidence of  Mother Cockleshell, of Chaldea, and of various other gypsies, went to show that  no one had left the camp on that night with the exception of Hearne, and even  his absence had not been made known until the fact of the death was made public  next morning. Hearne, as several of the gypsies stated, had retired about eleven  to his tent and had said nothing about going to The Manor, much less about  leaving the camp. Silver&rsquo;s statements revealed nothing, since, far from seeking  his brother-in-law&rsquo;s house, Pine, had pointedly declared that in order to keep  his secret he would be careful not to go near the place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Pine had no enemies to my knowledge who desired his death,&rdquo; declared the  secretary. &ldquo;We were so intimate that had his life been in danger he certainly  would have spoken about it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can throw no light on the darkness?&rdquo; asked the Coroner hopelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo;  said the witness. &ldquo;Nor, so far as I can see, is any one else able to throw any  light on the subject. Pine&rsquo;s secret was not a dishonorable one, as he was such  an upright man that no one could have desired to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently  there was no solution to the mystery, as every one concluded, when the evidence  was fully threshed out. An open verdict was brought in, and the proceedings  ended in this unsatisfactory manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilful  murder against some person or persons unknown,&rdquo; said Lambert, when he read the  report of the inquest in his St. James&rsquo;s Street rooms. &ldquo;Strange. I wonder who  cut the Gordian knot of the rope which bound Agnes to Pine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  could find no reply to this question, nor could any one else.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X<br>
    A Difficult Position</b></h2>
  <p>Lord  Garvington was not a creditable member of the aristocracy, since his vices  greatly exceeded his virtues. With a weak nature, and the tastes of a sybarite,  he required a great deal of money to render him happy. Like the immortal Becky  Sharp, he could have been fairly honest if possessed of a large income; but not  having it he stopped short of nothing save actual criminality in order to  indulge his luxurious tastes to the full. Candidly speaking, he had already  overstepped the mark when he altered the figures of a check his brother-in-law  had given him, and, had not Pine been so generous, he would have undoubtedly  occupied an extremely unpleasant position. However, thanks to Agnes, the affair  had been hushed up, and with characteristic promptitude, Garvington had  conveniently forgotten how nearly he had escaped the iron grip of Justice. In  fact, so entirely did it slip his memory that&mdash;on the plea of Pine&rsquo;s newly  discovered origin&mdash;he did not desire the body to be placed in the family vault.  But the widow wished to pay this honor to her husband&rsquo;s remains, and finally  got her own way in the matter, for the simple reason that now she was the owner  of Pine&rsquo;s millions Garvington did not wish to offend her. But, as such a mean  creature would, he made capital out of the concession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  I do this for you, Agnes,&rdquo; he said bluntly, when the question was being  decided, &ldquo;you must do something for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you wish me to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;hum&mdash;hey&mdash;ho!&rdquo;  gurgled Garvington, thinking cunningly that it was too early yet to exploit  her. &ldquo;We can talk about it when the will has been read, and we know exactly how  we stand. Besides your grief is sacred to me, my dear. Shut yourself up and  cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  had a sense of humor, and the blatant hypocrisy of the speech made her laugh  outright in spite of the genuine regret she felt for her husband&rsquo;s tragic  death. Garvington was quite shocked. &ldquo;Do you forget that the body is yet in the  house?&rdquo; he asked with heavy solemnity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t forget anything,&rdquo; retorted Agnes, becoming scornfully serious. &ldquo;Not even  that you count on me to settle your wretched financial difficulties out of poor  Hubert&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you will, my dear. You are a Lambert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly;  but I am not necessarily a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can&rsquo;t stop and hear you call yourself such a name,&rdquo; said Garvington,  ostentatiously dense to her true meaning. &ldquo;It is hysteria that speaks, and not  my dear sister. Very natural when you are so grieved. We are all mortal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are certainly silly in addition,&rdquo; replied the widow, who knew how useless it  was to argue with the man. &ldquo;Go away and don&rsquo;t worry me. When poor Hubert is  buried, and the will is read, I shall announce my intentions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Intentions!  Intentions!&rdquo; muttered the corpulent little lord, taking a hasty departure out  of diplomacy. &ldquo;Surely, Agnes won&rsquo;t be such a fool as to let the family estates  go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  never struck him that Pine might have so worded the will that the inheritance  he counted upon might not come to the widow, unless she chose to fulfil a  certain condition. But then he never guessed the jealousy with which the  hot-blooded gypsy had regarded the early engagement of Agnes and Lambert. If he  had done so, he assuredly would not have invited the young man down to the  funeral. But he did so, and talked about doing so, with a frequent mention that  the body was to rest in the sacred vault of the Lamberts so that every one  should applaud his generous humility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Pine was only a gypsy,&rdquo; said Garvington, on all and every occasion. &ldquo;But I  esteemed him as a good and honest man. He shall have every honor shown to his  memory. Noel and I, as representatives of his wife, my dear sister, shall  follow him to the Lambert vault, and there, with my ancestors, the body of this  honorable, though humble, man shall rest until the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  cynic in London laughed when the speech was reported to him. &ldquo;If Garvington is  buried in the same vault,&rdquo; he said contemptuously, &ldquo;he will ask Pine for money,  as soon as they rise to attend the Great Assizes!&rdquo; which bitter remark showed  that the little man could not induce people to believe him so disinterested as  he should have liked them to consider him.</p>
  <p>However,  in pursuance of this artful policy, he certainly gave the dead man, what the  landlady of the village inn called, &ldquo;a dressy funeral.&rdquo; All that could be done  in the way of pomp and ceremony was done, and the procession which followed  Ishmael Hearne to the grave was an extraordinarily long one. The villagers came  because, like all the lower orders, they loved the excitement of an interment;  the gypsies from the camp followed, since the deceased was of their blood; and  many people in financial and social circles came down from London for the  obvious reason that Pine was a well-known figure in the City and the West End,  and also a member of Parliament. As for Lambert, he put in an appearance, in  response to his cousin&rsquo;s invitation, unwillingly enough, but in order to  convince Agnes that he had every desire to obey her commands. People could  scarcely think that Pine had been jealous of the early engagement to Agnes,  when her former lover attended the funeral of a successful rival.</p>
  <p>Of  course, the house party at The Manor had broken up immediately after the  inquest. It would have disintegrated before only that Inspector Darby insisted  that every one should remain for examination in connection with the late  tragical occurrence. But in spite of questioning and cross-questioning, nothing  had been learned likely to show who had murdered the millionaire. There was a  great deal of talk after the body had been placed in the Lambert vault, and  there was more talk in the newspapers when an account was given of the funeral.  But neither by word of mouth, nor in print, was any suggestion made likely to  afford the slightest clue to the name or the whereabouts of the assassin.  Having regard to Pine&rsquo;s romantic career, it was thought by some that the act  was one of revenge by a gypsy jealous that the man should attain to such  affluence, while others hinted that the motive for the crime was to be found in  connection with the millionaire&rsquo;s career as a Gentile. Gradually, as all  conjecture proved futile, the gossip died away, and other events usurped the  interest of the public. Pine, who was really Hearne, had been murdered and  buried; his assassin would never be discovered, since the trail was too well  hidden; and Lady Agnes inherited at least two millions on which she would  probably marry her cousin and so restore the tarnished splendors of the Lambert  family. In this way the situation was summed up by the gossips, and then they  began to talk of something else. The tragedy was only a nine minutes&rsquo; wonder  after all.</p>
  <p>The  gossips both in town and country were certainly right in assuming that the  widow inherited the vast property of her deceased husband. But what they did  not know was that a condition attached to such inheritance irritated Agnes and  caused Garvington unfeigned alarm. Pine&rsquo;s solicitor&mdash;he was called Jarwin and  came from a stuffy little office in Chancery Lane&mdash;called Garvington aside, when  the mourners returned from the funeral, and asked that the reading of the will  might be confined to a few people whom he named.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a condition laid down by the testator which need not be made public,&rdquo; said  Mr. Jarwin blandly. &ldquo;A proposition which, if possible, must be kept out of  print.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington,  with a sudden recollection of his iniquity in connection with the falsified  check, did not dare to ask questions, but hastily summoned the people named by  the lawyer. As these were the widow, Lady Garvington, himself, and his cousin  Noel, the little man had no fear of what might be forthcoming, since with  relatives there could be no risk of betrayal. All the same, he waited for the  reading of the will with some perturbation, for the suggested secrecy hinted at  some posthumous revenge on the part of the dead man. And, hardened as he was,  Garvington did not wish his wife and Lambert to become acquainted with his  delinquency. He was, of course, unaware that the latter knew about it through  Agnes, and knew also how it had been used to coerce her&mdash;for the pressure  amounted to coercion&mdash;into a loveless marriage.</p>
  <p>The  quintette assembled in a small room near the library, and when the door and  window were closed there was no chance that any one would overhear the  conference. Lambert was rather puzzled to know why he had been requested to be  present, as he had no idea that Pine would mention him in the will. However, he  had not long to wait before he learned the reason, for the document produced by  Mr. Jarwin was singularly short and concise. Pine had never been a great  speaker, and carried his reticence into his testamentary disposition. Five  minutes was sufficient for the reading of the will, and those present learned  that all real and personal property had been left unreservedly to Agnes Pine,  the widow of the testator, on condition that she did not marry Noel Tamsworth  Leighton Lambert. If she did so, the money was to pass to a certain person,  whose name was mentioned in a sealed envelope held by Mr. Jarwin. This was only  to be opened when Agnes Pine formally relinquished her claim to the estate by  marrying Noel Lambert. Seeing that the will disposed of two millions sterling,  it was a remarkably abrupt document, and the reading of it took the hearers&rsquo;  breath away.</p>
  <p>Garvington,  relieved from the fears of his guilty conscience, was the first to recover his  power of speech. He looked at the lean, dry lawyer, and demanded fiercely if no  legacy had been left to him. &ldquo;Surely Pine did not forget me?&rdquo; he lamented, with  more temper than sorrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have heard the will,&rdquo; said Mr. Jarwin, folding up the single sheet of legal  paper on which the testament was inscribed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are no legacies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t  Pine remembered Silver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has remembered nothing and no one save Lady Agnes.&rdquo; Jarwin bowed to the silent  widow, who could not trust herself to speak, so angered was she by the cruel  way in which her husband had shown his jealousy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very dreadful and very disagreeable,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington in her weak and  inconsequent way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I was always nice to Hubert and he might have left  me a few shillings to get clothes. Everything goes in cooks and food and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue, Jane,&rdquo; struck in her husband crossly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always thinking of  frocks and frills. But I agree with you this will is dreadful. I am not going  to sit under such a beastly sell you know,&rdquo; he added, turning to Jarwin. &ldquo;I  shall contest the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lawyer coughed dryly and smiled. &ldquo;As you are not mentioned in the testament,  Lord Garvington, I fail to see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  hum! hum!&rdquo; Garvington was rather disconcerted. &ldquo;But Agnes can fight it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; questioned the widow, who was very pale and very quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you?&rdquo; blustered her brother. &ldquo;It prevents your marrying again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, it does not,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Jarwin, with another dry cough. &ldquo;Lady Agnes can  marry any one she chooses to, save&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes rested on the calm and watchful  face of Lambert.</p>
  <p>The  young man colored, and glancing at Agnes, was about to speak. But on second  thoughts he checked himself, as he did not wish to add to the embarrassment of  the scene. It was the widow who replied. &ldquo;Did Sir Hubert tell you why he made  such a provision?&rdquo; she asked, striving to preserve her calmness, which was  difficult under the circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  no,&rdquo; said Jarwin, nursing his chin reflectively. &ldquo;Sir Hubert was always of a  reticent disposition. He simply instructed me to draw up the will you have  heard, and gave me no explanation. Everything is in order, and I am at your  service, madam, whenever you choose to send for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  suppose I marry Mr. Lambert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,  you won&rsquo;t be such a fool!&rdquo; shouted her brother, growing so scarlet that he  seemed to be on the point of an apoplectic fit.</p>
  <p>She  turned on him with a look, which reduced him to silence, but carefully avoided  the eyes of the cousin. &ldquo;Suppose I marry Mr. Lambert?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you will lose the money,&rdquo; replied Jarwin, slightly weary of so  obvious an answer having to be made. &ldquo;You have heard the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  gets the money then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was another ridiculous question, as Jarwin, and not without reason, considered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you like me to read the will again?&rdquo; he asked sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I am aware of what it contains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, you must know, madam, that the money goes to a certain person whose  name is mentioned in a sealed envelope, now in my office safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the person?&rdquo; demanded Garvington, with a gleam of hope that Pine might have  made him the legatee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know, my lord. Sir Hubert Pine wrote down the name and address, sealed  the envelope, and gave it into my charge. It can only be opened when the  ceremony of marriage takes place between&mdash;&rdquo; he bowed again to Lady Agnes and  this time also to Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pine  must have been insane,&rdquo; said Garvington, fuming. &ldquo;He disguises himself as a  gypsy, and comes to burgle my house, and makes a silly will which ought to be  upset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert never struck me as insane,&rdquo; retorted Jarwin, putting the disputed will  into his black leather bag. &ldquo;A man who can make two million pounds in so short  a space of time can scarcely be called crazy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this masquerading as a gypsy and a burglar,&rdquo; urged Garvington irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was actually a gypsy, remember, my lord, and it was natural that he should wish  occasionally to get back to the life he loved. As to his being a burglar, I  venture to disagree with you. He had some reason to visit this house at the  hour and in the manner he did, and doubtless if he had lived he would have  explained. But whatever might have been his motive, Lord Garvington, I am  certain it was not connected with robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  snapped the fat little man candidly, &ldquo;if I had known that Pine was such a  blighter as to leave me nothing, I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;d have allowed him to be  buried in such decent company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy,  Freddy, the poor man is dead. Let him rest,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, who looked  more limp and untidy than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish he was resting somewhere else than in my vault. A damned gypsy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my husband,&rdquo; said Lady Agnes sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that, Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could forget it. Much use he has been to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> have no cause to complain,&rdquo; said his  sister with a meaning glance, and Garvington suddenly subsided.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you say something, Noel?&rdquo; asked Lady Garvington dismally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see what there is to say,&rdquo; he rejoined, not lifting his eyes from the  ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are wrong,&rdquo; remarked Agnes with a sudden flush. &ldquo;There is a very great deal  to say, but this is not the place to say it. Mr. Jarwin,&rdquo; she rose to her feet,  looking a queenly figure in her long black robes, &ldquo;you can return to town and  later will receive my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lawyer looked hard at her marble face, wondering whether she would choose the  lover or the money. It was a hard choice, and a very difficult position. He  could not read in her eyes what she intended to do, so mutely bowed and took a  ceremonious departure, paying a silent tribute to the widow&rsquo;s strength of mind.  &ldquo;Poor thing; poor thing,&rdquo; thought the solicitor, &ldquo;I believe she loves her  cousin. It is hard that she can only marry him at the cost of becoming a  pauper. A difficult position for her, indeed. H&rsquo;m! she&rsquo;ll hold on to the money,  of course; no woman would be such a fool as to pay two millions sterling for a  husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  relation to nine women out of ten, this view would have been a reasonable one  to take, but Agnes happened to be the tenth, who had the singular taste&mdash;madness  some would have called it&mdash;to prefer love to hard cash. Still, she made no hasty  decision, seeing that the issues involved in her renunciation were so great.  Garvington, showing a characteristic want of tact, began to argue the question  almost the moment Jarwin drove away from The Manor, but his sister promptly  declined to enter into any discussion.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  and Jane can go away,&rdquo; said she, cutting him short. &ldquo;I wish to have a private  conversation with Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t give up the money,&rdquo; whispered Garvington in an agonized  tone when at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sold myself once to help the family,&rdquo; she replied in the same low voice; &ldquo;but I  am not so sure that I am ready to do so twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right, dear,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, patting the widow&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It is better to  have love than money. Besides, it only means that Freddy will have to give up  eating rich dinners which don&rsquo;t agree with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  away, you fool!&rdquo; cried Freddy, exasperated, and, seizing her arm, he drew her  out of the room, growling like a sick bear.</p>
  <p>Agnes  closed the door, and returned to look at Lambert, who still continued to stare  at the carpet with folded arms. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he replied in the same tone, and without raising his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all you have to say, Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see what else I can say. Pine evidently guessed that we loved one  another, although heaven knows that our affection has been innocent enough, and  has taken this way to part us forever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  it part us forever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. As an honorable man, and one who loves you dearly, I can&rsquo;t expect you  to give up two millions for the sake of love in a cottage with me. It is asking  too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when a woman loves a man as I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time Lambert did look up, and his eyes flashed with surprise and delight. &ldquo;Agnes,  you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  cut him short by sitting down beside him and taking his hand. &ldquo;I would rather  live on a crust with you in the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage than in Park Lane a lonely  woman with ample wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t remain lonely long,&rdquo; said Lambert moodily. &ldquo;Pine&rsquo;s will does not forbid  you to marry any one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I deserve that answer, Noel, after what I have just said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear, no.&rdquo; He pressed her hand warmly. &ldquo;But you must make some allowance for my  feelings. It is right that a man should sacrifice all for a woman, but that a  woman should give up everything for a man seems wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many  women do, if they love truly as I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Agnes, think what people will say about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be your share of the sacrifice,&rdquo; she replied promptly. &ldquo;If I do this, you  must do that. There is no difficulty when the matter is looked on in that  light. But there is a graver question to be answered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  looked at her in a questioning manner and read the answer in her eyes. &ldquo;You  mean about the property of the family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Agnes heaved a sigh and shook her head. &ldquo;I wish I had been born a village girl  rather than the daughter of a great house. Rank has its obligations, Noel. I  recognized that before, and therefore married Hubert. He was a good, kind man,  and, save that I lost you, I had no reason to regret becoming his wife. But I  did not think that he would have put such an insult on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insult,  dear?&rdquo; Lambert flushed hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else can you call this forbidding me to marry you? The will is certain to be  filed at Somerset House, and the contents will be made known to the public in  the usual way, through the newspapers. Then what will people say, Noel? Why,  that I became Hubert&rsquo;s wife in order to get his money, since, knowing that he  was consumptive, I hoped he would soon die, and that as a rich widow I could  console myself with you. They will chuckle to see how my scheme has been  overturned by the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you made no such scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. Still, everyone will credit me with having done so. As a woman, who  has been insulted, and by a man who has no reason to mistrust me, I feel inclined  to renounce the money and marry you, if only to show how I despise the  millions. But as a Lambert I must think again of the family as I thought  before. The only question is, whether it is wise to place duty above love for  the second time, considering the misery we have endured, and the small thanks  we have received for our self-denial?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  Garvington&rsquo;s estates are free by now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  they are not. Hubert, as I told you when we spoke in the cottage, paid off many  mortgages, but retained possession of them. He did not charge Garvington any  interest, and let him have the income of the mortgaged land. No one could have  behaved better than Hubert did, until my brother&rsquo;s demands became so outrageous  that it was impossible to go on lending and giving him money. Hubert did not  trust him so far as to give back the mortgages, so these will form a portion of  his estate. As that belongs to me, I can settle everything with ease, and place  Garvington in an entirely satisfactory condition. But I do that at the cost of  losing you, dear. Should the estates pass to this unknown person, the mortgages  would be foreclosed, and our family would be ruined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  things as bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  bit as bad. Hubert told me plainly how matters stood. For generations the heads  of the family have been squandering money. Freddy is just as bad as the rest,  and, moreover, has no head for figures. He does not know the value of money,  never having been in want of it. But if everything was sold up&mdash;and it must be  if I marry you and lose the millions&mdash;he will be left without an acre of land  and only three hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the devil!&rdquo; Lambert jumped up and began to walk up and down the room with a  startled air. &ldquo;That would finish the Lambert family with a vengeance, Agnes.  What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait?  For what&mdash;the Deluge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t come while I hold the money. I have a good business head, and Hubert  taught me how to deal with financial matters. I could not give him love, but I did  give him every attention, and I believe that I was able to help him in some  ways. I shall utilize my experience to see the family lawyer and go into  matters thoroughly. Then we shall know for certain if things are as bad as  Hubert made out. If they are, I must sacrifice you and myself for the sake of  our name; if they are not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked Lambert, seeing how she hesitated. Agnes crossed the room and placed her  arms round his neck with a lovely color tinting her wan cheeks. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she  whispered, &ldquo;I shall marry you. In doing so I am not disloyal to Hubert&rsquo;s  memory, since I have always loved you, and he accepted me as his wife on the  understanding that I could not give him my heart. And now that he has insulted  me,&rdquo; she drew back, and her eyes flashed, &ldquo;I feel free to become your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; Lambert nodded. &ldquo;We must wait?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must wait. Duty comes before love. But I trust that the sacrifice will not be  necessary. Good-bye, dear,&rdquo; and she kissed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo;  repeated Lambert, returning the kiss. Then they parted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    Blackmail</b></h2>
  <p>Having  come to the only possible arrangement, consistent with the difficult position  in which they stood, Lambert and Lady Agnes took their almost immediate  departure from The Manor. The young man had merely come to stay there in  response to his cousin&rsquo;s request, so that his avoidance of her should not be  too marked, and the suspicions of Pine excited. Now that the man was dead,  there was no need to behave in this judicious way, and having no great love for  Garvington, whom he thoroughly despised, Lambert returned to his forest  cottage. There he busied himself once more with his art, and waited patiently  to see what the final decision of Agnes would be. He did not expect to hear for  some weeks, or even months, as the affairs of Garvington, being very much  involved, could not be understood in a moment. But the lovers, parted by a  strict sense of duty, eased their minds by writing weekly letters to one  another.</p>
  <p>Needless  to say, Garvington did not at all approve of the decision of his sister, which  she duly communicated to him. He disliked Lambert, both as the next heir to the  estates, and because he was a more popular man than himself. Even had Pine not  prohibited the marriage in his will, Garvington would have objected to Agnes  becoming the young man&rsquo;s wife; as it was, he stormed tempests, but without  changing the widow&rsquo;s determination. Being a remarkably selfish creature, all he  desired was that Agnes should live a solitary life as a kind of banker, to  supply him with money whenever he chose to ask for the same. Pine he had not  been able to manage, but he felt quite sure that he could bully his sister into  doing what he wanted. It both enraged and surprised him to find that she had a  will of her own and was not content to obey his egotistical orders. Agnes would  not even remain under his roof&mdash;as he wanted her to, lest some other person  should get hold of her and the desirable millions&mdash;but returned to her London  house. The only comfort he had was that Lambert was not with her, and  therefore&mdash;as he devoutly hoped&mdash;she would meet some man who would cause her to  forget the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood recluse. So long as Agnes retained the money,  Garvington did not particularly object to her marrying, as he always hoped to  cajole and bully ready cash out of her, but he would have preferred had she  remained single, as then she could be more easily plundered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said to his long-suffering wife. &ldquo;While she&rsquo;s a widow  there&rsquo;s always the chance that she may take the bit between her teeth and marry  Noel, in which case she loses everything. It will be as well to get her  married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have no selection of the husband this time,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, whose  sympathies were entirely for Agnes. &ldquo;She will choose for herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  her,&rdquo; retorted Garvington, with feigned generosity. &ldquo;So long as she does not  choose Noel; hang him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  the very man she will choose;&rdquo; replied his wife, and Garvington, uneasily  conscious that she was probably right, cursed freely all women in general and  his sister in particular. Meanwhile he went to Paris to look after a famous  chef, of whom he had heard great things, and left his wife in London with  strict injunctions to keep a watch on Agnes.</p>
  <p>The  widow was speedily made aware of these instructions, for when Lady Garvington  came to stay with her sister-in-law at the sumptuous Mayfair mansion, she told  her hostess about the conversation. More than that, she even pressed her to  marry Noel, and be happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money  doesn&rsquo;t do so much, after all, when you come to think of it,&rdquo; lamented Lady  Garvington. &ldquo;And I know you&rsquo;d be happier with Noel, than living here with all  this horrid wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would Freddy say if he heard you talk so, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what else he can say,&rdquo; rejoined the other reflectively. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never  kept his temper or held his tongue with me. His liver is nearly always out of  order with over-eating. However,&rdquo; she added cheering up, &ldquo;he is sure to die of  apoplexy before long, and then I shall live on tea and buns for the rest of my  life. I simply hate the sight of a dinner table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy  isn&rsquo;t a pretty sight during a meal,&rdquo; admitted his sister with a shrug. &ldquo;All the  same you shouldn&rsquo;t wish him dead, Jane. You might have a worse husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather have a profligate than a glutton, Agnes. But Freddy won&rsquo;t die, my dear.  He&rsquo;ll go to Wiesbaden, or Vichy, or Schwalbach, and take the waters to get  thin; then he&rsquo;ll return to eat himself to the size of a prize pig again. But  thank goodness,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, cheering up once more, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s away for a  few weeks, and we can enjoy ourselves. But do let us have plain joints and no  sauces, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you can live on bread and water if you choose,&rdquo; said the widow good-humoredly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity I am in mourning, as I can&rsquo;t take you out much. But the motor is always  at your disposal, and I can give you all the money you want. Get a few dresses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  hats, and boots, and shoes, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what else. You&rsquo;re a dear,  Agnes, and although I don&rsquo;t want to ruin you, I do want heaps of things. I&rsquo;m in  rags, as Freddy eats up our entire income.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t ruin a woman with two millions, Jane. Get what you require and I&rsquo;ll pay.  I am only too glad to give you some pleasure, since I can&rsquo;t attend to you as I  ought to. But you see, nearly three times a week I have to consult the lawyers  about settling Freddy&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  these conditions four or five weeks passed away very happily for the two women.  Lady Garvington certainly had the time of her life, and regained a portion of  her lost youth. She revelled in shopping, went in a quiet way to theatres,  patronized skating rinks, and even attended one or two small winter dances. And  to her joy, she met with a nice young man, who was earnestly in pursuit of a  new religion, which involved much fasting and occasional vegetarian meals. He  taught her to eat nuts, and eschew meats, talking meanwhile of the psychic  powers which such abstemiousness would develop in her. Of course Lady  Garvington did not overdo this asceticism, but she was thankful to meet a man  who had not read Beeton&rsquo;s Cookery Book. Besides, he flirted quite nicely.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agnes,  pleased to see her sister-in-law enjoying life, gave her attention to  Garvington&rsquo;s affairs, and found them in a woeful mess. It really did appear as  if she would have to save the Lambert family from ever-lasting disgrace, and  from being entirely submerged, by keeping hold of her millions. But she did not  lose heart, and worked on bravely in the hope that an adjustment would save a  few thousand a year for Freddy, without touching any of Pine&rsquo;s money. If she  could manage to secure him a sufficient income to keep up the title, and to  prevent the sale of The Manor in Hengishire, she then intended to surrender her  husband&rsquo;s wealth and retire to a country life with Noel as her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can paint and I can look after the cottage along with Mrs. Tribb,&rdquo; she told  Mrs. Belgrove, who called to see her one day, more painted and dyed and padded  and tastefully dressed than ever. &ldquo;We can keep fowls and things, you know,&rdquo; she  added vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  an idyl,&rdquo; tittered the visitor, and then went away to tell her friends that  Lady Agnes must have been in love with her cousin all the time. And as the  contents of the will were now generally known, every one agreed that the woman  was a fool to give up wealth for a dull existence in the woods. &ldquo;All the same  it&rsquo;s very sweet,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Belgrove, having made as much mischief as she  possibly could. &ldquo;I should like it myself if I could only dress as a Watteau  shepherdess, you know, and carry a lamb with a blue ribbon round its dear neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of  course, Lady Agnes heard nothing of this ill-natured chatter, since she did not  go into society during her period of mourning, and received only a few of her  most intimate friends. Moreover, besides attending to Garvington&rsquo;s affairs, it  was necessary that she should have frequent consultations with Mr. Jarwin in  his stuffy Chancery Lane office, relative to the large fortune left by her late  husband. There, on three occasions she met Silver, the ex-secretary, when he  came to explain various matters to the solicitor. With the consent of Lady  Agnes, the man had been discharged, when Jarvin took over the management of the  millions, but having a thorough knowledge of Pine&rsquo;s financial dealings, it was  necessary that he should be questioned every now and then.</p>
  <p>Silver  was rather sulky over his abrupt dismissal, but cunningly concealed his real  feelings when in the presence of the widow, since she was too opulent a person  to offend. It was Silver who suggested that a reward should be offered for the  detection of Pine&rsquo;s assassin. Lady Agnes approved of the idea, and indeed was  somewhat shocked that she had not thought of taking this course herself.  Therefore, within seven days every police office in the United Kingdom was  placarded with bills, stating that the sum of one thousand pounds would be  given to the person or persons who should denounce the culprit. The amount  offered caused quite a flutter of excitement, and public interest in the case  was revived for nearly a fortnight. At the conclusion of that period, as  nothing fresh was discovered, people ceased to discuss the matter. It seemed as  though the reward, large as it was, would never be claimed.</p>
  <p>But  having regard to the fact that Silver was interesting himself in the endeavor  to avenge his patron&rsquo;s death, Lady Agnes was not at all surprised to receive a  visit from him one foggy November afternoon. She certainly did not care much  for the little man, but feeling dull and somewhat lonely, she quite welcomed  his visit. Lady Garvington had gone with her ascetic admirer to a lecture on &ldquo;Souls  and Sorrows!&rdquo; therefore Agnes had a spare hour for the ex-secretary. He was  shown into her own particular private sitting-room, and she welcomed him with  studied politeness, for try as she might it was impossible for her to overcome  her mistrust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day,  Mr. Silver,&rdquo; she said, when he bowed before her. &ldquo;This is an unexpected visit.  Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  accepted her offer of a chair with an air of demure shyness, and sitting on its  edge stared at her rather hard. He looked neat and dapper in his Bond Street  kit, and for a man who had started life as a Whitechapel toymaker, his manners  were inoffensive. While Pine&rsquo;s secretary he had contrived to pick up hints in  the way of social behavior, and undoubtedly he was clever, since he so readily  adapted himself to his surroundings. He was not a gentleman, but he looked like  a gentleman, and therein lay a subtle difference as Lady Agnes decided. She  unconsciously in her manner, affable as it was, suggested the gulf between  them, and Silver, quickly contacting the atmosphere, did not love her any the  more for the hint.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  he admired her statuesque beauty, the fairness of which was accentuated by her  sombre dress. Blinking like a well-fed cat, Silver stared at his hostess, and  she looked questioningly at him. With his foxy face, his reddish hair, and  suave manners, too careful to be natural, he more than ever impressed her with  the idea that he was a dangerous man. Yet she could not see in what way he  could reveal his malignant disposition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you wish to see me about, Mr. Silver?&rdquo; she asked kindly, but did not&mdash;as he  swiftly noticed&mdash;offer him a cup of tea, although it was close upon five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to place my services at your disposal,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  I am not aware that I need them,&rdquo; replied Lady Agnes coldly, and not at all  anxious to accept the offer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; said Silver dryly, and clearing his throat, &ldquo;that when you hear what I  have to say you will be glad that I have come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  Will you be good enough to speak plainer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  colored hotly when she asked the question, as it struck her suddenly that  perhaps this plotter knew of Garvington&rsquo;s slip regarding the check. But as that  had been burnt by Pine at the time of her marriage, she reflected that even if  Silver knew about it, he could do nothing. Unless, and it was this thought that  made her turn red, Garvington had again risked contact with the criminal  courts. The idea was not a pleasant one, but being a brave woman, she faced the  possibility boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  she asked calmly, as he did not reply immediately. &ldquo;What have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about Pine&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Silver bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why, Lady Agnes?&rdquo; Silver raised his faint eyebrows. &ldquo;We were more like brothers  than master and servant. And remember that it was by the penny toys that I  invented your husband first made money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  talking to me, I prefer that you should call my late husband Sir Hubert,&rdquo;  insisted the widow haughtily. &ldquo;What have you discovered relative to his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  did not answer the question directly. &ldquo;Sir Hubert, since you will have it so,  Lady Agnes, was a gypsy,&rdquo; he remarked carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was made plain at the inquest, Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, Lady Agnes, but there were other things not made plain on that occasion. It  was not discovered who shot him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  tell me nothing new. I presume you have come to explain that you have  discovered a clew to the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  raised his pale face steadily. &ldquo;Would you be glad if I had?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!  Can you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man shirked a reply to this question also. &ldquo;Sir Hubert did not treat me over  well,&rdquo; he observed irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear that has nothing to do with me, Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I was dimissed from my post,&rdquo; he went on imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  Mr. Jarwin&rsquo;s advice,&rdquo; she informed him quickly. &ldquo;There was no need for you to  be retained. But I believe that you were given a year&rsquo;s salary in lieu of  notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I am obliged to you and to Mr. Jarwin for the money,  although it is not a very large sum. Considering what I did for Sir Hubert, and  how he built up his fortune out of my brains, I think that I have been treated  shabbily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes rose, and moved towards the fireplace to touch the ivory button of the  electric bell. &ldquo;On that point I refer you to Mr. Jarwin,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;This  interview has lasted long enough and can lead to nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may lead to something unpleasant unless you listen to me,&rdquo; said Silver acidly. &ldquo;I  advise you not to have me turned out, Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; She dropped the hand she had extended to ring the bell, and faced  the smooth-faced creature suddenly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will sit down, Lady Agnes, I can explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can  receive your explanation standing,&rdquo; said the widow, frowning. &ldquo;Be brief,  please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. To put the matter in a nutshell, I want five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand pounds!&rdquo; she echoed, aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  account,&rdquo; said Silver blandly. &ldquo;On account, Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert was a gypsy,&rdquo; he said again, and with a significant look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  stopped at the camp near Abbot&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a gypsy girl there called Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea!  Chaldea!&rdquo; muttered the widow, passing her hand across her brow. &ldquo;I have heard  that name. Oh, yes. Miss Greeby mentioned it to me as the name of a girl who  was sitting as Mr. Lambert&rsquo;s model.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented Silver, grinning. &ldquo;She is a very beautiful girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  color rushed again to the woman&rsquo;s cheeks, but she controlled her emotions with  an effort. &ldquo;So Miss Greeby told me!&rdquo; She knew that the man was hinting that  Lambert admired the girl in question, but her pride prevented her admitting the  knowledge. &ldquo;Chaldea is being painted as Esmeralda to the Quasimodo of her  lover, a Servian gypsy called Kara, as I have been informed, Mr. Silver. But  what has all this to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be in a hurry, Lady Agnes. It will take time to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you take this tone with me?&rdquo; demanded the widow, clenching her hands. &ldquo;Leave  the room, sir, or I shall have you turned out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shall leave since you wish it,&rdquo; replied Silver, rising slowly and smoothing  his silk hat with his sleeve. &ldquo;But of course I shall try and earn the reward  you offered, by taking the letter to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  was so surprised that she closed again the door she had opened for her visitor&rsquo;s  exit. &ldquo;What letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  one which was written to inveigle Sir Hubert to The Manor on the night he was  murdered,&rdquo; replied Silver slowly, and suddenly raising his eyes he looked at  her straightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said in a puzzled way. &ldquo;I have never heard that such a  letter was in existence. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea  has it, and will not give it up unless she receives five thousand pounds,&rdquo;  answered the man glibly. &ldquo;Give it to me and it passes into your possession,  Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  you what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  thousand pounds&mdash;on account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  account of blackmail. How dare you make such a proposition to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know,&rdquo; said Silver pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing. It is the first time I have heard of any letter. Who wrote it,  may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know,&rdquo; said Silver again.</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes was so insulted by his triumphant look that she could have struck his  grinning face. However, she had too strong a nature to lower herself in this  way, and pointed to a chair. &ldquo;Let me ask you a few questions, Mr. Silver,&rdquo; she  said imperiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am quite ready to answer whatever you choose to ask,&rdquo; he retorted, taking his  seat again and secretly surprised at her self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say that Chaldea holds a letter which inveigled my husband to his death?&rdquo;  demanded Lady Agnes coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And she wants five thousand pounds for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  doesn&rsquo;t she give it to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  thousand pounds is not enough for the letter. It is worth more&mdash;to some people,&rdquo;  and Silver raised his pale eyes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  me, I presume you mean;&rdquo; then when he bowed, she continued her examination. &ldquo;The  five thousand pounds you intimate is on account, yet you say that Chaldea will  deliver the letter for that sum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  me,&rdquo; rejoined the ex-secretary impudently. &ldquo;And when it is in my possession, I  can give it to you for twenty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes laughed in his face. &ldquo;I am too good a business woman to make such a  bargain,&rdquo; she said with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you know best,&rdquo; replied Silver, imitating her shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing; I am quite in the dark as to the reason for your blackmailing,  Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a nasty word, Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the only word which seems to suit the situation. Why should I give  twenty-five thousand pounds for this letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its  production will place the police on the track of the assassin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is not that what I desire? Why did I offer a reward of one thousand pounds if I  did not hope that the wretch who murdered my husband should be brought to  justice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  exhibited unfeigned surprise. &ldquo;You wish that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  I do. Where was this letter discovered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea  went to the tent of your husband in the camp and found it in the pocket of his  coat. He apparently left it behind by mistake when he went to watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  The letter stated that you intended to elope that night with Mr. Lambert, and  would leave the house by the blue door. Sir Hubert went to watch and prevent  the elopement. In that way he came by his death, since Lord Garvington  threatened to shoot a possible burglar. Of course, Sir Hubert, when the blue  door was opened by Lord Garvington, who had heard the footsteps of the supposed  burglar, threw himself forward, thinking you were coming out to meet Mr.  Lambert. Sir Hubert was first shot in the arm by Lord Garvington, who really  believed for the moment that he had to do with a robber. But the second shot,&rdquo;  ended Silver with emphasis, &ldquo;was fired by a person concealed in the shrubbery,  who knew that Sir Hubert would walk into the trap laid by the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>During  this amazing recital, Lady Agnes, with her eyes on the man&rsquo;s face, and her  hands clasped in sheer surprise, had sat down on a near couch. She could  scarcely believe her ears. &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; she asked in a faltering voice.</p>
  <p>Silver  shrugged his shoulders again. &ldquo;The letter held by Chaldea certainly set the  snare in which Sir Hubert was caught. Unless the person in the shrubbery knew  about the letter, the person would scarcely have been concealed there with a  revolver. I know about the letter for certain, since Chaldea showed it to me,  when I went to ask questions about the murder in the hope of gaining the  reward. The rest of my story is theoretical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was the person who fired the shot?&rdquo; asked Lady Agnes abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wrote the letter which set the snare?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  shuffled. &ldquo;Chaldea loves Mr. Lambert,&rdquo; he said hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; ordered the widow coldly and retaining her self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is jealous of you, Lady Agnes, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no reason to explain,&rdquo; interrupted the listener between her teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, Chaldea hating you, says that you wrote the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed.&rdquo; Lady Agnes replied calmly enough, although her conflicting emotions  almost suffocated her. &ldquo;Then I take it that this gypsy declares me to be a  murderess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shouldn&rsquo;t say that exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do say it,&rdquo; cried Lady Agnes, rising fiercely. &ldquo;If I wrote the letter, and set  the snare, I must necessarily know that some one was hiding in the shrubbery to  shoot my husband. It is an abominable lie from start to finish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to hear you say so. But the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police will deal with that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police? You will let Chaldea give the letter to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am innocent and have no fear of the police. Your attempt to blackmail me has  failed, Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  wise and take time for reflection,&rdquo; he urged, walking towards the door, &ldquo;for I  have seen this letter, and it is in your handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never wrote such a letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who did&mdash;in your handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you did yourself, Mr. Silver, since you are trying to blackmail me in this  bareface way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  snarled and gave her an ugly look. &ldquo;I did no such thing,&rdquo; he retorted  vehemently, and, as it seemed, honestly enough. &ldquo;I had every reason to wish  that Sir Hubert should live, since my income and my position depended upon his  existence. But you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about me?&rdquo; demanded Lady Agnes, taking so sudden a step forward that the little  man retreated nearer the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;People  say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what people say and what you are about to repeat,&rdquo; she said in a stifled  voice. &ldquo;You can tell the girl to take that forged letter to the police. I am  quite able to face any inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mr. Lambert also able?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Lambert?&rdquo; Agnes felt as though she would choke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was at his cottage on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  deny that; he went to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea  can prove that he was at his cottage, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better go,&rdquo; said Lady Agnes, turning white and looking dangerous. &ldquo;Go,  before you say what you may be sorry for. I shall tell Mr. Lambert the story  you have told me, and let him deal with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  threw off the mask, as he was enraged she should so boldly withstand his  demands. &ldquo;I give you one week,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;And, if you do not pay me  twenty-five thousand pounds, that letter goes to the inspector at Wanbury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can go now,&rdquo; she declared dauntlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you and Mr. Lambert will be arrested at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  gripped the man&rsquo;s arm as he was about to step through the door. &ldquo;I take your  week of grace,&rdquo; she said with a sudden impulse of wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you would,&rdquo; retorted Silver insultingly. &ldquo;But remember I must get the  money at the end of seven days. It&rsquo;s twenty-five thousand pounds for me, or  disgrace to you,&rdquo; and with an abrupt nod he disappeared sneering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  thousand pounds or disgrace,&rdquo; whispered Agnes to herself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    The Conspiracy</b></h2>
  <p>It  was lucky that Lambert did not know of the ordeal to which Agnes had to submit,  unaided, since he was having a most unhappy time himself. In a sketching  expedition he had caught a chill, which had developed once more a malarial  fever, contracted in the Congo marshes some years previously. Whenever his  constitution weakened, this ague fit would reappear, and for days, sometimes  weeks, he would shiver with cold, and alternately burn with fever. As the  autumn mists were hanging round the leafless Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, it was injudicious  of him to sit in the open, however warmly clothed, seeing that he was  predisposed to disease. But his desire for the society of the woman he loved,  and the hopelessness of the outlook, rendered him reckless, and he was more  often out of doors than in. The result was that when Agnes came down to relate  the interview with Silver, she found him in his sitting-room swathed in  blankets, and reclining in an arm-chair placed as closely to a large wood fire  as was possible. He was very ill indeed, poor man, and she uttered an  exclamation when she saw his wan cheeks and hollow eyes. Lambert was now as  weak as he had been strong, and with the mothering instinct of a woman, she  rushed forward to kneel beside his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, my dear, why did you not send for me?&rdquo; she wailed, keeping back her tears  with an effort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m all right, Agnes,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully, and fondly clasping her hand. &ldquo;Mrs.  Tribb is nursing me capitally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  doing my best,&rdquo; said the rosy-faced little housekeeper, who stood at the door  with her podgy hands primly folded over her apron. &ldquo;Plenty of bed and food is  what I give Master Noel; but bless you, my lady, he won&rsquo;t stay between the  blankets, being always a worrit from a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that I am very much between the blankets now,&rdquo; murmured Lambert in  a tired voice, and with a glance at his swathed limbs. &ldquo;Go away, Mrs. Tribb,  and get Lady Agnes something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only want a cup of tea,&rdquo; said Agnes, looking anxiously into her lover&rsquo;s  bluish-tinted face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tribb took a long look at the visitor and pursed up her lips, as she shook her  head. &ldquo;Hungry you mayn&rsquo;t be, my lady, but food you must have, and that of the  most nourishing and delicate. You look almost as much a corpse as Master Noel  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Agnes, you do seem to be ill,&rdquo; said Lambert with a startled glance at her  deadly white face, and at the dark circles under her eyes. &ldquo;What is the matter,  dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!  Nothing! Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tribb still continued to shake her head, and, to vary the movement, nodded like  a Chinese mandarin. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t looked after proper, my lady, for all your fine  London servants, who ain&rsquo;t to be trusted, nohow, having neither hands to do nor  hearts to feel for them as wants comforts and attentions. I remember you, my  lady, a blooming young rose of a gal, and now sheets ain&rsquo;t nothing to your  complexion. But rose you shall be again, my lady, if wine and food can do what  they&rsquo;re meant to do. Tea you shan&rsquo;t have, nohow, but a glass or two of  burgundy, and a plate of patty-foo-grass sandwiches, and later a bowl of strong  beef tea with port wine to strengthen the same,&rdquo; and Mrs. Tribb, with a  determined look on her face, went away to prepare these delicacies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear! my dear!&rdquo; murmured Agnes again when the door closed. &ldquo;You should have  sent for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  answered Lambert, smoothing her hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child to cry out at the least  scratch. It&rsquo;s only an attack of my old malarial fever, and I shall be all right  in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a few of these days,&rdquo; said Agnes, looking out of the window at the gaunt,  dripping trees and gray sky and melancholy monoliths. &ldquo;You ought to come to  London and see the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  I come, I should have had to pay you a visit, and I thought that you did not  wish me to, until things were adjusted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  drew back, and, kneeling before the fire, spread out her hands to the blaze. &ldquo;Will  they ever be adjusted?&rdquo; she asked herself despairingly, but did not say so  aloud, as she was unwilling to worry the sick man. &ldquo;Well, I only came down to  The Manor for a few days,&rdquo; she said aloud, and in a most cheerful manner. &ldquo;Jane  wants to get the house in order for Garvington, who returns from Paris in a  week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes!  Agnes!&rdquo; Lambert shook his head. &ldquo;You are not telling me the truth. I know you  too well, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really am staying with Jane at The Manor,&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I believe that; but you are in trouble and came down to consult me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she admitted faintly. &ldquo;I am in great trouble. But I don&rsquo;t wish to worry you  while you are in this state.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will worry me a great deal more by keeping silence,&rdquo; said Lambert, sitting up  in his chair and drawing the blankets more closely round him. &ldquo;Do not trouble  about me. I&rsquo;m all right. But you&mdash;&rdquo; he looked at her keenly and with a dismayed  expression. &ldquo;The trouble must be very great,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may become so, Noel. It has to do with&mdash;oh, here is Mrs. Tribb!&rdquo; and she broke  off hurriedly, as the housekeeper appeared with a tray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  my lady, just you sit in that arm-chair opposite to Master Noel, and I&rsquo;ll put  the tray on this small stool beside you. Sandwiches and burgundy wine, my lady,  and see that you eat and drink all you can. Walking over on this dripping day,&rdquo;  cried Mrs. Tribb, bustling about. &ldquo;Giving yourself your death of cold, and you  with carriages and horses, and them spitting cats of motive things. You&rsquo;re as  bad as Master Noel, my lady. As for him, God bless him evermore, he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs.  Tribb raised her hands to show that words failed her, and once more vanished  through the door to get ready the beef tea.</p>
  <p>Agnes  did not want to eat, but Lambert, who quite agreed with the kind-hearted  practical housekeeper, insisted that she should do so. To please him she took  two sandwiches, and a glass of the strong red wine, which brought color back to  her cheeks in some degree. When she finished, and had drawn her chair closer to  the blaze, he smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are just like Darby and Joan,&rdquo; said Lambert, who looked much better for her  presence. &ldquo;I am so glad you are here, Agnes. You are the very best medicine I  can have to make me well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  idea of comparing me to anything so nasty as medicine,&rdquo; laughed Agnes with an  attempt at gayety. &ldquo;But indeed, Noel, I wish my visit was a pleasant one. But  it is not, whatever you may say; I am in great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what&mdash;with what&mdash;in what?&rdquo; stuttered Lambert, so confusedly and anxiously that  she hesitated to tell him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you well enough to hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I am,&rdquo; he answered fretfully, for the suspense began to tell on his  nerves. &ldquo;I would rather know the worst and face the worst than be left to worry  over these hints. Has the trouble to do with the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And with Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pine&rsquo;s  secretary? I thought you had got rid of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. Mr. Jarwin said that he was not needed, so I paid him a year&rsquo;s wages  instead of giving him notice, and let him go. But I have met him once or twice  at the lawyers, as he has been telling Mr. Jarwin about poor Hubert&rsquo;s  investments. And yesterday afternoon he came to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  came to the point at once, seeing that it would be better to do so, and put an  end to Lambert&rsquo;s suspense. &ldquo;About a letter supposed to have been written by me,  as a means of luring Hubert to The Manor to be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s  sallow and pinched face grew a deep red. &ldquo;Is the man mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  sane enough to ask twenty-five thousand pounds for the letter,&rdquo; she said in a  dry tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much madness about that request.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five  thousand pounds!&rdquo; gasped Lambert, gripping the arms of his chair and attempting  to rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Don&rsquo;t get up, Noel, you are too weak.&rdquo; Agnes pressed him back into the seat. &ldquo;Twenty  thousand for himself and five thousand for Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea!  Chaldea! What has she got to do with the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  holds the letter,&rdquo; said Agnes with a side-glance. &ldquo;And being jealous of me, she  intends to make me suffer, unless I buy her silence and the letter. Otherwise,  according to Mr. Silver, she will show it to the police. I have seven days,  more or less, in which to make up my mind. Either I must be blackmailed, or I  must face the accusation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  heard only one word that struck him in this speech. &ldquo;Why is Chaldea jealous of  you?&rdquo; he demanded angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you can best answer that question, Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly can, and answer it honestly, too. Who told you about Chaldea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Silver, for one, as I have just confessed. Clara Greeby for another. She said  that the girl was sitting to you for some picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Esmeralda  and Quasimodo,&rdquo; replied the artist quickly. &ldquo;You will find what I have done of  the picture in the next room. But this confounded girl chose to fall in love  with me, and since then I have declined to see her. I need hardly tell you,  Agnes, that I gave her no encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear. I never for one moment supposed that you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, and in spite of my very plain speaking, she continues to haunt me,  Agnes. I have avoided her on every occasion, but she comes daily to see Mrs.  Tribb, and ask questions about my illness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  if she comes this afternoon, you must get that letter from her,&rdquo; was the reply.  &ldquo;I wish to see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver  declares that you wrote it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does. Chaldea showed it to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is in your handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Mr. Silver declares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  rubbed the bristles of his three days&rsquo; beard, and wriggled uncomfortably in his  seat. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t gather much from these hints,&rdquo; he said with the fretful  impatience of an invalid. &ldquo;Give me a detailed account of this scoundrel&rsquo;s  interview with you, and report his exact words if you can remember them, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember them very well. A woman does not forget such insults easily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  the beast!&rdquo; muttered Lambert savagely. &ldquo;Go on, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  patted his hand to soothe him, and forthwith related all that had passed  between her and the ex-secretary. Lambert frowned once or twice during the  recital, and bit his lip with anger. Weak as he was, he longed for Silver to be  within kicking distance, and it would have fared badly with the foxy little man  had he been in the room at the moment. When Agnes ended, her lover reflected  for a few minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a conspiracy,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  conspiracy, Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Chaldea hates you because the fool has chosen to fall in love with me. The  discovery of this letter has placed a weapon in her hand to do you an injury,  and for the sake of money Silver is assisting her. I will do Chaldea the  justice to say that I don&rsquo;t believe she asks a single penny for the letter. To  spite you she would go at once to the police. But Silver, seeing that there is  money in the business, has prevented her doing so. As to this letter&mdash;&rdquo; He  stopped and rubbed his chin again vexedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt, but not of your handwriting, I fancy, in spite of what this daring  blackguard says. He informed you that the letter stated how you intended to  elope with me on that night, and would leave The Manor by the blue door. Also,  on the face of it, it would appear that you had written the letter to your  husband, since otherwise it would not have been in his possession. You would  not have given him such a hint had an elopement really been arranged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  frowned. &ldquo;There was no chance of an elopement being arranged,&rdquo; she observed  rather coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. You and I know as much, but I am looking at the matter from the  point of view of the person who wrote the letter. It can&rsquo;t be your forged  handwriting, for Pine would never have believed that you would put him on the  track as it were. No, Agnes. Depend upon it, the letter was a warning sent by  some sympathetic friend, and is probably an anonymous one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  nodded meditatively. &ldquo;You may be right, Noel. But who wrote to Hubert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must see the letter and find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if it is my forged handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it is,&rdquo; said Lambert decisively. &ldquo;No conspirator would be so  foolish as to conduct his plot in such a way. However, Chaldea has the letter,  according to Silver, and we must make her give it up. She is sure to be here  soon, as she always comes bothering Mrs. Tribb in the afternoon about my  health. Just ring that hand-bell, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Chaldea wrote the letter?&rdquo; she asked, having obeyed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She has not the education to forge, or even to write decently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Mr. Silver&mdash;but no. I taxed him with setting the trap, and he declared that  Hubert was more benefit to him alive than dead, which is perfectly true. Here  is Mrs. Tribb, Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  turned his head. &ldquo;Has that gypsy been here to-day?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, Master Noel, but there&rsquo;s no saying when she may come, for she&rsquo;s always  hanging round the house. I&rsquo;d tar and feather her and slap and pinch her if I  had my way, say what you like, my lady. I&rsquo;ve no patience with gals of that  free-and-easy, light-headed, butter-won&rsquo;t-melt-in-your-mouth kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she comes to-day, show her in here,&rdquo; said Lambert, paying little attention to  Mrs. Tribb&rsquo;s somewhat German speech of mouth-filling words.</p>
  <p>The  housekeeper&rsquo;s black eyes twinkled, and she opened her lips, then she shut them  again, and looking at Lady Agnes in a questioning way, trotted out of the room.  It was plain that Mrs. Tribb knew of Chaldea&rsquo;s admiration for her master, and  could not understand why he wished her to enter the house when Lady Agnes was  present. She did not think it a wise thing to apply fire to gunpowder, which,  in her opinion, was what Lambert was doing.</p>
  <p>There  ensued silence for a few moments. Then Agnes, staring into the fire, remarked  in a musing manner, &ldquo;I wonder who did shoot Hubert. Mr. Silver would not have  done so, as it was to his interest to keep him alive. Do you think that to hurt  me, Noel, Chaldea might have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! No! It was to her interest also that Pine should live, since she knew that  I could not marry you while he was alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  nodded, understanding him so well that she did not need to ask for a detailed  explanation. &ldquo;It could not have been any of those staying at The Manor,&rdquo; she  said doubtfully, &ldquo;since every one was indoors and in bed. Garvington, of  course, only broke poor Hubert&rsquo;s arm under a misapprehension. Who could have  been the person in the shrubbery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver  hints that I am the individual,&rdquo; said Lambert grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he does,&rdquo; assented Lady Agnes quickly. &ldquo;I declared that you were in London, but  he said that you returned on that night to this place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, worse luck. I went to town, thinking it best to be away while Pine was in  the neighborhood, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew that Hubert was a gypsy and at the camp?&rdquo; interrupted Agnes in a nervous  manner, for the information startled her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Chaldea told me so, when she was trying to make me fall in love with her. I did  not tell you, as I thought that you might be vexed, although I dare say I  should have done so later. However, I went to town in order to prevent trouble,  and only returned for that single night. I went back to town next morning very  early, and did not hear about the murder until I saw a paragraph in the evening  papers. Afterwards I came down to the funeral because Garvington asked me to,  and I thought that you would like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you come back on that particular night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Agnes, I had no idea that Hubert would be murdered on that especial night,  so did not choose it particularly. I returned because I had left behind a  parcel of your letters to me when we were engaged. I fancied that Chaldea might  put Hubert up to searching the cottage while I was away, and if he had found  those letters he would have been more jealous than ever, as you can easily  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; flashed out Agnes sharply. &ldquo;Hubert knew that we loved one  another, and that I broke the engagement to save the family. I told him that I  could not give him the affection he desired, and he was content to marry me on  those terms. The discovery of letters written before I became his wife would  not have caused trouble, since I was always loyal to him. There was no need for  you to return, and your presence here on that night lends color to Mr. Silver&rsquo;s  accusation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  I don&rsquo;t. All the same it is awkward for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it was made purposely awkward, Agnes. Whosoever murdered Hubert must have  known of my return, and laid the trap on that night, so that I might be  implicated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who set the trap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  person who wrote that letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what we have to find out from Chaldea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment; as if he had summoned her, the gypsy suddenly flung open the door  and walked in with a sulky expression on her dark face. At first she had been  delighted to hear that Lambert wanted to see her, but when informed by Mrs.  Tribb that Lady Agnes was with the young man, she had lost her temper. However,  the chance of seeing Lambert was too tempting to forego, so she marched in  defiantly, ready to fight with her rival if there was an opportunity of doing  so. But the Gentile lady declined the combat, and took no more notice of the  jealous gypsy than was absolutely necessary. On her side Chaldea ostentatiously  addressed her conversation to Lambert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you, rye?&rdquo; she asked, stopping with effort in the middle of the room, for  her impulse was to rush forward and gather him to her heaving bosom. &ldquo;Have you  taken drows, my precious lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by drows, Chaldea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poison,  no less. You look drabbed, for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drabbed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poisoned.  But I waste the kalo jib on you, my Gorgious. God bless you for a sick one, say  I, and that&rsquo;s a bad dukkerin, the which in gentle Romany means fortune, my  Gentile swell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  talking such nonsense,&rdquo; said Lambert sharply, and annoyed to see how the girl  ignored the presence of Lady Agnes. &ldquo;I have a few questions to ask you about a  certain letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kushto  bak to the rye, who showed it to the lady,&rdquo; said Chaldea, tossing her head so  that the golden coins jingled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not show it to me, girl,&rdquo; remarked Lady Agnes coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai!  It seems that the rumy of Hearne can lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall put you out of the house if you speak in that way,&rdquo; said Lambert sternly.  &ldquo;Silver went to Lady Agnes and tried to blackmail her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a boro pappin, and that&rsquo;s Romany for a large goose, my Gorgious rye, for I  asked no gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told him to ask five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I die in a ditch if I did!&rdquo; cried Chaldea vehemently. &ldquo;Touch the gold of the  raclan I would not, though I wanted bread. The tiny rye took the letter to give  to the prastramengro, and that&rsquo;s a policeman, my gentleman, so that there might  be trouble. But I wished no gold from her. Romany speaking, I should like to  poison her. I love you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  done with this nonsense, Chaldea. Talk like that and out you go. I can see from  what you admit, that you have been making mischief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  as true as my father,&rdquo; laughed the gypsy viciously. &ldquo;And glad am I to say the  word, my boro rye. And why should the raclan go free-footed when she drew her  rom to be slaughtered like a pig?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did nothing of the sort,&rdquo; cried Agnes, with an angry look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duvel,  it is true.&rdquo; Chaldea still addressed Lambert, and took no notice of Agnes. &ldquo;I  swear it on your Bible-book. I found the letter in my brother&rsquo;s tent, the day  after he perished. Hearne, for Hearne he was, and a gentle Romany also, read  the letter, saying that the raclan, his own romi, was running away with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wrote the letter?&rdquo; demanded Agnes indignantly.</p>
  <p>This  time Chaldea answered her fiercely. &ldquo;You did, my Gorgious rani, and lie as you  may, it&rsquo;s the truth I tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ill  as he was, Lambert could not endure seeing the girl insult Agnes. With  unexpected strength he rose from his chair and took her by the shoulders to  turn her out of the room. Chaldea laughed wildly, but did not resist. It was  Agnes who intervened. &ldquo;Let her stay until we learn the meaning of these things,  Noel,&rdquo; she said rapidly in French.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  insults you,&rdquo; he replied, in the same tongue, but released the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind; never mind.&rdquo; Agnes turned to Chaldea and reverted to English. &ldquo;Girl, you  are playing a dangerous game. I wrote no letter to the man you call Hearne, and  who was my husband&mdash;Sir Hubert Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;Avali, that is true. The letter was written by you to  my precious rye here, and Hearne&rsquo;s dukkerin brought it his way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did he get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  who know, know,&rdquo; retorted Chaldea indifferently. &ldquo;Hearne&rsquo;s breath was out of  him before I could ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that I wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  tiny rye swore by his God that you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is absolutely false!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my mother, there are liars about,&rdquo; jeered the gypsy sceptically. &ldquo;Catch you  blabbing your doings on the crook, my rani, Chore mandy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  English,&rdquo; interrupted Agnes, who was quivering with rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t cheat me,&rdquo; translated Chaldea sulkily. &ldquo;You write my rye, here, the  letter swearing to run world-wide with him, and let it fall into your rom&rsquo;s  hands, so as to fetch him to the big house. Then did you, my cunning gentleman,&rdquo;  she whirled round on the astounded Lambert viciously, &ldquo;hide so quietly in the  bushes to shoot. Hai! it is so, and I love you for the boldness, my Gorgious  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is absolutely false,&rdquo; cried Lambert, echoing Agnes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  true! and twice times true. May I go crazy, Meg, if it isn&rsquo;t. You wanted the raclan  as your romi, and so plotted my brother&rsquo;s death. But your sweet one will go  before the Poknees, and with irons on her wrists, and a rope round her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  she-devil!&rdquo; shouted Lambert in a frenzy of rage, and forgetting in his anger  the presence of Agnes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Words  of honey under the moon,&rdquo; mocked the girl, then suddenly became tender. &ldquo;Let  her go, rye, let her go. My love is all for you, and when we pad the hoof  together, those who hate us shall take off the hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  sat glaring at her furiously, and Agnes glided between him and the girl,  fearful lest he should spring up and insult her. But she addressed her words to  Chaldea. &ldquo;Why do you think I got Mr. Lambert to kill my husband?&rdquo; she asked,  wincing at having to put the question, but seeing that it was extremely  necessary to learn all she could from the gypsy.</p>
  <p>The  other woman drew her shawl closely round her fine form and snapped her fingers  contemptuously. &ldquo;It needs no chovihani to tell. Hearne the Romany was poor,  Pine the Gentile chinked gold in his pockets. Says you to yourself, &lsquo;He I love  isn&rsquo;t him with money.&rsquo; And says you, &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t get my true rom, the beauty of  the world will clasp him to her breast.&rsquo; So you goes for to get Hearne out of  the flesh, to wed the rye here on my brother&rsquo;s rich possessions. Avali,&rdquo; she  nodded vigorously. &ldquo;That is so, though &lsquo;No&rsquo; you says to me, for wisdom. Red  money you have gained, my daring sister, for the blood of a Romany chal has  changed the color. But I&rsquo;m no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  long she would have continued to rage at Lady Agnes it is impossible to say,  for the invalid, with the artificial strength of furious anger, sprang from his  chair to turn her out of the room. Chaldea dodged him in the alert way of a  wild animal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  no love-embrace, my rye,&rdquo; she jibed, retreating swiftly. &ldquo;Later, later, when  the moon rises, my angel,&rdquo; and she slipped deftly through the door with a  contemptuous laugh. Lambert would have followed, but that Agnes caught his arm,  and with tears in her eyes implored him to remain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what can we do in the face of such danger?&rdquo; she asked him when he was quieter,  and breaking down, she sobbed bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must meet it boldly. Silver has the forged letter: he must be arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the scandal, Noel. Dare we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,  you are innocent: I am innocent. Innocence can dare all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  sick, both troubled, both conscious of the dark clouds around them, they looked  at one another in silence. Then Lambert repeated his words with conviction, to  reassure himself as much as to comfort her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Innocence  can dare all things,&rdquo; said Lambert, positively.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    A Friend In Need</b></h2>
  <p>It  was natural that Lambert should talk of having Silver arrested, as in the first  flush of indignation at his audacious attempt to levy blackmail, this appeared  the most reasonable thing to do. But when Agnes went back to The Manor, and the  sick man was left alone to struggle through a long and weary night, the  reaction suggested a more cautious dealing with the matter. Silver was a  venomous little reptile, and if brought before a magistrate would probably  produce the letter which he offered for sale at so ridiculous a price. If this  was made public, Agnes would find herself in an extremely unpleasant position.  Certainly the letter was forged, but that would not be easy to prove. And even  if it were proved and Agnes cleared her character, the necessary scandal  connected with the publicity of such a defence would be both distressing and  painful. In wishing to silence Silver, and yet avoid the interference of the  police, Lambert found himself on the horns of a dilemma.</p>
  <p>Having  readjusted the situation in his own mind, Lambert next day wrote a lengthy  letter to Agnes, setting forth his objections to drastic measures. He informed  her&mdash;not quite truthfully&mdash;that he hoped to be on his feet in twenty-four hours,  and then would personally attend to the matter, although he could not say as  yet what he intended to do. But five out of the seven days of grace allowed by  the blackmailer yet remained, and much could be done in that time. &ldquo;Return to  town and attend to your own and to your brother&rsquo;s affairs as usual,&rdquo; concluded  the letter. &ldquo;All matters connected with Silver can be left in my hands, and  should he attempt to see you in the meantime, refer him to me.&rdquo; The epistle  ended with the intimation that Agnes was not to worry, as the writer would take  the whole burden on his own shoulders. The widow felt more cheerful after this  communication, and went back to her town house to act as her lover suggested.  She had every belief in Lambert&rsquo;s capability to deal with the matter.</p>
  <p>The  young man was more doubtful, for he could not see how he was to begin  unravelling this tangled skein. The interview with Chaldea had proved futile,  as she was plainly on the side of the enemy, and to apply to Silver for  information as to his intentions would merely result in a repetition of what he  had said to Lady Agnes. It only remained to lay the whole matter before  Inspector Darby, and Lambert was half inclined to go to Wanbury for this  purpose. He did not, however, undertake the journey, for two reasons. Firstly,  he wished to avoid asking for official assistance until absolutely forced to do  so; and secondly, he was too ill to leave the cottage. The worry he felt  regarding Agnes&rsquo;s perilous position told on an already weakened frame, and the  invalid grew worse instead of better.</p>
  <p>Finally,  Lambert decided to risk a journey to the camp, which was not so very far  distant, and interview Mother Cockleshell. The old lady had no great love for  Chaldea, who flouted her authority, and would not, therefore, be very kindly  disposed towards the girl. The young man believed, in some vague way, that  Chaldea had originated the conspiracy which had to do with the letter, and was  carrying her underhand plans to a conclusion with the aid of Silver. Mother  Cockleshell, who was very shrewd, might have learned or guessed the girl&rsquo;s  rascality, and would assuredly thwart her aims if possible. Also the  gypsy-queen would probably know a great deal about Pine in his character of  Ishmael Hearne, since she had been acquainted with him intimately during the  early part of his life. But, whatever she knew, or whatever she did not know,  Lambert considered that it would be wise to enlist her on his side, as the mere  fact that Chaldea was one of the opposite party would make her fight like a  wild cat. And as the whole affair had to do with the gypsies, and as Gentilla  Stanley was a gypsy, it was just as well to apply for her assistance.  Nevertheless, Lambert was quite in the dark, as to what assistance could be  rendered.</p>
  <p>In  this way the young man made his plans, only to be thwarted by the weakness of  his body. He could crawl out of bed and sit before the fire, but in spite of  all his will-power, he could not crawl as far as the camp. Baffled in this way,  he decided to send a note asking Mother Cockleshell to call on him, although he  knew that if Chaldea learned about the visit&mdash;which she was almost certain to  do&mdash;she would be placed on her guard. But this had to be risked, and Lambert,  moreover, believed that the old woman was quite equal to dealing with the girl.  However, Fate took the matter out of his hands, and before he could even write  the invitation, a visitor arrived in the person of Miss Greeby, who suggested a  way out of the difficulty, by offering her services. Matters came to a head  within half an hour of her presenting herself in the sitting-room.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby was quite her old breezy, masculine self, and her presence in the  cottage was like a breath of moorland air blowing through the languid  atmosphere of a hot-house. She was arrayed characteristically in a  short-skirted, tailor-made gown of a brown hue and bound with brown leather,  and wore in addition a man&rsquo;s cap, dog-skin gloves, and heavy laced-up boots fit  to tramp miry country roads. With her fresh complexion and red hair, and a  large frame instinct with vitality, she looked aggressively healthy, and  Lambert with his failing life felt quite a weakling beside this magnificent  goddess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo,  old fellow,&rdquo; cried Miss Greeby in her best man-to-man style, &ldquo;feeling chippy?  Why, you do look a wreck, I must say. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fever&rsquo;s up and I&rsquo;m down,&rdquo; replied Lambert, who was glad to see her, if only to  distract his painful thoughts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a touch of malaria, my dear Clara. I  shall be all right in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  hopeful, I must say, Lambert. What about a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t need one. Mrs. Tribb is nursing me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coddling  you,&rdquo; muttered Miss Greeby, planting herself manfully in an opposite chair and  crossing her legs in a gentlemanly manner. &ldquo;Fresh air and exercise, beefsteaks  and tankards of beer are what you need. Defy Nature and you get the better of  her. Kill or cure is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I have strong reasons to remain alive, I shan&rsquo;t adopt your prescription, Dr.  Greeby,&rdquo; said Lambert, dryly. &ldquo;What are you doing in these parts? I thought you  were shooting in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I was,&rdquo; admitted the visitor, frankly and laying her bludgeon&mdash;she still carried  it&mdash;across her knee. &ldquo;But I grew sick of the sport. Knocked over the birds too  easy, Lambert, so there was no fun. The birds are getting as silly as the men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  women knock them over easy enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I mean,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, vigorously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten world, this, unless  one can get away into the wilds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you go there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  Miss Greeby leaned forward with her elbows on her knees, and dandled the  bludgeon with both hands. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d like a change from the rough and  ready. This case of Pine&rsquo;s rather puzzled me, and so I&rsquo;m on the trail as a  detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  was rather startled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s considerably out of your line, Clara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby nodded. &ldquo;Exactly, and so I&rsquo;m indulging in the novelty. One must do  something to entertain one&rsquo;s self, you know, Lambert. It struck me that the  gypsies know a lot more about the matter than they chose to say, so I came down  yesterday, and put up at the Garvington Arms in the village. Here I&rsquo;m going to  stay until I can get at the root of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  root?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to learn who murdered Pine, poor devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  Lambert smiled. &ldquo;You wish to gain the reward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me. I&rsquo;ve got more money than I know what to do with, as it is. Silver is more  anxious to get the cash than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver!  Have you seen him lately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  couple of days ago,&rdquo; Miss Greeby informed him easily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my secretary now,  Lambert. Yes! The poor beast was chucked out of his comfortable billet by the  death of Pine, and hearing that I wanted some one to write my letters and run  my errands, and act like a tame cat generally, he applied to me. Since I knew  him pretty well through Pine, I took him on. He&rsquo;s a cunning little fox, but all  right when he&rsquo;s kept in order. And I find him pretty useful, although I&rsquo;ve only  had him as a secretary for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  did not immediately reply. The news rather amazed him, as it had always been Miss  Greeby&rsquo;s boast that she could manage her own business. It was queer that she  should have changed her mind in this respect, although she was woman enough to  exercise that very feminine prerogative. But the immediate trend of Lambert&rsquo;s  thoughts were in the direction of seeking aid from his visitor. He could not  act himself because he was sick, and he knew that she was a capable person in  dealing with difficulties. Also, simply for the sake of something to do she had  become an amateur detective and was hunting for the trail of Pine&rsquo;s assassin.  It seemed to Lambert that it would not be a bad idea to tell her of his  troubles. She would, as he knew, be only too willing to assist, and in that  readiness lay his hesitation. He did not wish, if possible, to lie under any  obligation to Miss Greeby lest she should demand in payment that he should  become her husband. And yet he believed that by this time she had overcome her  desires in this direction. To make sure, he ventured on a few cautious  questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  friends, aren&rsquo;t we, Clara?&rdquo; he asked, after a long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby, nodding heartily. &ldquo;Does it need putting into words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose not, but what I mean is that we are pals.&rdquo; He used the word which he  knew most appealed to her masculine affectations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby again, and once more heartily. &ldquo;Real, honest pals. I never  believed in that stuff about the impossibility of a man and woman being pals  unless there&rsquo;s love rubbish about the business. At one time, Lambert, I don&rsquo;t  deny but what I had a feeling of that sort for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now?&rdquo; questioned the young man with an uneasy smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  it&rsquo;s gone, or rather my love has become affection, and that&rsquo;s quite a different  thing, old fellow. I want to see you happy, and you aren&rsquo;t now. I daresay you&rsquo;re  still crying for the moon. Eh?&rdquo; she looked at him sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  asked me that before when you came here,&rdquo; said Lambert, slowly. &ldquo;And I refused  to answer. I can answer now. The moon is quite beyond my reach, so I have dried  my tears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby, who was lighting a cigarette, threw away the match and stared hard at  his haggard face. &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t expect to hear that, now we know how the  moon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  things by their right name,&rdquo; interrupted Lambert, sharply. &ldquo;Agnes is now a  widow, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is, if you call Agnes a thing. Of course, you&rsquo;ll marry her since the barrier  has been removed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  Pine? No! I&rsquo;m not certain on that point. She is a rich widow and I&rsquo;m a poor  artist. In honor bound I can&rsquo;t allow her to lose her money by becoming my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby stared at the fire. &ldquo;I heard about that beastly will,&rdquo; she said,  frowning. &ldquo;Horribly unfair, I call it. Still, I believed that you loved the  moon&mdash;well, then, Agnes, since you wish us to be plain&mdash;and would carry her off  if you had the pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never been accused of not having pluck, Clara. But there&rsquo;s another thing  to be considered, and that&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bosh!&rdquo; cried Miss Greeby, with boyish vigor. &ldquo;You love her and she loves you,  so why not marry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not worth paying two million for, Clara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are, if she loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does and would marry me to-morrow if I would let her. The hesitation is on my  part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  fool you. If I were in her position I&rsquo;d soon overcome your scruples.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; said Lambert delicately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think so,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;A woman always gets her own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  sometimes wrecks continents to get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  wreck this one, anyhow,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby dryly. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;re pals, and if  there&rsquo;s anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  there is,&rdquo; said Lambert abruptly, and making up his mind to trust her, since  she showed plainly that there was no chance of love on her part destroying  friendship. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick here and can&rsquo;t move. Let me engage you to act on my  behalf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  what, if you don&rsquo;t mind my asking, Lambert?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  what you are for the moment, a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby in a guttural manner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to learn on my behalf, and as my deputy, who murdered Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that you can marry Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The will has stopped my chances in that direction. Her two million forms quite  an insurmountable barrier between us now, as the fact of her being Pine&rsquo;s wife  did formerly. Now you understand the situation, and that I am prevented by  honor from making her my wife, don&rsquo;t let us talk any more on that especial  subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  you are,&rdquo; assented Miss Greeby affably. &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;ll say this, that you are too  scrupulous, and if I can help you to marry Agnes I shall do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  demanded Lambert bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I&rsquo;m your pal and wish to see you happy. You won&rsquo;t be happy, like the Pears soap  advertisement, until you get it. Agnes is the &lsquo;it.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, leave the matter alone, Clara,&rdquo; said Lambert, taking the privilege of an  invalid and becoming peevish. &ldquo;As things stand, I can see no chance of marrying  Agnes without violating my idea of honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why do you wish me to help you?&rdquo; demanded Miss Greeby sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I wish you to help me, you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I know what you wish me to do; act as detective; I know about it, my  dear boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Lambert, again fractious. &ldquo;But if you listen I&rsquo;ll tell you  exactly what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby made herself comfortable with a fresh cigarette, and nodded in an easy  manner, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all attention, old boy. Fire away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must regard my confidence as sacred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  my hand on it. But I should like to know why you desire to learn who murdered  Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  if you don&rsquo;t track down the assassin, Agnes will get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;  ejaculated Miss Greeby, guttural again. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  wasted no further time in preliminary explanations, but plunged into the middle  of things. In a quarter of an hour his auditor was acquainted with the facts of  a highly unpleasant case, but exhibited no surprise when she heard what her  secretary had to do with the matter. In fact, she rather appeared to admire his  acuteness in turning such shady knowledge to his own advantage. At the same  time, she considered that Agnes had behaved in a decidedly weak manner. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d  been in her shoes I&rsquo;d have fired the beast out in double-quick time,&rdquo; said Miss  Greeby grimly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have belted him over the head in addition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he would have gone straight to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no he wouldn&rsquo;t. One thousand reward against twenty-five thousand blackmail isn&rsquo;t  good enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t get his blackmail,&rdquo; said Lambert, tightening his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet he won&rsquo;t now that I&rsquo;ve come into the matter. But there&rsquo;s no denying he&rsquo;s  got the whip-hand so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes  never wrote the letter,&rdquo; said Lambert quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that goes without the saying, my dear fellow. Agnes knew that if she became a  rich widow, your uneasy sense of honor would never let you marry her. She had  no reason to get rid of Pine on that score.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  on any score, you may add.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby nodded. &ldquo;Certainly! You and Agnes should have got married and let  Garvington get out of his troubles as best he could. That&rsquo;s what I should have  done, as I&rsquo;m not an aristocrat, and can&rsquo;t see the use of becoming the sacrifice  for a musty, fusty old family. However, Agnes made her bargain and kept to it.  She&rsquo;s all right, although other people may be not of that opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  isn&rsquo;t a man or woman who dare say a word against Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good many will say lots of words, should what you have told me get into print,&rdquo;  rejoined Miss Greeby dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you. Therefore do I ask for your assistance. What is best to be  done, Clara?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get the letter from Silver and learn who forged it. Once that is made  plain, the truth will come to light, since the individual who forged and sent  that letter must have fired the second shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. But Silver won&rsquo;t give up the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, he will. He&rsquo;s my secretary, and I&rsquo;ll make him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  as your secretary he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lambert, dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  see about that, old boy. I&rsquo;ll heckle and harry and worry Silver on to the  gallows if he doesn&rsquo;t do what he&rsquo;s told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gallows. You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think nothing. It was to Silver&rsquo;s interest that Pine should live, so I don&rsquo;t  fancy he set the trap. It was to Chaldea&rsquo;s interest that Pine should not live,  since she loves you, and I don&rsquo;t think she is to blame. Garvington couldn&rsquo;t  have done it, as he has lost a good friend in Pine, and&mdash;and&mdash;go on Lambert,  suggest some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t. And two out of three you mention were inside The Manor when the second  shot was fired, so can prove an alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not bothering about who fired the second shot,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby leisurely, &ldquo;but  as to who wrote that letter. Once we find the forger, we&rsquo;ll soon discover the  assassin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True;  but how are you going about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall see Silver and force him to give me the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll manage somehow. The little beast&rsquo;s a coward, and I&rsquo;ll bully him into  compliance.&rdquo; Miss Greeby spoke very confidently. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll see the kind of  paper the letter is written on, and there may be an envelope which would show  where it was posted. Of course, the forger must be well acquainted with Agnes&rsquo;s  handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  obvious,&rdquo; said Lambert promptly. &ldquo;Well, I suppose that your way of starting the  matter is the best. But we have only four days before Silver makes his move.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I get the letter he won&rsquo;t make any move,&rdquo; reported Miss Greeby, and she looked  very determined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hope so. But, Clara, before you return to town I wish you would see Mother  Cockleshell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  old gypsy fortune-teller, who looks like an almshouse widow? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hates Chaldea, and I suspect that Chaldea has something to do with the matter  of this conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  Miss Greeby rubbed her aquiline nose. &ldquo;A conspiracy. Perhaps you may be right.  But its reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  colored. &ldquo;Chaldea wants me to marry her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  minx! I know she does. I warned you against having her to sit for you, Lambert.  But there&rsquo;s no sense in your suggestion, my boy. It wasn&rsquo;t any catch for her to  get Pine killed and leave his wife free to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;hang it,&rdquo; the young man clutched his hair in desperation and  glared at the fire, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  can I. Unless it is to be found in the City.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gypsies  are more lawless than City men,&rdquo; observed the other quickly, &ldquo;and Hearne would  have enemies rather than Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, rising and getting ready to go away. &ldquo;Hearne  was nobody: Pine was a millionaire. Successful men have enemies all over the  shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the inquest it was said that Pine had no enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  rubbish. A strong man like that couldn&rsquo;t make such a fortune without exciting  envy. I&rsquo;ll bet that his assassin is to be found in a frock coat and a silk hat.  However, I&rsquo;ll look up Mother Cockleshell, as it is just as well to know what  she thinks of this pretty gypsy hussy of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  of mine. I don&rsquo;t care for her in the least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if that mattered. There is always one who loves and one who is loved, as Heine  says, and that is the cause of all life&rsquo;s tragedies. Of this tragedy maybe,  although I think some envious stockbroker may have shot Pine as a too  successful financial rival. However, we shall see about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  see about another thing, Clara,&rdquo; said Lambert quickly. &ldquo;Call on Agnes and tell  her that she need not worry over Silver. She expects the Deluge in a few days,  remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Write  and tell her that I have the case in hand and that she needn&rsquo;t trouble about  Silver. I&rsquo;ll straighten him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear you are too hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t fear anything of the sort. I&rsquo;ll break his neck if he doesn&rsquo;t obey me. I  wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to do it, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  ran his eyes over her masculine personality and laughed. &ldquo;I quite believe that,  Clara. But, I say, won&rsquo;t you have some tea before you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks. I don&rsquo;t eat between meals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afternoon  tea is a meal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  It&rsquo;s a weakness. I&rsquo;m not Garvington. By the way, where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Paris, but he returns in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t let him meddle with this matter, or he&rsquo;ll put things wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall allow no one but yourself to meddle, Clara, Garvington shan&rsquo;t know a  single thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby nodded. &ldquo;Right. All we wish kept quiet would be in the papers if  Garvington gets hold of our secrets. He&rsquo;s a loose-tongued little glutton. Well,  good-bye, old chap, and do look after yourself. Good people are scarce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  gripped her large hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully obliged to you, Clara.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  until I do something before you say that, old son,&rdquo; she laughed and strode  towards the door. &ldquo;By the way, oughtn&rsquo;t I to send the doctor in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Confound the doctor! I&rsquo;m all right. You&rsquo;ll see me on my legs in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we can work together at the case. Keep your flag flying, old chap, for I&rsquo;m at  the helm to steer the bark.&rdquo; And with this nautical farewell she went off with  a manly stride, whistling a gay tune.</p>
  <p>Left  alone, the invalid looked into the fire, and wondered if he had been right to  trust her. After some thought, he concluded that it was the best thing he could  have done, since, in his present helpless state, he needed some one to act as  his deputy. And there was no doubt that Miss Greeby had entirely overcome the  passion she had once entertained for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope Agnes will think so also,&rdquo; thought Lambert, when he began a letter to the  lady. &ldquo;She was always rather doubtful of Clara.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    Miss Greeby, Detective</b></h2>
  <p>As  Miss Greeby had informed Lambert, she intended to remain at the Garvington Arms  until the mystery of Pine&rsquo;s death was solved. But her interview with him  necessitated a rearrangement of plans, since the incriminating letter appeared  to be such an important piece of evidence. To obtain it, Miss Greeby had  decided to return to London forthwith, in order to compel its surrender. Silver  would undoubtedly show fight, but his mistress was grimly satisfied that she  would be able to manage him, and quite counted upon gaining her end by bullying  him into compliance. When in possession of the letter she decided to submit it  to Agnes and hear what that lady had to say about it as a dexterous piece of  forgery. Then, on what was said would depend her next move in the complicated  game. Meanwhile, since she was on the spot and desired to gather all possible  evidence connected with Chaldea&rsquo;s apparent knowledge of the crime, Miss Greeby  went straight from Lambert&rsquo;s cottage to the gypsy camp.</p>
  <p>Here  she found the community of vagrants in the throes of an election, or rather  their excitement was connected with the deposition of Gentilla Stanley from the  Bohemian throne, and the elevation of Chaldea. Miss Greeby mixed with the  throng, dispensed a few judicious shillings and speedily became aware of what  was going on. It appeared that Chaldea, being pretty and unscrupulous, and  having gained, by cunning, a wonderful influence amongst the younger members of  the tribe, was insisting that she should be elected its head. The older men and  women, believing wisely that it was better to have an experienced ruler than a  pretty figurehead, stood by Mother Cockleshell, therefore the camp was divided  into two parties. Tongues were used freely, and occasionally fists came into  play, while the gypsies gathered round the tent of the old woman and listened  to the duet between her and the younger aspirant to this throne of Brentford.  Miss Greeby, with crossed legs and leaning on her bludgeon, listened to the  voluble speech of Mother Cockleshell, which was occasionally interrupted by  Chaldea. The oration was delivered in Romany, and Miss Greeby only understood  such scraps of it as was hastily translated to her by a wild-eyed girl to whom  she had given a shilling. Gentilla, less like a sober pew-opener, and more  resembling the Hecate of some witch-gathering, screamed objurgations at the  pitch of her crocked voice, and waved her skinny arms to emphasize her words,  in a most dramatic fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ye Romans,&rdquo; she screeched vehemently, &ldquo;are ye not fools to be gulled by a babe  with her mother&rsquo;s milk&mdash;and curses that it fed her&mdash;scarcely dry on her living  lips? Who am I who speak, asses of the common? Gentilla Stanley, whose father was  Pharaoh before her, and who can call up the ghosts of dead Egyptian kings, with  a tent for a palace, and a cudgel for a sceptre, and the wisdom of our people  at the service of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things  have changed,&rdquo; cried out Chaldea with a mocking laugh. &ldquo;For old wisdom is dead  leaves, and I am the tree which puts forth the green of new truths to make the  Gorgios take off their hats to the Romans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  spawn of the old devil, but you lie. Truth is truth and changes not. Can you  read the hand? can you cheat the Gentile? do you know the law of the Poknees,  and can you diddle them as has money? Says you, &lsquo;I can!&rsquo; And in that you lie,  like your mother before you. Bless your wisdom&rdquo;&mdash;Mother Cockleshell made an  ironical curtsey. &ldquo;Age must bow before a brat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beauty  draws money to the Romans, and wheedles the Gorgios to part with red gold.  Wrinkles you have, mother, and weak wits to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weak  wits, you drab? My weakest wits are your strongest. &lsquo;Wrinkles,&rsquo; says you in  your cunning way, and flaunts your brazen smoothness. I spit on you for a fool.&rdquo;  The old woman suited her action to the word. &ldquo;Every wrinkle is the mark of  lessons learned, and them is wisdom which the Romans take from my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear  the witchly hag,&rdquo; cried Chaldea in her turn. &ldquo;She and her musty wisdom that puts  the Romans under the feet of the Gentiles. Are not three of our brothers in  choky? have we not been turned off common and out of field? Isn&rsquo;t the fire low  and the pot empty, and every purse without gold? Bad luck she has brought us,&rdquo;  snarled the girl, pointing an accusing finger. &ldquo;And bad luck we Romans will  have till she is turned from the camp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  a dog you would send me away,&rdquo; shrieked Mother Cockleshell, glancing round and  seeing that Chaldea&rsquo;s supporters outnumbered her own. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m dangerous, and  go I shall as a queen should, at my own free will. I cast a shoe amongst you,&rdquo;&mdash;she  flung one of her own, hastily snatched off her foot&mdash;&ldquo;and curses gather round  it. Under its heels shall you lie, ye Romans, till time again and time once  more be accomplished. I go on my own,&rdquo; she turned and walked to the door of her  tent. &ldquo;Alone I go to cheat the Gentiles and win my food. Take your new queen,  and with her sorrow and starvation, prison, and the kicks of the Gorgios. So it  is, as I have said, and so it shall be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  vanished into the tent, and the older members of the tribe, shaking their heads  over the ill-omen of her concluding words, withdrew sorrowfully to their  various habitations, in order to discuss the situation. But the young men and  women bowed down before Chaldea and forthwith elected her their ruler, fawning  on her, kissing her hands and invoking blessings on her pretty face, that face  which they hoped and believed would bring prosperity to them. And there was no  doubt that of late, under Mother Cockleshell&rsquo;s leadership, the tribe had been  unfortunate in many ways. It was for this reason that Chaldea had raised the  standard of rebellion, and for this reason also she gained her triumph. To  celebrate her coronation she gave Kara, who hovered constantly at her elbow, a  couple of sovereigns, and told him to buy food and drink. In a high state of  enjoyment the gypsies dispersed in order to prepare for the forthcoming  festivity, and Chaldea, weary but victorious, stood alone by the steps of the  caravan, which was her perambulating home. Seizing her opportunity, Miss Greeby  approached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  congratulations to your majesty,&rdquo; she said ironically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry not to be  able to stay for your coronation, which I presume takes place to-night. But I  have to go back to London to see a friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no friends, my Gentile lady,&rdquo; retorted Chaldea, with a fiery spark in each  eye. &ldquo;And what do you here amongst the gentle Romany?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentle,&rdquo;  Miss Greeby chuckled, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a new word for the row that&rsquo;s been going on, my  girl. Do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I know the road and the tent and the art of dukkerhin. You stay at the big  house, and you love the rye who lived in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  clever of you to guess that,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby coolly, &ldquo;but as it happens, you  are wrong. The rye is not for me and not for you. He marries the lady he  worships on his knees. Forgive me for speaking in this high-flowing manner,&rdquo;  ended Miss Greeby apologetically, &ldquo;but in romantic situations one must speak  romantic words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  did not pay attention to the greater part of this speech, as only one statement  appealed to her. &ldquo;The rye shall not marry the Gentile lady,&rdquo; she said between  her white teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think so, Chaldea. Your plotting has all been in vain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  plotting. What do you know of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  certain portion, my girl, and I&rsquo;m going to know more when I see Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  frowned darkly. &ldquo;I know nothing of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you do, since you gave him a certain letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Patchessa  tu adove?&rdquo; asked Chaldea scornfully; then, seeing that her visitor did not  understand her, explained: &ldquo;Do you believe in that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby alertly. &ldquo;You found the letter in Pine&rsquo;s tent when he was  camping here as Hearne, and passed it to Silver so that he might ask money for  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie. I swear it&rsquo;s a lie. I ask no money. I told the tiny rye&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver,  I presume,&rdquo; put in Miss Greeby carelessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye:  Silver is his name, and a good one for him as has no gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will get gold from Lady Agnes for the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Drodi&mdash;ah bah!&rdquo; broke off Chaldea. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand Romanes. I speak the  Gorgio tongue to such as you. Listen! I found the letter which lured my brother  to his death. The rani wrote that letter, and I gave it to the tiny rye,  saying: &lsquo;Tell her if she gives up the big rye free she shall go; if not take  the letter to those who deal in the law.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police, I suppose you mean,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby coolly. &ldquo;A very pretty scheme, my  good girl. But it won&rsquo;t do, you know. Lady Agnes never wrote that letter, and  had nothing to do with the death of her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  set a trap for him,&rdquo; cried Chaldea fiercely, &ldquo;and Hearne walked into it like a  rabbit into a snare. The big rye waited outside and shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Greeby just as fiercely, and determined to defend her  friend. &ldquo;He would not do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  but I can prove it, and will when the time is ripe. He becomes my rom does the  big rye, or round his neck goes the rope; and she dances long-side, I swear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a bloodthirsty idea, you savage devil! And how do you propose to prove that Mr.  Lambert shot the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo;  sneered Chaldea contemptuously, &ldquo;you take me for a fool, saying more than I can  do. But know this, my precious angel&rdquo;&mdash;she fumbled in her pocket and brought out  a more or less formless piece of lead&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s this, may I ask? The bullet which  passed through Hearne&rsquo;s heart, and buried itself in a tree-trunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby made a snatch at the article, but Chaldea was too quick for her and  slipped it again into her pocket. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove that it is the bullet,&rdquo;  snapped Miss Greeby glaring, for she dreaded lest its production should  incriminate Lambert, innocent though she believed him to be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kara  can prove it. He went to where Hearne was shot and saw that there was a big  tree by the blue door, and before the shrubbery. A shot fired from behind the  bushes would by chance strike the tree. The bullet which killed my brother was  not found in the heart. It passed through and was in the tree-trunk. Kara  knifed it out and brought it to me. If this,&rdquo; Chaldea held up the bullet again  jeeringly, &ldquo;fits the pistol of the big rye he will swing for sure. The letter  hangs her and the bullet hangs him. I want my price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t get it, then,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, eyeing the pocket into which the girl  had again dropped the bullet. &ldquo;Mr. Lambert was absent in London on that night.  I heard that by chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you heard wrong, my Gentile lady. Avali, quite wrong. The big rye returned on  that very night and went to Lundra again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  if he did,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby desperately, &ldquo;he did not leave the cottage. His  housekeeper can prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  snapped Chaldea triumphantly. &ldquo;She was in her bed and the golden rye was in his  bed. My brother was killed after midnight, and if the rye took a walk then, who  can say where he was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have to prove all this, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea  snapped her fingers. &ldquo;First, the letter to shame her; then the bullet to hang  him. The rest comes after. My price, you know, my Gorgious artful. I toves my  own gad. It&rsquo;s a good proverb, lady, and true Romany.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wash my own shirt,&rdquo; said Chaldea, significantly, and sprang up the steps of her  gaily-painted caravan to shut herself in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a fool I am not to take that bullet from her,&rdquo; thought Miss Greeby, standing  irresolutely before the vehicle, and she cast a glance around to see if such an  idea was feasible. It was not, as she speedily decided, for a single cry from  Chaldea would bring the gypsies round to protect their new queen. It was  probable also that the girl would fight like a wild cat; although Miss Greeby  felt that she could manage her so far. But she was not equal to fighting the  whole camp of vagrants, and so was compelled to abandon her scheme. In a  somewhat discontented mood, she turned away, feeling that, so far, Chaldea had  the whip-hand.</p>
  <p>Then  it occurred to her that she had not yet examined Mother Cockleshell as had been  her original intention when she came to the camp. Forthwith she passed back to  the tent under the elm, to interview the deposed queen. Here, she found  Gentilla Stanley placing her goods in an untidy bundle on the back of a large  gray donkey, which was her private property. The old creature&rsquo;s eyes were red  with weeping and her gray hair had fallen down, so that she presented a  somewhat wild appearance. This, in connection with her employment, reminded  Miss Greeby&mdash;whose reading was wide&mdash;of a similar scene in Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;  when Mrs. Pentulengro&rsquo;s mother shifted herself. And for the moment Mother  Cockleshell had just the hairy looks of Mrs. Hern, and also at the moment,  probably had the same amiable feelings.</p>
  <p>Feeling  that the old woman detested her successful rival, Miss Greeby approached,  guessing that now was the right moment to work on her mind, and thus to learn  what she could of Chaldea&rsquo;s underhand doings. She quite expected a snub, as  Gentilla could scarcely be expected to answer questions when taken up with her  own troubles. But the artful creature, seeing by a side-glance that Miss Greeby  was a wealthy Gentile lady, dropped one of her almshouse curtseys when she  approached, and bundled up her hair. A change passed over her withered face,  and Miss Greeby found herself addressing not so much a fallen queen, as a  respectable old woman who had known better days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a blessing on your sweet face, my angel,&rdquo; mumbled Mother Cockleshell. &ldquo;For a  heart you have to feel for my sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is a sign of my feelings,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, handing over a sovereign, for she  rightly judged that the gypsy would only appreciate this outward symbol of sympathy.  &ldquo;Now, what do you know of Pine&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell, who was busy tying up the sovereign in a corner of her respectable  shawl, after biting it to make sure it was current gold, looked up with a  vacant expression. &ldquo;Murder, my lady, and what should I know of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby looked at her straightly. &ldquo;What does Chaldea know of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  vicious pair of devils looked out of the decent widow&rsquo;s eyes in a moment, and  at once she became the Romany. &ldquo;Hai! She knows, does she, the drab! I hope to see  her hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  killing of Hearne, may his bones rest sweetly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby suppressed an exclamation. &ldquo;She accuses Lady Agnes of laying a trap by  writing a letter, and says that Mr. Lambert fired the shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali!  Avali!&rdquo; Mother Cockleshell nodded vigorously, but did not interrupt her  preparations for departure. &ldquo;That she would say, since she loves the Gorgio,  and hates the rani. A rope round her neck to set the rye free to make  Chaldea&mdash;my curses on her&mdash;his true wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  couldn&rsquo;t have fired the shot herself, you know,&rdquo; went on Miss Greeby in a  musing manner. &ldquo;For then she would remove an obstacle to Mr. Lambert marrying  Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blessings  on her for a kind, Gentile lady,&rdquo; said Gentilla, piously, and looking more  respectable than ever, since the lurking devils had disappeared. &ldquo;But Chaldea  is artful, and knows the rye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  my lady. Hearne, who was the Gorgio Pine, had the angel to wife, but he did not  hope to live long because of illness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby nodded. &ldquo;Consumption, Pine told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he had died natural,&rdquo; pursued Mother Cockleshell, pulling hard at a strap, &ldquo;maybe  the Gentile lady would have married the golden rye, whom she loves. But by the  violent death, Chaldea has tangled up both in her knots, and if they wed she  will make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she says. But can she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai!  But she&rsquo;s a deep one, ma&rsquo;am, believe me when I say so,&rdquo; Mother Cockleshell  nodded sapiently. &ldquo;But foolish trouble has she given herself, when the death of  Hearne natural, or by the pistol-shot would stop the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Miss Greeby once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  Gentiles are fools,&rdquo; said Gentilla, politely. &ldquo;For you put other things before  true love. Hearne, as Pine, had much gold, and that he left to his wife should  she not marry the golden rye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea  was told so by the dead, and told me, my lady. Now the angel of the big house  would give up the gold to marry the rye, for her heart is all for him. &lsquo;But,&rsquo;  says he, and tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong. Says he, &lsquo;No. If I make you my romi that  would beggar you and fair it would not be, for a Romany rye to do!&rsquo; So, my  lady, the red gold parts them, because it&rsquo;s red money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Red  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood  money. The taint of blood is on the wealth of the dead one, and so it divides  by a curse the true hearts of the living. You see, my lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby did see, and the more readily, since she had heard Lambert express  exactly the sentiments with which the old gypsy credited him. An overstrained  feeling of honor prevented him in any case from making Agnes his wife, whether  the death had come by violence or by natural causes. But it was amazing that  Gentilla should know this, and Miss Greeby wonderingly asked her how she came  by such knowledge. The respectable widow chuckled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have witchly ways, ma&rsquo;am, and the golden rye has talked many a time to me in my  tent, when I told him of the Gorgious lady&rsquo;s goodness to me when ill. They  love&mdash;aye, that is sure&mdash;but the money divides their hearts, and that is foolish.  Chaldea had no need to shoot to keep them apart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know she shot Pine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can say nothing the Poknees would listen to,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell  readily. &ldquo;For I speak only as I think, and not as I know. But the child was  impatient for joy, and hoped by placing the cruel will between true hearts to  gain that of the golden rye for her own part. But that she will not. Ha! Ha!  Nor you, my lady, nor you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;  Miss Greeby colored even redder than she was by nature.</p>
  <p>Gentilla  looked at her shrewdly. &ldquo;La! La! La! La!&rdquo; she croaked. &ldquo;Age brings a mighty  wisdom. They were fools to throw me out,&rdquo; and she jerked her grizzled head in  the direction of the caravans and tents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk rubbish, you old donkey! Mr. Lambert is only my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a woman and he&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell sententiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are chums, pals, whatever you like to call us. I want to see him happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will never be happy, my lady, unless he marries the rani. And death, by  bringing the money between their true love, has divided them forever, unless  the golden rye puts his heart before his fear of silly chatter for them he  moves amongst. The child was right to shoot Hearne, so far, although she could  have waited and gained the same end. The rye is free to marry her, or to marry  you, ma&rsquo;am, but never to marry the angel, unless&mdash;&rdquo; Mother Cockleshell adjusted  the bundle carefully on the donkey, and then cut a long switch from the tree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to marry Mr. Lambert,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby decisively. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take  care that Chaldea doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gentilla  chuckled again. &ldquo;Oh, trust you for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to Chaldea shooting Pine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  it to me, leave it to me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the old gypsy with a grandiloquent wave  of her dirty hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I wish to learn the truth and save Lady Agnes from this trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish to save her?&rdquo; chuckled Mother Cockleshell. &ldquo;And not the golden rye? Ah  well, my angel, there are women, and women.&rdquo; She faced round, and the humor  died out of her wrinkled face. &ldquo;You wish for help and so have come to see me?  Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Miss Greeby tartly. &ldquo;Chaldea will make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child won&rsquo;t. I can manage her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby hitched up her broad shoulders contemptuously. &ldquo;She has managed you just  now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are ways and ways, and when the hour arrives, the sun rises to scatter the  darkness,&rdquo; said Gentilla mystically. &ldquo;Let the child win for the moment, for my  turn comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know something?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  I know mustn&rsquo;t be said till the hour strikes. But content yourself, my Gorgious  lady, with knowing that the child will make no trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has parted with the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of that letter. Hearne showed it to me, and would make for the big house,  although I told him fair not to doubt his true wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did he get the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  tellings,&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell with a wink of her lively eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  a good mind to take you to the police, and then you&rsquo;d be forced to say what you  know,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby crossly, for the vague hints irritated her not a  little.</p>
  <p>The  old woman cackled in evident enjoyment. &ldquo;Do that, and the pot will boil over,  ma&rsquo;am. I wish to help the angel rani who nursed me when I was sick, and I have  debts to pay to Chaldea. Both I do in my own witchly way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will help me to learn the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely!  Surely! my Gorgious one. And now,&rdquo; Mother Cockleshell gave a tug at the donkey&rsquo;s  mouth, &ldquo;I goes my ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  where can I find you again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the time comes the mouth will open, and them as thinks they&rsquo;re high will find  themselves in the dust. Aye, and maybe lower, if six feet of good earth lies atop,  and them burning in lime, uncoffined and unblessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby was masculine and fearless, but there was something so weird about this  mystic sentence, which hinted at capital punishment, that she shrank back  nervously. Mother Cockleshell, delighted to see that she had made an  impression, climbed on to the gray donkey and made a progress through the camp.  Passing by Chaldea&rsquo;s caravan she spat on it and muttered a word or so, which  did not indicate that she wished a blessing to rest on it. Chaldea did not show  herself, so the deposed queen was accompanied to the outskirts of the wood by  the elder gypsies, mourning loudly. But when they finally halted to see the  last of Mother Cockleshell, she raised her hand and spoke authoritatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  go and I come, my children. Forget not, ye Romans, that I say so much. When the  seed needs rain it falls. Sarishan, brothers and sisters all.&rdquo; And with this  strange speech, mystical to the last, she rode away into the setting sun, on  the gray donkey, looking more like an almshouse widow than ever.</p>
  <p>As  for Miss Greeby, she strode out of the camp and out of the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, and  made for the Garvington Arms, where she had left her baggage. What Mother  Cockleshell knew, she did not guess; what Mother Cockleshell intended to do,  she could not think; but she was satisfied that Chaldea would in some way pay  for her triumph. And the downfall of the girl was evidently connected with the  unravelling of the murder mystery. In a witchly way, as the old woman would  have said herself, she intended to adjust matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  leave things so far in her hands,&rdquo; thought Miss Greeby. &ldquo;Now for Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Guesswork</b></h2>
  <p>Whether  Miss Greeby found a difficulty, as was probable, in getting Silver to hand over  the forged letter, or whether she had decided to leave the solution of this  mystery to Mother Cockleshell, it is impossible to say. But she certainly did  not put in an appearance at Lady Agnes Pine&rsquo;s town house to report progress  until after the new year. Nor in the meantime did she visit Lambert, although  she wrote to say that she induced the secretary to delay his threatened  exposure. The position of things was therefore highly unsatisfactory, since the  consequent suspense was painful both to Agnes and her lover. And of course the  widow had been duly informed of the interview at the cottage, and naturally  expected events to move more rapidly.</p>
  <p>However,  taking the wise advice of Isaiah to &ldquo;Make no haste in time of trouble,&rdquo; Agnes  possessed her soul in patience, and did not seek out Miss Greeby in any way,  either by visiting or by letter. She attended at her lawyers&rsquo; offices to  supervise her late husband&rsquo;s affairs, and had frequent consultations with  Garvington&rsquo;s solicitors in connection with the freeing of the Lambert estates.  Everything was going on very satisfactorily, even to the improvement of Lambert&rsquo;s  health, so Agnes was not at all so ill at ease in her mind as might have been  expected. Certainly the sword of Damocles still dangled over her head, and over  the head of Lambert, but a consciousness that they were both innocent, assured  her inwardly that it would not fall. Nevertheless the beginning of the new year  found her in anything but a placid frame of mind. She was greatly relieved when  Miss Greeby at last condescended to pay her a visit.</p>
  <p>Luckily  Agnes was alone when the lady arrived, as Garvington and his wife were both out  enjoying themselves in their several ways. The pair had been staying with the  wealthy widow for Christmas, and had not yet taken their departure, since  Garvington always tried to live at somebody&rsquo;s expense if possible. He had  naturally shut up The Manor during the festive season, as the villagers  expected coals and blankets and port wine and plum-puddings, which he had  neither the money nor the inclination to supply. In fact, the greedy little man  considered that they should ask for nothing and pay larger rents than they did.  By deserting them when peace on earth and goodwill to men prevailed, or ought  to have prevailed, he disappointed them greatly and chuckled over their  lamentations. Garvington was very human in some ways.</p>
  <p>However,  both the corpulent little lord and his untidy wife were out of the way when  Miss Greeby was announced, and Agnes was thankful that such was the case, since  the interview was bound to be an important one. Miss Greeby, as usual, looked  large and aggressively healthy, bouncing into the room like an india-rubber  ball. Her town dress differed very little from the garb she wore in the  country, save that she had a feather-trimmed hat instead of a man&rsquo;s cap, and  carried an umbrella in place of a bludgeon. A smile, which showed all her  strong white teeth in a somewhat carnivorous way, overspread her face as she  shook hands vigorously with her hostess. And Miss Greeby&rsquo;s grip was so friendly  as to be positively painful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  you are, Agnes, and here am I. Beastly day, ain&rsquo;t it? Rain and rain and rain  again. Seems as though we&rsquo;d gone back to Father Noah&rsquo;s times, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expected you before, Clara,&rdquo; remarked Lady Agnes rather hurriedly, and too full  of anxiety to discuss the weather.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I intended to come before,&rdquo; confessed Miss Greeby candidly. &ldquo;Only, one thing  and another prevented me!&rdquo; Agnes noticed that she did not specify the  hindrances. &ldquo;It was the deuce&rsquo;s own job to get that letter. Oh, by the way, I  suppose Lambert told you about the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Silver told me about it, and I told Noel,&rdquo; responded Agnes gravely. &ldquo;I also  heard about your interview with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s ages ago, long before Christmas. I should have gone and seen him, to tell  about my experiences at the gypsy camp, but I thought that I would learn more  before making my report as a detective. By the way, how is Lambert, do you  know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is all right now, and is in town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  his old rooms, I suppose. For how long? I want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  an indefinite period. Garvington has turned him out of the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce! What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Agnes, explaining reluctantly, &ldquo;you see Noel paid no rent, as Garvington  is his cousin, and when an offer came along offering a pound a week for the  place, Garvington said that he was too poor to refuse it. So Noel has taken a  small house in Kensington, and Mrs. Tribb has been installed as his  housekeeper. I wonder you didn&rsquo;t know these things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby, rather aggressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it is Mr. Silver who has taken the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby sat up alertly. &ldquo;Silver. Oh, indeed. Then that explains why he asked me  for leave to stay in the country. Said his health required fresh air, and that  London got on his nerves. Hum! hum!&rdquo; Miss Greeby bit the handle of her  umbrella. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s taken the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage, has he? I wonder what that&rsquo;s  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Agnes restlessly. &ldquo;Of course I could have  prevented Garvington letting it to him, since he tried to blackmail me, but I  thought it was best to see the letter, and to understand his meaning more  thoroughly before telling my brother about his impertinence. Noel wanted me to  tell, but I decided not to&mdash;in the meantime at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver&rsquo;s  meaning is not hard to understand,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, drily and feeling in her  pocket. &ldquo;He wants to get twenty-five thousand pounds for this.&rdquo; She produced a  sheet of paper dramatically. &ldquo;However, I made the little animal give it to me  for nothing. Never mind what arguments I used. I got it out of him, and brought  it to show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes,  paling slightly, took the letter and glanced over it with surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;if I had not been certain that I never wrote  such a letter, I should believe that I did. My handwriting has certainly been  imitated in a wonderfully accurate way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  imitated it?&rdquo; asked Miss Greeby, who was watching her eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. But doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he knows nothing, or says that he knows nothing. All he swears to is that  Chaldea found the letter in Pine&rsquo;s tent the day after his murder, and before  Inspector Darby had time to search. The envelope had been destroyed, so we don&rsquo;t  know if the letter was posted or delivered by hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had written such a letter to Noel,&rdquo; said Agnes quietly, &ldquo;it certainly would  have been delivered by hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  which case Pine might have intercepted the messenger,&rdquo; put in Miss Greeby. &ldquo;It  couldn&rsquo;t have been sent by post, or Pine would not have got hold of it, unless  he bribed Mrs. Tribb into giving it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Tribb is not open to bribery, Clara. And as to the letter, I never wrote it,  nor did Noel ever receive it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was written from The Manor, anyhow,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby bluntly. &ldquo;Look at the  crest and the heading. Someone in the house wrote it, if you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that. The paper might have been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;  Miss Greeby again bit her umbrella handle reflectively. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in  that, Agnes. Chaldea told Mrs. Belgrove&rsquo;s fortune in the park, and afterwards  she came to the drawing-room to tell it again. I wonder if she stole the paper  while she was in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  if she did, an uneducated gypsy could not have forged the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might have got somebody to do so,&rdquo; suggested Miss Greeby, nodding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the somebody must be well acquainted with my handwriting,&rdquo; retorted Lady Agnes,  and began to study the few lines closely.</p>
  <p>She  might have written it herself, so much did it resemble her style of writing.  The terse communication stated that the writer, who signed herself &ldquo;Agnes Pine,&rdquo;  would meet &ldquo;her dearest Noel&rdquo; outside the blue door, shortly after midnight,  and hoped that he would have the motor at the park gates to take them to London  en route to Paris. &ldquo;Hubert is sure to get a divorce,&rdquo; ended the letter, &ldquo;and  then we can marry at once and be happy ever more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was certainly a silly letter, and Agnes laughed scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t express myself in that way,&rdquo; she said contemptuously, and still eyeing  the writing wonderingly. &ldquo;And as I respected my husband and respect myself, I  should never have thought of eloping with my cousin, especially from Garvington&rsquo;s  house, when I had much better and safer chances of eloping in town. Had Noel  received this, he would never have believed that I wrote it, as I assuredly did  not. And a &lsquo;motor at the park gates,&rsquo;&ldquo; she read. &ldquo;Why not at the postern gate,  which leads to the blue door? that would have been safer and more reasonable.  Pah! I never heard such rubbish,&rdquo; and she folded up the letter to slip it into  her pocket.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby looked rather aghast. &ldquo;Oh, you must give it back to me,&rdquo; she said  hurriedly. &ldquo;I have to look into the case, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not give it back to you,&rdquo; said Agnes in a determined manner. &ldquo;It is in my  possession and shall remain there. I wish to show it to Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what am I to say to Silver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  you like. You can manage him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that he has lost this weapon&rdquo;&mdash;Agnes touched her pocket&mdash;&ldquo;he can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Miss  Greeby shrugged her big shoulders and stood up&mdash;&ldquo;just as you please. But it  would be best to leave the letter and the case in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; rejoined Agnes decisively. &ldquo;Noel is now quite well again, and I  prefer him to take charge of the matter himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all the thanks I get for my trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Clara,&rdquo; said the other cordially, &ldquo;I am ever so much obliged to you for  robbing Mr. Silver of this letter. But I don&rsquo;t wish to put you to any more  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as you please,&rdquo; said Miss Greeby again, and rather sullenly. &ldquo;I wash my hands  of the business, and if Silver makes trouble you have only yourself to thank. I  advise you also, Agnes, to see Mother Cockleshell and learn what she has to  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  she know anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  gave me certain mysterious hints that she did. But she appears to have a great  opinion of you, my dear, so she may be more open with you than she was with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is she to be found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Chaldea is queen of the tribe, which is still camped on the  outskirts of Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. Mother Cockleshell has gone away on her own. Have  you any idea who wrote the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  took out the forged missive again and studied it. &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; she said,  shaking her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know of any one who can imitate your handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know&mdash;oh,&rdquo; she stopped suddenly and grew as white as the widow&rsquo;s cap she  wore. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; demanded Miss Greeby, on fire with curiosity. &ldquo;Have you thought of any  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  shook her head again and placed the letter in her pocket. &ldquo;I can think of no  one,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby did not entirely believe this, as the sudden hesitation and the paleness  hinted at some unexpected thought, probably connected with the forgery.  However, since she had done all she could, it was best, as she judged, to leave  things in the widow&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of the whole business,&rdquo; said Miss  Greeby carelessly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do for me to be a detective, as I have no  staying power, and get sick of things. Still, if you want me, you know where to  send for me, and at all events I&rsquo;ve drawn Silver&rsquo;s teeth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear; thank you very much,&rdquo; said Agnes mechanically, so the visitor took her  leave, wondering what was rendering her hostess so absent-minded. A very  persistent thought told her that Agnes had made a discovery in connection with  the letter, but since she would not impart that thought there was no more to be  said.</p>
  <p>When  Miss Greeby left the house and was striding down the street, Agnes for the  third time took the letter from her pocket and studied every line of the  writing. It was wonderfully like her own, she thought again, and yet wondered  both at the contents and at the signature. &ldquo;I should never have written in this  way to Noel,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;And certainly I should never have signed myself &lsquo;Agnes  Pine&rsquo; to so intimate a note. However, we shall see,&rdquo; and with this cryptic  thought she placed the letter in her desk.</p>
  <p>When  Garvington and his wife returned they found Agnes singularly quiet and pale.  The little man did not notice this, as he never took any interest in other  people&rsquo;s emotions, but his wife asked questions to which she received no  answers, and looked at Agnes uneasily, when she saw that she did not eat any  dinner to speak of. Lady Garvington was very fond of her kind-hearted  sister-in-law, and would have been glad to know what was troubling her. But  Agnes kept her worries to herself, and insisted that Jane should go to the  pantomime, as she had arranged with some friends instead of remaining at home.  But when Garvington moved to leave the drawing-room, after drinking his coffee,  his sister detained him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to come to the library to write a letter for me, Freddy,&rdquo; she said in  a tremulous voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you write it yourself?&rdquo; said Garvington selfishly, as he was in a hurry to get  to his club.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear. I am so tired,&rdquo; sighed Agnes, passing her hand across her brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you should have kept on Silver as your secretary,&rdquo; grumbled Garvington. &ldquo;However,  if it won&rsquo;t take long, I don&rsquo;t mind obliging you.&rdquo; He followed her into the  library, and took his seat at the writing table. &ldquo;Who is the letter to?&rdquo; he  demanded, taking up a pen in a hurry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Mr. Jarwin. I want him to find out where Gentilla Stanley is. It&rsquo;s only a  formal letter, so write it and sign it on my behalf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  an infernal secretary,&rdquo; sighed Garvington, taking paper and squaring his  elbows. &ldquo;What do you want with old Mother Cockleshell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Greeby was here to-day and told me that the woman knows something about poor  Hubert&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington&rsquo;s  pen halted for a moment, but he did not look round. &ldquo;What can she possibly  know?&rdquo; he demanded irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I shall find out when Mr. Jarwin discovers her,&rdquo; said Agnes, who was in a  low chair near the fire. &ldquo;By the way, Freddy, I am sorry you let the Abbot&rsquo;s  Wood Cottage to Mr. Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; growled Garvington, writing industriously. &ldquo;Noel didn&rsquo;t pay me a  pound a week, and Silver does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might have a more respectable tenant,&rdquo; said Agnes scathingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  says Silver isn&rsquo;t respectable?&rdquo; he asked, looking round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and I have every reason to say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense!&rdquo; Garvington began to write again. &ldquo;Silver was Pine&rsquo;s secretary, and  now he&rsquo;s Miss Greeby&rsquo;s. They wouldn&rsquo;t have engaged him unless he was  respectable, although he did start life as a pauper toymaker. I suppose that is  what you mean, Agnes. I&rsquo;m surprised at your narrowness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  we have not all your tolerance, Freddy. Have you finished that letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are.&rdquo; Garvington handed it over. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to address the envelope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do,&rdquo; Agnes ran her eyes over the missive; &ldquo;and you can add a postscript to  this, telling Mr. Jarwin he can take my motor to look for Gentilla Stanley if  he chooses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  did as he was asked reluctantly. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t see why Jarwin can&rsquo;t supply  his own motors,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;and ten to one he&rsquo;ll only put an advertisement  in the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if Mother Cockleshell ever saw a newspaper,&rdquo; retorted his sister. &ldquo;Oh, thank  you, Freddy, you are good,&rdquo; she went on when he handed her the letter in a  newly addressed envelope; &ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t go, I want to speak to you about Mr.  Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  threw himself with a growl into a chair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about him  except that he&rsquo;s my tenant,&rdquo; he complained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it is time you did. Perhaps you are not aware that Mr. Silver tried to  blackmail me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  the little man grew purple and exploded. &ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  anything but nonsense.&rdquo; Agnes rose and went to her desk to get the forged  letter. &ldquo;He came to me a long time before Christmas and said that Chaldea found  this,&rdquo; she flourished the letter before her brother&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;in Hubert&rsquo;s tent  when he was masquerading as Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  letter? What does it say?&rdquo; Garvington stretched out his hand.</p>
  <p>Agnes  drew back and returned to her seat by the fire. &ldquo;I can tell you the contents,&rdquo;  she said coolly, &ldquo;it is supposed to be written by me to Noel and makes an  appointment to meet him at the blue door on the night of Hubert&rsquo;s death in  order to elope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,  you never wrote such a letter,&rdquo; cried Garvington, jumping up with a furious red  face.</p>
  <p>His  sister did not answer for a moment. She had taken the letter just written to  Jarwin by Garvington and was comparing it with that which Miss Greeby had  extorted from Silver. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in a strange voice and becoming white, &ldquo;I  never wrote such a letter; but I should be glad to know why you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did?&rdquo; Garvington retreated and his face became as white as that of the woman  who confronted him, &ldquo;what the devil do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always knew that you were clever at imitating handwriting, Freddy,&rdquo; said Agnes,  while the two letters shook in her grasp, &ldquo;we used to make a joke of it, I  remember. But it was no joke when you altered that check Hubert gave you, and  none when you imitated his signature to that mortgage about which he told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never&mdash;I never!&rdquo; stammered the detected little scoundrel, holding on to a chair  for support. &ldquo;I never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spare  me these lies,&rdquo; interrupted his sister scornfully, &ldquo;Hubert showed the mortgage,  when it came into his possession, to me. He admitted that his signature was  legal to spare you, and also, for my sake, hushed up the affair of the check.  He warned you against playing with fire, Freddy, and now you have done so  again, to bring about his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a damned lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a damned truth,&rdquo; retorted Agnes fiercely. &ldquo;I got you to write the letter to Mr.  Jarwin so that I might compare the signature to the one in the forged letter.  Agnes Pine in one and Agnes Pine in the other, both with the same twists and  twirls&mdash;very, very like my signature and yet with a difference that I alone can  detect. The postscript about the motor I asked you to write because the word  occurs in the forged letter. Motor and motor&mdash;both the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; denied Garvington again. &ldquo;I have not imitated your handwriting in the  letter to Jarwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  unconsciously imitated the signature, and you have written the word motor the  same in both letters,&rdquo; said Agnes decisively. &ldquo;I suddenly thought of your  talent for writing like other people when Clara Greeby asked me to-day if I  could guess who had forged the letter. I laid a trap for you and you have  fallen into it. And you&rdquo;&mdash;she took a step forward with fiery glance so that  Garvington, retreating, nearly tumbled over a chair&mdash;&ldquo;you laid a trap for Hubert  into which he fell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never did&mdash;I never did!&rdquo; babbled Garvington, gray with fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you did. I swear to it. Now I understand why you threatened to shoot any  possible burglar who should come to The Manor. You learned, in some way, I don&rsquo;t  know how, that Hubert was with the gypsies, and, knowing his jealous nature,  you wrote this letter and let it fall into his hands, so that he might risk  being shot as a robber and a thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t  shoot him,&rdquo; panted the man brokenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not for the want of trying. You broke his arm, and probably would have  followed him out to inflict a mortal wound if your accomplice in the shrubbery  had not been beforehand with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,  I swear that I took Pine for a burglar, and I don&rsquo;t know who shot him. Really,  I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  liar!&rdquo; said Agnes with intense scorn. &ldquo;When you posted your accompl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had no chance to finish the word, for Garvington broke in furiously and made a  great effort to assert himself. &ldquo;I had no accomplice. Who shot Pine I don&rsquo;t  know. I never wrote the letter; I never lured him to his death; he was more  good to me alive than dead. He never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not more good to you alive than dead,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Agnes in her turn. &ldquo;For  Hubert despised you for the way in which you tried to trick him out of money.  He thought you little better than a criminal, and only hushed up your  wickedness for my sake. You would have got no more money out of him, and you  know that much. By killing him you hoped that I would get the fortune and then  you could plunder me at your leisure. Hubert was hard to manage, and you  thought that I would be easy. Well, I have got the money and you have got rid  of Hubert. But I shall punish you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Punish  me?&rdquo; Garvington passed his tongue over his dry lips, and looked as though in  his terror he would go down on his knees to plead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not by denouncing you to the police,&rdquo; said his sister contemptuously. &ldquo;For, bad  as you are, I have to consider our family name. But you had Hubert shot so as  to get the money through me, and now that I am in possession I shall surrender  it to the person named in the sealed envelope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! No! No! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I shall. I can do so by marrying Noel. I shall no longer consider the financial  position of the family. I have sacrificed enough, and I shall sacrifice no  more. Hubert was a good husband to me, and I was a good and loyal wife to him;  but his will insults me, and you have made me your enemy by what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not do it. I swear I did not do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you did; and no denial on your part will make me believe otherwise. I shall  give you a few days to think over the necessity of making a confession, and in  any case I shall marry Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  lose the money. You shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  Agnes stepped forward and looked fairly into his shifty eyes. &ldquo;You are not in a  position to say that, Freddy. I am mistress both of the situation and of Hubert&rsquo;s  millions. Go away,&rdquo; she pushed him toward the door. &ldquo;Take time to think over  your position, and confess everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  got out of the room as swiftly as his shaky legs could carry him, and paused at  the door to turn with a very evil face. &ldquo;You daren&rsquo;t split on me,&rdquo; he  screeched. &ldquo;I defy you! I defy you! You daren&rsquo;t split on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alas!  Agnes knew that only too well, and when he disappeared she wept bitterly,  feeling her impotence.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>
    The Last Straw</b></h2>
  <p>Lady  Agnes was inaccurate when she informed Miss Greeby that her cousin had taken a  house in Kensington, since, like many women, she was accustomed to speak in  general terms, rather than in a precise way. The young man certainly did live  in the suburb she mentioned, but he had simply rented a furnished flat in one  of the cheaper streets. He was the poorest of all the Lamberts, and could  scarcely pay his club subscriptions, much less live in the style his ancient  name demanded. The St. James&rsquo;s chambers had merely been lent to him by a  friend, and when the owner returned, the temporary occupant had to shift.  Therefore, on the score of economy, he hired the dingy flat and brought up Mrs.  Tribb to look after it. The little woman, on her master&rsquo;s account, was  disgusted with the mean surroundings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you ought to be living in a kind of Buckingham Palace, Master Noel, as I should  declare with my dying breath,&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;And have the title, too,  if things was as they ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t be much better off if I did have the title, Mrs. Tribb,&rdquo; replied  Lambert with a shrug. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s common knowledge that Garvington can scarcely keep  his head above water. As an old family servant you should know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Master Noel, there&rsquo;s many things as I know, as I&rsquo;m sorry I do know,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Tribb incoherently. &ldquo;And them lords as is dead and buried did waste the money,  there&rsquo;s no denying. But some of your cousins, Master Noel, have gone into trade  and made money, more shame to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see that, Mrs. Tribb. I&rsquo;d go into trade myself if I had any head for  figures. There&rsquo;s no disgrace in trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for them as isn&rsquo;t Lamberts, Master Noel, and far be it from me to say so,  gentry not being so rich as they used to be when my mother was a gal. I don&rsquo;t  hold with it though for you, sir. But now Lady Agnes having millions and  billions will make things easier for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, Mrs. Tribb. How could I take money from her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not, Master Noel? if you&rsquo;ll excuse my making so free. As a child she&rsquo;d give  you anything in the way of toys, and as a grown-up, her head is yours if not  her heart, as is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!  there! Don&rsquo;t talk any more,&rdquo; said Lambert, coloring and vexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t annoyed you, sir, I hope. It&rsquo;s my heart as speaks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  appreciate the interest you take in the family, Mrs. Tribb, but you had better  leave some things unsaid. Now, go and prepare tea, as Lady Agnes has written  saying she will be here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Master Noel, and you only tell me now. Then there ain&rsquo;t time to cook them cakes  she dotes on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Lambert declined to argue further, and Mrs. Tribb withdrew, murmuring that she  would have to make shift with sardine sandwiches. Her tongue was assuredly  something of a nuisance, but the young man knew how devoted she was to the  family, and, since she had looked after him when he was a child, he sanctioned  in her a freedom he would not have permitted any one else to indulge in. And it  is to be feared, that the little woman in her zeal sometimes abused her  privileges.</p>
  <p>The  sitting room was small and cramped, and atrociously furnished in an overcrowded  way. There were patterns on the wall-paper, on the carpet, on the tablecloth  and curtains, until the eye ached for a clean surface without a design. And  there were so many ill-matched colors, misused for decorative purposes, that  Lambert shuddered to the core of his artistic soul when he beheld them. To  neutralize the glaring tints, he pulled down the blinds of the two windows  which looked on to a dull suburban roadway, and thus shut out the weak  sunshine. Then he threw himself into an uncomfortable arm-chair and sought  solace in his briar root. The future was dark, the present was disagreeable,  and the past would not bear thinking about, so intimately did it deal with the  murder of Pine, the threats of Silver, and the misery occasioned by the  sacrifice of Agnes to the family fetish. It was in the young man&rsquo;s mind to  leave England forthwith and begin a new life, unhampered by former troubles and  present grievances. But Agnes required help and could not be left to struggle  unaided, so Lambert silently vowed again, as he had vowed before, to stand by  her to the end. Yet so far he was unable to see what the end would be.</p>
  <p>While  he thus contemplated the unpleasantness of life he became aware that the front  door bell was ringing, and he heard Mrs. Tribb hurrying along the passage. So  thin were the walls, and so near the door that he heard also the housekeeper&rsquo;s  effusive welcome, which was cut short by a gasp of surprise. Lambert idly  wondered what caused the little woman&rsquo;s astonishment, but speedily learned when  Agnes appeared in the room. With rare discretion Mrs. Tribb ushered in the  visitor and then fled to the kitchen to wonder why the widow had discarded her  mourning. &ldquo;And him only planted six months, as you might say,&rdquo; murmured the  puzzled woman. &ldquo;Whatever will Master Noel say to such goings on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Master  Noel said nothing, because he was too astonished to speak, and Agnes, seeing  his surprise, and guessing its cause, waited, somewhat defiantly, for him to  make an observation. She was dressed in a gray silk frock, with a hat and  gloves, and shoes to match, and drew off a fur-lined cloak of maroon-colored  velvet, when she entered the room. Her face was somewhat pale and her eyes  looked unnaturally large, but she had a resolute expression about her mouth,  which showed that she had made up her mind. Lambert, swift, from long  association, to read her moods, wondered what conclusion she had arrived at, and  proceeded to inquire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he demanded, considerably startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  dress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. Where is your widow&rsquo;s cap and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the fire, and there they can remain until they are burned to ashes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  stared harder than ever. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means,&rdquo; said Agnes, replying very directly, &ldquo;that the victim is no longer  decked out for the sacrifice. It means, that as Hubert insulted me by his will,  I no longer intend to consider his memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Agnes, you respected him. You always said that you did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, until his will was read. Then when I found that his mean jealousy&mdash;which was  entirely unreasonable&mdash;had arranged to rob me of my income by preventing my  marriage with you, I ceased to have any regard for him. Hubert knew that I  loved you, and was content to take me on those terms so long as I was loyal to  him. I <i>was</i> loyal, and did what I  could to show him gratitude for the way in which he helped the family. Now his  will has broken the bargain I respect him no longer, and for that reason I  refuse to pose any longer as a grieving widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder, with these thoughts, that you posed at all,&rdquo; said Lambert gloomily, and  pushed forward a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not make up my mind until lately what to do,&rdquo; explained Agnes, sitting  down gracefully, &ldquo;and while I accepted his money it appeared to me that I ought  to show his memory the outward respect of crape and all the rest of it. Now,&rdquo;  she leaned forward and spoke meaningly, &ldquo;I am resolved to surrender the money.  That breaks the link between us. The will! the will!&rdquo; she tapped an impatient  foot on the carpet. &ldquo;How could you expect any woman to put up with such an  insult?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  dropped on the sofa and looked at her hard. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;I  never saw you like this before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not free when you last saw me,&rdquo; she replied dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; you were a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean free, in my own mind, to marry you. I am now. I don&rsquo;t intend to consider  the family or society, or Mr. Silver&rsquo;s threats, or anything else. I have shaken  off my fetters; I have discarded my ring.&rdquo; She violently pulled off her glove  to show that the circle of gold was absent. &ldquo;I am free, and I thank God that I  am free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes!  Agnes! I can&rsquo;t reduce you to poverty by marrying you. It would not be honorable  of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  would it be honorable on my part for me to keep the money of a man I despise  because his will insults me?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  argued all this before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  we did, and concluded to wait until we saw how the estates could be freed  before we came to any conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  do you see now how the estates can be freed without using Pine&rsquo;s money, Agnes?&rdquo;  asked Lambert anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Things are ever so much worse than I thought. Garvington can hold out for  another year, but at the end of twelve months the estates will be sold up by  the person whose name is in the sealed envelope, and he will be reduced to some  hundreds a year. The Lamberts!&rdquo; she waved her arm dramatically, &ldquo;are ruined, my  dear; entirely ruined!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for the simple reason that you wish us to place love before duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  leaned forward and took his hand firmly. &ldquo;Noel, you love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you love the family name better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  one way I wish to save it, in another I am willing to let it go hang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Those were my views until three or four days ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what caused you to change your mind, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  visit which Clara Greeby paid me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;  Lambert sat up very straight. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t been making mischief, has she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. On the contrary, she has done both of us a great service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  nodded thankfully. He felt doubtful as to whether Miss Greeby really had meant  to renounce her absurd passion for himself, and it was a relief to find that  she had been acting honestly. &ldquo;Has she then learned who killed Pine?&rdquo; he asked  cautiously.</p>
  <p>Lady  Agnes suddenly rose and began to pace the room, twisting her gloves and trying  to control herself. Usually she was so composed that Lambert wondered at this  restlessness. He wondered still more when she burst into violent tears, and  therefore hastened to draw her back to the chair. When she was seated he knelt  beside her and passed his arm round her neck, as distressed as she was. It was  so unlike Agnes to break down in this way, and more unlike her to sob brokenly.  &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid  of what, darling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid to learn who killed my husband. He might have done so, and yet he only  fired the first shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Agnes,&rdquo;  Lambert rose up suddenly, &ldquo;are you talking of Garvington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  She leaned back and dried her tears. &ldquo;In spite of what he says, I am afraid he  may be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert&rsquo;s  heart seemed to stand still. &ldquo;You talk rubbish!&rdquo; he cried angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish it was. Oh, how I wish it was rubbish! But I can&rsquo;t be sure. Of course, he  may have meant what he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does he say? Tell me everything. Oh, heavens!&rdquo; Lambert clutched his smooth  hair. &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ruin  to the Lambert family. I told you so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have only told me scraps so far. I don&rsquo;t understand how you can arrive at the  conclusion that Garvington is guilty. Agnes, don&rsquo;t go on crying in so  unnecessary a way. If things have to be faced, surely we are strong enough to  face them. Don&rsquo;t let our emotions make fools of us. Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; he said  sharply and stamping. &ldquo;Dry your eyes and explain matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t help my feelings,&rdquo; faltered Agnes, beginning to respond to the spur, and  becoming calmer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you can. I don&rsquo;t offer you brandy or smelling salts, or anything of the sort,  because I know you to be a woman with a firm mind. Exert your will, and compel  your nerves to be calm. This exhibition is too cheap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  cried Agnes indignantly, and this feeling was the one Lambert wished to arouse,  &ldquo;how can you talk so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I love you and respect you,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>She  knew that he meant what he said, and that her firmness of mind and self-control  had always appealed to him, therefore she made a great effort and subdued her  unruly nerves. Lambert gave her no assistance, and merely walked up and down  the room while waiting for her to recover. It was not easy for her to be  herself immediately, as she really was shaken, and privately considered that he  expected too much. But pride came to her aid, and she gradually became more  composed. Meanwhile Lambert pulled up the blind to display the ugly room in all  its deformity, and the sight&mdash;as he guessed it would&mdash;extorted an exclamation  from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how can you live in this horrid place?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Necessity  knows no law. Are you better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I am all right. But you are brutal, Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t have been brutal to a weaker woman,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And by acting as I  have done, I show how much I think of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  a strange way of showing approval. But your drastic methods have triumphed. I  am quite composed, and shall tell you of our disgrace in as unemotional a  manner as if I were reckoning pounds, shillings and pence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disgrace?&rdquo;  Lambert fastened on the one word anxiously. &ldquo;To us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Garvington in the first place. But sit down and listen. I shall tell you  everything, from the moment Clara came to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  nodded and resumed his seat. Agnes, with wonderful coolness, detailed Miss  Greeby&rsquo;s visit and production of the letter. Thence she passed on to explain  how she had tricked Garvington into confession. &ldquo;But he did not confess,&rdquo;  interrupted Lambert at this point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at the moment. He did yesterday in a letter to me. You see, he left my house  immediately and slept at his club. Then he went down to The Manor and sent for  Jane, who, by the way, knows nothing of what I have explained. Here are two  letters,&rdquo; added Agnes, taking an envelope out of her pocket. &ldquo;One is the forged  one, and the other came from Garvington yesterday. Even though he is not  imitating my writing, you can see every now and then the similarity. Perhaps  there is a family resemblance in our caligraphy.&rdquo; Her cousin examined the two  epistles with a rather scared look, for there was no doubt that things looked  black against the head of the family. However, he did not read Garvington&rsquo;s  letter, but asked Agnes to explain. &ldquo;What excuse does he make for forging your  name?&rdquo; asked Lambert in a business-like way, for there was no need to rage over  such a worm as Freddy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very weak one,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;So weak that I scarcely believe him to be in  earnest. Besides, Freddy always was a liar. He declares that when he went to  see about getting the gypsies turned off the land, he caught sight of Hubert.  He did not speak to him, but learned the truth from Mr. Silver, whom he forced  to speak. Then he wrote the letter and let it purposely fall into Mr. Silver&rsquo;s  hands, and by Mr. Silver it was passed on to Hubert. Freddy writes that he only  wanted to hurt Hubert so that he might be laid up in bed at The Manor. When he  was weak&mdash;Hubert, I mean&mdash;Freddy then intended to get all the money he could out  of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not wish to kill Pine, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And all the evidence goes to show that he only broke Hubert&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true,&rdquo; murmured Lambert thoughtfully, &ldquo;for the evidence of the other guests  and of the servants showed plainly at the inquest that the second shot was  fired outside while Garvington was indoors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  nodded. &ldquo;Yes; it really seems as though Freddy for once in his life is telling  the exact truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  cousin glanced at Garvington&rsquo;s lengthy letter of explanation. &ldquo;Do you really  believe that he hoped to manage Pine during the illness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Agnes reluctantly, &ldquo;Freddy has tremendous faith in his powers of  persuasion. Hubert would do nothing more for him since he was such a cormorant  for money. But if Hubert had been laid up with a broken arm, it is just  possible that he might have been worried into doing what Freddy wanted, if only  to get rid of his importunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  It sounds weak. Garvington certainly winged Pine, so that seems to corroborate  the statement in this letter. He&rsquo;s such a good shot that he could easily have  killed Pine if he wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t think that Freddy is responsible for the death?&rdquo; inquired Agnes with  a look of relief.</p>
  <p>Lambert  appeared worried. &ldquo;I think not, dear. He lured Hubert into his own private trap  so as to get him laid up and extort money. Unfortunately, another person, aware  of the trap, waited outside and killed your poor husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to what Freddy says, Mr. Silver knew of the trap, since he delivered the letter  to Hubert. And Mr. Silver knew that Freddy had threatened to shoot any possible  burglar. It seems to me,&rdquo; ended Agnes deliberately, &ldquo;that Mr. Silver is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should he shoot Pine, to whom he owed so much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  remember, Silver was inside the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented Lady Agnes, in dismay. &ldquo;That is true. It is a great puzzle, Noel.  However, I am not trying to solve it. Clara says that Mr. Silver will hold his  tongue, and certainly as the letter is now in my possession he cannot bring  forward any evidence to show that I am inculpated in the matter. I think the  best thing to do is to let Freddy and Mr. Silver fight out the matter between  them, while we are on our honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  started. &ldquo;Agnes! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  grew impatient. &ldquo;Oh, what is the use of asking what I mean when you know quite  well, Noel? Hubert insulted me in his will, and cast a slur on my character by  forbidding me to marry you. Freddy&mdash;although he did not fire the second  shot&mdash;certainly lured Hubert to his death by forging that letter. I don&rsquo;t intend  to consider my husband&rsquo;s memory any more, nor my brother&rsquo;s position. I shall  never speak to him again if I can help it, as he is a wicked little animal. I  have sacrificed myself sufficiently, and now I intend to take my own way. Let  the millions go, and let Freddy be ruined, if only to punish him for his  wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  dear, how can I ask you to share my poverty?&rdquo; said Lambert, greatly distressed.  &ldquo;I have only five hundred a year, and you have been accustomed to such luxury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have another five hundred a year of my own,&rdquo; said Agnes obstinately, &ldquo;which  Hubert settled on me for pin money. He refused to make any other settlements. I  have a right to that money, since I sacrificed so much, and I shall keep it.  Surely we can live on one thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  England?&rdquo; inquired Lambert doubtfully. &ldquo;And after you have led such a luxurious  life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she said quickly. &ldquo;I mean in the Colonies. Let us go to Australia, or Canada,  or South Africa, I don&rsquo;t care which, and cut ourselves off from the past. We  have suffered enough; let us now think of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  are we not selfish to let the family name be disgraced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy  is selfish, and will disgrace it in any case,&rdquo; said Agnes, with a contemptuous  shrug. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of pulling him out of the mud, when he will only sink  back into it again? No, Noel, if you love me you will marry me within the week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s so sudden, dear,&rdquo; he urged, more and more distressed. &ldquo;Take time to  consider. How can I rob you of millions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t rob me. If you refuse, I shall make over the money to some charity, and  live on my five hundred a year. Remember, Noel, what people think of me: that I  married Hubert to get his money and to become your wife when he died, so that  we could live on his wealth. We can only prove that belief to be false by  surrendering the millions and marrying as paupers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be right, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet, and yet&mdash;oh,&rdquo; she cried, wounded, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man did not answer, but stood looking at her with all his soul in his eyes, and  shaking from head to foot. Never before had she looked so desirable, and never  before had he felt the tides of love surge to so high a Water-mark. &ldquo;Love you!&rdquo;  he said in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;Agnes, I would give my soul for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  give it.&rdquo; She wreathed her arms round his neck and whispered with her warm lips  close to his ear, &ldquo;Give me all of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  two millions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Darling,  you will repent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Repent!&rdquo;  She pressed him closer to her. &ldquo;Repent that I exchange a lonely life for  companionship with you? Oh, my dear, how can you think so? I am sick of money  and sick of loneliness. I want you, you, you! Noel, Noel, it is your part to  woo, and here am I making all the love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is such a serious step for you to take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the only step that I can take. I am known as a mercenary woman, and until we  marry and give up the money, everybody will think scornfully of me. Besides,  Freddy must be punished, and in no other way can I make him suffer so much as  by depriving him of the wealth he sinned to obtain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  There is that view, certainly. And,&rdquo; Lambert gasped, &ldquo;I love you&mdash;oh, never  doubt that, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall,&rdquo; she whispered ardently, &ldquo;unless you get a special license and marry me  straightaway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Garvington and Silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Clara Greeby and Chaldea, who both love you,&rdquo; she mocked. &ldquo;Let them all fight  out their troubles alone. I have had enough suffering; so have you. So there&rsquo;s  no more to be said. Now, sir,&rdquo; she added playfully, &ldquo;wilt thou take this woman  to be thy wedded wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said, opening his arms and gathering Agnes to his heart. &ldquo;But what will  people say of your marrying so soon after Pine&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  them say what they like and do what they like. We are going to the Colonies and  will be beyond reach of slanderous tongues. Now, let us have tea, Noel, for I  am hungry and thirsty, and quite tired out with trying to convince you of my  earnestness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  rang for the tea. &ldquo;Shall we tell Jarwin that we intend to marry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  We shall tell no one until we are married,&rdquo; she replied, and kissed him once,  twice, thrice, and again, until Mrs. Tribb entered with the tray. Then they  both sat demurely at the first of many meals which they hoped would be the  start of a new Darby and Joan existence.</p>
  <p>And  the outcome of the interview and of the decision that was arrived at appeared  in a letter to Mr. Jarwin, of Chancery Lane. A week later he received a  communication signed by Agnes Lambert, in which she stated that on the  preceding day she had married her cousin by special license. Mr. Jarwin had to  read the epistle twice before he could grasp the astounding fact that the woman  had paid two millions for a husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  mad, crazy, silly, insane,&rdquo; murmured the lawyer, then his eyes lighted up with  curiosity. &ldquo;Now I shall know the name of the person in the sealed letter who  inherits,&rdquo; and he forthwith proceeded to his safe.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    On The Trail</b></h2>
  <p>Great  was the excitement in society when it became known&mdash;through the medium of a  newspaper paragraph&mdash;that Lady Agnes Pine had surrendered two millions sterling  to become Mrs. Noel Lambert. Some romantic people praised her as a noble woman,  who placed love above mere money, while others loudly declared her to be a  superlative fool. But one and all agreed that she must have loved her cousin  all the time, and that clearly the marriage with the deceased millionaire had  been forced on by Garvington, for family reasons connected with the poverty of  the Lamberts. It was believed that the fat little egotist had obtained his  price for selling his sister, and that his estates had been freed from all  claims through the generosity of Pine. Of course, this was not the case; but  the fact was unknown to the general public, and Garvington was credited with an  income which he did not possess.</p>
  <p>The  man himself was furious at having been tricked. He put it in this way, quite  oblivious to his own actions, which had brought about such a result. He could  not plead ignorance on this score, as Agnes had written him a letter announcing  her marriage, and plainly stating her reasons for giving up her late husband&rsquo;s  fortune. She ironically advised him to seek out the person to whom the money  would pass, and to see if he could not plunder that individual. Garvington,  angry as he was, took the advice seriously, and sought out Jarwin. But that  astute individual declined to satisfy his curiosity, guessing what use he would  make of the information. In due time, as the solicitor said, the name of the  lucky legatee would be made public, and with this assurance Garvington was  obliged to be content.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the happy pair&mdash;and they truly were extremely happy&mdash;heard nothing of the  chatter, and were indifferent to either praise or blame. They were all in all  to one another, and lived in a kind of Paradise, on the south coast of  Devonshire. On one of his sketching tours Lambert had discovered a picturesque  old-world village, tucked away in a fold of the moorlands, and hither he  brought his wife for the golden hours of the honeymoon. They lived at the small  inn and were attended to by a gigantic landlady, who made them very  comfortable. Mrs. &ldquo;Anak,&rdquo; as Noel called her, took the young couple for poor  but artistic people, since Agnes had dropped her title, as unsuited to her now  humble position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in the Colonies,&rdquo; she explained to her husband, during a moorland ramble, &ldquo;it  would be absurd for me to be called &lsquo;my lady.&rsquo; Mrs. Noel Lambert is good enough  for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, dear, if we ever do go to the Colonies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must, Noel, as we have so little to live on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  one thousand a year isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; he answered good-humoredly. &ldquo;It may seem  poverty to you, who have been used to millions, my darling; but all my life I  have been hard up, and I am thankful for twenty pounds a week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak as though I had been wealthy all my life, Noel. But remember that I was  as hard up as you before I married Hubert, poor soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  dear, you must appreciate the fact that we can never starve. Besides I hope to  make a name as a painter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Colonies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Art is to be found there as in England. Change of scene does not destroy  any talent one may possess. But I am not so sure, darling, if it is wise to  leave England&mdash;at least until we learn who murdered Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, do let us leave that vexed question alone. The truth will never become  known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must become known, Agnes,&rdquo; said Lambert firmly. &ldquo;Remember that Silver and  Chaldea practically accuse us of murdering your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  know it is a lie, and won&rsquo;t proceed further,&rdquo; said Agnes hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, they will, and Miss Greeby also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clara!  Why, she is on our side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  she is not. Your guess that she was still in love with me turns out to be quite  correct. I received a letter from her this morning, which was forwarded from  Kensington. She reproaches me with marrying you after the trouble she took in  getting the forged letter back from Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you told me that she said she would help you as a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did so, in order&mdash;to use an expressive phrase&mdash;to pull the wool over my eyes. But  she intended&mdash;and she puts her intention plainly in her letter&mdash;to help me in  order to secure my gratitude, and then she counted upon my making her my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  flushed. &ldquo;I might have guessed that she would act in that way. When you told me  that she was helping I had a suspicion what she was aiming at. What else does  she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  all manner of things, more or less silly. She hints that I have acted meanly in  causing you to forfeit two millions, and says that no man of honor would act in  such a way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lambert coolly. &ldquo;She believed that my possession of the money  would be even a greater barrier to our coming together than the fact of my  being married to Hubert. Well, dear, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great deal, Agnes,&rdquo; replied Noel, wrinkling his brows. &ldquo;She intends to make  mischief, and she can, with the aid of Silver, who is naturally furious at  having lost his chance of blackmail. Then there&rsquo;s Chaldea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can join forces with Miss Greeby and the secretary, and they will do their best  to get us into trouble. To defend ourselves we should have to explain that  Garvington wrote the letter, and then heaven only knows what disgrace would  befall the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t believe that Freddy is guilty?&rdquo; asked Agnes anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. Still, he wrote that letter which lured Pine to his death, and if such a  mean act became known, he would be disgraced forever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy  has such criminal instincts,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lambert gloomily, &ldquo;that I am quite sure  he will sooner or later stand in the dock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must keep him out of it as long as we can,&rdquo; said Noel decisively. &ldquo;For that  reason I intend to leave you here and go to Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see Freddy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and to see Chaldea, and to call on Silver, who is living in my old cottage.  Also I wish to have a conversation with Miss Greeby. In some way, my dear, I  must settle these people, or they will make trouble. Have you noticed, Agnes,  what a number of gypsies seem to cross our path?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but there are many gypsies in Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, but many gypsies do not come to this retired spot as a rule, and yet  they seem to swarm. Chaldea is having us watched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo; Agnes opened her astonished eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to learn. Chaldea is now a queen, and evidently has sent instructions to  her kinsfolk in this county to keep an eye on us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  ruminated for a few minutes. &ldquo;I met Mother Cockleshell yesterday,&rdquo; she  observed; &ldquo;but I thought nothing of it, as she belongs to Devonshire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe Mother Cockleshell is on our side, dear, since she is so grateful to  you for looking after her when she was sick. But Kara has been hovering about,  and we know that he is Chaldea&rsquo;s lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Lambert, rising from the heather on which they had seated themselves,  &ldquo;it will be best to face Mother Cockleshell and Kara in order to learn what all  this spying means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  approved of this suggestion, and the two returned to Mrs. &ldquo;Anak&rsquo;s&rdquo; abode to  watch for the gypsies. But, although they saw two or three, or even more during  the next few days, they did not set eyes on the Servian dwarf, or on Gentilla  Stanley. Then&mdash;since it never rains but it pours&mdash;the two came together to the  inn. Agnes saw them through the sitting-room window, and walked out boldly to  confront them. Noel was absent at the moment, so she had to conduct the  examination entirely alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentilla,  why are you spying on me and my husband?&rdquo; asked Agnes abruptly.</p>
  <p>The  respectable woman dropped a curtsey and clutched the shoulder of Kara, who  showed a disposition to run away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no spy, my angel,&rdquo; said the old creature  with a cunning glint in her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this one who keeps watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, my lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call me by my title. I&rsquo;ve dropped it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  for a time, my dear. I have read your fortune in the stars, my Gorgio one, and  higher you will be with money and rank than ever you have been in past days.  But not with the child&rsquo;s approval.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child. What child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea,  no less. She&rsquo;s raging mad, as the golden rye has made you his romi, my sweet  one, and she has set many besides Kara to overlook you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Mr. Lambert and I thought. And Chaldea&rsquo;s reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  would make trouble,&rdquo; replied Mother Cockleshell mysteriously. &ldquo;But Kara does  not wish her to love the golden rye&mdash;as she still does&mdash;since he would have the  child to himself.&rdquo; She turned and spoke rapidly in Romany to the small man in  the faded green coat.</p>
  <p>Kara  listened with twinkling eyes, and pulling at his heavy beard with one hand,  while he held the neck of his violin with the other. When Mother Cockleshell  ceased he poured out a flood of the kalo jib with much gesticulation, and in a  voice which boomed like a gong. Of course, Mrs. Lambert did not understand a  word of his speech, and looked inquiringly at Gentilla.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kara  says,&rdquo; translated the woman hurriedly, &ldquo;that he is your friend, since he is  glad you are the golden rye&rsquo;s romi. Ever since you left Lundra the child has  set him and others to spy on you. She makes mischief, does the child in her  witchly way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  him,&rdquo; said Agnes, indicating the dwarf, &ldquo;if he knows who murdered my late  husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gentilla  asked the question and translated the reply. &ldquo;He knows nothing, but the child  knows much. I go back to the wood in Hengishire, my dear, to bring about much  that will astonish Chaldea&mdash;curses on her evil heart. Tell the rye to meet me at  his old cottage in a week. Then the wrong will be made right,&rdquo; ended Mother  Cockleshell, speaking quite in the style of Meg Merrilees, and very  grandiloquently. &ldquo;And happiness will be yours. By this and this I bless you, my  precious lady,&rdquo; making several mystical signs, she turned away, forcing the  reluctant Kara to follow her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Gentilla?&rdquo; Agnes hurried in pursuit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no, my Gorgious. It is not the time. Seven days, and seven hours, and seven  minutes will hear the striking of the moment. Sarishan, my deary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell hobbled away with surprising alacrity, and Mrs. Lambert returned  thoughtfully to the inn. Evidently the old woman knew of something which would  solve the mystery, else she would scarcely have asked Noel to meet her in  Hengishire. And being an enemy to Chaldea, who had deposed her, Agnes was quite  sure that Gentilla would work her hardest to thwart the younger gypsy&rsquo;s plans.  It flashed across her mind that Chaldea herself might have murdered Pine. But  since his death would have removed the barrier between Lambert and herself,  Agnes could not believe that Chaldea was guilty. The affair seemed to become  more involved every time it was looked into.</p>
  <p>However,  Mrs. Lambert related to her husband that same evening all that had taken place,  and duly delivered the old gypsy&rsquo;s message. Noel listened quietly and nodded.  He made up his mind to keep the appointment in Abbot&rsquo;s Wood the moment he  received the intelligence. &ldquo;And you can stay here, Agnes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I wish to be beside you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  may be danger, my dear. Chaldea will not stick at a trifle to revenge herself,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the more reason that I should be with you,&rdquo; insisted Agnes. &ldquo;Besides, these  wretches are plotting against me as much as against you, so it is only fair  that I should be on the spot to defend myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a husband to defend you now, Agnes. Still, as I know you will be anxious  if I leave you in this out-of-the-way place, it will be best for us both to go  to London. There is a telephone at Wanbury, and I can communicate with you at  once should it be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it will be necessary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lambert with fond impatience. &ldquo;I shall  worry dreadfully to think that you are in danger. I don&rsquo;t wish to lose you now  that we are together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can depend upon my keeping out of danger, for your sake, dear,&rdquo; said the young  man, caressing her. &ldquo;Moreover, Mother Cockleshell will look after me should  Chaldea try any of her Romany tricks. Stay in town, darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me, that flat is so dingy, and lonely, and disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shan&rsquo;t remain at the flat. There&rsquo;s a very pleasant hotel near Hyde Park where  we can put up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  so expensive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the expense, just now. When everything is square we can consider economy.  But I shall not be easy in my mind until poor Pine&rsquo;s murderer is in custody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only hope Garvington won&rsquo;t be found to be an accomplice,&rdquo; said Agnes, with a  shiver. &ldquo;Bad as he is, I can&rsquo;t help remembering that he is my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the head of the Lamberts,&rdquo; added her husband gravely. &ldquo;You may be sure that I  shall try and save the name from disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a dismal ending to our honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us look upon it as the last hedge of trouble which has to be jumped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Agnes  laughed at this quaint way of putting things, and cheered up. For the next few  days they did their best to enjoy to the full the golden hours of love, and  peace which remained, and then departed, to the unfeigned regret of Mrs. &ldquo;Anak.&rdquo;  But present pleasure meant future trouble, so the happy pair&mdash;and they were  happy in spite of the lowering clouds&mdash;were forced to leave their temporary  paradise in order to baffle their enemies. Miss Greeby, Chaldea, Silver, and  perhaps Garvington, were all arrayed against them, so a conflict could not  possibly be avoided.</p>
  <p>Agnes  took up her abode in the private hotel near the Park which Lambert had referred  to, and was very comfortable, although she did not enjoy that luxury with which  Pine&rsquo;s care had formerly surrounded her. Having seen that she had all she  required, Noel took the train to Wanbury, and thence drove in a hired fly to  Garvington, where he put up at the village inn. It was late at night when he  arrived, so it might have been expected that few would have noted his coming.  This was true, but among the few was Chaldea, who still camped with her tribe  in Abbot&rsquo;s Wood. Whosoever now owned the property on mortgage, evidently did  not desire to send the gypsies packing, and, of course, Garvington, not having  the power, could not do so.</p>
  <p>Thus  it happened that while Lambert was breakfasting next morning, somewhere about  ten o&rsquo;clock, word was brought to him by the landlady that a gypsy wished to see  him. The young man at once thought that Mother Cockleshell had called to adjust  the situation, and gave orders that she should be admitted. He was startled and  ill-pleased when Chaldea made her appearance. She looked as handsome as ever,  but her face wore a sullen, vicious look, which augured ill for a peaceful  interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you cheated me after all, rye?&rdquo; was her greeting, and her eyes sparkled with  anger at the sight of the man she had lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be a fool, girl,&rdquo; said Lambert, purposely rough, for her persistence irritated  him. &ldquo;You know that I never loved you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I so ugly then?&rdquo; demanded the girl bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  remark is beside the point,&rdquo; said the man coldly. &ldquo;And I am not going to  discuss such things with you. But I should like to know why you set spies on me  when I was in Devonshire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chaldea&rsquo;s  eyes sparkled still more, and she taunted him. &ldquo;Oh, the clever one that you  are, to know that I had you watched. Aye, and I did, my rye. From the time you  left the cottage you were under the looks of my people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want revenge,&rdquo; cried Chaldea, stepping forward and striking so hard a blow on  the table that the dishes jumped. &ldquo;You scorned me, and now you shall pay for  that scorn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be melodramatic, please. What can you do to harm me, I should like to know, you  silly creature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can prove that you murdered my brother Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  can you, and in what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have the bullet which killed him,&rdquo; said the gypsy, speaking very fast so as to  prevent interruption. &ldquo;Kara knifed it out of the tree-trunk which grows near  the shrubbery. If I take it to the police and it fits your pistol, then where  will you be, my precious cheat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  looked at her thoughtfully. If she really did possess the bullet he would be  able to learn if Garvington had fired the second shot, since it would fit the  barrel of his revolver. So far as he was concerned, when coming to live in the  Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage, he had left all his weapons stored in London, and would  be able to prove that such was the case. He did not fear for himself, as  Chaldea&rsquo;s malice could not hurt him in this way, but he wondered if it would be  wise to take her to The Manor, where Garvington was in residence, in order to  test the fitting of the bullet. Finally, he decided to risk doing so, as in  this way he might be able to force the girl&rsquo;s hand and learn how much she  really knew. If aware that Garvington was the culprit, she would exhibit no  surprise did the bullet fit the barrel of that gentleman&rsquo;s revolver. And should  it be proved that she knew the truth, she would not dare to say anything to the  police, lest she should be brought into the matter, as an accomplice after the  fact. Chaldea misunderstood his silence, while he was thinking in this way, and  smiled mockingly with a toss of her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  the rye is afraid. His sin has come home to him,&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;Hai, you are at  my feet now, my Gorgious one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; said Lambert coolly, and rose to put on his cap. &ldquo;Come with me,  Chaldea. We go to The Manor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what would I do in the boro rye&rsquo;s ken, my precious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  ignored the question. &ldquo;Have you the bullet with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali,&rdquo;  Chaldea nodded. &ldquo;It lies in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we shall see at The Manor if it fits the pistol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai!  you have left the shooter at the big house,&rdquo; said the girl, falling into the  trap, and thereby proved&mdash;to Lambert at least&mdash;that she was really in the dark as  regards the true criminal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Garvington has a revolver of mine,&rdquo; said the young man evasively, although the  remark was a true one, since he had presented his cousin with a brace of  revolvers some twelve months before.</p>
  <p>Chaldea  looked at him doubtfully. &ldquo;And if the bullet fits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can do what you like,&rdquo; retorted Lambert tartly. &ldquo;Come on. I can&rsquo;t wait here  all day listening to the rubbish you talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gypsy followed him sullenly enough, being overborne by his peremptory manner,  and anxious, if possible, to bring home the crime to him. What she could not  understand, for all her cleverness, was, why he should be so eager to condemn  himself, and so went to The Manor on the lookout for treachery. Chaldea always  judged other people by herself, and looked upon treachery as quite necessary on  certain occasions. Had she guessed the kind of trap which Lambert was laying  for her, it is questionable if she would have fallen into it so easily. And  Lambert, even at this late hour, could not be certain if she really regarded  him as guilty, or if she was only bluffing in order to gain her ends.</p>
  <p>Needless  to say, Garvington did not welcome his cousin enthusiastically when he entered  the library to find him waiting with Chaldea beside him. The fat little man  rushed in like a whirlwind, and, ignoring his own shady behavior, heaped  reproaches on Lambert&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you have the cheek to come here,&rdquo; he raged. &ldquo;You and this beast of a  girl. I want no gypsies in my house, I can tell you. And you&rsquo;ve lost me a  fortune by your selfish behavior.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think we need talk of selfishness when you are present, Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? By marrying Agnes you have made her give up the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wished to give it up to punish you,&rdquo; said Lambert rebukingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  punish me!&rdquo; Garvington&rsquo;s gooseberry eyes nearly fell out of his head. &ldquo;And what  have I done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  laughed and shrugged his shoulders. In the face of this dense egotism, it was  impossible to argue in any way. He dismissed the subject and got to business,  as he did not wish to remain longer in Garvington&rsquo;s society than was absolutely  necessary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  girl,&rdquo; he said abruptly, indicating Chaldea, who stood passively at his elbow, &ldquo;has  found the bullet with which Pine was shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kara  found it, my boro rye,&rdquo; put in the gypsy quickly, and addressing Lord  Garvington, who gurgled out his surprises, &ldquo;in the tree-trunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  yes,&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;The elm which is near the shrubbery. Then why  didn&rsquo;t you give the bullet to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you ask that, Garvington?&rdquo; inquired Lambert meaningly, and the little man  whirled round to answer with an expression of innocent surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do,&rdquo; he vociferated, growing purple with resentment. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t accuse  me of murdering the man who was so useful to me, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall answer that very leading question when you bring out the revolver with  which you shot Pine on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only winged him,&rdquo; cried Garvington indignantly. &ldquo;The second shot was fired by  some unknown person, as was proved clearly enough at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, I wish you to produce the revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  The host looked suspicious and even anxious.</p>
  <p>It  was Chaldea who replied, and when doing so she fished out the battered bullet. &ldquo;To  see if this fits the barrel of the pistol which the golden rye gave you, my  great one,&rdquo; said she significantly.</p>
  <p>Garvington  started, his color changed and he stole a queer look at the impassive face of  his cousin. &ldquo;The pistol which the golden rye gave me?&rdquo; he repeated slowly and  weighing the words. &ldquo;Did you give me one, Noel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  gave you a couple in a case,&rdquo; answered Lambert without mentioning the date of  the present. &ldquo;And if this bullet fits the one you used&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will prove nothing,&rdquo; interrupted the other hurriedly, and with a restless  movement. &ldquo;I fired from the doorstep, and my bullet, after breaking Pine&rsquo;s arm,  must have vanished into the beyond. The shot which killed him was fired from  the shrubbery, and, it is quite easy to guess how it passed through him and  buried itself in the tree which was in the line of fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to see the pistols,&rdquo; said Lambert insistently, and this time Chaldea  looked at him, wondering why he was so anxious to condemn himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; snapped Garvington, with some reluctance, and walked toward the  door. There he paused, and evidently awaited to arrive at some conclusion, the  nature of which his cousin could not guess. &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he said again, and  left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  thinks that you are a fool, as I do, my Gorgious,&rdquo; said Chaldea scornfully. &ldquo;You  wish to hang yourself it seems, my rye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think that I shall be the one to be hanged. Tell me, Chaldea, do you  really believe that I am guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the girl positively. &ldquo;And if you had married me I should have saved you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  laughed, but was saved the trouble of a reply by the return of Garvington, who  trotted in to lay a mahogany case on the table. Opening this, he took out a  small revolver of beautiful workmanship. Chaldea, desperately anxious to bring  home the crime to Lambert, hastily snatched the weapon from the little man&rsquo;s  hand and slipped the bullet into one of the chambers. It fitted&mdash;making  allowance for its battered condition&mdash;precisely. She uttered a cry of triumph. &ldquo;So  you did shoot the Romany, my bold one,&rdquo; was her victorious speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the bullet fits the barrel of a revolver I gave to my cousin some twelve months  ago?&rdquo; he inquired, smiling.</p>
  <p>Chaldea&rsquo;s  face fell. &ldquo;Twelve months ago!&rdquo; she echoed, greatly disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as Lord Garvington can swear to. So I could not have used the weapon on that  night, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  used it,&rdquo; admitted Garvington readily enough. &ldquo;And winged Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  But I gave you a brace of revolvers of the same make. The bullet which would  fit one&mdash;as it does&mdash;would fit the other. I see there is only one in the case.  Where is the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington&rsquo;s  color changed and he shuffled with his feet. &ldquo;I lent it to Silver,&rdquo; he said in  a low voice, and reluctantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it in Silver&rsquo;s possession on the night Pine was shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  have been. He borrowed it a week before because he feared burglars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said Lambert coolly, and drawing a breath of relief, for the tension had been  great, &ldquo;the inference is obvious. Silver shot Hubert Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII<br>
    An Amazing Accusation</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Beng  in tutes bukko!&rdquo; swore Chaldea in good Romany, meaning that she wished the  devil was in some one&rsquo;s body. And she heartily meant what she said, and cared  little which of the two men&rsquo;s interior was occupied by the enemy of mankind,  since she hated both. The girl was disappointed to think that Lambert should  escape from her snare, and enraged that Garvington&rsquo;s production of one revolver  and his confession that Silver had the other tended to this end. &ldquo;May the pair  of you burn in hell,&rdquo; she cried, taking to English, so that they could  understand the insult. &ldquo;Ashes may you be in the Crooked One&rsquo;s furnace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  shrugged his shoulders, as he quite understood her feelings, and did not intend  to lower himself by correcting her. He addressed himself to his cousin and  turned his back on the gypsy. &ldquo;Silver shot Hubert Pine,&rdquo; he repeated, with his  eyes on Garvington&rsquo;s craven face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  impossible&mdash;impossible!&rdquo; returned the other hurriedly. &ldquo;Silver was shut up in  the house with the rest. I saw to the windows and doors myself, along with the  butler and footmen. At the inquest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind about the inquest. I know what you said there, and I am now beginning to  see why you said it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the devil do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean,&rdquo; stated the other, staring hard at him, &ldquo;that you knew Silver was guilty  when the inquest took place, and screened him for some reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know; I swear I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; stuttered Garvington, wiping his heated  face, and with his lower lip trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have done so,&rdquo; replied Lambert relentlessly. &ldquo;This bullet will fit both  the revolvers I gave you, and as you passed on one to Silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!  Bosh! Nonsense!&rdquo; babbled the little man incoherently. &ldquo;Until you brought the  bullet I never knew that it would fit the revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was true, as Lambert admitted. However, he saw that Garvington was afraid for  some reason, and pressed his advantage. &ldquo;Now that you see how it fits, you must  be aware that it could only have been fired from the revolver which you gave  Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; protested Garvington. &ldquo;That bullet may fit many revolvers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I had that brace of revolvers especially  manufactured, and the make is peculiar. I am quite prepared to swear that the  bullet would fit no other weapon. And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated, then faced the girl,  who lingered, sullen and disappointed. &ldquo;You can go, Chaldea,&rdquo; said Lambert,  pointing to the French window of the library, which was wide open.</p>
  <p>The  gypsy sauntered toward it, clutching her shawl and gritting her white teeth  together. &ldquo;Oh, I go my ways, my rye, but I have not done with you yet, may the  big devil rack my bones if I have. You win to-day&mdash;I win to-morrow, and so good  day to you, and curses on you for a bad one. The devil is a nice character&mdash;and  that&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she screamed, beside herself with rage. &ldquo;The puro beng is a fino  mush, if you will have the kalo jib!&rdquo; and with a wild cry worthy of a banshee  she disappeared and was seen running unsteadily across the lawn. Lambert  shrugged his shoulders again and turned to his miserable cousin, who had sat  down with a dogged look on his fat face. &ldquo;I have got rid of her because I wish  to save the family name from disgrace,&rdquo; said Lambert quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no disgrace on my part. Remember to whom you are speaking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. I speak to the head of the family, worse luck! You have done your best to  trail our name in the mud. You altered a check which Pine gave you so as to get  more money; you forged his name to a mortgage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies,  lies, the lies of Agnes!&rdquo; screamed Garvington, jumping up and shaking his fist  in puny anger. &ldquo;The wicked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  properly of my wife, or I&rsquo;ll wring your neck,&rdquo; said Lambert sharply. &ldquo;As to  what she told me being lies, it is only too true, as you know. I read the  letter you wrote confessing that you had lured Pine here to be shot by telling  falsehoods about Agnes and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only lured him to get his arm broken so that I might nurse him when he was ill  and get some money,&rdquo; growled Garvington, sitting down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am well aware of what you did and how you did it. But you gave that forged  letter to Silver so that it might be passed on to Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did. And because Silver knew too much you gave him the Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage at  a cheap rent, or at no rent at all, for all I know. To be quite plain,  Garvington, you conspired with Silver to have Pine killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Winged&mdash;only  winged, I tell you. I never shot him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  accomplice did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  not my accomplice. He was in the house&mdash;everything was locked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  you,&rdquo; said Lambert quickly. &ldquo;So it was easy for you to leave a window  unfastened, so that Silver might get outside to hide in the shrubbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Garvington jumped up again, looking both pale and wicked. &ldquo;You want to put a  rope round my neck, curse you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a melodramatic speech which is not true,&rdquo; replied the other coldly. &ldquo;For I want  to save you, or, rather, our name, from disgrace. I won&rsquo;t call in the police&rdquo;&mdash;Garvington  winced at this word&mdash;&ldquo;because I wish to hush the matter up. But since Chaldea  and Silver accuse me and accuse Agnes of getting rid of Pine so that we might  marry, it is necessary that I should learn the exact truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know it. I know nothing more than I have confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are such a liar that I can&rsquo;t believe you. However, I shall go at once to Silver  and you shall come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Garvington, who was overfed and flabby and unable to hold his own  against a determined man, settled himself in his chair and looked as obstinate  as a battery mule.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you will, you little swine,&rdquo; said Lambert freezingly cold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you call me names?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Names!  If I called you those you deserved I should have to annex the vocabulary of a  Texan muledriver. How such a beast as you ever got into our family I can&rsquo;t  conceive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am the head of the family and I order you to leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you do, do you? Very good. Then I go straight to Wanbury and shall tell what I  have discovered to Inspector Darby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! No! No!&rdquo; Garvington, cornered at last, sprang from his chair and made for  his cousin with unsteady legs. &ldquo;It might be unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay&mdash;to you. Well, will you come with me to Abbot&rsquo;s Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  whimpered Garvington. &ldquo;Wait till I get my cap and stick, curse you, for an  interfering beast. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  then you do know something likely to reveal the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t&mdash;I swear I don&rsquo;t! I only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  damn you, get your cap, and let us be off,&rdquo; broke in Lambert angrily, &ldquo;for I  can&rsquo;t be here all day listening to your lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  scowled and ambled out of the room, closely followed by his cousin, who did not  think it wise to lose sight of so shifty a person. In a few minutes they were  out of the house and took the path leading from the blue door to the postern  gate in the brick wall surrounding the park. It was a frosty, sunny day, with a  hard blue sky, overarching a wintry landscape. A slight fall of snow had  powdered the ground with a film of white, and the men&rsquo;s feet drummed loudly on  the iron earth, which was in the grip of the frost. Garvington complained of the  cold, although he had on a fur overcoat which made him look like a baby bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  give me my death of cold, dragging me out like this,&rdquo; he moaned, as he trotted  beside his cousin. &ldquo;I believe you want me to take pneumonia so that I may die  and leave you the title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should at least respect it more than you do,&rdquo; said Lambert with scorn. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t  you be a man instead of a thing on two legs? If you did die no one would miss  you but cooks and provision dealers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  gave him a vicious glance from his little pig&rsquo;s eyes, and longed to be tall,  and strong, and daring, so that he might knock him down. But he knew that  Lambert was muscular and dexterous, and would probably break his neck if it  came to a tussle. Therefore, as the stout little lord had a great regard for  his neck, he judged it best to yield to superior force, and trotted along  obediently enough. Also he became aware within himself that it would be  necessary to explain to Silver how he had come to betray him, and that would  not be easy. Silver would be certain to make himself extremely disagreeable.  Altogether the walk was not a pleasant one for the sybarite.</p>
  <p>The  Abbot&rsquo;s Wood looked bare and lean with the leaves stripped from its many trees.  Occasionally there was a fir, clothed in dark green foliage, but for the most  part the branches of the trees were naked, and quivered constantly in the  chilly breeze. Even on the outskirts of the wood one could see right into the  centre where the black monoliths&mdash;they looked black against the snow&mdash;reared  themselves grimly. To the right there was a glimpse of gypsy fires and tents  and caravans, and the sound of the Romany tongue was borne toward them through  the clear atmosphere. On such a day it was easy both to see and hear for long  distances, and for this reason Chaldea became aware that the two men were  walking toward the cottage.</p>
  <p>The  girl, desperately angry that she had been unable to bring Lambert to book, had  sauntered back to the camp, but had just reached it when she caught sight of  the tall figure and the short one. In a moment she knew that Lambert and his  cousin were making for Silver&rsquo;s abode, which was just what she had expected  them to do. At once she determined to again adopt her former tactics, which had  been successful in enabling her to overhear the conversation between Lambert  and Lady Agnes, and, following at a respectful distance, she waited for her  chance. It came when the pair entered the cottage, for then Chaldea ran swiftly  in a circle toward the monoliths, and crouched down behind one. While peering  from behind this shelter, she saw Silver pass the window of the studio, and  felt certain that the interview, would take place in that room. Like a serpent,  as she was, the girl crawled and wriggled through the frozen vegetation and  finally managed to get under the window without being observed. The window was  closed, but by pressing her ear close to the woodwork she was enabled to hear a  great deal, if not all. Candidly speaking, Chaldea had truly believed that  Lambert had shot Pine, but now that he had disproved the charge so easily, she  became desperately anxious to learn the truth. Lambert had escaped her, but she  thought that it might be possible to implicate his wife in the crime, which  would serve her purpose of injuring him just as well.</p>
  <p>Silver  was not surprised to see his landlord, as it seemed that Garvington paid him  frequent visits. But he certainly showed an uneasy amazement when Lambert  stalked in behind the fat little man. Silver was also small, and also cowardly,  and also not quite at rest in his conscience, so he shivered when he met the  very direct gaze of his unwelcome visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have come to look at your old house, Mr. Lambert,&rdquo; he remarked, when the two  made themselves comfortable by the studio fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I have come to see you,&rdquo; was the grim response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is an unexpected honor,&rdquo; said Silver uneasily, and his eyes sought those of  Lord Garvington, who was spreading out his hands to the blaze, looking blue  with cold. He caught Silver&rsquo;s inquiring look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Garvington crossly. &ldquo;I must look after myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver&rsquo;s  smooth, foxy face became livid, and he could scarcely speak. When he did, it  was with a sickly smile. &ldquo;Whatever are you talking about, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you know, d&mdash;&mdash; you! I did give you that revolver, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  revolver?&rdquo; Silver stared. &ldquo;Yes, why should I deny it? I suppose you have come  to get it back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to get it, Mr. Silver,&rdquo; put in Lambert politely. &ldquo;Hand it over to me,  if you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you like. It certainly has your name on the handle,&rdquo; said the secretary so  quietly that the other man was puzzled. Silver did not seem to be so  uncomfortable as he might have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  revolver was one of a pair which I had especially made when I went to Africa  some years ago,&rdquo; explained Lambert elaborately, and determined to make his  listener understand the situation thoroughly. &ldquo;On my return I made them a  present to my cousin. I understand, Mr. Silver, that Lord Garvington lent you  one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  kept the other,&rdquo; interrupted the man sharply. &ldquo;That is true. I was afraid of  burglars, since Lord Garvington was always talking about them, so I asked him  to lend me a weapon to defend myself with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you used it to shoot Pine,&rdquo; snapped Garvington, anxious to end his suspense and  get the interview over as speedily as possible.</p>
  <p>Silver  rose from his seat in an automatic manner, and turned delicately pale. &ldquo;Are you  mad?&rdquo; he gasped, looking from one man to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all very well you talking,&rdquo; whimpered Garvington with a shiver; &ldquo;but Pine was  shot with that revolver I lent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I knew you&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; complained Garvington, shivering again. &ldquo;But I warned  you that there might be trouble, since you carried that letter for me, so that  it might fall by chance into Pine&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augh!&rdquo;  groaned Silver, sinking back into his chair and passing his tongue over a pair  of dry, gray lips. &ldquo;Hold your tongue, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the use? He knows,&rdquo; and Garvington jerked his head in the direction of his  cousin. &ldquo;The game&rsquo;s up, Silver&mdash;the game&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Silver&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and he looked like a rat at bay. &ldquo;So you intend to save  yourself at my expense. But it won&rsquo;t do, my lord. You wrote that letter, if I  carried it to the camp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have admitted to my sister and to Lambert, here, that I wrote the letter,  Silver. I had to, or get into trouble with the police, since neither of them  will listen to reason. But you suggested the plan to get Pine winged so that he  might be ill in my house, and then we could both get money out of him. You  invented the plot, and I only wrote the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augh!  Augh!&rdquo; gulped Silver, unable to speak plainly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you confess the truth of Lord Garvington&rsquo;s statement?&rdquo; inquired Lambert  suavely, and fixing a merciless eye on the trapped fox.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that  is&mdash;yes. He swings on the same hook as I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed.  Then Lord Garvington was aware that you shot Pine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was not! I was not!&rdquo; screamed the head of the Lambert family, jumping up and  clenching his hands. &ldquo;I swear I never knew the truth until you brought the  bullet to the library to fit the revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;bullet!&rdquo;  stammered Silver, whose smooth red hair was almost standing on end from sheer  fright.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Lambert, addressing him sharply. &ldquo;Kara, under the direction of Chaldea,  found the bullet in the trunk of the elm tree which was in the line of fire.  She came with me to The Manor this morning, and we found that it fitted the  barrel of Lord Garvington&rsquo;s revolver. At the inquest, and on unimpeachable  evidence, it was proved that he fired only the first shot, which disabled Pine  without killing him. The second shot, which pierced the man&rsquo;s heart, could only  have come from the second revolver, which was, and is, in your possession, Mr.  Silver. The bullet found in the tree trunk will fit no other barrel of no other  weapon. I&rsquo;m prepared to swear to this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  covered his face with his hands and looked so deadly white that Lambert  believed he would faint. However, he pulled himself together, and addressed  Garvington anxiously. &ldquo;You know, my lord, that you locked up the house on that  night, and that I was indoors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  admitted the other hesitating. &ldquo;So far as I knew you certainly were inside. It  is true, Noel,&rdquo; he added, catching his cousin&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Even to save myself I  must admit that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;d admit anything to save yourself,&rdquo; retorted his cousin contemptuously, and  noting the mistake in the wording of the sentence. &ldquo;But admitting that Silver  was within doors doesn&rsquo;t save you, so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need for Lord Garvington to excuse himself,&rdquo; spoke up Silver, attempting  to enlist the little man on his side by defending him. &ldquo;It was proved at the  inquest, as you have admitted, Mr. Lambert, that he only fired the first shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you fired the second.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never did. I was inside and in bed. I only came down with the rest of the  guests when I heard the firing. Is that not so, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  admitted Garvington grudgingly. &ldquo;So far as I know you had nothing to do with  the second shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  turned a relieved face toward Lambert. &ldquo;I shall confess this much, sir,&rdquo; he  said, trying to speak calmly and judicially. &ldquo;Pine treated me badly by taking  my toy inventions and by giving me very little money. When I was staying at The  Manor I learned that Lord Garvington had also been treated badly by Pine. He  said if we could get money that we should go shares. I knew that Pine was  jealous of his wife, and that you were at the cottage here, so I suggested  that, as Lord Garvington could imitate handwriting, he should forge a letter  purporting to come from Lady Agnes to you, saying that she intended to elope on  a certain night. Also I told Lord Garvington to talk a great deal about  shooting burglars, so as to give color to his shooting Pine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was arranged to shoot him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Garvington, glaring at Silver. &ldquo;All we wanted to do was to  break Pine&rsquo;s arm or leg so that he might be laid up in The Manor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is so,&rdquo; said Silver feverishly, and nodding. &ldquo;I fancied&mdash;and for this  reason I suggested the plot&mdash;that when Pine was ill, both Lord Garvington and  myself could deal with him in an easier manner. Also&mdash;since the business would  be left in my hands&mdash;I hoped to take out some money from various investments,  and share it with Lord Garvington. We never meant that Pine should be killed,  but only reduced to weakness so that we might force him to give us both money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very ingenious plot,&rdquo; said Lambert grimly and wondering how much of the story  was true. &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Lord Garvington wrote the letter, and when seeing Pine, I gave it to him saying  that while keeping watch on his wife&mdash;as he asked me to,&rdquo; said Silver with an  emphasis which made Lambert wince, &ldquo;I had intercepted the letter. Pine was  furious, as I knew he would be, and said that he would come to the blue door at  the appointed time to prevent the supposed elopement. I told Lord Garvington,  who was ready, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I went down, pretending that Pine was a burglar,&rdquo; said Lord Garvington,  continuing the story in a most shameless manner. &ldquo;I opened the door quite  expecting to find him there. He rushed me, believing in his blind haste that I  was Agnes coming to elope with you. I shot him in the arm, and he staggered  away, while I shut the door again. Whether, on finding his mistake, and knowing  that he had met me instead of Agnes, he intended to go away, I can&rsquo;t say, as I  was on the wrong side of the door. But Agnes, attracted to the window by the  shot, declared&mdash;and you heard her declare it at the inquest, Noel&mdash;that Pine  walked rapidly away and was shot just as he came abreast of the shrubbery. That&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  quite enough, too,&rdquo; said Lambert savagely. &ldquo;You tricky pair of beasts; I  suppose you hoped to implicate me in the crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t a crime,&rdquo; protested Silver; &ldquo;but only a way to get money. By going up to  London you certainly delayed what we intended to do, since we could not carry  out our plan until you returned. You did for one night, as Chaldea, who was on  the watch for you, told us, and then we acted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Chaldea know of the trap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  She knew nothing save that I&rdquo;&mdash;it was Silver who spoke&mdash;&ldquo;wanted to know about  your return. She found the letter in Pine&rsquo;s tent, and really believed that Lady  Agnes had written it, and that you had shot Pine. It was to force you by  threats to marry her that she gave the letter to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she instructed you to show it to the police,&rdquo; said Lambert between his teeth, &ldquo;whereas  you tried to blackmail Lady Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to make my money somehow,&rdquo; said Silver insolently. &ldquo;Pine was dead and Lady  Agnes had the coin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were to share in the twenty-five thousand pounds, I suppose?&rdquo; Lambert asked his  cousin indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Silver blackmailed on his own. I hoped to get money from Agnes in another  way&mdash;as her hard-up brother that is. And if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  shut up! You make me sick,&rdquo; interrupted Lambert, suppressing a strong desire to  choke his cousin. &ldquo;You are as bad as Silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Silver is as innocent as Lord Garvington,&rdquo; struck in that gentleman, whose face  was recovering its natural color.</p>
  <p>Lambert  turned on him sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with that. You shot Pine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  sprang up with a hysterical cry. He had judged like Agag that the bitterness of  death was past, but found that he was not yet safe. &ldquo;I did not shoot Pine,&rdquo; he  declared, wringing his hands. &ldquo;Oh, why can&rsquo;t you believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Garvington gave you the second revolver and with that&mdash;on the evidence of the  bullet&mdash;Pine was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  might be so, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; Silver hesitated, and shivered and looked round with a  hunted expression in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what? You may as well explain to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t&mdash;I refuse to. I am innocent! You can&rsquo;t hurt me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  brushed aside this puny rage. &ldquo;Inspector Darby can. I shall go to Wanbury this  evening and tell him all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried Garvington, greatly agitated. &ldquo;Think of me&mdash;think of the  family!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think  of Justice! You two beasts aren&rsquo;t fit to be at large. I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; and he made for  the door.</p>
  <p>In  a moment Silver was clutching his coat. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I am  innocent! Lord Garvington, say that I am innocent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  &mdash;&mdash; you, get out of the hole as best you can! I&rsquo;m in as big a mess as you are,  unless Lambert acts decently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Decently,  you wicked little devil,&rdquo; said Lambert scornfully. &ldquo;I only propose to do what  any decent man would do. You trapped Pine by means of the letter, and Silver  shot him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had the revolver!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hadn&rsquo;t. I gave it away! I lent it!&rdquo; panted Silver, crying with terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lent it&mdash;you gave it&mdash;you liar! Who to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  looked round again for some way of escape, but could see none. &ldquo;To Miss Greeby.  She&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;she shot Pine. I swear she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
    Mother Cockleshell</b></h2>
  <p>It  was late in the afternoon when Lambert got back to the village inn, and he felt  both tired and bewildered. The examination of Silver had been so long, and what  he revealed so amazing, that the young man wished to be alone, both to rest and  to think over the situation. It was a very perplexing one, as he plainly saw,  since, in the light of the new revelations, it seemed almost impossible to  preserve the name of the family from disgrace. Seated in his sitting room, with  his legs stretched out and his hands in his pockets, Lambert moodily glared at  the carpet, recalling all that had been confessed by the foxy secretary of Miss  Greeby. That he should accuse her of committing the crime seemed unreasonable.</p>
  <p>According  to Silver, the woman had overheard by chance the scheme to lure Pine to The  Manor. Knowing that the millionaire was coming to Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, the secretary  had propounded the plan to Garvington long before the man&rsquo;s arrival. Hence the  constant talk of the host about burglars and his somewhat unnecessary threat to  shoot any one who tried to break into the house. The persistence of this remark  had roused Miss Greeby&rsquo;s curiosity, and noting that Silver and his host were  frequently in one another&rsquo;s company, she had seized her opportunity to listen.  For some time, so cautious were the plotters, she had heard nothing particular,  but after her recognition of Hearne as Pine when she visited the gypsy camp she  became aware that these secret talks were connected with his presence. Then a  chance remark of Garvington&rsquo;s&mdash;he was always loose-tongued&mdash;gave her the clue,  and by threats of exposure she managed to make Silver confess the whole plot.  Far from thwarting it she agreed to let them carry it out, and promised  secrecy, only extracting a promise that she should be advised of the time and  place for the trapping of the millionaire. And it was this acquiescence of Miss  Greeby&rsquo;s which puzzled Lambert.</p>
  <p>On  the face of it, since she was in love with him, it was better for her own  private plans that Pine should remain alive, because the marriage placed Agnes  beyond his reach. Why, then, should Miss Greeby have removed the barrier&mdash;and at  the cost of being hanged for murder? Lambert had asked Silver this question,  but had obtained no definite answer, since the secretary protested that she had  not explained her reasons. Jokingly referring to possible burglars, she had  borrowed the revolver from Silver which he had obtained from Garvington, and it  was this action which first led the little secretary to suspect her. Afterward,  knowing that she had met Pine in Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, he kept a close watch on her  every action to see if she intended to take a hand in the game. But Silver  protested that he could see no reason for her doing so, and even up to the  moment when he confessed to Lambert could not conjecture why she had acted in  such a manner.</p>
  <p>However,  it appeared that she was duly informed of the hour when Pine would probably  arrive to prevent the pretended elopement, and also learned that he would be  hanging about the blue door. When Silver retired for the night he watched the  door of her bedroom&mdash;which was in the same wing of the mansion of his own. Also  he occasionally looked out to see if Pine had arrived, as the window of his  room afforded a fair view of the blue door and the shrubbery. For over an  hour&mdash;as he told Lambert&mdash;he divided his attention between the passage and the  window. It was while looking out of the last, and after midnight, that he saw  Miss Greeby climb out of her room and descend to the ground by means of the ivy  which formed a natural ladder. Her window was no great height from the ground,  and she was an athletic woman much given to exercise. Wondering what she  intended to do, yet afraid&mdash;because of Pine&rsquo;s expected arrival&mdash;to leave the  house, Silver watched her cautiously. She was arrayed in a long black cloak  with a hood, he said, but in the brilliant moonlight he could easily  distinguish her gigantic form as she slipped into the shrubbery. When Pine  arrived, Silver saw him dash at the blue door when it was opened by Garvington,  and saw him fall back after the first shot. Then he heard the shutting of the  door; immediately afterward the opening of Lady Agnes&rsquo;s window, and noted that  Pine ran quickly and unsteadily down the path. As he passed the shrubbery, the  second shot came&mdash;at this point Silver simply gave the same description as Lady  Agnes did at the inquest&mdash;and then Pine fell. Afterward Garvington and his  guests came out and gathered round the body, but Miss Greeby, slipping along  the rear of the shrubbery, doubled back to the shadow at the corner of the  house. Silver, having to play his part, did not wait to see her re-enter the  mansion, but presumed she did so by clambering up the ivy. He ran down and  mingled with the guests and servants, who were clustered round the dead man,  and finally found Miss Greeby at his elbow, artlessly inquiring what had  happened. For the time being he accepted her innocent attitude.</p>
  <p>Later  on, when dismissed by Jarwin and in want of funds, he sought out Miss Greeby  and accused her. At first she denied the story, but finally, as she judged that  he could bring home the crime to her, she compromised with him by giving him  the post of her secretary at a good salary. When he obtained the forged letter  from Chaldea&mdash;and she learned this from Lambert when he was ill&mdash;Miss Greeby made  him give it to her, alleging that by showing it to Agnes she could the more  positively part the widow from her lover. Miss Greeby, knowing who had written  the letter, counted upon Agnes guessing the truth, and had she not seen that it  had entered her mind, when the letter was brought to her, she would have given  a hint as to the forger&rsquo;s name. But Agnes&rsquo;s hesitation and sudden paleness  assured Miss Greeby that she guessed the truth, so the letter was left to work  its poison. Silver, of course, clamored for his blackmail, but Miss Greeby  promised to recompense him, and also threatened if he did not hold his tongue  that she would accuse him and Garvington of the murder. Since the latter had  forged the letter and the former had borrowed the revolver which had killed  Pine, it would have been tolerably easy for Miss Greeby to substantiate her  accusation. As to her share in the crime, all she had to do was to deny that  Silver had passed the borrowed revolver on to her, and there was no way in  which he could prove that he had done so. On the whole, Silver had judged it  best to fall in with Miss Greeby&rsquo;s plans, and preserve silence, especially as  she was rich and could supply him with whatever money he chose to ask for. She  was in his power, and he was in her power, so it was necessary to act on the  golden rule of give and take.</p>
  <p>And  the final statement which Silver made to Lambert intimated that Garvington was ignorant  of the truth. Until the bullet was produced in the library to fit the revolver  it had never struck Garvington that the other weapon had been used to kill  Pine. And he had honestly believed that Silver&mdash;as was actually the case&mdash;had  remained in his bedroom all the time, until he came downstairs to play his  part. As to Miss Greeby being concerned in the matter, such an idea had never  entered Garvington&rsquo;s head. The little man&rsquo;s hesitation in producing the  revolver, when he got an inkling of the truth, was due to his dread that if  Silver was accused of the murder&mdash;and at the time it seemed as though the  secretary was guilty&mdash;he might turn king&rsquo;s evidence to save his neck, and  explain the very shady plot in which Garvington had been engaged. But Lambert  had forced his cousin&rsquo;s hand, and Silver had been brought to book, with the  result that the young man now sat in his room at the inn, quite convinced that  Miss Greeby was guilty, yet wondering what motive had led her to act in such a  murderous way.</p>
  <p>Also,  Lambert wondered what was best to be done, in order to save the family name. If  he went to the police and had Miss Greeby arrested, the truth of Garvington&rsquo;s  shady dealings would certainly come to light, especially as Silver was an  accessory after the fact. On the other hand, if he left things as they were,  there was always a chance that hints might be thrown out by Chaldea&mdash;who had  everything to gain and nothing to lose&mdash;that he and Agnes were responsible for  the death of Pine. Of course, Lambert, not knowing that Chaldea had been  listening to the conversation in the cottage, believed that the girl was  ignorant of the true state of affairs, and he wondered how he could inform her  that the actual criminal was known without risking her malignity. He wanted to  clear his character and that of his wife; likewise he wished to save the family  name. But it seemed to him that the issue of these things lay in the hands of  Chaldea, and she was bent upon injuring him if she could. It was all very  perplexing.</p>
  <p>It  was at this point of his meditation that Mother Cockleshell arrived at the inn.  He heard her jovial voice outside and judged from its tone that the old dame  was in excellent spirits. Her visit seemed to be a hint from heaven as to what  he should do. Gentilla hated Chaldea and loved Agnes, so Lambert felt that she  would be able to help him. As soon as possible he had her brought into the  sitting room, and, having made her sit down, closed both the door and the  window, preparatory to telling her all that he had learned. The conversation  was, indeed, an important one, and he was anxious that it should take place  without witnesses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> kind, sir,&rdquo; said Mother  Cockleshell, who had been supplied with a glass of gin and water. &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t  for the likes of me to be sitting down with the likes of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  We must have a long talk, and I can&rsquo;t expect you to stand all the time&mdash;at your  age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  Gentiles ain&rsquo;t so anxious to save the legs of old ones,&rdquo; remarked Gentilla  Stanley cheerfully. &ldquo;But I always did say as you were a golden one for kindness  of heart. Well, them as does what&rsquo;s unexpected gets what they don&rsquo;t hope for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have got my heart&rsquo;s desire, Mother,&rdquo; said Lambert, sitting down and lighting  his pipe. &ldquo;I am happy now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  as happy as you&rsquo;d like to be, sir,&rdquo; said the old woman, speaking quite in the  Gentile manner, and looking like a decent charwoman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a dear wife, as I  don&rsquo;t deny, Mr. Lambert, but money is what you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have enough for my needs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for her needs, sir. She should be wrapped in cloth of gold and have a path of  flowers to tread upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a path of thorns just now,&rdquo; muttered Lambert moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for long, sir; not for long. I come to put the crooked straight and to raise a  lamp to banish the dark. Very good this white satin is,&rdquo; said Mother  Cockleshell irrelevantly, and alluding to the gin. &ldquo;And terbaccer goes well  with it, as there&rsquo;s no denying. You wouldn&rsquo;t mind my taking a whiff, sir, would  you?&rdquo; and she produced a blackened clay pipe which had seen much service. &ldquo;Smoking  is good for the nerves, Mr. Lambert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man handed her his pouch. &ldquo;Fill up,&rdquo; he said, smiling at the idea of his  smoking in company with an old gypsy hag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  you, my precious!&rdquo; said Mother Cockleshell, accepting the offer with avidity,  and talking more in the Romany manner. &ldquo;I allers did say as you were what I  said before you were, and that&rsquo;s golden, my Gorgious one. Ahime!&rdquo; she blew a  wreath of blue smoke from her withered lips, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s food to me, my dearie, and  heat to my old bones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  nodded. &ldquo;You hinted, in Devonshire, that you had something to say, and a few  moments ago you talked about putting the crooked straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t the crooked need that same?&rdquo; chuckled Gentilla, nodding. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble  at hand, my gentleman. The child&rsquo;s brewing witch&rsquo;s broth, for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea!&rdquo;  Lambert sat up anxiously. He mistrusted the younger gypsy greatly, and was  eager to know what she was now doing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!  Aye! Aye!&rdquo; Mother Cockleshell nodded three times like a veritable Macbeth  witch. &ldquo;She came tearing, rampagious-like, to the camp an hour or so back and  put on her fine clothes&mdash;may they cleave with pain to her skin&mdash;to go to the big  city. It is true, rye. Kara ran by the side of the donkey she rode upon&mdash;may she  have an accident&mdash;to Wanbury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Wanbury?&rdquo; Lambert looked startled as it crossed his mind, and not unnaturally,  that Chaldea might have gone to inform Inspector Darby about the conversation  with Garvington in the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Wanbury first, sir, and then to Lundra.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you be certain of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child treated me like the devil&rsquo;s calls her,&rdquo; said Gentilla Stanley, shaking  her head angrily. &ldquo;And I have no trust in her, for a witchly wrong &lsquo;un she is.  When she goes donkey-wise to Wanbury, I says to a chal, says I, quick-like, &lsquo;Follow  and watch her games!&rsquo; So the chal runs secret, behind hedges, and comes on the  child at the railway line making for Lundra. And off she goes on wheels in  place of tramping the droms in true Romany style.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce has she gone to London for?&rdquo; Lambert asked himself in a low voice,  but Gentilla&rsquo;s sharp ears overheard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mischief  for sure, my gentleman. Hai, but she&rsquo;s a bad one, that same. But she plays and  I play, with the winning for me&mdash;since the good cards are always in the old  hand. Fear nothing, my rye. She cannot hurt, though snake that she is, her bite  stings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man did not reply. He was uneasy in one way and relieved in another.  Chaldea certainly had not gone to see Inspector Darby, so she could not have  any intention of bringing the police into the matter. But why had she gone to  London? He asked himself this question and finally put it to the old woman, who  watched him with bright, twinkling eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  gone for mischief,&rdquo; answered Gentilla, nodding positively. &ldquo;For mischief&rsquo;s as  natural to her as cheating is to a Romany chal. But I&rsquo;m a dealer of cards  myself, rye, and I deal myself the best hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you&rsquo;d leave metaphor and come to plain speaking,&rdquo; cried Lambert in an  irritable tone, for the conversation was getting on his nerves by reason of its  prolixity and indirectness.</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell laughed and nodded, then emptied the ashes out of her pipe and  spoke out, irrelevantly as it would seem: &ldquo;The child has taken the hearts of  the young from me,&rdquo; said she, shaking her grizzled head; &ldquo;but the old cling to  the old. With them as trusts my wisdom, my rye, I goes across the black water  to America and leaves the silly ones to the child. She&rsquo;ll get them into choky  and trouble, for sure. And that&rsquo;s a true dukkerin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you the money to go to America?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo;  The old woman chuckled and hugged herself. &ldquo;And why not, sir, when Ishmael  Hearne was my child. Aye, the child of my child, for I am the bebee of Hearne,  bebee being grandmother in our Romany tongue, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  started from his seat, almost too astonished to speak. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that  you are Pine&rsquo;s grandmother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pine?  Who is Pine? A Gentile I know not. Hearne he was born and Hearne he shall be to  me, though the grass is now a quilt for him. Ohone! Hai mai! Ah, me! Woe! and woe,  my gentleman. He was the child of my child and the love of my heart,&rdquo; she  rocked herself to and fro sorrowfully, &ldquo;like a leaf has he fallen from the  tree; like the dew has he vanished into the blackness of the great shadow. Hai  mai! Hai mai! the sadness of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hearne  your grandson?&rdquo; murmured Lambert, staring at her and scarcely able to believe  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True.  Yes; it is true,&rdquo; said Gentilla, still rocking. &ldquo;He left the road, and the  tent, and the merry fire under a hedge for your Gentile life. But a born Romany  he was and no Gorgio. Ahr-r-r!&rdquo; she shook herself with disgust. &ldquo;Why did he  labor for gold in the Gentile manner, when he could have chored and cheated  like a true-hearted black one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  allusions to money suddenly enlightened the young man. &ldquo;Yours is the name  mentioned in the sealed letter held by Jarwin?&rdquo; he cried, with genuine  amazement written largely on his face. &ldquo;You inherit the millions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell wiped her eyes with a corner of her shawl and chuckled  complacently. &ldquo;It is so, young man, therefore can I take those who hold to my  wisdom to the great land beyond the water. Ah, I am rich now, sir, and as a  Gorgious one could I live beneath a roof-tree. But for why, I asks you, my  golden rye, when I was bred to the open and the sky? In a tent I was born; in a  tent I shall die. Should I go, Gentile, it&rsquo;s longing for the free life I&rsquo;d be,  since Romany I am and ever shall be. As we says in our tongue, my dear, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s  allers the boro matcho that pet-a-lay &lsquo;dree the panni,&rsquo; though true gypsy lingo  you can&rsquo;t call it for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo; demanded Lambert, staring at the dingy possessor of two millions  sterling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  allers the largest fish that falls back into the water,&rdquo; translated Mrs.  Stanley. &ldquo;I told that to Leland, the boro rye, and he goes and puts the same  into a book for your readings, my dearie!&rdquo; then she uttered a howl and flung up  her arms. &ldquo;But what matter I am rich, when my child&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s blood calls out  for vengeance. I&rsquo;d give all the red gold&mdash;and red money it is, my loved one,&rdquo;  she added, fixing a bright pair of eyes on Lambert, &ldquo;if I could find him as  shot the darling of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knowing  that he could trust her, and pitying her obvious sorrow, Lambert had no  hesitation in revealing the truth so far as he knew it. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a him who  shot your grandson, but a her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai!&rdquo;  Gentilla flung up her arms again, &ldquo;then I was right. My old eyes did see like a  cat in the dark, though brightly shone the moon when he fell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  You know?&rdquo; Lambert started back again at this second surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s a Gentile lady, I know. A red one large as a cow in the meadows, and  fierce as an unbroken colt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Greeby!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greeby!  Greeby! So your romi told me,&rdquo; shrieked the old woman, throwing up her hands in  ecstasy. &ldquo;Says I to her, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the foxy one?&rsquo; and says she, smiling like, &lsquo;Greeby&rsquo;s  her name!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you ask my wife that?&rdquo; demanded Lambert, much astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hai,  she was no wife of yours then, sir. Why did I ask her? Because I saw the  shooting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Pine&mdash;of Hearne&mdash;of your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  who else? of who else?&rdquo; cried Mother Cockleshell, clapping her skinny hand and  paddling on the floor with her feet. &ldquo;Says Ishmael to me, &lsquo;Bebee,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;my  romi is false and would run away with the golden rye this very night as ever  was.&rsquo; And says I to him, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not so, son of my son, for your romi is as true  as the stars and purer than gold.&rsquo; But says he, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a letter,&rsquo; he says,  and shows it to me. &lsquo;Lies, son of my son,&rsquo; says I, and calls on him to play the  trustful rom. But he pitches down the letter, and says he, &lsquo;I go this night to  stop them from paddling the hoof,&rsquo; and says I to him, &lsquo;No! No!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s  a true one.&rsquo; But he goes, when all in the camp are sleeping death-like, and I  watches, and I follers, and I hides.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you hide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind, dearie. I hides securely, and sees him walking up and down biting the  lips of him and swinging his arms. Then I sees&mdash;for Oliver was bright, and  Oliver&rsquo;s the moon, lovey&mdash;the big Gentile woman come round and hide in the  bushes. Says I to myself, says I, &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s your game?&rsquo; I says, not knowing  the same till she shoots and my child&rsquo;s child falls dead as a hedgehog. Then  she runs and I run, and all is over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you denounce her, Gentilla?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for why, my precious heart? Who would believe the old gypsy? Rather would the  Poknees say as I&rsquo;d killed my dear one. No! no! Artful am I and patient in  abiding my time. But the hour strikes, as I said when I spoke to your romi in  Devonshire no less, and the foxy moll shall hang. You see, my dear, I waited  for some Gentile to speak what I could speak, to say as what I saw was truth  for sure. You speak, and now I can tell my tale to the big policeman at Wanbury  so that my son&rsquo;s son may sleep quiet, knowing that the evil has come home to  her as laid him low. But, lovey, oh, lovey, and my precious one!&rdquo; cried the old  woman darting forward to caress Lambert&rsquo;s hand in a fondling way, &ldquo;tell me how  you know and what you learned. At the cottage you were, and maybe out in the  open watching the winder of her you loved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Lambert sharply, &ldquo;I was at the cottage certainly, but in bed and asleep. I  did not hear of the crime until I was in London. In this way I found out the  truth, Mother!&rdquo; and he related rapidly all that had been discovered, bringing  the narrative right up to the confession of Silver, which he detailed at  length.</p>
  <p>The  old woman kept her sharp eyes on his expressive face and hugged his hand every  now and then, as various points in the narrative struck her. At the end she  dropped his hand and returned back to her chair chuckling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad dukkerin  for the foxy lady,&rdquo; said Gentilla, grinning like the witch she was. &ldquo;Hanged she  will be, and rightful it is to be so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you,&rdquo; replied Lambert relentlessly. &ldquo;Your evidence and that of  Silver can hang her, certainly. Yet, if she is arrested, and the whole tale  comes out in the newspapers, think of the disgrace to my family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mother  Cockleshell nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as true as true, my golden rye,&rdquo; she said  pondering. &ldquo;And I wish not to hurt you and the rani, who was kind to me. I go  away,&rdquo; she rose to her feet briskly, &ldquo;and I think. What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Lambert, doubtfully and irresolutely. &ldquo;I must consult my wife.  Miss Greeby should certainly suffer for her crime, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!  Aye! Aye! The boro rye,&rdquo; she meant Garvington, &ldquo;is a bad one for sure, as we  know. Shame to him is shame to you, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have the rani miserable&mdash;the  good kind one that she is. Wait! aye, wait, my precious gentleman, and we shall  see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will say nothing in the meantime,&rdquo; said Lambert, stopping her at the door, and  anxious to know exactly what were her intentions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have waited long for vengeance and I can wait longer, sir,&rdquo; said Mother  Cockleshell, becoming less the gypsy and more the respectable almshouse widow. &ldquo;Depend  upon my keeping quiet until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  what? Until when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind,&rdquo; said the woman mysteriously. &ldquo;Them as sins must suffer for the sin.  But not you and her as is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  violence, Gentilla,&rdquo; said the young man, alarmed less the lawless gypsy nature  should punish Miss Greeby privately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear there shall be no violence, rye. Wait, for the child is making mischief,  and until we knows of her doings we must be silent. Give me your gripper, my  dearie,&rdquo; she seized his wrist and bent back the palm of the hand to trace the  lines with a dirty finger. &ldquo;Good fortune comes to you and to her, my golden  rye,&rdquo; she droned in true gypsy fashion. &ldquo;Money, and peace, and honor, and many  children, to carry on a stainless name. Your son shall you see, and your son&rsquo;s  son, my noble gentleman, and with your romi shall you go with happiness to the  grave,&rdquo; she dropped the hand. &ldquo;So be it for a true dukkerin, and remember  Gentilla Stanley when the luck comes true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mother, Mother,&rdquo; said Lambert, following her to the door, as he was still  doubtful as to her intentions concerning Miss Greeby.</p>
  <p>The  gypsy waved him aside solemnly. &ldquo;Never again will you see me, my golden rye, if  the stars speak truly, and if there be virtue in the lines of the hand. I came  into your life: I go out of your life: and what is written shall be!&rdquo; she made  a mystic sign close to his face and then nodded cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duveleste  rye!&rdquo; was her final greeting, and she disappeared swiftly, but the young man  did not know that the Romany farewell meant, &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
    The Destined End</b></h2>
  <p>As  might have been anticipated, Lord Garvington was in anything but a happy frame  of mind. He left Silver in almost a fainting condition, and returned to The  Manor feeling very sick himself. The two cowardly little men had not the  necessary pluck of conspirators, and now that there seemed to be a very good  chance that their nefarious doings would be made public they were both in  deadly fear of the consequences. Silver was in the worst plight, since he was  well aware that the law would consider him to be an accessory after the fact,  and that, although his neck was not in danger, his liberty assuredly was. He  was so stunned by the storm which had broken so unexpectedly over his head, that  he had not even the sense to run away. All manly grit&mdash;what he possessed of  it&mdash;had been knocked out of him, and he could only whimper over the fire while  waiting for Lambert to act.</p>
  <p>Garvington  was not quite so downhearted, as he knew that his cousin was anxious to  consider the fair fame of the family. Thinking thus, he felt a trifle  reassured, for the forged letter could not be made public without a slur being  cast on the name. Then, again, Garvington knew that he was innocent of  designing Pine&rsquo;s death, and that, even if Lambert did inform the police, he  could not be arrested. It is only just to say that had the little man known of  Miss Greeby&rsquo;s intention to murder the millionaire, he would never have written  the letter which lured the man to his doom. And for two reasons: in the first  place he was too cowardly to risk his neck; and in the second Pine was of more  value to him alive than dead. Comforting himself with this reflection, he  managed to maintain a fairly calm demeanor before his wife.</p>
  <p>But  on this night Lady Garvington was particularly exasperating, for she constantly  asked questions which the husband did not feel inclined to answer. Having heard  that Lambert was in the village, she wished to know why he had not been asked  to stay at The Manor, and defended the young man when Garvington pointed out  that an iniquitous person who had robbed Agnes of two millions could not be  tolerated by the man&mdash;Garvington meant himself&mdash;he had wronged. Then Jane  inquired why Lambert had brought Chaldea to the house, and what had passed in  the library, but received no answer, save a growl. Finally she insisted that  Freddy had lost his appetite, which was perfectly true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I thought you liked that way of dressing a fish so much, dear,&rdquo; was her wail. &ldquo;I  never seem to quite hit your taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bother: leave me alone, Jane. I&rsquo;m worried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you are, for you have eaten so little. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s  the matter, confound your inquisitiveness. Hasn&rsquo;t Agnes lost all her money  because of this selfish marriage with Noel, hang him? How the dickens do you  expect us to carry on unless we borrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you get some money from the person who now inherits?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jarwin  won&rsquo;t tell me the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I know who it is,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington triumphantly. &ldquo;One of the servants who  went to the gypsy camp this afternoon told my maid, and my maid told me. The  gypsies are greatly excited, and no wonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Freddy  stared at her. &ldquo;Excited, what about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  about the money, dear. Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted Freddy, breaking a glass in his irritation. &ldquo;What is it?  Bother you, Jane. Don&rsquo;t keep me hanging on in suspense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I never do, Freddy, dear. It&rsquo;s Hubert&rsquo;s money which has gone to his  mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  jumped up. &ldquo;Who&mdash;who&mdash;who is his mother?&rdquo; he demanded, furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  dear old Gentilla Stanley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  What! What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Freddy,&rdquo; said his wife plaintively. &ldquo;You make my head ache. Yes, it&rsquo;s quite  true. Celestine had it from William the footman. Fancy, Gentilla having all  that money. How lucky she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  damn her; damn her,&rdquo; growled Garvington, breaking another glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  dear. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s going to make good use of the money. She says&mdash;so William  told Celestine&mdash;that she would give a million to learn for certain who murdered  poor Hubert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  she? would she? would she?&rdquo; Garvington&rsquo;s gooseberry eyes nearly dropped out of  his head, and he babbled, and burbled, and choked, and spluttered, until his  wife was quite alarmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Freddy,  you always eat too fast. Go and lie down, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Garvington, rapidly making up his mind to adopt a certain course about  which he wished his wife to know nothing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lie down, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t take any more wine,&rdquo; warned Jane, as she drifted out of the dining-room. &ldquo;You  are quite red as it is, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Freddy did not take this advice, but drank glass after glass until he became  pot-valiant. He needed courage, as he intended to go all by himself to the  lonely Abbot&rsquo;s Wood Cottage and interview Silver. It occurred to Freddy that if  he could induce the secretary to give up Miss Greeby to justice, Mother  Cockleshell, out of gratitude, might surrender to him the sum of one million  pounds. Of course, the old hag might have been talking all round the shop, and  her offer might be bluff, but it was worth taking into consideration.  Garvington, thinking that there was no time to lose, since his cousin might be  beforehand in denouncing the guilty woman, hurried on his fur overcoat, and  after leaving a lying statement with the butler that he had gone to bed, he  went out by the useful blue door. In a few minutes he was trotting along the  well-known path making up his mind what to say to Silver. The interview did not  promise to be an easy one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could do without him,&rdquo; thought the treacherous little scoundrel as he  left his own property and struck across the waste ground beyond the park wall. &ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t, dash it all, since he&rsquo;s the only person who saw the crime actually  committed. &lsquo;Course he&rsquo;ll get jailed as an accessory-after-the-fact: but when he  comes out I&rsquo;ll give him a thousand or so if the old woman parts. At all events,  I&rsquo;ll see what Silver is prepared to do, and then I&rsquo;ll call on old Cockleshell  and make things right with her. Hang it,&rdquo; Freddy had a qualmish feeling. &ldquo;The  exposure won&rsquo;t be pleasant for me over that unlucky letter, but if I can  snaffle a million, it&rsquo;s worth it. Curse the honor of the family, I&rsquo;ve got to  look after myself somehow. Ho! ho!&rdquo; he chuckled as he remembered his cousin. &ldquo;What  a sell for Noel when he finds that I&rsquo;ve taken the wind out of his sails. Serve  him jolly well right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way Garvington kept up his spirits during the walk, and felt entirely  cheerful and virtuous by the time he reached the cottage. In the thin, cold  moonlight, the wintry wood looked spectral and wan. The sight of the frowning  monoliths, the gaunt, frozen trees and the snow-powdered earth, made the  luxurious little man shiver. Also the anticipated conversation rather daunted  him, although he decided that after all Silver was but a feeble creature who  could be easily managed. What Freddy forgot was that he lacked pluck himself,  and that Silver, driven into a corner, might fight with the courage of despair.  The sight of the secretary&rsquo;s deadly white and terrified face as he opened the  door sufficient to peer out showed that he was at bay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you come in I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rdquo; he quavered, brokenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll brain you with the  poker. I&rsquo;ll throw hot water on you, and&mdash;and scratch out your&mdash;your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  come,&rdquo; said Garvington, boldly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me&mdash;a friend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  recognized the voice and the dumpy figure of his visitor. At once he dragged  him into the passage and barred the door quickly, breathing hard meanwhile. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind you,&rdquo; he giggled, hysterically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the same boat with me, my  lord. But I fancied when you knocked that the police&mdash;the police&rdquo;&mdash;his voice died  weakly in his throat: he cast a wild glance around and touched his neck  uneasily as though he already felt the hangman&rsquo;s rope encircling it.</p>
  <p>Garvington  did not approve of this grim pantomime, and swore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite alone, damn you,&rdquo;  he said roughly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, so far!&rdquo; He sat down and loosened his  overcoat, for the place was like a Turkish bath for heat. &ldquo;I want a drink. You&rsquo;ve  been priming yourself, I see,&rdquo; and he pointed to a decanter of port wine and a  bottle of brandy which were on the table along with a tray of glasses. &ldquo;Silly  ass you are to mix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;keeping  up my&mdash;my spirits,&rdquo; giggled Silver, wholly unnerved, and pouring out the brandy  with a shaking hand. &ldquo;There you are, my lord. There&rsquo;s water, but no soda.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeping  up your spirits by pouring spirits down,&rdquo; said Garvington, venturing on a weak  joke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a state of siege, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  certainly was. He had bolted the shutters, and had piled furniture against the  two windows of the room. On the table beside the decanter and bottles of  brandy, lay a poker, a heavy club which Lambert had brought from Africa, and  had left behind when he gave up the cottage, a revolver loaded in all six  chambers, and a large bread knife. Apparently the man was in a dangerous state  of despair and was ready to give the officers of the law a hostile welcome when  they came to arrest him. He touched the various weapons feverishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give them beans,&rdquo; he said, looking fearfully from right to left. &ldquo;Every door is  locked; every window is bolted. I&rsquo;ve heaped up chairs and sofas and tables and  chests of drawers, and wardrobes and mattresses against every opening to keep  the devils out. And the lamps&mdash;look at the lamps. Ugh!&rdquo; he shuddered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  bear to be in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty  of light,&rdquo; observed Garvington, and spoke truly, for there must have been at  least six lamps in the room&mdash;two on the table, two on the mantel-piece, and a  couple on the sideboard. And amidst his primitive defences sat Silver quailing  and quivering at every sound, occasionally pouring brandy down his throat to  keep up his courage.</p>
  <p>The  white looks of the man, the disorder of the room, the glare of the many lights,  and the real danger of the situation, communicated their thrill to Garvington.  He shivered and looked into shadowy corners, as Silver did; then strove to  reassure both himself and his companion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry so,&rdquo; he said, sipping his  brandy to keep him up to concert pitch, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea which will be good  for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; questioned the secretary cautiously. He naturally did not trust the man  who had betrayed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know who has inherited Pine&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The person named in the sealed envelope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,  and the person is Mother Cockleshell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  was so amazed that he forgot his fright. &ldquo;What? Is Gentilla Stanley related to  Pine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  his grandmother, it seems. One of my servants was at the camp to-day and found  the gypsies greatly excited over the old cat&rsquo;s windfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  Silver whistled and drew a deep breath. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known that, I&rsquo;d have got round  the old woman. But it&rsquo;s too late now since all the fat is on the fire. Mr.  Lambert knows too much, and you have confessed what should have been kept  quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to save my own skin,&rdquo; said Garvington sullenly. &ldquo;After all, I had nothing  to do with the murder. I never guessed that you were so mixed up in it until  Lambert brought that bullet to fit the revolver I lent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  which I gave to Miss Greeby,&rdquo; snapped Silver tartly. &ldquo;She is the criminal, not  me. What a wax she will be in when she learns the truth. I expect your cousin  will have her arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. He has some silly idea in his head about the honor of our name,  and won&rsquo;t press matters unless he is forced to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  can force him?&rdquo; asked Silver, looking more at ease, since he saw a gleam of  hope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chaldea!  She&rsquo;s death on making trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  we silence her? Remember you swing on my hook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; contradicted Garvington sharply. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  forging that letter you can!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I did not write it to lure Pine to his death, but only wished to maim  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will get you into trouble,&rdquo; insisted Silver, anxious to have a companion in  misery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t, I tell you. There&rsquo;s no one to prosecute. You are the person who is in  danger, as you knew Miss Greeby to be guilty, and are therefore an accessory  after the fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Mr. Lambert has the honor of your family at heart he will do nothing,&rdquo; said the  secretary hopefully; &ldquo;for if Miss Greeby is arrested along with me the writing  of that letter is bound to come out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s worth a million.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is worth a million?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  exposure. See here, Silver, I hear that Mother Cockleshell is willing to hand  over that sum to the person who finds the murderer of her grandson. We know  that Miss Greeby is guilty, so why not give her up and earn the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  secretary rose in quivering alarm. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be arrested also. You said so; you  know you said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I say so again,&rdquo; remarked Garvington, leaning back coolly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d not be  hanged, you know, although she would. A few years in prison would be your  little lot and when you came out I could give you say&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;ten thousand  pounds. There! That&rsquo;s a splendid offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  would you get the ten thousand? Tell me!&rdquo; asked Silver with a curious look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the million Mother Cockleshell would hand over to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  denouncing me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  denouncing Miss Greeby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  beast!&rdquo; shrieked Silver hysterically. &ldquo;You know quite well that if she is taken  by the police I have no chance of escaping. I&rsquo;d run away now if I had the cash.  But I haven&rsquo;t. I count on your cousin keeping quiet because of your family  name, and you shan&rsquo;t give the show away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  think,&rdquo; said Garvington, persuasively, &ldquo;a whole million.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  you, and only ten thousand for me. Oh, I like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll make it twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty  thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forty,  fifty, sixty, seventy&mdash;oh, hang it, you greedy beast! I&rsquo;ll give you one hundred  thousand. You&rsquo;d be rich for life then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  I, curse you!&rdquo; Silver clenched his fists and backed against the wall looking  decidedly dangerous. &ldquo;And risk a life-long sentence to get the money while you  take the lion&rsquo;s share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  only get ten years at most,&rdquo; argued the visitor, annoyed by what he considered to  be silly objections.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  years are ten centuries at my time of life. You shan&rsquo;t denounce me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Garvington  rose. &ldquo;Yes, I shall,&rdquo; he declared, rendered desperate by the dread lest he  should lose the million. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Wanbury to-night to tell Inspector Darby  and get a warrant for Miss Greeby&rsquo;s arrest along with yours as her accomplice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  flung himself forward and gripped Garvington&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;You daren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I dare. I can&rsquo;t be hurt. I didn&rsquo;t murder the man and I&rsquo;m not going to lose a  pile of money for your silly scruples.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my lord, consider.&rdquo; Silver in a panic dropped on his knees. &ldquo;I shall be shut up  for years; it will kill me; it will kill me! And you don&rsquo;t know what a terrible  and clever woman Miss Greeby is. She may deny that I gave her the revolver and  I can&rsquo;t prove that I did. Then I might be accused of the crime and hanged.  Hanged!&rdquo; cried the poor wretch miserably. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll never give me away, my  lord, will you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  you, don&rsquo;t I risk my reputation to get the money,&rdquo; raged Garvington, shaking  off the trembling arms which were round his knees. &ldquo;The truth of the letter  will have to come out, and then I&rsquo;m dished so far as society is concerned. I  wouldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;tell that is&mdash;but that the stakes are so large. One million is  waiting to be picked up and I&rsquo;m going to pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! no! no!&rdquo; Silver grovelled on the floor and embraced Garvington&rsquo;s feet. But  the more he wailed the more insulting and determined did the visitor become.  Like all tyrants and bullies Garvington gained strength and courage from the  increased feebleness of his victim. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me up,&rdquo; wept the secretary,  nearly beside himself with terror; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  damn you, get out of the way!&rdquo; said Garvington, and made for the door. &ldquo;I go  straight to Wanbury,&rdquo; which statement was a lie, as he first intended to see  Mother Cockleshell at the camp and make certain that the reward was safe. But  Silver believed him and was goaded to frenzy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shan&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; he screamed, leaping to his feet, and before Garvington knew where  he was the secretary had the heavy poker in his grasp. The little fat lord gave  a cry of terror and dodged the first blow which merely fell on his shoulder.  But the second alighted on his head and with a moan he dropped to the ground.  Silver flung away the poker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you dead? are you dead?&rdquo; he gasped, kneeling beside Garvington, and placed his  hand on the senseless man&rsquo;s heart. It still beat feebly, so he arose with a  sigh of relief. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only stunned,&rdquo; panted Silver, and staggered unsteadily to  the table to seize a glass of brandy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, ah&mdash;ah&mdash;ah!&rdquo; he shrieked and dropped  the tumbler as a loud and continuous knocking came to the front door.</p>
  <p>Naturally  in his state of panic he believed that the police had actually arrived, and  here he had struck down Lord Garvington. Even though the little man was not  dead, Silver knew that the assault would add to his punishment, although he  might have concluded that the lesser crime was swallowed up in the greater. But  he was too terrified to think of doing anything save hiding the stunned man,  and with a gigantic effort he managed to fling the body behind the sofa. Then  he piled up rugs and cushions between the wall and the back of the sofa until  Garvington was quite hidden and ran a considerable risk of being suffocated.  All the time the ominous knocking continued, as though the gallows was being  constructed. At least it seemed so to Silver&rsquo;s disturbed fancy, and he crept  along to the door holding the revolver in an unsteady grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me in; let me in,&rdquo; said a loud, hard voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Greeby. I have come to  save you. Let me in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silver  had no hesitation in obeying, since she was in as much danger as he was and  could not hurt him without hurting herself. With trembling fingers he unbolted  the door and opened it, to find her tall and stately and tremendously impatient  on the threshold. She stepped in and banged the door to without locking it.  Silver&rsquo;s teeth chattered so much and his limbs trembled so greatly that he  could scarcely move or speak. On seeing this&mdash;for there was a lamp in the  passage&mdash;Miss Greeby picked him up in her big arms like a baby and made for the  sitting-room. When, within she pitched Silver on to the sofa behind which  Garvington lay senseless, and placing her arms akimbo surveyed him viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  infernal worm!&rdquo; said Miss Greeby, grim and savage in her looks, &ldquo;you have split  on me, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;how  do you know?&rdquo; quavered Silver mechanically, noting that in her long driving  coat with a man&rsquo;s cap she looked more masculine than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I know? Because Chaldea was hiding under the studio window this afternoon  and overheard all that passed between you and Garvington and that meddlesome  Lambert. She knew that I was in danger and came at once to London to tell me  since I had given her my address. I lost no time, but motored down here and  dropped her at the camp. Now I&rsquo;ve come to get you out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  out of the country?&rdquo; stammered the secretary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you cowardly swine, although I&rsquo;d rather choke the life out of you if it could  be done with safety. You denounced me, you beast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to; my own neck was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  in danger now. I&rsquo;d strangle you for two pins. But I intend to send you abroad  since your evidence is dangerous to me. If you are out of the way there&rsquo;s no  one else can state that I shot Pine. Here&rsquo;s twenty pounds in gold;&rdquo; she thrust  a canvas bag into the man&rsquo;s shaking hands; &ldquo;get on your coat and cap and I&rsquo;ll  take you to the nearest seaport wherever that is. My motor is on the verge of  the wood. You must get on board some ship and sail for the world&rsquo;s end. I&rsquo;ll  send you more money when you write. Come, come,&rdquo; she stamped, &ldquo;sharp&rsquo;s the  word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby lifted him off the sofa by the scruff of the neck. &ldquo;Do you want to be  killed?&rdquo; she said between her teeth, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no time to be lost. Chaldea tells  me that Lambert threatens to have me arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  prospect of safety and prosperity in a distant land so appealed to Silver that  he regained his courage in a wonderfully short space of time. Rising to his  feet he hastily drained another glass of brandy and the color came back to his  wan cheeks. But for all the quantity he had drank that same evening he was not  in the least intoxicated. He was about to rush out of the room to get his coat  and cap when Miss Greeby laid a heavy hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there any one else in the house?&rdquo; she asked suspiciously.</p>
  <p>Silver  cast a glance towards the sofa. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no servant,&rdquo; he said in a stronger  voice. &ldquo;I have been cooking and looking after myself since I came here.  But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what, you hound?&rdquo; she shook him fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington&rsquo;s  behind the sofa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garvington!&rdquo;  Miss Greeby was on the spot in a moment pulling away the concealing rugs and  cushions. &ldquo;Have you murdered him?&rdquo; she demanded, drawing a deep breath and  looking at the senseless man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he&rsquo;s only stunned. I struck him with the poker because he wanted to denounce  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right.&rdquo; Miss Greeby patted the head of her accomplice as if he were a child, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  bolder than I thought. Go on; hurry up! Before Garvington recovers his senses  we&rsquo;ll be far enough away. Denounce me; denounce him, will you?&rdquo; she said,  looking at Garvington while the secretary slipped out of the room; &ldquo;you do so  at your own cost, my lord. That forged letter won&rsquo;t tell in your favor. Ha!&rdquo;  she started to her feet. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that! Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  might well ask. There was a struggle going on in the passage, and she heard  cries for help. Miss Greeby flung open the sitting-room door, and Silver,  embracing Mother Cockleshell, tumbled at her feet. &ldquo;She got in by the door you  left open,&rdquo; cried Silver breathlessly, &ldquo;hold her or we are lost; we&rsquo;ll never  get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted the dishevelled old woman, producing a knife to keep Miss  Greeby at bay. &ldquo;Chaldea came to the camp and I learned through Kara how she&rsquo;d  brought you down, my Gentile lady. I went to tell the golden rye, and he&rsquo;s on  the way here with the village policeman. You&rsquo;re done for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet.&rdquo; Miss Greeby darted under the uplifted knife and caught Gentilla round the  waist. The next moment the old woman was flung against the wall, breathless and  broken up. But she still contrived to hurl curses at the murderess of her  grandson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw you shoot him; I saw you shoot him,&rdquo; screamed Mother Cockleshell, trying to  rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silver,  make for the motor; it&rsquo;s near the camp; follow the path,&rdquo; ordered Miss Greeby  breathlessly; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no time to be lost. As to this old devil&mdash;&rdquo; she snatched  up a lamp as the secretary dashed out of the house, and flung it fairly at  Gentilla Stanley. In a moment the old woman was yelling with agony, and  scrambled to her feet a pillar of fire. Miss Greeby laughed in a taunting  manner and hurled another lamp behind the sofa. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have given me up also,  would you, Garvington?&rdquo; she cried in her deep tone; &ldquo;take that, and that, and  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lamp  after lamp was smashed and burst into flames, until only one was left. Then  Miss Greeby, seeing with satisfaction that the entire room was on fire and  hearing the sound of hasty footsteps and the echoing of distant voices, rushed  in her turn from the cottage. As she bolted the voice of Garvington screaming  with pain and dread was heard as he came to his senses to find himself  encircled by fire. And Mother Cockleshell also shrieked, not so much because of  her agony as to stop Miss Greeby from escaping.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rye!  Rye! she&rsquo;s running; catch her; catch her. Aha&mdash;aha&mdash;aha!&rdquo; and she sank into the  now blazing furnace of the room.</p>
  <p>The  walls of the cottage were of mud, the partitions and roof of wood and thatch,  so the whole place soon burned like a bonfire. Miss Greeby shot out of the door  and strode at a quick pace across the glade. But as she passed beyond the  monoliths, Lambert, in company with a policeman, made a sudden appearance and  blocked her way of escape. With a grim determination to thwart him she kilted  up her skirts and leaped like a kangaroo towards the undergrowth beneath the  leafless trees. By this time the flames were shooting through the thatched roof  in long scarlet streamers and illuminated the spectral wood with awful light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  stop!&rdquo; cried Lambert, racing to cut off the woman&rsquo;s retreat, closely followed  by the constable.</p>
  <p>Miss  Greeby laughed scornfully, and instead of avoiding them as they crossed her  path, she darted straight towards the pair. In a moment, by a dexterous touch  of her shoulders right and left, she knocked them over by taking them unawares,  and then sprang down the path which curved towards the gypsies&rsquo; encampment. At  its end the motor was waiting, and so vivid was the light that she saw Silver&rsquo;s  black figure bending down as he frantically strove to start the machine. She  travelled at top speed, fearful lest the man should escape without her.</p>
  <p>Then  came an onrush of Romany, attracted to the glade by the fire. They guessed from  Miss Greeby&rsquo;s haste that something was seriously wrong and tried to stop her.  But, delivering blows straight from the shoulder, here, there, and everywhere,  the woman managed to break through, and finally reached the end of the pathway.  Here was the motor and safety, since she hoped to make a dash for the nearest  seaport and get out of the kingdom before the police authorities could act.</p>
  <p>But  the stars in their course fought against her. Silver, having started the  machinery, was already handling the steering gear, and bent only upon saving  his own miserable self, had put the car in motion. He could only drive in a  slip-slop amateur way and aimlessly zigzagged down the sloping bank which fell  away to the high road. As the motor began to gather speed Miss Greeby ran for  her life and liberty, ranging at length breathlessly alongside. The gypsies  tailed behind, shouting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop,  you beast!&rdquo; screamed Miss Greeby, feeling fear for the first time, and she  tried to grab the car for the purpose of swinging herself on board.</p>
  <p>But  Silver urged it to greater speed. &ldquo;I save myself; myself,&rdquo; he shrieked shrilly  and unhinged by deadly terror, &ldquo;get away; get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  his panic he twisted the wheel in the wrong direction, and the big machine  swerved obediently. The next moment Miss Greeby was knocked down and writhed  under the wheels. She uttered a tragic cry, but little Silver cared for that.  Rendered merciless with fear he sent the car right over her body, and then  drove desperately down the hill to gain the hard road. Miss Greeby, with a  broken back, lay on the ground and saw as in a ghastly dream her machine flash  roaring along the highway driven by a man who could not manage it. Even in her  pain a smile crept over her pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  done for, the little beast,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll smash. Lambert! Lambert!&rdquo; The  man whose name she breathed had arrived as she spoke; and knelt breathlessly  beside her to raise her head. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;oh, poor creature!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  done for, Lambert,&rdquo; she panted in deadly pain, &ldquo;back broken. I sinned for you,  but&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t hang me. Look&mdash;look after Garvington&mdash;Cockleshell  too&mdash;look&mdash;look&mdash;Augh!&rdquo; and she moaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;cottage,&rdquo;  murmured the woman, and fell back in a fainting condition with a would-be  sneering laugh.</p>
  <p>Lambert  started to his feet with an oath, and leaving the wretched woman to the care of  some gypsies, ran back to the glade. The cottage was a mass of streaming,  crackling flames, and there was no water to extinguish these, as he realized  with sudden fear. It was terrible to think that the old woman and Garvington  were burning in that furnace, and desperately anxious to save at least one of  the two, Lambert tried to enter the door. But the heat of the fire drove him  back, and the flames seemed to roar at his discomfiture. He could do nothing  but stand helplessly and gaze upon what was plainly Garvington&rsquo;s funeral pyre.</p>
  <p>By  this time the villagers were making for the wood, and the whole place rang with  cries of excitement and dismay. The wintry scene was revealed only too clearly  by the ruddy glare and by the same sinister light. Lambert suddenly beheld  Chaldea at his elbow. Gripping his arm, she spoke hoarsely, &ldquo;The tiny rye is  dead. He drove the engine over a bank and it smashed him to a pulp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  ah! And&mdash;and Miss Greeby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  clenched his hands and groaned, &ldquo;Garvington and Mother Cockleshell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dead and he is dead by now,&rdquo; said Chaldea, looking with a callous smile at  the burning cottage, &ldquo;both are dead&mdash;Lord Garvington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  Garvington?&rdquo; Lambert groaned again. He had forgotten that he now possessed the  title and what remained of the family estates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Avali!&rdquo;  cried Chaldea, clapping her hands and nodding toward the cottage with a meaning  smile, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the bonfire to celebrate the luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>Chapter XXI<br>
    A Final Surprise</b></h2>
  <p>A  week later and Lambert was seated in the library of The Manor, looking worn and  anxious. His wan appearance was not due so much to what he had passed through,  trying as late events had been, as to his dread of what Inspector Darby was  about to say. That officer was beside him, getting ready for an immediate  conversation by turning over various papers which he produced from a large and  well-filled pocket-book. Darby looked complacent and important, as an  examination into the late tragedy had added greatly to his reputation as a  zealous officer. Things were now more ship-shape, as Miss Greeby had died after  making confession of her crime and had been duly buried by her shocked  relatives. The ashes of Lord Garvington and Mother Cockleshell, recovered from  the d&eacute;bris of the cottage, had also been disposed of with religious ceremonies,  and Silver&rsquo;s broken body had been placed in an unwept grave. The frightful  catastrophe which had resulted in the death of four people had been the talk of  the United Kingdom for the entire seven days.</p>
  <p>What  Lambert was dreading to hear was the report of Miss Greeby&rsquo;s confession, which  Inspector Darby had come to talk about. He had tried to see her himself at the  village inn, whither she had been transferred to die, but she had refused to  let him come to her dying bed, and therefore he did not know in what state of  mind she had passed away. Judging from the vindictive spirit which she had  displayed, Lambert fancied that she had told Darby the whole wretched story of  the forged letter and the murder. The last was bound to be confessed, but the  young man had hoped against hope that Miss Greeby would be silent regarding  Garvington&rsquo;s share in the shameful plot. Wickedly as his cousin had behaved,  Lambert did not wish his memory to be smirched and the family honor to be  tarnished by a revelation of the little man&rsquo;s true character. He heartily  wished that the evil Garvington had done might be buried with him, and the  whole sordid affair forgotten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  my lord,&rdquo; said Darby leisurely, when his papers were in order, &ldquo;I have to  congratulate your lordship on your accession to the title. Hitherto so busy  have I been that there has been no time to do this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Mr. Inspector, but I regret that I should have succeeded through so tragic  a death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, my lord! the feeling does you honor,&rdquo; Darby nodded sympathetically; &ldquo;but  it must be some comfort for you to know that your poor cousin perished when on  an errand of mercy, although his aim was not perhaps quite in accordance with  strict justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  stared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; he remarked, being puzzled by this  coupling of Garvington&rsquo;s name with any good deed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you don&rsquo;t, my lord. But for you to understand I had better begin with  Miss Greeby&rsquo;s confession. I must touch on some rather intimate things, however,&rdquo;  said the inspector rather shyly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning  that Miss Greeby was in love with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,  my lord. Her love for you&mdash;if you will excuse my mentioning so private a  subject&mdash;caused the whole catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  the young man felt a sense of relief, as if Darby put the matter in this way  the truth about the forged letter could scarcely have come to light, &ldquo;will you  explain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  my lord. Miss Greeby always wished to marry your lordship, but she knew that  you loved your wife, the present Lady Garvington, who was then Lady Agnes Pine.  She believed that you and Lady Agnes would sooner or later run away together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no reason she should think so,&rdquo; said Noel, becoming scarlet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not, my lord. Pardon me again for speaking of such very private matters.  But I can scarcely make your lordship understand how the late Sir Hubert Pine  came by his death unless I am painfully frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, Mr. Inspector,&rdquo; Noel leaned back and folded his arms. &ldquo;Be frank to the  verge of rudeness, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, no, my lord; certainly not,&rdquo; Darby said in a shocked manner. &ldquo;I will be as  delicate as I possibly can. Well, then, my lord, Miss Greeby, thinking that you  might elope with the then Lady Agnes Pine, resolved to place an even greater  barrier between you than the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  could be a possibly greater barrier?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  honor, my lord, your strict sense of honor. Miss Greeby thought that if she got  rid of Sir Hubert, and Lady Agnes was in possession of the millions, that you  would never risk her losing the same for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was right in supposing that, Mr. Inspector, but how did Miss Greeby know that  Lady Agnes would lose the money if she married me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Hubert told her so himself, my lord, when she discovered that he was at the  Abbot&rsquo;s Wood camp under the name of Ishmael Hearne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  real name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, my lord; of course. And having made this discovery and knowing how  jealous Sir Hubert was of his wife&mdash;if you will pardon my mentioning the  fact&mdash;Miss Greeby laid a trap to lure him to The Manor that he might be shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  listener moved uneasily, and he now quite expected to hear the revelation of  Garvington&rsquo;s forgery. &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Greeby,&rdquo; pursued the officer, glancing at his notes, &ldquo;knew that the late Mark  Silver, who was Sir Hubert&rsquo;s secretary, was not well disposed toward his  employer, as he fancied that he had been cheated out of the proceeds of certain  inventions. Miss Greeby worked on this point and induced Silver to forge a  letter purporting to come from Lady Agnes to you saying that an elopement had  been arranged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Lambert drew a breath of relief, &ldquo;so Silver laid a trap, did he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lord, and a very clever one. The letter was arranged by Silver to fall into  Sir Hubert&rsquo;s hands. That unfortunate gentleman came to the blue door at the  appointed time, then Miss Greeby, who had climbed out of the window of her  bedroom to hide in the shrubbery, shot the unsuspecting man. She then got back into  her room&mdash;and a very clever climber she must have been, my lord&mdash;and afterward  mingled with the guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why did she think of luring Sir Hubert to be shot?&rdquo; asked Noel with feigned  ignorance, &ldquo;when she ran such a risk of being discovered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  my lord, therein lies the cleverness of the idea. Poor Lord Garvington had  threatened to shoot any burglar, and that gave Miss Greeby the idea. It was her  hope that your late cousin might kill Sir Hubert by mistaking him for a robber,  and she only posted herself in the shrubbery to shoot if Sir Hubert was not  killed. He was not, as we know that the shot fired by Lord Garvington only  broke his arm. Miss Greeby made sure by killing him herself, and very cleverly  she did so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about my late cousin&rsquo;s philanthropic visit to Silver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  my lord, that was a mistake. His lordship was informed of the forged letter by  Chaldea the gypsy girl, who found it in Sir Hubert&rsquo;s tent, and for the sake of  your family wished to get Silver out of the country. It would have been  dreadful&mdash;as Lord Garvington rightly considered&mdash;that the name of his sister and  your name should be mentioned in connection with an elopement even though it  was untrue. He therefore went to induce Silver to leave the country, but the  man, instead of being grateful, stunned his lordship with a blow from a poker  which he had picked up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was that known, Mr. Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Greeby had the truth from his own lips. Silver threatened to denounce her, and  knowing this Chaldea went to London to warn her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  muttered Lambert, thinking of what Gentilla Stanley had said, &ldquo;how did she find  out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  overheard a conversation between Silver and Lord Garvington in the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  was relieved again, since Miss Greeby had not evidently mentioned him as being  mixed up with the matter. &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Inspector, I can guess the rest. This  unfortunate woman came down to get Silver, who could have hanged her, out of  the country, and he set fire to the cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  set fire to it,&rdquo; corrected Darby quickly, &ldquo;by chance, as she told me, she  overturned a lamp. Of course, Lord Garvington, being senseless, was burned to  death. Gentilla Stanley was also burned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did she come to be there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it seems that Gentilla followed Hearne&mdash;he was her grandson I hear from the  gypsies&mdash;to The Manor on that night and saw the shooting. But she said nothing,  not feeling sure if her unsupported testimony would be sufficient to convict  Miss Greeby. However, she watched that lady and followed her to the cottage to  denounce her and prevent the escape of Silver&mdash;who knew the truth also, as she  ascertained. Silver knocked the old woman down and stunned her, so she also was  burned to death. Then Silver ran for the motor car and crushed Miss  Greeby&mdash;since he could not manage the machine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he crush her on purpose, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Darby after a pause, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Miss Greeby was rich, and if the  pair of them had escaped Silver would have been able to extort money. He no  more killed her than he killed himself by dashing into that chalk pit near the  road. It was mismanagement of the motor in both cases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  was quiet for a time. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he asked, looking up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All,  my lord,&rdquo; answered the inspector, gathering his papers together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  anything else likely to appear in the papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  noted,&rdquo; said Lambert slowly, &ldquo;that there was no mention of the forged letter  made at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darby  nodded. &ldquo;I arranged that, my lord, since the forged letter made so free with  your lordship&rsquo;s name and that of the present Lady Garvington. As you probably  saw, it was only stated that the late Sir Hubert had gone to meet his secretary  at The Manor and that Miss Greeby, knowing of his coming, had shot him. The  motive was ascribed as anger at the late Sir Hubert for having lost a great sum  of money which Miss Greeby entrusted to him for the purpose of speculation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is it true that such money was entrusted and lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  true, my lord. I saw in that fact a chance of hiding the real truth. It would  do no good to make the forged letter public and would cast discredit both on  the dead and the living. Therefore all that has been said does not even hint at  the trap laid by Silver. Now that all parties concerned are dead and buried, no  more will be heard of the matter, and your lordship can sleep in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man walked up and down the room for a few minutes while the inspector  made ready to depart. Noel was deeply touched by the man&rsquo;s consideration and  made up his mind that he should not lose by the delicacy he had shown in  preserving his name and that of Agnes from the tongue of gossips. He saw  plainly that Darby was a man he could thoroughly trust and forthwith did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Inspector,&rdquo; he said, coming forward to shake hands, &ldquo;you have acted in a most  kind and generous manner and I cannot show my appreciation of your behavior  more than by telling you the exact truth of this sad affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the truth,&rdquo; said Darby staring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the exact truth, which closely concerns the honor of my family. But as you have  saved that by suppressing certain evidence it is only right that you should  know more than you do know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall keep quiet anything that you tell me, my lord,&rdquo; said Darby greatly  pleased; &ldquo;that is, anything that is consistent with my official duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. Also I wish you to know exactly how matters stand, since there may be  trouble with Chaldea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t think so, my lord. Chaldea has married that dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kara,  the Servian gypsy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She&rsquo;s given him a bad time, and he put up with it because he had no authority  over her; but now that she&rsquo;s his romi&mdash;as these people call a wife&mdash;he&rsquo;ll make  her dance to his playing. They left England yesterday for foreign  parts&mdash;Hungary, I fancy, my lord. The girl won&rsquo;t come back in a hurry, for Kara  will keep an eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lambert  drew a long breath of relief. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;as I never should  have felt safe while she remained in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Felt  safe?&rdquo; echoed the officer suspiciously.</p>
  <p>His  host nodded and told the man to take a seat again. Then, without wasting  further time, he related the real truth about the forged letter. Darby listened  to the recital in amazement and shook his head sadly over the delinquency of  the late Lord Garvington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  Well!&rdquo; said the inspector staring, &ldquo;to think as a nobleman born and bred should  act in this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t a nobleman be wicked as well as the grocer?&rdquo; said Lambert  impatiently, &ldquo;and according to the socialistic press all the evil of humanity  is to be found in aristocratic circles. However, you know the exact truth, Mr.  Inspector, and I have confided to you the secret which concerns the honor of my  family. You won&rsquo;t abuse my confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darby  rose and extended his hand. &ldquo;You may be sure of that, my lord. What you have  told me will never be repeated. Everything in connection with this matter is  finished, and you will hear no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad and thankful,&rdquo; said the other, again drawing a breath of relief, &ldquo;and to  show my appreciation of your services, Darby, I shall send you a substantial  check.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my lord, I couldn&rsquo;t take it. I only did my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you did a great deal more than that,&rdquo; answered the new Lord Garvington  dryly, &ldquo;and had you acted entirely on the evidence you gathered together, and  especially on the confession of that miserable woman, you might have made  public much that I would prefer to keep private. Take the money from a friend,  Darby, and as a mark of esteem for a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my lord,&rdquo; replied the inspector straightly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny but what my  conscience and my duty to the Government will allow me to take it since you put  it in that way. And as I am not a rich man the money will be welcome. Thank  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a warm hand-shake the inspector took his departure and Noel offered up a silent  prayer of thankfulness to God that things had turned out so admirably. His  shifty cousin was now dead and there was no longer any danger that the honor of  the family, for which so much had been sacrificed, both by himself and Agnes,  would be smirched. The young man regretted the death of Mother Cockleshell, who  had been so well disposed toward his wife and himself, but he rejoiced that  Chaldea had left England under the guardianship of Kara, as henceforth&mdash;if he  knew anything of the dwarf&rsquo;s jealous disposition&mdash;the girl would trouble him no  more. And Silver was dead and buried, which did away with any possible trouble  coming from that quarter. Finally, poor Miss Greeby, who had sinned for love,  was out of the way and there was no need to be anxious on her account. Fate had  made a clean sweep of all the actors in the tragedy, and Lambert hoped that  this particular play was ended.</p>
  <p>When  the inspector went away, Lord Garvington sought out his wife and his late  cousin&rsquo;s widow. To them he reported all that had passed and gave them the  joyful assurance that nothing more would be heard in connection with the late  tragic events. Both ladies were delighted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Freddy,&rdquo; sighed Agnes, who had quite forgiven her brother now that he had paid  for his sins, &ldquo;he behaved very badly; all the same he had his good points,  Noel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  he had, he had,&rdquo; said Lady Garvington, the widow, shaking her untidy head, &ldquo;he  was selfish and greedy, and perhaps not so thoughtful as he might have been,  but there are worse people than poor Freddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noel  could not help smiling at this somewhat guarded eulogy of the dead, but did not  pursue the subject. &ldquo;Well, Jane, you must not grieve too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I shall not,&rdquo; she admitted bluntly, &ldquo;I am going to be quiet for a few months  and then perhaps I may marry again. But I shall marry a man who lives on nuts  and roots, my dear Noel. Never again,&rdquo; she shuddered, &ldquo;shall I bother about the  kitchen. I shall burn Freddy&rsquo;s recipes and cookery books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady  Garvington evidently really felt relieved by the death of her greedy little  husband, although she tried her best to appear sorry. But the twinkle of relief  in her eyes betrayed her, and neither Noel nor Agnes could blame her. She had  enough to live on&mdash;since the new lord had arranged this in a most generous  manner&mdash;and she was free from the cares of the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I&rsquo;ll go to London in a few days when I&rsquo;ve packed up,&rdquo; said the widow nodding, &ldquo;you  two dears can stay here for your second honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be concerned with pounds, shillings, and pence, then,&rdquo; said Agnes with a  smile, &ldquo;for Noel has to get the estate put in order. Things are very bad just  now, as I know for certain. But we must try to save The Manor from going out of  the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was at this moment, and while the trio wondered how the financial condition of  the Lamberts was to be improved, that a message came saying that Mr. Jarwin  wished to see Lord and Lady Garvington in the library. Wondering what the  lawyer had come about, and dreading further bad news, the young couple  descended, leaving the widow to her packing up. They found the lean, dry  solicitor waiting for them with a smiling face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Agnes as she greeted him, &ldquo;then it&rsquo;s not bad news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary,&rdquo; said Jarwin, with his cough, &ldquo;it is the best of news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noel  looked at him hard. &ldquo;The best of news to me at the present moment would be  information about money,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I have a title, it is true, but the  estate is much encumbered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need not trouble about that, Lord Garvington; Mrs. Stanley has put all that  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  asked Agnes greatly agitated. &ldquo;Has she made over the mortgages to Noel? Oh, if  she only has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has done better than that,&rdquo; remarked Jarwin, producing a paper of no great  size, &ldquo;this is her will. She wanted to make a deed of gift, and probably would  have done so had she lived. But luckily she made the will&mdash;and a hard-and-fast  one it is&mdash;for I drew it up myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Jarwin complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  does the will concern us?&rdquo; asked Agnes, catching Noel&rsquo;s hand with a tremor, for  she could scarcely grasp the hints of the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Stanley, my dear lady, had a great regard for you since you nursed her through  a dangerous illness. Also you were, as she put it, a good and true wife to her  grandson. Therefore, as she approved of you and of your second marriage, she  has left the entire fortune of your late husband to you and to Lord Garvington  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  cried Lambert growing pale, while his wife gasped with astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, and here is the proof,&rdquo; Jarwin shook the parchment, &ldquo;one million to  you, Lord Garvington, and one million to your wife. Listen, if you please,&rdquo; and  the solicitor read the document in a formal manner which left no doubt as to  the truth of his amazing news. When he finished the lucky couple looked at one  another scarcely able to speak. It was Agnes who recovered her voice first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it can&rsquo;t be true&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Noel, pinch me, for I must be  dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, as the will gives you to understand,&rdquo; said the lawyer, smiling in his  dry way, &ldquo;and if I may be permitted to say so, Lady Garvington, never was money  more rightfully inherited. You surrendered everything for the sake of true  love, and it is only just that you should be rewarded. If Mrs. Stanley had  lived she intended to keep five or six thousand for herself so that she could transport  certain gypsies to America, but she would undoubtedly have made a deed of gift  of the rest of the property. Oh, what a very fortunate thing it was that she  made this will,&rdquo; cried Jarwin, genuinely moved at the thought of the possible  loss of the millions, &ldquo;for her unforeseen death would have spoiled everything  if I had not the forethought to suggest the testament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is to you we owe our good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Mrs. Gentilla Stanley&mdash;and to me partially. I only ask for my reward that you  will continue to allow me to see after the property. The fees,&rdquo; added Jarwin  with his dry cough, &ldquo;will be considerable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can rob us if you like,&rdquo; said Noel, slapping him on the back. &ldquo;Well, to say  that I am glad is to speak weakly. I am overjoyed. With this money we can  restore the fortunes of the family again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will be placed higher than they have ever been before,&rdquo; cried Agnes with a  shining face. &ldquo;Two millions. Oh, what a lot of good we can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  yourselves?&rdquo; inquired Jarwin dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to others also,&rdquo; said Lambert gravely. &ldquo;God has been so good to us that we must  be good to others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  be good to me, Lord Garvington,&rdquo; said the solicitor, putting away the will in  his bag, &ldquo;for I am dying of hunger. A little luncheon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very big one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am no great eater,&rdquo; said Jarwin, and walked toward the door, &ldquo;a wash and  brush-up and a plate of soup will satisfy me. And I will say again what I said  before to both of you, that you thoroughly deserve your good fortune. Lord  Garvington, you are the luckier of the two, as you have a wife who is far above  rubies, and&mdash;and&mdash;dear me, I am talking romance. So foolish at my age. To  think&mdash;well&mdash;well, I am extremely hungry, so don&rsquo;t let luncheon be long before it  appears,&rdquo; and with a croaking laugh at his jokes the lawyer disappeared.</p>
  <p>Left  alone the fortunate couple fell into one another&rsquo;s arms. It seemed incredible  that the past storm should have been succeeded by so wonderful a calm. They had  been tested by adversity, and they had proved themselves to be of sterling  metal. Before them the future stretched in a long, smooth road under sunny blue  skies, and behind them the black clouds, out of which they had emerged, were  dispersing into thin air. Evil passes, good endures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  millions!&rdquo; sighed Agnes joyfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  red money,&rdquo; remarked her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you call it that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother  Cockleshell&mdash;bless her!&mdash;called it so because it was tainted with blood. But we  must cleanse the stains, Agnes, by using much of it to help all that are in  trouble. God has been good in settling our affairs in this way, but He has  given me a better gift than the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo; asked Lady Garvington softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  love of my dear wife,&rdquo; said the happiest of men to the happiest of women.</p>
