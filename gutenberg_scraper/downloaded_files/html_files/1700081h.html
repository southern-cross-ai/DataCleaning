  <p class="poem">The  stone had its birth in the nurturing earth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its home in the heart of the main,<br>
  From the coraline caves it was tossed by the waves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the breast of an aureate plain;<br>
  And the spirits who dwell in the nethermost hell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stored fire in its bosom of white;<br>
  The sylphs of the air made it gracious and fair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blue of the firmament&rsquo;s height.</p>
  <p class="poem">The  dull gnomes I ween, gave it glittering sheen.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till yellow as gold it became:<br>
  The nymphs of the sea made the opal to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beacon of emerald flame.</p>
  <p class="poem">The  many tints glow, they come and they go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At bidding of spirits abhorr&rsquo;d,<br>
  When one ray is bright, in the bosom of white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its hue tells the fate of its lord.<br>
  For yellow hints wealth, and blue meaneth health,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While green forbodes passing of gloom,<br>
  But beware of the red, &lsquo;tis an omen of dread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portending disaster and doom.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter I<br>
    Chums</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Long  years have passed since last we met,<br>
    And left their marks of teen and fret;<br>
    No longer faces plump and smooth,<br>
    Proclaim the halcyon days of youth.<br>
    But haggard looks and tresses white<br>
    Betray the ardour of the fight;<br>
    The same old friends: we meet once more&mdash;<br>
    But not the merry boys of yore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a great mistake,&rdquo; said Sir Philip Cassim, looking doubtfully at the piece of  paper lying on his desk; &ldquo;then we were foolish boys, now we are&mdash;I trust  sensible men. Certainly it is a great mistake.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  piece of paper was yellow with age, a trifle grimy, and so worn with constant  foldings, that it was wonderful the four quarters had not long since parted  company, as had the four friends, each of whom carried a similar piece in his  pocket-book. Often in his wanderings had Sir Philip pondered over that untidy  boyish scribble setting forth the foolish promise, which he now, half  regretfully, characterised as &ldquo;a great mistake.&rdquo; </p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Bedford  Grammar School, <br>
  &ldquo;<i>24th July, 1874.</i> </p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;If  we live and are in good health, we promise faithfully to meet at Philip&rsquo;s  house, in Portman Square, London, on the twenty-fourth day of July, one  thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. </p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;(Signed) </p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Philip  Winthorp Cassim,<br>
  John Duval,<br>
  Peter Paul Grench,<br>
  Timothy Terence Patrick Fletcher.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is quite fifteen years ago,&rdquo; said Cassim, smoothing the frail paper with tender  fingers; &ldquo;now it is the twenty-fourth day of July in the year eighty-nine. Six  o&rsquo;clock! I wonder if any of them will turn up. Jack is an engineer, building  railways and bridges in China. Peter, as a respectable physician, doses  invalids in Devonshire. Special Correspondent Tim, the stormy petrel of war,  wires lies to London newspapers. I&mdash;I am a mere idler, given to wanderings among  the tombs of dead civilisations. Peter may come. It means only a short railway  journey to him; but Jack and Tim are probably thousands of miles away. Still,  as I came from the Guinea Coast to meet them, they certainly ought not to miss  the appointment. This is the day, the place, the hour, and I have prepared the  fatted calf, of which they will partake&mdash;if they turn up. Pshaw! I am a fool to  think they will come. They have, no doubt, quite forgotten this boyish freak.  Perhaps it is best so. It is a great mistake to arrange a meeting fifteen years  ahead. Father Time is too fond of strange surprises.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Rising  from his chair, he paced slowly to and fro with folded arms, and bent head, the  droop of this latter being somewhat dejected. The idea that he was about to  meet his old schoolfellows rendered him pensive, and a trifle regretful. Many  years had passed since those halcyon days of youth, and, oh, the difference  between now and then! He could hardly avoid speculating on their certain  mutation. Had the wand of Time changed those merry lads into staid men? Would  Jack still be ambitious as of yore? Tim&rsquo;s jokes were famous in the old days;  but now, perchance, he found life too serious for jesting. Then Peter&rsquo;s  butterflies! How often they had laughed at his entomological craze. Now,  doubtless, he was more taken up with pills and patients. And himself,&mdash;he had  out-lived his youthful enthusiasms, more&rsquo;s the pity. No wonder he felt pensive  at the thought of such changes. Retrospection is a saddening faculty. </p>
  <p>Cassim  grew weary of these pessimistic fancies, and pausing in front of the fireplace,  surveyed himself long and critically in the mirror. It reflected a dark,  handsome face, reddened by the saltness of wind and wave, boldly cut features,  and melancholy eyes. Those eyes of Philip&rsquo;s were somewhat misleading, as they  suggested a poetic nature, steeped in sentimentalism, whereas he was a  remarkably matter-of-fact young man, inclined to scoff at the romantic tendencies  of his fellow-creatures. By no means expansive or apt to unbosom himself to his  friends, this reticence, in conjunction with his romantic appearance, entirely  deceived the world as to his true character. His Byronism lay in looks, rather  than in actions. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty  is by no means old,&rdquo; mused Sir Philip, absently stroking his moustache, &ldquo;if  anything, it errs on the side of youth, yet I look close on a hundred. Dark  people never do wear well. Tim is five years older than I, Peter past  thirty-three, but it&rsquo;s probable they look younger than I do. As to Jack&mdash;well,  Jack is an infant of twenty-eight summers, and I suspect has altered but  little. They would hardly recognise me. Possibly I shall have considerable  difficulty in recognising them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  resumed his walk and his soliloquy, reverting therein to his first idea. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  meeting is a mistake. Beyond the fact that we were at school together, we have  nothing in common about which to converse. Different lives, different ideas. We  will simply bore one another. Perhaps they are married. Peter was just the kind  of boy who would grow into a domesticated man. Jack was romantic, and has  probably been captured by a pretty face. Tim! I&rsquo;m not so sure about Tim. I  fancy he is still a bachelor like myself!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was his own fault that such was the case, as many a maiden would have gladly  married Sir Philip and his Kentish acres. The baronet, however, with but little  predisposition to matrimony, fought shy of the marriage ring, and preferred his  yacht to all the beauties in Christendom. On rare occasions, he showed himself  in Belgravia drawing-rooms, but in the main loved the masculine seclusion of  his club, and the lurching deck of <i>The Bohemian</i>. It may be that some of  his remote ancestors had intermarried with the Romany, and thus introduced a  strain of wandering blood into the family; but certain it was that Sir Philip  Cassim, in place of being a steady-going country squire, was an irreclaimable  Arab in the matter of vagrancy. Cases of atavism occur in the most respectable families. </p>
  <p>His  nomadic instincts lured him into the dark places of the earth, and, as a rule,  he preferred these to the more civilised portions. Humanity in the rough is  more interesting than humanity veneered with culture, and in seeking such  primevalism, Sir Philip explored many of those barbaric lands which gird our  comfortable civilisation. Peru he knew better than Piccadilly; St. James&rsquo;s  Street was unknown territory to him compared with his knowledge of Japan, and  if his yacht was not skirting the treacherous New Zealand coast, she was  certainly battling with the giant billows off the Horn. </p>
  <p>Hating  conventionalism, and the <i>leges non script&aelig;</i> of London society, this  vagabond by predilection rarely dwelt in the Portman Square family mansion.  When he did pay a visit to town, he usually camped out&mdash;so to speak, in a club  bedroom, and before his friends knew of his whereabouts, would flit away  without warning, and be next heard of at Pernambuco, or somewhere about  Madagascar. On this special occasion, however, he occupied his town house for  the purpose of keeping the appointment made with his three friends fifteen  years before on the banks of the Ouse. </p>
  <p>On  this account, and to avoid the trouble of hiring servants for the few days of  his stay, he brought his stewards up from the yacht. These, accustomed to such  emergencies, owing to Sir Philip&rsquo;s whimsical mode of life, speedily rendered a  few rooms habitable, and prepared the dinner, which was to celebrate the  re-union of the quartette. It seemed strange that Cassim should take all this  trouble to fulfil a boyish promise, but as he was a man who did not make  friends easily, and moreover was beginning to weary of solitary wanderings, he  greatly inclined to a renewal of these youthful friendships. Besides, he cherished  a kindly memory of his old school-fellows, and looked forward with genuine  pleasure to meeting them again. Yet, as his latter reason savoured of  sentimentalism, he would not admit of its existence even to himself&mdash;it clashed  with his convictions that life was not worth living. </p>
  <p>Despite  the fact that he was a cosmopolitan, Philip&rsquo;s nature, impressionable in the  extreme, was deeply tinged with the prevailing pessimism of the day. He  professed that facile disbelief in everything and in everyone, which is so easy  to acquire, so difficult to relinquish. Human nature he mistrusted, friendship  he scoffed at, and was always on his guard against those with whom he came in  contact. Thus living entirely within, and for himself, the real geniality of  his disposition became encrusted with the barnacles of a selfish philosophy.  This <i>noli me tangere</i> creed isolated him from his fellow-creatures&mdash;with  the result that while he possessed many acquaintances he had no real friends.  Thus he created his own misery, he inflicted his own punishment. </p>
  <p>Adopting  as his motto the saying of the Oxford fine gentleman, &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s new! nothing&rsquo;s  true, and no matter,&rdquo; Cassim schooled himself to suppress all outward signs of  feeling, and passed through life with a pretended indifference to the things of  this world. Pretended! because he really felt deeply and suffered acutely,  though pride forbade his showing aught of such mental disturbances to those  around him. Perhaps, in seeing so much of the world, he had early exhausted all  emotion; but he certainly surveyed everything from Dan to Beersheba with calm  indifference. The real man was a genial, kind-hearted creature; the false, a  frigidly cold person who accepted all things with ostentatious stoicism. </p>
  <p>He  was by no means popular with men, as they greatly resented his reserve and  haughty demeanour; but women professed to find him charming. Probably they,  with the subtle instinct of their sex, saw below the mask of feigned cynicism,  and judged him by what he was, not by what he appeared to be. Certainly he  never laid himself out to gain their good opinion. He rarely troubled to make  himself agreeable; he was not a marrying man (than which there can be no worse  crime in a woman&rsquo;s eyes), and led a solitary, vagrant existence; yet, in spite  of such social disqualifications, women were his best friends, and defended him  loyally from the clumsy sneers of his own sex. Assuredly he should have  married, if only out of gratitude for such championship; but he preferred a  single life, and in the main eschewed female society. </p>
  <p>Withal  he was not inclined to undervalue either his personal appearance or his mental  capacity. No mean classical scholar, he seldom passed a day without dipping  into the charming pages of Horace or Catullus. Of the two he preferred the Veronese,  who with Heine and Poe formed his favourite trio of poets, from which names it  can be seen that Sir Philip had a taste for the fantastic in literature. He was  conversant with three or four modern languages, and was especially familiar  with the noble tongue of Castille. A man who can read &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; in the  original is somewhat of a rarity in England. Those of Philip&rsquo;s acquaintances  who could induce him to talk literature and art formed an excellent opinion of  his abilities. Moreover, he was unique in one respect. He had circumnavigated  the globe, yet had refrained from writing a book of travel. </p>
  <p>As  to his personal appearance, it was as smart and spruce as that of his yacht.  Only those who know how a crack yacht is cherished by her owner can thoroughly  understand this comparison. In spite of his solitary existence, Philip was  always careful of the outward man, and this attention to his toilet was a  notable trait of his character. Yet he was by no means effeminate, foppish, or  finical. To sum up, he was a well-dressed, well-bred, cultured Englishman&mdash;who  had all the qualities&mdash;mental, personal, and physical&mdash;fitting him to shine with  no mean lustre in society, yet he preferred to live the life of a nautical  hermit&mdash;if such a thing be possible. </p>
  <p>Walking  constantly to and fro, he glanced every now and then at the clock, the large  hand of which was close on seven. Given that all three guests were within a  measurable distance of the rendezvous, he began to calculate, from what he knew  of their idiosyncrasies, which one of them would be the first to arrive. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am certain it will be Peter,&rdquo; decided Cassim, after due reflection; &ldquo;neat,  orderly, punctual Peter, who never missed a lesson, and never came late to  class. Tim is careless! Jack is whimsical! If anyone arrives, it will be Dr.  Peter Paul Grench. And,&rdquo; he added, as the bell rang, &ldquo;here he is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  prognostication proved to be correct, for in a few minutes the door of the  study opened to admit a precise little gentleman, in whom Philip had no  difficulty in recognising his quondam schoolfellow. It was a trifle larger  Peter&mdash;it was Peter in evening dress, twirling a pince-nez&mdash;Peter with  mutton-chop whiskers and a bald head; but it was undeniably Peter Paul Grench,  of Bedford Grammar School. </p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;The  child,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoth Philip, advancing to meet his guest, &ldquo; &lsquo;is father to the man.&rsquo;  It is just on seven, and you, Peter, keep your fifteen-year-old appointment to  the minute. I am delighted to see you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure the feeling is reciprocal,&rdquo; responded Dr. Grench, primly, as he grasped  the baronet&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;it is indeed a pleasure to meet an old schoolfellow after  these many years.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  spoke in a Johnsonian manner, but his words were genuine enough and under the  influence of this natural emotion, for the moment he forgot his primness. After  a time, however, habit asserted its influence over nature, and Grench resumed  his buckram civilities, while Philip, also recovering himself, relapsed into  his usual nonchalant manners. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you kept this appointment, after all,&rdquo; said Cassim, as they settled themselves  for a confidential conversation; &ldquo;I thought it possible you might have  forgotten about it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means,&rdquo; answered Grench, producing a piece of paper similar to that of  Philip&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I have often looked at this, and always intended, unless prevented  by disease or death, to meet my old schoolfellows as agreed. Here we are, my  dear friend; but Tim and Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  be at the other end of the world, for all I know,&rdquo; responded the baronet,  carelessly. &ldquo;Special correspondents and engineers are the Wandering Jews of  to-day. Still, as I came from the Guinea coast for this appointment, they will  surely not grudge a lengthy journey for a similar purpose.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  is in London,&rdquo; said Peter, unexpectedly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  remarked Philip, manifesting but little surprise, &ldquo;you have seen him, then?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Since we parted at Bedford I have seen none of you; but I have heard of all  three.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  good of me, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Cassim, with that amiable belief in his  fellow-creatures which made them love him so. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  bad, at all events,&rdquo; answered Peter, serenely. &ldquo;You are constantly travelling;  you are still a bachelor; you open your heart to no one, and judge the world as  though you were not its denizen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  last remark is stolen from La Rochefoucauld. Yes! Your description is accurate  if not original. However, let us not talk of Philip Cassim. I am terribly tired  of him. What about Jack and Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Jack I know nothing, save that he was last heard of in India. Tim, however,  wrote to me the other day saying <i>he</i> intended to keep this appointment.  Concerning his life, he volunteered no information.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  like Tim! His private correspondence was always unsatisfactory. I like his  newspaper letters however; the descriptions are so bright and vivid&mdash;plenty of  gunpowder and adventure. Certainly Tim makes an excellent war correspondent. I  wonder if he still has that strong brogue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  not. When he came to Bedford, he was fresh from Ireland; but now that he has  been travelling so much, he must have lost his pronounced Irishisms.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; said Philip, with a smile, &ldquo;Tim is Irish of the Irish. I  believe he loves his brogue. You can&rsquo;t educate the race nature out of a man.  Believe me, my dear Peter, Tim will be as noisy and as warm-hearted as of yore.  I am very fond of Tim.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I should think Tim, such as you describe him, would be the last person to suit  a fastidious individual such as yourself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, Peter, I am not quite so hypercritical as all that. Besides, Tim, with all  his noise and brogue, is a thorough gentleman. It is your veneered person I  object to. However, Tim may have changed. Meanwhile what about yourself?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  Canning&rsquo;s knife-grinder, I have no story to tell. When I left Bedford I went to  Cambridge&mdash;afterwards came to London. Passed my examinations, walked the  hospitals, took my degree, and hearing that a doctor was wanted down at  Barnstaple, I went there. For some years I practised with more or less success.  Then I retired to give&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Retired!&rdquo;  interrupted Philip, in surprise. &ldquo;Have you made your fortune?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means. Country doctors never make fortunes. No! I inherit five hundred a  year from my father, and as there is no necessity for me to physic people for a  livelihood, I devote myself&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  sticking pins through unoffending butterflies!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  how did you guess that?&rdquo; asked the little doctor, in mild surprise. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily  enough. You had a butterfly and beetle mania at school. If I remember rightly,  we rolled you in nettles to cure you of entomology. Boys don&rsquo;t relish  scientific urchins. So you are still at it. But five hundred a year and  beetles. Peter, you are not ambitious.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  assented Grench, simply; &ldquo;I am not at all ambitious. My entomology gives me  great pleasure, or why should I not enjoy myself in my own way? Ah, Philip, you  do not know what true enjoyment is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not&mdash;if it&rsquo;s butterflies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see one of the Callidryas species for the first time is indeed a pleasure,&rdquo;  said Peter, beaming with scientific rapture. &ldquo;Then the Papilios, the Hesperid&aelig;  and the red Timitis&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  oh!&rdquo; yawned Philip, stretching himself, &ldquo;how dry it sounds.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dry!&rdquo;  echoed Peter, indignantly; &ldquo;the most fascinating pursuit in the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  looked kindly at the little man who appeared to be so satisfied with his simple  pleasures. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Decidedly,  Peter, you are a happy person. Come with me on a cruise, and I will introduce  you to the paradise of butterflies. Tropical America, Peter, where the insects  are like flying flowers. Green butterflies, purple beetles, gilded moths&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Peter, opening his eyes with delight, &ldquo;I should like to go to South  America. I would find a peculiar species there, the Heliconid&aelig;. Why, Philip, if  only&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!  there&rsquo;s the bell,&rdquo; exclaimed Cassim, rising with alacrity, rather thankful to  escape Peter&rsquo;s lecture. &ldquo;Is it Jack or Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim,&rdquo;  said Peter, promptly, &ldquo;no one else would ring so violently.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did ye say they were?&rdquo; cried a hearty Irish voice half way up the stairs. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  settles it,&rdquo; remarked Philip, comically, as he opened the door; &ldquo;no two persons  can possess such a strong brogue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And  Tim it was. Tim, large and burly, roaring like a Bull of Bashan, who hurled  himself into the room, and flung himself on Philip&rsquo;s neck. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear friend! my dear boy!&rdquo; he thundered, squeezing Cassim in his athletic  embrace, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s glad I am to see you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently,  Tim, gently,&rdquo; gasped Philip, helpless in the hug of this bear; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t crush me  to a jelly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Tim, releasing the baronet to pounce on the doctor, &ldquo;you fat  little man, how splendid you look.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Warned  by the fate of Philip, the doctor skilfully evaded the embrace of the giant,  and Tim was only able to demonstrate his affection by a handgrip. He threw all  his soul into this latter, and Peter&rsquo;s face wrinkled up like a monkey&rsquo;s with  pain. It was like a fly struggling with an elephant, and Philip, thoroughly  roused from his ordinary placidity, laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as you&rsquo;ve quite done murdering us, Tim,&rdquo; he said, placing a chair between  himself and his too demonstrative friend, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll give your hat and  coat to the servant.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim,  who had rushed upstairs without pause, meekly delivered the articles in  question to the servant, who stood grinning at the door. Looking on this  respectful grin as a liberty, Philip frowned at the poor man, who thereupon  vanished, while Tim, overcome by his late exertions, fell so heavily into a  chair that the room rocked. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo;  he said, wiping his heated brow, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hot. I am, anyhow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  scarcely to be wondered at,&rdquo; returned Cassim dryly, &ldquo;considering the enthusiasm  of your greeting.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not?&rdquo; retorted Tim, with the broadest of brogues; &ldquo;am I not glad to see you  both?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; and we are glad to see you,&rdquo; said Peter, examining his crushed hand; &ldquo;but  you needn&rsquo;t maim us for life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim  roared with laughter in the most unfeeling manner, and Cassim, with a smile,  placed his hand on the giant&rsquo;s shoulder. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same noisy Tim as of old,&rdquo; he said kindly; &ldquo;you were a large boy, Tim, and now  you are a large man. I wouldn&rsquo;t have recognised you, though, save for the  brogue. It&rsquo;s as strong as ever.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true, anyhow,&rdquo; acknowledged Fletcher placing his huge paw on Philip&rsquo;s slender  hand as it rested on his shoulder. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I but one term at the school, and  that didn&rsquo;t turn it into cockney speaking. Besides, I&rsquo;ve been to Cork since.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  freshen up the accent, I suppose,&rdquo; said Grench, with the air of a man who has  made a cutting remark; &ldquo;but a special correspondent should know more than one  language.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Especially  if the language is Irish,&rdquo; finished Cassim, mischievously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  along with you,&rdquo; replied Tim, with a twinkle in his eye; &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s a polyglot  I am, French, Italian, Spanish, and a touch of Arabic. I can tell lies in any  one of them. So here you are, lads. Where&rsquo;s Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was in South America when I heard last; but I&rsquo;ll go bail he&rsquo;ll turn up soon.  What is the time?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half-past  seven,&rdquo; rejoined Peter, consulting an eminently respectable watch of the family  physician species. </p>
  <p>Tim  took out his piece of paper from a pocket-book commensurate to his size, and  smoothed it carefully with his huge hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven&rsquo;s  the hour, and Jack&rsquo;s late. I never knew him early yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you were not renowned for punctuality at school, Tim!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  for you, Philip, and many&rsquo;s the hearing I&rsquo;ve had for that same. But this is a  special occasion, and Jack should be punctual. Confound him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;ll be here shortly,&rdquo; said Cassim, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;We have plenty to  talk about until he arrives. How are you, Tim? But I needn&rsquo;t ask, you look like  the giant Goribuster.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six  foot five in my stockings,&rdquo; replied Tim, complacently; &ldquo;and a good thing it is  for me that same. Special corresponding isn&rsquo;t knocking about the world in a  gentleman&rsquo;s yacht, sir.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  collecting butterflies,&rdquo; added Philip, with a sly smile at Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you at that rubbish still, Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I am,&rdquo; answered Peter, in mild surprise; &ldquo;in fact, since my father left  me five hundred a year, I&rsquo;ve devoted myself entirely to entomology.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to eating!&rdquo; said Tim, with a grin. &ldquo;Why, Peter, you&rsquo;ve a paunch like a priest.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  really!&rdquo; began Peter, scandalised; but his further protestations were drowned  in the laughter of Philip, on hearing which Tim nodded approvingly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now, my dear friend, that&rsquo;s better. You are more like a Christian than when I  last saw you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Bedford?&rdquo; inquired Philip, still smiling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  In London&mdash;no less. Didn&rsquo;t I see you at the theatre six months ago, looking for  all the world as if you were attending your own funeral?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  looked so supercilious and stand-off-the-grass like that I couldn&rsquo;t bring  myself to it at all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  idiot!&rdquo; said Philip, colouring with vexation. &ldquo;You know I am always glad to see  you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that a Chinese invitation, Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I assure you, Tim. Don&rsquo;t think me such a prig. Why, I came all the way from the  Guinea coast just to meet you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a fine boy you are,&rdquo; said Tim, stretching out his huge hand; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only joking  I am. If you didn&rsquo;t recognise an old friend, it&rsquo;s thrashing you I&rsquo;d be, as once  I did at school.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I remember rightly, it was you who had the worst of that little encounter,&rdquo;  retorted Philip, gripping Tim&rsquo;s hand strongly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a draw,&rdquo; said Peter, suddenly; &ldquo;I remember the fight quite well. But we can  talk of these things again. I want to know what Tim is doing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this is fame,&rdquo; grunted Tim, nodding his head. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen my letters  about the Soudan War to <i>The Morning Planet</i>, and my account of the  Transvaal ructions? Am I not a special correspondent, you ignorant little  person?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, yes; I know all that,&rdquo; replied Peter, impatiently; &ldquo;but tell us about your  life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that my life, sir? When I left school, I went to Ireland and became a reporter.  Then I was taken up by a paper in London, and went to the Soudan&mdash;afterwards to  Burmah, where I was nearly drowned in the Irriwaddy. They know me in Algiers  and Morocco. Now I&rsquo;ve just returned from Burmah, where I parted with my dear  friend, Pho Sa. He&rsquo;s in glory now&mdash;rest his soul! They hanged him for being a  Dacoit, poor devil.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have been all over the world, Tim,&rdquo; said Philip, when the Irishman  stopped for breath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s queer I never knocked up against you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you never stayed one day in one place. That boat of yours is a kind of Flying  Dutchman.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it; she has doubled the Cape lots of times. I was just trying to  persuade Peter to take a cruise with me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am seriously thinking of the advisability of doing so,&rdquo; observed Peter,  judiciously selecting his words. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you, indeed, Mr. Lindley Murray. Well, if Philip asks me, I&rsquo;ll come too.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you really, Tim?&rdquo; asked Philip, eagerly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will. There&rsquo;s no war on at present, and I&rsquo;m not busy. If those  squabbling South American Republics don&rsquo;t come to blows again, I&rsquo;ll be free for  six months, more or less.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  come with me, by all means.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what,&rdquo; observed Peter, who had been thinking; &ldquo;Jack, if he turns up at  all, will have travelled home from South America. Let us take him back in  Philip&rsquo;s yacht.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not a bad idea anyhow,&rdquo; from Tim, patting Peter&rsquo;s head, a familiarity much  resented by the family physician. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got brains under this bald spot.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite agreeable, provided Jack turns up,&rdquo; said Sir Philip, yawning; &ldquo;but it  is now eight o&rsquo;clock, and I&rsquo;m hungry. It&rsquo;s no use waiting any longer for Jack,  so I vote we have dinner.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  arrive in the middle of it,&rdquo; said Grench, as Cassim touched the bell. &ldquo;Jack was  never in time, or Tim either.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be taking away my character, you mosquito,&rdquo; cried Tim, playfully, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll put  you on the top of the bookcase there. It&rsquo;s a mighty little chap you are, Peter!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we can&rsquo;t all be giants!&rdquo; retorted Peter, resentfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tall enough for what  I want to do.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Collecting  butterflies! You don&rsquo;t know the value of time, sir. Come along with me to the  dining-room.&rdquo; And, in spite of Peter&rsquo;s struggles, he picked him up like a baby,  and carried him as far as the study door. Indeed, he would have carried him  into the dining-room had not the presence of the servant restrained him. Tim  had no idea of the dignity of the medical profession. </p>
  <p>The  servant intimated that dinner was ready, so the three friends sat down to the  meal rather regretting that Jack was not present to complete the quartette.  Just as they finished their soup the servant announced&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Duval!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Simultaneously  the three sprang up from the table, and on looking towards the door beheld a  tall young fellow, arrayed in tweeds, standing on the threshold. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;  they cried, rushing towards him with unbounded delight. &ldquo;Jack Duval!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear boys,&rdquo; said Jack, his voice shaking with emotion; &ldquo;my dear old friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="II"></a><b>Chapter  II<br>
    The Devil Stone</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Spirits  dwelling in the zone<br>
    Of the changeful devil stone,<br>
    Pray ye say what destiny<br>
    Is prepared by Fate for me.<br>
    Doth the doubtful future hold<br>
    Poverty or mickle gold,<br>
    Fortune&rsquo;s smile, or Fortune&rsquo;s frown,<br>
    Beggar&rsquo;s staff, or monarch&rsquo;s crown?<br>
    Shall I wed, or live alone,<br>
    Spirits of the devil stone?<br>
    See the colours come and go,<br>
    Thus foreboding joy and woe;<br>
    Burns the red, the blue is seen,<br>
    Yellow glows and flames the green,<br>
    Like a rainbow in the sky,<br>
    Mingle tints capriciously,<br>
    Till the writhing of the hues,<br>
    Sense and brain and eye confuse,<br>
    Prophet priest can read alone<br>
    Omens of the devil stone.</p>
  <p>Having  finished dinner, they repaired to the library, and there made themselves  comfortable with coffee and tobacco. Emotion at meeting one another after the  lapse of so many years had by no means deprived them of their appetites, and  they all did full justice to the excellent fare provided by Philip&rsquo;s cook. So  busy were they in this respect that during the meal conversation waxed somewhat  desultory, and it was not until comfortably seated in the library that they  found time for a thoroughly exhaustive confabulation. </p>
  <p>For  this purpose the quartette drew their chairs close together, and proceeded to  incense the goddess Nicotina, of whom they were all devotees save Peter. He  said that tobacco was bad for the nerves, especially when in the guise of  cigarettes, which last shaft was aimed at Philip, who particularly affected  those evil little dainties abhorred by Dr. Grench. Jack and Tim, to mark their  contempt for Peter&rsquo;s counter-blast, produced well-coloured meerschaum pipes,  which had circumnavigated the globe in their pockets. Whereat Peter, despairing  of making proselytes, held his tongue and busied himself with his coffee&mdash;very  weak coffee, with plenty of milk and no sugar. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an old woman you have become, Peter,&rdquo; said Cassim, watching all this caution  with languid interest. &ldquo;You have positively no redeeming vices. But you won&rsquo;t  live any the longer for such self-denial. Tim, there, with his strong coffee  and stronger tobacco, will live to bury you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  suffers from liver!&rdquo; observed Peter, serenely making a side attack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  roared Tim, indignantly, &ldquo;is it me you mean? Why, I never had a touch of liver  in my life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have it shortly, then,&rdquo; retorted Peter, with a pitying smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor,  you know, Peter, and I can see at a glance that you are a mass of disease.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>All  this time Jack had spoken very little. He alone of the party was not seated,  but leaned against the mantelpiece, pipe in mouth, with a far-away look in his  eyes. While Tim and Peter wrangled over the ailments of the former, Philip,  lying back luxuriously in his chair, surveyed his old schoolfellow thoughtfully  through a veil of smoke. He saw a greater change in Jack than in the other two. </p>
  <p>In  truth, Duval was well worth looking at, for, without being the ideal Greek god  of romance, he was undeniably a handsome young man. Tim had the advantage of  him in height and size, but Jack&rsquo;s lean frame and iron muscles would carry him  successfully through greater hardships than could the Irishman&rsquo;s uncultivated  strength. Jack could last for days in the saddle; he could sustain existence on  the smallest quantity of food compatible with actual life; he could endure all  disagreeables incidental to a pioneer existence with philosophical resignation,  and altogether presented an excellent type of the Anglo-Saxon race in its  colonising capacity. Certainly the special correspondent had, in the interests  of his profession, undergone considerable hardships with fair success; but Tim  was too fond of pampering his body when among the fleshpots of Egypt, whereas  Jack, constantly in the van of civilisation subjugating wildernesses, had no  time to relapse into luxurious living. The spirit was willing enough, but the  flesh had no chance of indulging. </p>
  <p>His  face, bronzed by tropic suns, his curly yellow locks, his jauntily curled  moustache, and a certain reckless gleam in his blue eyes, made him look like  one of those dare-devil, Elizabethan seamen who thrashed the Dons on the  Spanish Main. Man of action as he was, fertile in expedients, and constantly on  the alert for possible dangers, Jack Duval was eminently fitted for the  profession which he had chosen, and could only endure existence in the desert  places of the world. This huge London, with its sombre skies, its hurrying  crowds, its etiquette of civilisation, was by no means to his taste, and  already he was looking forward with relief to the time when he would once more  be on his way to the vivid, careless, dangerous life of the frontier. </p>
  <p>Philip  admired his friend&rsquo;s masculine thoroughness, and could not help comparing  himself disadvantageously with the young engineer. Yet Cassim was no weakling  of the boudoir; he also had sailed stormy seas, had dared the unknown where  Nature fights doggedly with man for the preservation of her virgin solitudes.  Still, withal, Jack was a finer man than he was. What were his luxurious  travels, his antarctic explorations, in comparison with the actual hardships  undergone by this dauntless pioneer of civilisation? Jack was one who did some  good in the world; but as for himself&mdash;well, Philip did not care about pursuing  the idea to its bitter end, as the sequence could hardly prove satisfactory to  his self-love. He irritably threw away his cigarette, moved restlessly in his  chair, and finally expressed himself in words. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you come here, Jack, and make us feel like wastrels? A few hours ago and I  rather prided myself on myself; but now you make me feel idle, and lazy, and  selfish, and effeminate. It&rsquo;s too bad of you, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Brains  were not Duval&rsquo;s strong point, and, unable to understand the meaning of this  outburst, he simply stared in vague astonishment at Sir Philip. Tim and the  doctor, pausing in their conversation, pricked up their ears, while Cassim,  paying no attention to this sudden enlargement of his audience, went on  speaking, half peevishly, half good-humouredly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am the enervated type of an effete civilisation. You, my friend, are the lusty  young savage to whom the shaping of the future is given. You are Walt Whitman&rsquo;s  tan-faced man, the incarnation of the dominating Anglo-Saxon race, ever pushing  forward into fresh worlds. As compared with mine, your prim&aelig;val life is  absolutely perfect. The Sybarite quails before the clear glance of the child of  Nature. Take me with you into the wilderness, John Duval. Teach me how to  emulate the Last of the Mohicans. Make me as resourceful as Robinson Crusoe. I  am a prematurely old man, Jack, and I wish to be a child once more.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce are you driving at, Philip?&rdquo; asked practical Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  from a book he&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; suggested Tim, with a laugh. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Melancholia,&rdquo;  hinted Peter, who was nothing if not medicinal. </p>
  <p>Philip  laughed and lighted a fresh cigarette. Duval ran his hand through his curly  locks, pulled hard at his pipe, and delivered himself bluntly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose all that balderdash means that you are tired of London.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  much so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  you never stay two days in London,&rdquo; said Peter, in astonishment. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  do I. Don&rsquo;t I tell you I&rsquo;m tired of it? Be quiet, Peter; I can see that Jack is  on the verge of being delivered of a great idea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my word, that&rsquo;s cute of you, Philip,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, admiringly. &ldquo;Yes, I have  a scheme to propound, for the carrying out which I need your assistance&mdash;in  fact, the assistance of all three.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  promises to be an interesting conversation,&rdquo; said Cassim, in an animated tone. &ldquo;Proceed,  John Duval, Engineer. What is it you wish us to do?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had better begin at the beginning, gentlemen all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  generally considered the best way,&rdquo; observed Peter, with mild sarcasm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet! you small pill-box. Let Jack speak.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I told you at dinner,&rdquo; said Jack, placing his elbows backward on the  mantelshelf, &ldquo;I have been all over the world since I last saw your three faces.  China, Peru, New Zealand, India, Turkey&mdash;I know all those places, and many  others. I have made money; I have lost money; I have had ups and downs; but  everywhere I can safely say I&rsquo;ve had a good time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same  here,&rdquo; murmured Tim, refilling his pipe. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  present I am in Central America,&rdquo; pursued Jack, taking no notice of the  interpolation, &ldquo;under engagement as a railway engineer to the Republic of  Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cholacaca?&rdquo;  echoed Tim, loudly; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it there the row&rsquo;s to take place?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what do you know about it, Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  special correspondent knows a lot of things,&rdquo; returned Fletcher, sagely. &ldquo;Go on  with the music, my boy. I&rsquo;ll tell you something when you&rsquo;ve ended.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  looked hard at Tim and hesitated, but Philip, curled up luxuriously in his big chair,  asked him to proceed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  going to tell an Arabian Night story, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it sounds like one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I love romance. It&rsquo;s something about buried cities, and Aztecs, and treasure,  and the god Huitzilopochtli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bosh! You&rsquo;ve been reading Prescott.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; observed Peter, plaintively, &ldquo;that with all these interruptions  we&rsquo;ll never hear the story.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first that speaks will be crushed,&rdquo; announced Tim, glaring around. &ldquo;If you  please, Mr. Duval, it&rsquo;s waiting we are.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  laughed, and resumed his story. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  I was at Tlatonac&mdash;that is the capital of the Republic&mdash;I became mixed up in  certain events, political and otherwise. I found I could do nothing I wanted to  without assistance; so, as I suddenly remembered our promise to meet here this  year, I came straight to London. In fact, I was in such a hurry to find out if  you three had remembered the appointment, that I left my luggage at the railway  station, and came on by a hansom to Portman Square. This is the reason I am not  in evening dress.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  deuce take your evening dress,&rdquo; said Philip, irritably; &ldquo;you might have come in  a bathing-towel, for all I cared. I didn&rsquo;t want to see your clothes. I wanted  to see you. Go on with the story of the buried city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know my story is about a buried city?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard a romance of Central America that wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  hear one now, then. This isn&rsquo;t about a city&mdash;it&rsquo;s concerning a stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stone?&rdquo; echoed his three listeners. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  An opal. A harlequin opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is a harlequin opal, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim,  I&rsquo;m astonished at your ignorance. A special correspondent should know all  things. A harlequin opal is one containing all the colours of the rainbow, and  a few extra ones besides.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Jack, and this special opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  one of the most magnificent jewels in the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  drew a long breath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  once. Great Scott, what a gem! You fellows can&rsquo;t conceive its beauty. It is as  large as a guinea-hen&rsquo;s egg. Milky white, and shooting rays of blue and green,  and red and yellow like fireworks. It belonged to Montezuma.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought those everlasting Aztecs would come in,&rdquo; said Philip smiling. &ldquo;Well,  Jack, and what about this stone?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of that? The night&rsquo;s young, and the liquor&rsquo;s plentiful.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind sitting up all night, if the story is interesting. Start at once  Jack, and don&rsquo;t keep us any longer in suspense. I hate wire-drawn agonies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  year ago I was pottering about at Zacatecas, over a wretched little railway  that wasn&rsquo;t worth bothering about. Being hard up, I went in for it in default  of something better; but meanwhile kept my eyes open to see what I could drop  into. After some months, I heard that the Republic of Cholacaca was about to  open up the country with railways, so I thought I&rsquo;d go there to get a job.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Cholacaca?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down  Yucatan way&mdash;not far from Guatemala.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know; looks on to Campeche Bay.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  on the other side of the neck. Washed by the Carribean Sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must get you to show it to me on the map,&rdquo; said Philip, finding his  geographical knowledge at fault. &ldquo;I have an idea of its whereabouts, but not of  its precise locality. Meanwhile let us continue your adventures.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I heard of this prospect at Tlatonac,&rdquo; continued Jack, without further  preamble, &ldquo;I left Zacatecas for Mexico, stayed a few days in the capital, to  make inquiries about the Republic. These proving satisfactory, I went on to  Vera Cruz, and, fortunately, found a coasting-vessel which took me on to  Cholacaca. Considering the ship, I got to my destination pretty sharp. I didn&rsquo;t  know a soul in the town when I arrived; but, after a few days, began to pick up  a few acquaintances. Among these was Don Miguel Maraquando, a wealthy old  Estanciero. He has great influence in Cholacaca, being a member of the Junta,  and is regarded by many people as the future president of the Republic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if Don Hypolito stands out,&rdquo; said Tim, softly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack, when the journalist cut him short. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  heard many things, my boy. Later on I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to be pretty well acquainted with what&rsquo;s going on in Cholacaca,&rdquo; said  Jack, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell my story first, and you  can tell yours afterwards. Don Miguel became a great friend of mine, and I saw  a good deal of him while I stayed at Tlatonac. He is greatly in favour of this  railway, which is to be made from the capital to Acauhtzin, a distance of some  three hundred and fifty miles. Don Hypolito Xuarez, the leader of the  Oposidores, objected to the scheme on the ground that it was utterly  unnecessary to run a railway to Acauhtzin when ships could take goods there by  water.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  isn&rsquo;t the man right?&rdquo; said Tim, indignantly; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of running a  railway along the seacoast?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  argue that question later on,&rdquo; replied Jack, dryly; &ldquo;I have my own ideas on the  subject, and, as an engineer, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Don Hypolito&rsquo;s  objection sounds all right, I have no doubt; but if you look into the matter  you will see he hasn&rsquo;t a leg to stand on. Besides, he&rsquo;s only objecting to the  railway out of sheer cussedness, because Maraquando won&rsquo;t let him marry Do&ntilde;a  Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  ah!&rdquo; observed Philip, who had been listening to the story with great attention,  &ldquo;I was waiting for the inevitable woman to appear on the scene. And who is Do&ntilde;a  Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is Maraquando&rsquo;s ward,&rdquo; replied Jack, colouring a little. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  whom you are in love?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t say that Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but you looked it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  chuckled, whereat Duval turned on him crossly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would stop making such a row, Peter; I can&rsquo;t hear myself speak.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what about Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; persisted Philip, maliciously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Dolores,&rdquo; repeated Jack, calmly, &ldquo;is the woman whom I hope to make my wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this startling announcement there was a dead silence. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you, Jack,&rdquo; said Cassim, gravely, after a momentary pause. &ldquo;I hope  you will ask us all to your wedding. But what has this story of politics,  railways, and love to do with the harlequin opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  Listen. Don Hypolito is an ambitious man who wants to become Dictator of  Cholacaca, and rule that Republic as Dr. Francia did Paraguay. Now, the easiest  way in which he can obtain his desire is by marrying Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Is she the heiress of the Republic?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but she is the lawful owner of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  in heaven&rsquo;s name, is that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means &lsquo;the shining precious stone,&rsquo; in the Toltec tongue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce!&rdquo; murmured Philip, in an amused tone; &ldquo;we have got past the Aztecs.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose this shining precious stone is the harlequin opal?&rdquo; said Peter,  inquiringly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  This celebrated stone is hundreds of years old. Tradition says it was the  property of Quetzalcoatl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the Mexican god of the air,&rdquo; said Philip who knew all sorts of stray facts. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You&rsquo;ve read that in Prescott.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t. Bancroft is my authority. But how did it come into the possession of  your Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she is a direct descendant of Montezuma.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  Aztec princess. Jack, you are making a royal match.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid there is very little royalty about Dolores,&rdquo; replied Jack, laughing; &ldquo;but,  as regards this stone. Quetzalcoatl gave it to Huitzilopochtli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord!  what names.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  Cortez conquered Mexico, he found the stone adorning the statue of the war god  in his famous teocalli in the city of the Aztecs. One of the Spanish  adventurers stole it, and afterwards married a daughter of Montezuma. When she  found out that he had the opal, she stole it from him, and went off down south,  where she delivered it to some native priest in one of those Central American  forests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  it remains still?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means. This woman had a son by the Spaniard, a Mestizo, as they call this  mixture of Indian and Spanish blood. He, I believe, claimed the stone as his  property whereon the high priest of Huitzilopochtli proposed to sacrifice him.  Not being a religious man, he disliked the idea, and ran away, taking the stone  with him. He reached the coast, and married a native woman. There they set up a  temple on their own account to the god of war, and round it, as time went on,  grew a settlement, which was called after the opal &lsquo;Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rsquo; Then  the Spaniards came and conquered the town, which they rechristened Puebla de Nuestra  Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepcion; but the name didn&rsquo;t catch on, and it is now known by  its old Indian name of Tlatonac. Of course there are a good many Spaniards  there still; descendants of the Conquistadores; but the majority of the  population are Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what became of the opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  as the Spaniards tried to get hold of it, the Indians took it inland to one of  their forest retreats. The descendants of Montezuma, however, are still  supposed to be its guardians, and, when one owner dies, the opal is brought  secretly to Tlatonac, and shown to the new possessor; then it is taken back to  its forest sanctuary.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you see it?&rdquo; asked Philip, curiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the whole point of the story,&rdquo; answered Jack, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The son of  Montezuma&rsquo;s daughter married a native woman, as I told you; their son, however,  married a Spanish lady, and so the race was continued. Off and on, they married  Indian and Spaniard. This mixing of race isn&rsquo;t good, from a philoprogenitive  point of view, and Dolores is the last descendant of the original owner of the  opal. Therefore, she is its guardian, and that is the reason Don Hypolito wants  to marry her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wishes to obtain the stone as a wedding dowry?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  This Chalchuih Tlatonac is an object of superstitious veneration to the  Indians. They are supposed to be converted; but they all more or less cling to  their old beliefs. In one of these mysterious forests stands a temple to  Huitzilopochtli, and there a good many of them go in secret to consult the  opal. How they consult it I don&rsquo;t know, unless by its changing colours. Now, if  Hypolito marries Dolores, through her he might seize the stone. If he becomes  its possessor, he could do what he pleased with the Indian population. As they  greatly outnumber the Spanish element, he would use them to raise himself to  the Dictatorship of Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he doesn&rsquo;t love the girl?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit,&rdquo; replied Jack, viciously; &ldquo;all he wants is to marry her, and thus gain  possession of the devil stone. Besides, apart from the use it would be to him,  from a superstitious point of view, he would like to obtain the stone for its  own sake. It is a magnificent gem.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he seen it also?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  at the same time as I did. Dolores&rsquo; father died, and she became the ward of her  uncle Don Miguel. I was a good deal about the house, and naturally enough fell  in love with her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!  Jack!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  fall in love with her, yourself, Philip, when you see her; she&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. You say that because you are in love with her. Does she return your  love?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  she is as fond of me as I am of her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what does Don Miguel, the proud hidalgo, say?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  says nothing, because he knows nothing,&rdquo; said Jack, promptly; &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t told  him yet. However, when Dolores and myself found out we loved one another, she  told me all about this Chalchuih Tlatonac, and how she expected it was to be  shown to her, according to custom. A few nights afterwards the priest arrived  secretly, and showed her the stone. While she was holding it up, I entered the  room suddenly with Don Hypolito. We saw the opal flashing like a rainbow in her  hand. By Heaven, boys, I never saw such splendour in my life. We only had a  glimpse of it, for as soon as the old priest saw us he snatched it out of her  hand and bolted. I followed, but lost him, so the opal went back to the forest  temple; and Lord only knows where that is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  Do&ntilde;a Dolores know?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nobody knows except the priests. They meet the worshippers on the verge of the  forest and blindfold them before leading them to the shrine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how did Don Hypolito find out Dolores was the guardian of the opal?&rdquo; asked  Peter, after a pause. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the story is common property. But the opal isn&rsquo;t of much value to Dolores. She  is called its guardian, but has nothing to do with it. Now I suppose she&rsquo;ll  never see it again.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a queer story anyhow,&rdquo; observed Tim, reflectively; &ldquo;I would like to see that  jewel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;ve come to see you all about,&rdquo; said Jack, excitedly. &ldquo;I want you all to  come with me to Cholacaca, and help me to marry Dolores, and get the devil  stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  three remained silent, and a shade of disappointment passed over Duval&rsquo;s face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, if you fellows don&rsquo;t care, I&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Jack,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, slowly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions. You  want us to go to Central America?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  upset Don Hypolito&rsquo;s little plans?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speaking  for myself,&rdquo; said Philip, quietly, &ldquo;there is nothing I should like better. I am  with you, Jack. But Peter&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll come too,&rdquo; said the doctor, serenely, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s only to collect  butterflies. While I&rsquo;m on the spot, I may as well help. There&rsquo;s sure to be  fighting, and I can attend to the wounded. You can depend upon me, Jack; I&rsquo;ll  be your family physician, and physic the lot of you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;  cried Jack, his face lighting up as he grasped a hand of each. &ldquo;And what do you  say, Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  story is queer,&rdquo; remarked Tim, solemnly; &ldquo;but mine is queerer. I&rsquo;ll go with the  greatest of pleasure, Jack; but it so happens I&rsquo;m going out to the same place  for <i>The Morning Planet</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a coincidence, anyhow, Jack. I told you I knew about Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen the evening papers?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I was too excited at the idea of meeting you fellows to bother about reading.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are an ignorant person. While you&rsquo;ve been fast in coming here, the telegraph&rsquo;s  been faster. From all accounts, there&rsquo;s going to be a shindy in Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores!&rdquo;  gasped Jack, turning pale. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you needn&rsquo;t be distressful,&rdquo; said Fletcher, hastily; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing much up  as yet. I saw the telegram myself this morning. Don Hypolito has left Tlatonac,  and gone to that other town&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call it? &lsquo;Tis on the tip of my tongue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s the name. &lsquo;Tis said he&rsquo;s trying to stir up a row; but there&rsquo;s no news of  any consequence, at all!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  been ordered to the front, then, Tim?&rdquo; said Philip, quickly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  hit it, my boy! I was in the office this morning, and the editor called me in. &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye  want a trip?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s going to be trouble  again in South America,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;are the Peruvians at it  again?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Cholacaca.&rsquo; &lsquo;And where&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more  nor I know,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Find out on the map, and hold yourself in readiness to  go.&rsquo; So I left him at once, and looked up the map; found out all I could about  the place, and at any minute I&rsquo;m expecting to be sent off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jove!  how curious,&rdquo; said Jack, reflectively. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Don Hypolito to cause  trouble quite so soon; but I saw things were shaping that way. It&rsquo;s strange,  Tim, that you should be going to the very place I wish you to go to. But Philip  and Peter won&rsquo;t like to come now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t make the slightest difference to me,&rdquo; said Philip, coolly. &ldquo;In fact,  like Xeres, I&rsquo;m longing for a new pleasure. I&rsquo;ve never been in a war, and  should like the novelty of the thing. As to Peter! he&rsquo;s coming to resume his  profession on the battle-field.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what about my butterflies?&rdquo; remonstrated Peter, who did not exactly relish the  idea of being put in the forefront of the battle. He objected to the role of  Uriah. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you can do all that sort of thing between times. The main thing is to get the  better of Don Hypolito, and help Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Philip,&rdquo; said the little man meekly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your practice,&rdquo; hesitated Jack, not liking to be selfish. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  the poor little man hasn&rsquo;t got one,&rdquo; laughed Tim, digging Peter in the ribs. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t  he killed his patients long ago, and is now starving on five hundred a year,  poor soul.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very kind of you all!&rdquo; said Duval, looking at his three friends. &ldquo;But I feel  that I&rsquo;m leading you into trouble.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me,&rdquo; declared Tim, stoutly, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the <i>Morning Planet&rsquo;s</i> to blame, if I  peg out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I want some excitement,&rdquo; said Philip, gaily; &ldquo;and Peter wants butterflies; don&rsquo;t  you, doctor? We&rsquo;re all free agents in the matter, Jack, and will go with  pleasure.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  strange,&rdquo; said Peter, pensively; &ldquo;we little thought at Bedford that&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter,  don&rsquo;t be sentimental,&rdquo; interrupted the baronet, jumping up. &ldquo;We little thought  our meeting would bring us good luck, if that is what you mean. I&rsquo;m delighted  at this new conquest of Mexico.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must start at once, Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Jack, we shall start the day after to-morrow, in my yacht. She&rsquo;s lying  down at Yarmouth, in the Isle of Wight, and is ready to get steam up at a  minute&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she a fast boat?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fast!&rdquo;  echoed Philip, indignant at the imputation; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the fastest steam-yacht  afloat. Wait till she clears the Channel, then you&rsquo;ll see what a clean pair of  heels she can show.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  quicker the better. I don&rsquo;t want to arrive at Tlatonac and find Dolores  missing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t find a hair of her head touched. You shall marry her, Jack, and inherit  the harlequin opal, and go and be priest to Huitzilopochtli, if you like. Now  have a glass of wine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim,  who was always handy when liquor was about, had already filled the glasses and  solemnly handed them to his friends. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the health,&rdquo; said Tim, standing up huge and burly, &ldquo;of the future Mrs. Duval.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  toast was drunk with acclamation. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III<br>
  &ldquo;The Bohemian&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Come,  lads, and send the capstan round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Rio! Rio!<br>
Our good old barkey&rsquo;s outward bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Rio! Rio!<br>
  So, shipmates, all look sharp and spry,<br>
  To Poll and Nancy say good-bye,<br>
  And tell them, if they pipe their eye,<br>
  We&rsquo;re bound for Rio Grande.</p>
  <p class="poem">The  old man drank his grog and swore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Rio! Rio!<br>
He&rsquo;d stay no longer slack ashore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Rio! Rio!<br>
&ldquo;Come, tumble up, my lads,&rdquo; sez he,<br>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; weigh the anchor speedily,<br>
In twenty days the Cross we&rsquo;ll see,<br>
We&rsquo;re bound for Rio Grande.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of her?&rdquo; asked Philip, with justifiable pride. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  as near perfection as can be,&rdquo; replied Jack, enthusiastically; &ldquo;no two opinions  about that, old fellow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><i>The  Bohemian</i> was a superbly modelled  craft, and well deserved their admiration as she lay in Yarmouth Harbour, Isle  of Wight. Schooner rigged fore and aft, she was close on two hundred tons yacht  measurement, and one of the smartest vessels of her kind in British waters.  Putting aside her speed when the screw was spinning, she was renowned for her  sailing capabilities. With all sails set, and a fair wind, she could smoke  through the water at the rate of fifteen knots an hour. Thanks to her owner&rsquo;s  wandering proclivities, she was well known in every civilised port, and a good  many savage anchorages had also seen her graceful form glide into their smooth  waters. </p>
  <p>Some  said that her engines were too powerful for her frame; and, indeed, when all  her furnaces were going, the boat quivered from stem to stern at every rise and  fall of the cranks. Philip, however, rarely used the full power of her screw,  as it was quite unnecessary; but when she did fire up to the extent of her furnace  accommodation, her speed was something wonderful. Sometimes the baronet used  the screw, more often the sails; and, with her white wings spread like summer  clouds, <i>The Bohemian</i>, leaning to leeward rode the surges like a Venus of  the foam. Taper masts, splendid spars, cotton-white cloths, she looked a thing  of beauty as she swirled through the sea in a smother of foam. She was the  pride of Philip&rsquo;s heart, and whether becalmed in the doldrums or seething  through troubled waters in the heel of the trade, was well worthy of her owner&rsquo;s  admiration. </p>
  <p>Jack  was scarcely less enthusiastic. He knew more of the land than of the sea, and  this was the first time he had ever had the opportunity of inspecting a crack  yacht. It was impossible not to admire her milk-white decks, her well-polished  brasses, and the general spruceness of her whole appearance. Philip attended  thoroughly well to her wants, and despite her frequent voyagings in stormy  seas, she always looked as though she had just left dry dock. When the screw  thrashed the water into silver froth, and the black smoke poured from the wide  funnel, <i>The Bohemian</i> knew what was expected of her, and put her heart  into her work. In such a craft it was impossible that a voyage could be  otherwise than pleasant, and Jack looked forward to having a thoroughly jolly  run to Yucatan with his old schoolfellows. </p>
  <p>As  has before been stated, they were at Yarmouth. Not that land-and-water Norfolk  puddle, but the quaint little seaport in the Isle of Wight. It was famous  enough in the old days, and in the reign of our second Charles, the governor of  the island made it his head-quarters. Now his old residence is turned into an  hotel, and in comparison with Cowes and Ryde, this once populous town is a mere  village. With its narrow streets, and antique houses, and indolent townsfolk,  it has an old-world air, and is still affected by some yachtsmen at the time  when the Solent is full of graceful boats. Philip was very fond of this  out-of-the-way seaport, and generally left <i>The Bohemian</i> in its harbour  when he wished to run up to town. </p>
  <p>After  that famous dinner, the four friends separated in order to prepare for the  voyage. As they had only one clear day in which to do all things, there was  little time to be lost. Peter started for Barnstaple by the early train, in  order to arrange his affairs, and, to save time, Philip agreed to pick him up  at Plymouth. The special correspondent went straight to his chief, and told him  of his desire to start for Cholacaca at once; so, as it seemed pretty certain  that the difference between Don Hypolito and the Government would culminate in  a civil war, Tim duly received his orders. Now he was flying round town  collecting needful articles for his campaign, and was expected down by the  early train. </p>
  <p>On  his part, Jack had absolutely nothing to do in London. He already possessed all  necessaries, and had neither the money nor the inclination to buy things he did  not want. Indeed, leaving the bulk of his belongings in Tlatonac, he had  arrived in England with but a single portmanteau, which had been left at the  station. Philip carried the homeless wanderer to his club, and put him up for  the night, and next day they took themselves and the solitary portmanteau down  to Yarmouth, where they soon made themselves comfortable on board the yacht.  All things being thus arranged, they only waited Tim&rsquo;s arrival to leave for  Plymouth, from whence, after taking Peter on board, <i>The Bohemian</i> could  bear away westward in the track of Columbus. </p>
  <p>With  all his indolence Philip was no dilettante yachtsman, to leave everything to  his sailing master, and thoroughly believed in looking after things himself.  After displaying the beauties of his boat to Jack, he busied himself with  seeing about stores, and making sure that all was in order for the voyage.  While the baronet was thus engaged, Jack wandered over the yacht in a musing  sort of fashion, thinking not so much of the scene around him as of Dolores and  of the possible events now happening at Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>He  had good reason to mistrust Don Hypolito knowing as he did how treacherous and  cruel was the nature of that would-be dictator. Half Indian, half Spanish, this  Mestizo possessed the worst traits of both races, and, once his passions were  aroused, would stop at nothing to accomplish his desire. It was true that it  was principally on account of the opal that he desired to marry Do&ntilde;a Dolores;  but he was also in love with her beauty, and adored her in a sensual, brutish  fashion, which made Jack grind his teeth and clench his hands at the very thought.  Yet he was undeniably a clever man, and skilled in diplomatic intrigue;  therefore it might be that his revolt against the established Government of  Cholacaca would end in his assuming the dictatorship. In such an event, he  would certainly force Dolores to become his wife; and against his power the  Englishman would be able to do nothing. Still, as he had now the aid of his  three friends, Duval hoped, if it came to the worst, to escape with Dolores and  the opal in Philip&rsquo;s yacht. Once on the open sea, and they could laugh at  Xuarez and his threats. The engines of <i>The Bohemian</i> were not meant for  show. </p>
  <p>What  Jack feared was that Don Hypolito might have resorted to strong measures, and  carried off Dolores with him to Acauhtzin. Hitherto there had been no suspicion  that he intended to revolt; so, lulled by a sense of false security, Dolores  might have permitted herself to be kidnapped, in which case Jack hardly knew  what to do. Still, it might be that nothing had happened save the withdrawal of  Xuarez to Acauhtzin, and Duval fervently hoped that he and his friends might  arrive at Tlatonac before the out-break of hostilities. Provided he started  fair with Xuarez in the game, Jack hoped to come off winner&mdash;Dolores, the opal,  and the Republic, being the stakes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we start to-morrow, it will not be long before we reach Chalacaca,&rdquo; thought  Jack, as he leaned over the taffrail looking absently at the dull-hued water. &ldquo;Once  there, and I will be able to protect Dolores. If the worst comes, there is  always Philip&rsquo;s yacht, and as to marriage, I am sure Maraquando would rather  see his niece married to me than to that Xuarez half-bred.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a brown study, Jack?&rdquo; said Cassim&rsquo;s voice, behind him. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give a penny  for your thoughts, for they are worth more.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you are thinking of Do&ntilde;a Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a true bill,&rdquo; replied Jack, with an ingenuous blush. &ldquo;I was hoping she had not  been carried off to Acauhtzin by that scoundrel Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  your friend Don Hypolito! Not a bit of it. If all you say is correct, he is in  too serious a position, at present, to hamper himself with a woman. Don&rsquo;t  worry, fond lover. <i>The Bohemian</i> will take us to Central America in less  than no time, and if there&rsquo;s going to be a row, we&rsquo;ll be there to see its genesis.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope and trust so,&rdquo; said Duval, gloomily; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not so hopeful as you are.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hopeful! My dear lad, I&rsquo;m the most pessimistic person in existence; but at this  moment I look at things from a common-sense point of view. If Xuarez intends  business, he has withdrawn to Acauhtzin to make his plans. To do so, he  requires time. If he had kidnapped Do&ntilde;a Dolores, things would be brought to a  head before his plans were ripe. Therefore he has not kidnapped her. Q.E.D. So  come ashore, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you finished your business?&rdquo; asked Jack, following Sir Philip into his boat. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  everything is right. As soon as Tim arrives, we shall start for Plymouth, to  pick up Peter. I wish Tim would come down to-night; but I suppose even a  special correspondent must have time to collect his traps.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is your reason for going ashore?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the first place, I wish to send a wire to my lawyer, as to my destination; and,  in the second, I desire to stretch my legs. Let us have as much dry land as we  can get. It will be nothing but sea for the next week or so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you been long ashore, this time?&rdquo; asked Duval, as they went up to the  telegraph-office. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  five or six days. I came from the Guinea coast, I tell you, to keep this  appointment. I didn&rsquo;t then know it would result in a Central American  expedition.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you are not regretting your determination?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Jack, I am delighted. I have not yet seen a war, so it will be something  new. Now then, Messrs. Bradshaw and Co.,&rdquo; he added, poising his pen over the  telegraph form, &ldquo;I had better tell you where I am to be found. How do you spell  Tlatonac, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;T-l-a-t-o-n-a-c,&rdquo;  spelt Jack, slowly; &ldquo;but why don&rsquo;t you write your lawyer a letter, instead of  sending an unsatisfactory telegram.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to write about,&rdquo; replied Philip, signing his name with a flourish;  &ldquo;all they need know is where I am in case of my possible death, so as to make  things right for the next-of-kin. They have no letters to forward. I always  carry plenty of money, so I never bother my head about them, beyond giving my  bare address.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  they object to such unbusiness-like habits?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  did at first, but finding objections of no use, have quite given up such  preachings. Don&rsquo;t trouble any more about them, but let us take a walk. &lsquo;You  take a walk, but you drink tea,&rsquo; saith Samuel Johnson.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see the connection,&rdquo; said Jack, soberly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  do I; but what matters. &lsquo;Dulce est desipere in loco.&rsquo; There is a bit of  dictionary Latin for your delectation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter  said you were a misanthrope, Philip; but I don&rsquo;t think so myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter  is a &mdash; collector of butterflies,&rdquo; retorted Philip, gaily. &ldquo;I <i>was</i> a  misanthrope; man delighted me not, nor woman neither; but now I have met the  friends of my youth, I feel much better. The friends we make in life are never  as dear as those we make at school. Since leaving Bedford I have made none. I  have lived for my yacht and in my yacht. Now that I have you, and Tim, and  Peter, I feel that I am rapidly losing the character for Timonism. Like Mr.  Bunthorne, I am a reformed character.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Mr. Bunthorne? a friend of yours?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack,  Jack! you are a sad barbarian. It is a character in one of Gilbert and Sullivan&rsquo;s  operas. But you have lived so long among savages that you don&rsquo;t know him; in  fact, I don&rsquo;t believe you know who Gilbert and Sullivan are.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I do. I&rsquo;m not so ignorant as all that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is balm in Gilead then,&rdquo; said Cassim, satirically. &ldquo;Jack, when you marry  Dolores, and realise the opal, you must return to civilisation. I can&rsquo;t let the  friend of my youth dwell among the tombs any longer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very happy among the tombs.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you are. You would be happy anywhere,&rdquo; rejoined Philip, enviously. &ldquo;Would  I were as easily contented. Tell me how to be happy, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  married,&rdquo; returned Jack, promptly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Married!&rdquo;  echoed Cassim, as though the idea were a new revelation; &ldquo;that is a serious  question, Jack, which needs serious discussion. Let us sit down on this soft  turf, my friend, and you shall give your opinions regarding matrimony. You don&rsquo;t  know anything about it as yet; but that is a mere detail.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time, owing to their rapid walking, they had left Yarmouth far behind, and  having turned off the high-road, were now strolling across a field yellow with  gorse. In a few minutes they arrived at a land-slip where the earth fell  suddenly down to the beach. The brow of this was covered with soft grass,  starred with primroses, and Philip threw himself down thereon with a sigh of  content. Jack more soberly seated himself by the side of his friend, and for a  few moments they remained silent, gazing at the scene. Below was the rent and  torn earth, on either side a scanty fringe of trees, and in front the blue sea  stretching far away towards the dim line of the Hampshire coast. A gentle wind  was blowing, the perfume of the wild flowers came delicately on its wings, and  they could hear the waves lapping on the beach below, while occasionally a bird  piped in the near boughs. It was very cool, pastoral and pleasant, grateful  enough to Jack&rsquo;s eyes, weary of the burning skies, and the gorgeous  efflorescence of the tropics. Ah me! how often we sigh for green and misty  England in the lands of the sun. </p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;There  is no land like England,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted Jack, absently smelling a pale primrose. &ldquo;Ah!  there is no doubt it is the most delightful country in the whole world. I have  been all over the planet, so I ought to know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet you propose to leave the land you profess to love,&rdquo; said Philip, rolling  himself over so as to catch his friend&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Jack, you are inconsistent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must earn my bread and butter. Everyone isn&rsquo;t born like you, with a silver  spoon in his mouth. If I can&rsquo;t find employment in England, I must go abroad.  Besides, there is always Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; assented Philip, gravely, &ldquo;there is always Dolores. Is she pretty,  Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo;  echoed Duval, with huge disdain; &ldquo;if there is one adjective that does <i>not</i> describe Dolores it is &lsquo;pretty.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  a vague description. Fra Angelica, Burne Jones, Gustave Dor&eacute;, all paint angels  differently.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mind being more minute, if you care to listen. But I do not wish to  bore you with my love affairs.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like to be bored with love affairs&mdash;when they are those of Jack Duval.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  smiled thankfully. He was eager to talk of Dolores to Philip; but being  somewhat sensitive to ridicule, hesitated as to whether he should do so. As a  rule, a man&rsquo;s friends do not care about listening to a lover&rsquo;s ravings. Women  are the most sympathetic in such a case; but as Jack had no female friend in  whom to confide, he had either to hold his tongue or tell Philip. Philip, he  thought, would not care for descriptions of the beloved one, so he kept silent;  but now that he had been warmly requested to be as explicit as he pleased, he  eagerly hastened to unbosom himself. At that moment, Jack thought Philip an  angel of sympathy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores,&rdquo;  he began slowly, fixing his eyes seaward, &ldquo;is rather tall, with a charming  figure. Her hair is purple black, her face oval, and her complexion inclined to  be darkish. She has teeth like pearls, and a mouth like Cupid&rsquo;s bow. Her  eyes&mdash;well, her eyes,&rdquo; said Jack, enthusiastically, &ldquo;are like those velvety dark  pansies when the dew lies on them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the first original epithet you&rsquo;ve used, Jack. Teeth of pearl, and Cupid&rsquo;s bow  for a mouth are old similes. Dew on pansies is distinctly good.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  if you are going to laugh&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack, angrily, when Cassim hastened to  disclaim any such discourtesy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not laughing, my dear lad. I am only complimenting you on your ingenuity. I  know exactly what kind of a woman Dolores is. She is like De Musset&rsquo;s  Marquise&mdash;half fiend, half angel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never heard of her,&rdquo; interrupted Duval, bluntly, as he produced a gold oval  from his pocket; &ldquo;but, to save further description, look at this picture. It  was done for me by a Spanish fellow at Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  surveyed the portrait in the locket long and earnestly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  Dolores a temper, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;  replied Jack, laconically; &ldquo;but what do you think of her?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has an exquisite face, and, judging from her mouth, a fiery temper. I don&rsquo;t  wonder you are in love with her, Jack. I hope she&rsquo;ll make you a good wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem rather doubtful on that point,&rdquo; said Jack, half annoyed, as he restored  the locket to his waistcoat pocket. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m doubtful of the advisability of mixed marriages  in the matter of race. It may be all very well for the offspring, who, as a  rule, are clever; but the husband and wife, having different trainings, do not  as a rule hit it off. Race-nature again, my friend.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that,&rdquo; rejoined Jack, equably, &ldquo;I have lived so long in Mexico and South  America that I am half Spanish in my habits, and so can suit myself to Dolores.  Besides, when we are married, we will stay in Spanish America; it will be more  advisable than coming to England.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I agree with you there,&rdquo; said Philip, lazily; &ldquo;in fact, I think the indolent  Creole life of South America would suit me also. I also must find an Indian-Spanish  spouse. And that reminds me, Jack, that we sat down to discuss my marriage  prospects, whereas we&rsquo;ve done nothing but talk about yours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  suppose you marry Do&ntilde;a Eulalia?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  have you found me a spouse already?&rdquo; cried Cassim, sitting up, with a ringing  laugh. &ldquo;And who, is Do&ntilde;a Eulalia?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cousin of Dolores, and the daughter of Don Miguel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she as beautiful as her cousin? But there, I needn&rsquo;t ask that. Of course, in  your eyes, no one is so perfect as Dolores. Well, I will consider the matter  when I see Eulalia. It is too important a step to take without due  consideration.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense you talk, Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  shouldn&rsquo;t I talk nonsense? Between you and me, Jack, I grow weary at times of  very sensible people. We won&rsquo;t discuss how that remark applies to you. Tell me  how many more members there are of the Maraquando family.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a son, Don Rafael.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what does the young hidalgo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is in the Cholacacan navy. A very jolly young fellow of twenty-five. We are  great friends. Then there is a Do&ntilde;a Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  beauty?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to her own idea, very much so,&rdquo; replied Jack, dryly. &ldquo;She is the old man&rsquo;s  sister, and acts as duenna to Dolores and Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  an old maid. Good! We will marry her to Peter, and they can collect butterflies  together.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Do&ntilde;a Serafina would marry anyone; but why to Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. Peter looks as if he needed a wife; so, as he won&rsquo;t choose one for  himself, I must do so for him. Oh,&rdquo; yawned Philip, rising reluctantly to his  feet, &ldquo;what a pleasant talk we have had. I suppose it&rsquo;s time we returned to the  boat? Come, John, I&rsquo;ll race you to the road.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Nothing  loth, Jack accepted the challenge at once, and, though Philip ran like a deer,  succeeded in beating him easily. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;  gasped Cassim, leaning breathless against a fence which verged on the  high-road. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one too many for me, Jack. I thought I was a good runner,  but you can beat me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  out of training. Too much flesh. Too soft muscles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll soon right all that at Cholacaca, when we run from the enemy. Constant  life on a yacht isn&rsquo;t a good thing to develop a fellow&rsquo;s running powers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  jumped lightly over the fence, and walked soberly towards Yarmouth in the  gathering dusk. The sun was setting, and there was a glory over sea and land  somewhat tempered by the twilight. The friends strolled comfortably along,  still talking. Indeed, since their meeting they had done little else but talk,  more especially Philip, who was not like the same man. His reserve seemed to  have melted away like dew before the sun of Duval&rsquo;s geniality, and he was more  like the merry boy of old than the haughty, distrustful man of the present. The  reason of this lay in the fact that he felt he could thoroughly trust Jack, and  it was a great comfort to him that there was at least one man in the world to  whom he could open his heart unreservedly. Secretly, he was much astonished at  the pleasure he found in this friendship, and by no means displeased, for while  in Jack&rsquo;s company the world seemed a goodly place in which to dwell. Yet Duval  was decidedly a commonplace young man, smart enough at his business, yet by no  means distinguished for intellectuality; withal, so warm-hearted and  simple-natured, that Philip surrendered himself entirely to the influence of  this pleasant friendship. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are doing me no end of good, Jack,&rdquo; he said as they walked through the town. &ldquo;Before  you came, I was gradually becoming a fossil; now I am renewing my youth.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; replied Jack simply. &ldquo;But indeed, Philip, so far as I  can see, you seem to be as jolly as a sandboy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t a week ago. It&rsquo;s the sunshine of your happy geniality, Jack. I will stay  with you until the cure is complete. Then I will see you safely married to  Dolores; present you with the opal stone, as a dowry, and then&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then!&rdquo; repeated Jack, as his friend paused. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will take up the old discontented life again.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t let you do that,&rdquo; said Duval, slipping his arm within that of Philip&rsquo;s. &ldquo;No.  I will cure you, as you say, and then you will marry Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  That&rsquo;s doubtful.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure about that, <i>mi amigo</i>. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m hungry, so let us go on  board and have dinner.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  bathos,&rdquo; laughed Philip, but offered no opposition to so sensible a suggestion. </p>
  <p>They  sat up late that night talking of many things, but principally about Dolores  and Tlatonac. Jack gave his friend a vivid description of the Cholacacan  capital, and of the life therein, all of which was highly appreciated by  Philip. The baronet&rsquo;s taste in existence, as in literature, leaned towards the  dreamy and fantastical, so the languorous life of Spanish America in sleepy  towns, amid the dilapidated pomp of former splendours, appealed greatly to the  imaginative side of his nature. Hitherto his visits to these out-of-the-way  places had been limited to a few days ashore, while his yacht was anchored in  the harbour; but this time he determined to take Jack for his guide, and live  the life of these strange people. It was a dream of the Orient in a new world.  The Arabian Nights in the west. </p>
  <p>Next  morning they were up early in order to greet Tim, who duly arrived in a state  of great excitement. He was delighted to be once more on the war-path,  especially as he was to go through the campaign in the company of his old  school-fellows. The business of putting his luggage on board took but little  time, as Tim did not believe in special correspondents travelling with much  impedimenta. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could have brought more luggage, if you had liked,&rdquo; said Philip, when they  inspected Tim&rsquo;s modest kit. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;More!  Haven&rsquo;t I got all I want,&rdquo; retorted Tim, indignantly. &ldquo;What would I be stuffing  up the boat with rags for. A tooth-brush and a clean collar is all I require.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,  if this is going to be a lengthy campaign,&rdquo; replied Philip, dryly. &ldquo;I expect,  before the end of the voyage, you&rsquo;ll be wearing Peter&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  was so small, and Tim so large, that the idea struck the latter as wonderfully  ludicrous, and he sat down to laugh which he continued to do until the screw  began to beat the water. Then he went on deck to superintend the departure. </p>
  <p>In  due time they arrived at Plymouth without accident, where they found Peter  waiting with as much luggage as a bride would take on her honeymoon. It proved  to be mostly articles for capturing butterflies, and cases for preserving them  much to the disgust of Philip, who hated his yacht to be overloaded with such <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.  With that painful candour which prevailed between them, he told Peter that he  would only take half; but the meek doctor waxed indignant, and refused to go  without all these, what he called, &ldquo;necessaries.&rdquo; So, in the end, Philip had to  give in. </p>
  <p>Then <i>The Bohemian</i> turned her prow westward, and dipping her nose in the salt  brine, followed in the track of Columbus. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV<br>
    In The Track Of Columbus</b> </h2>
  <p class="poem">Spread  sails, out oars, the galley&rsquo;s beak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points westward where the sunset dies.<br>
  The fabled land of gold we seek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which glows beneath the tropic skies,&mdash;<br>
  A jewelled land of Paradise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters round our prow are curled,<br>
  White foam bells streak their turquoise blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We leave behind the ancient world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  seek the new. </p>
  <p class="poem">Spread  sails, out oars, a path of gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams from the sinking sun at eve,<br>
  As those bold mariners of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again romances wild we weave,<br>
  Of splendours we would fain believe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yon path leads on to fairyland,<br>
Which glows within the sunset&rsquo;s heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anguish for that magic strand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  so depart. </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  the notoriety of the Atlantic Ocean for storms, <i>The Bohemian</i> met with  little or no bad weather during her voyage to Cholacaca. Blue skies, blue seas  and fair winds, it was an ideal cruise, and had it not been necessary to reach  Tlatonac with as little delay as possible, Philip would willingly have  prolonged this ocean tramping for an indefinite period. Jack, however, was  anxious to see Dolores; the special correspondent looked forward eagerly to the  fierce delights of possible battles, and Peter hankered after the insect tribes  of Central America; so, in deference to their wishes, Philip made his yacht act  well up to her reputation as a fast boat. <i>The Bohemian</i> did not belie her  fame, and made a bee-line straight for her destination. </p>
  <p>Ignoring  Lisbon, where boats generally touch on their way to South America, the yacht  held on straight for the Azores, passed them in the night, and continued her  course to Cuba, from whence she could drop down to Tlatonac in a few days. She  touched at Havana, which was a trifle out of her course, at the express request  of Jack, who had a few commissions to fulfil for Dolores; otherwise her nearest  point of call would have been Kingston, in the Island of Jamaica. </p>
  <p>Truly  there are worse lots in the world than a lotus-eating existence on board a  crack yacht, and none of the four friends found the voyage too long or too  dull. Peter attended to his entomological traps; Tim, obeying his journalistic  instincts, made notes of daily events for future use; and Philip, in  conjunction with his sailing master, attended to the navigation of the boat.  The only idle person on board was Jack Duval, who did nothing but eat, sleep,  drink, and think of Dolores, save when he amused himself by worrying his busier  companions. </p>
  <p>Thanks  to the powerful engines of <i>The Bohemian</i> and the uniform speed at which  they were kept the whole time, the voyage to the Carribean Sea was accomplished  in a wonderfully short period. Occasionally, when the bearings of the engines  became heated by constant friction, the screw was stopped and the sails were  set, when the yacht, leaning slightly to one side, swirled through the waters  under a cloud of canvas. They depended chiefly on steam power, however, and it  was rarely that the drum of the screw ceased resounding through the vessel as  she held on steadily westward in the eye of the sunset. </p>
  <p>All  four friends had plenty to do and plenty to talk about, so managed to get  through the days in a sufficiently pleasant fashion. After dinner, which was  the principal event of the twenty-four hours, they sat on deck chatting in the  warm tropic nights, or else stayed in the saloon listening to Philip&rsquo;s piano  playing and Jack&rsquo;s singing. Tim also sang in a pleasant tenor voice, and often  favoured the company with a varied selection of ditties, ranging from pathetic Irish  melodies to the latest music-hall songs of the day. Peter was the most  unmusical member of the party, and, save talking, did little else to amuse his  friends. It is true that he offered to give them a lecture on &ldquo;lepidopterous  moths,&rdquo; but the offer was promptly refused on the score that it would be dull.  Peter could not understand such an adjective being applied to so interesting a  subject. </p>
  <p>It  was at one of these symposiums that Jack gave them a description of the  political situation in Cholacaca, information peculiarly acceptable to Tim, who  was anxious to be thoroughly acquainted with the local affairs of the country.  On reaching Tlatonac, he wrote a capital article embodying Jack&rsquo;s information,  and sent it off at once to <i>The Morning Planet</i>, in whose columns it duly  appeared, and gave the British public an excellent idea of Don Hypolito&rsquo;s  reasons for rebelling against the Established Government of the Republic. Tim&rsquo;s  articles were brutally plain and untempered by style. </p>
  <p>The  night was warm and cloudless. Westward the faint after-glow of the sunset; and  in the east, the slender crescent of the moon, low down on the horizon.  Overhead the constellations large and mellow burned like lamps in the purple  sky, and mirrored their flashing points in the deep, so that the yacht cut her  way through a glittering sea of planetary splendours. The sails were all  furled, and a light breeze made humming noises in the taut hemp of the rigging.  From the wide mouth of the funnel floated a faint trail of smoke, and the steady  screw, with monotonous repetition, throbbed like a beating heart. The water  hissing like serpents, streamed past the black sides of the boat, and at the  prow the white foam boiled like a witch&rsquo;s cauldron, as she rose and fell on the  heaving plain. It was all wonderfully charming, and the voyagers seated on deck  felt it to be so. After a time conversation ceased, and they remained silent,  drinking in the beauty of the night and the infinite magic of the sea. Peter,  unromantic Peter, was the first to break the charm with a commonplace remark. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope we shall get fresh milk in Cuba; I&rsquo;m tired of this Swiss stuff.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  heathen!&rdquo; cried Tim, in a disgusted tone; &ldquo;he thinks of nothing but his fat  little paunch. Can&rsquo;t you admire the works of Nature, you little dunderhead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I <i>do</i> want fresh milk,&rdquo; urged Peter, obstinately. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no eye for beauty, Peter,&rdquo; said Jack, gravely; &ldquo;look at the grandeur of  the scene around you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very pretty.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo;  cried Philip, laughing. &ldquo;I once heard a young lady call the Hallelujah Chorus  pretty. You must be a relation of that young lady, Peter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  all the adjectives in the English language,&rdquo; said Duval, with mock solemnity, &ldquo;the  one I most detest is &lsquo;pretty.&rsquo; &rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Especially  when it is applied to a certain damsel, whereof we wot,&rdquo; interjected Philip,  mischievously; whereat Jack blushed and the others laughed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Peter is so enthusiastic over all this,&rdquo; said Tim, waving his hand to indicate  the same, &ldquo;what will he say when he sees Do&ntilde;a Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bother  Do&ntilde;a Serafina,&rdquo; retorted the doctor, growing red. &ldquo;I wish you fellows would  stop roasting me on the subject.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t a subject, Peter, but an object. Forty-five, and as plain as Tim there!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it me you mean, Jack. Why, I&rsquo;m not bad looking, at all. I&rsquo;ve had that same on  the best female authority. We can&rsquo;t all be heathen gods, like you and Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  object to be compared to a heathen god,&rdquo; said the baronet, lighting a fresh  cigarette. &ldquo;There is ugly Vulcan as well as beautiful Apollo. Your compliment  reads both ways, Tim.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the vanity of the creature. But I&rsquo;m not going to pass compliments, sir. No, it&rsquo;s  my intention to request Mister Duval to deliver a speech.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about?&rdquo; asked Jack, considerably taken aback at this cool request. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the politics of Cholacaca. I dursn&rsquo;t neglect my business, lads, and the first  letter I have to send to my chief is a report of the cause of this shindy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  information will be useful to us all,&rdquo; said Philip, settling himself more  comfortably in his chair; &ldquo;we will then know which side to take, Don Miguel&rsquo;s  or Don Hypolito&rsquo;s. Go on, Jack, and you, Peter, hold your tongue; interrupt,  and I&rsquo;ll give orders for your removal overboard.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  doctor grinned and expressed his desire to know all that Jack had to say on the  subject; whereat Duval, without wasting any time, plunged at once into the  middle of the subject. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a difficult task,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his chin in some perplexity; &ldquo;but first you  must know the geography of Cholacaca. It has more depth than breadth, being a  strip of country lying south of Yucatan, about four hundred miles long and two  hundred broad. Tlatonac, the chief town, is in the south, and Acauhtzin, the  second city, in the north, about three hundred miles intervening. There are  other towns of more or less importance in the interior; but the most of  Cholacaca consists of dense forests inhabited by Indians and dotted with buried  cities.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of which contains the Temple of the Harlequin Opal, I suppose,&rdquo; said Philip,  leisurely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have an idea that the Temple of the Opal is not very far from Tlatonac; but  of this I am not sure. Well, to proceed. The country is very mountainous, and  there are comparatively few roads. I am engaged by the Government to construct  a railway to Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  far have you constructed?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty  miles, or thereabouts, and now that this war is on the tapis, I expect the  works will have to be abandoned. Failing this railway, the only way to get to  the second capital is by water. So, you see, communication between the two  towns is not so perfect as it might be.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  thus offers good opportunities to Don Hypolito to make things nasty for the  Government.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no doubt of that, provided Don Hypolito can secure the allegiance of the navy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  navy!&rdquo; said Peter, in surprise. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say, Jack, that Cholacaca  has a navy?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very good one, as South American navies go. They have three war-ships, named  respectively, <i>The Columbus</i>, <i>The Cortes</i>, and <i>The Pizarro</i>,  all first-class vessels. The Government has also sent to England for two  torpedo-boats, which are expected out shortly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  if Don Hypolito commands the navy, he can do what he likes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly. Tlatonac is well fortified, and the war-ships would have to keep well  out of the range of the guns.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  army worth mentioning?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  a capital army for this part of the world. Mostly Mestizos, you know; and, if  needs be, I dare say the Government can secure the forest Indians as their  allies. Fools if they do. No wise man trusts an Indian. That holds good of  governments also, I take it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Judging  from your opal story,&rdquo; said Philip, reflectively, &ldquo;it seems to me that this  Indian business depends on the stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. If Don Hypolito secures Dolores and her opal, the Indians, out of sheer  superstition, will side with him against the Government. In that case, they are  too near Tlatonac to be pleasant.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what are the plans of this Don, if you please,&rdquo; asked Tim, who was scribbling  shorthand notes in his pocket-book. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  you&rsquo;ll have to ask Xuarez about those, and then he won&rsquo;t tell you. So far as I  can judge, he will win over the navy to his side, establish his head-quarters  at Acauhtzin, and make things unpleasant all round. With the navy of three, he  can blockade Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the torpedo-boats?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They,  no doubt, are on their way out from England. If the war-ships can stop them,  they certainly will.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Torpedo-boats  are unpleasant things to handle.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I don&rsquo;t suppose the war-ships will try force. Those in charge of the two  torpedo-boats won&rsquo;t know of the disaffection of the navy; so possibly their  commander will be decoyed on board the ships, and the rebels can place their  own men in charge of the torpederas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; said Philip, after a pause, &ldquo;it would be as well to use this yacht  to warn them before they enter the harbour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Philip, if you tried on that game, the rebels would send a war-ship after  you, and <i>The Bohemian</i> would be knocked to bits.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if she gets a start. I&rsquo;ll back her speed against the whole Cholacacan navy.  When <i>The Bohemian</i> has all her furnaces going, she is like a streak of  greased lightning.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  after all,&rdquo; said Peter, yawning, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we need anticipate evil. Don  Hypolito may <i>not</i> have rebelled, and the navy may still be loyal to the  Government.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried Tim, sticking his chin in the air, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ve come all these miles  to see a flash in the pan. If Don Hypolito doesn&rsquo;t revolt, I shall consider  myself deceived. I want war&mdash;blood red war, and plenty of it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barbaric  wretch!&rdquo; said Philip, indolently. &ldquo;War wasn&rsquo;t invented to fill the empty  columns of your paper during the silly season. Not that I would mind a war  myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  see all that and more,&rdquo; remarked Jack, confidently. &ldquo;Xuarez is bent on becoming  Dictator of the Republic, and as President Gomez won&rsquo;t care about being kicked  out, it will be a case of war to the knife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of a man is Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  like Napoleon: a wonderful man, I can tell you. You can see from his face that  he was born to command. If he gains the day, he won&rsquo;t be content with playing  at Dictator. Not he! He&rsquo;ll make himself Emperor, establish his capital in the  neck of the Isthmus of Panama, and conquer South America. He won&rsquo;t attempt the  north further than Mexico, in case the U.S. Government might make it hot for  him. The Yankees object to foreign domination. Some people are so particular.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  New World is not the place for empires,&rdquo; said Philip, decisively. &ldquo;Monarchs are  at a discount in the Americas. Maximilian failed; Iturbide failed; Dom Pedro  had to leave Brazil. No; Montezuma was the last of the American emperors&mdash;there  will never be another.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  prophesy till you know, Philip. Don Hypolito is as cunning as the devil, and as  clever.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care how clever he is. No one can depend on the half-baked lot that form  the population of Spanish America. You have to form a nation before you can  construct an empire.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  some truth in that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  if Xuarez appeals to their superstition through this opal,&rdquo; said Peter, mildly,  &ldquo;there will be&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  only counts with the Indians. The Mestizos and the descendants of the Spaniards  won&rsquo;t be led by such child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the Church?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  flicked a spot of dust off his coat. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Church has that much power in Cholacaca now,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s effete; it&rsquo;s  worn out. The age of the Inquisition is past.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Don Hypolito does get to be Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo; asked Tim, inquiringly, &ldquo;what  will he do for the downtrodden country?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to his own showing&mdash;everything. Don&rsquo;t I tell you he wishes to found a monarchy.  But when he&rsquo;s got the upper hand, I question whether he&rsquo;ll do much, save what  chimes in with his own personal ambition. Besides, Cholacaca is going ahead now  quite as much as is good for it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  refers to the railway, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly,  and to other things also. This railway will open up a lot of valuable country.  It will run through from end to end. From Janjalla in the south to Acauhtzin in  the north. Then lines will branch off here and there to the sea-coast on one  side, to the mountains on the other. Thus the whole country will be a network  of railways, bringing the population and towns within trading distance of one  another.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of which visions are to be realised by Jack,&rdquo; said Peter, with mock sarcasm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  realised by Jack,&rdquo; assented the engineer, good-humouredly. &ldquo;If Don Hypolito  gets beaten, and things go on as now, I will have plenty of work.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  virtue in &lsquo;if,&rsquo; &rdquo; quoted Philip, smiling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is certainly difficult to foresee the end. Still, Gomez has the army.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Don Hypolito has the navy. It&rsquo;s pretty even, I think.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  combat will be decided by us four,&rdquo; said Tim, conceitedly, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll fight on  the side of Jack&rsquo;s choosing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we will assist the Government. I don&rsquo;t want to help Xuarez to marry Dolores,  and get the Harlequin Opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my opinion that the war has nothing to do with the Harlequin Opal,&rdquo; said Peter,  decisively. &ldquo;If the Indians have got it, the Indians will keep it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  I&rsquo;m within stealing distance of it,&rdquo; replied Jack, promptly. &ldquo;No; whatever  comes and goes, I&rsquo;m determined to get that opal. It belongs to Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Dolores belongs to you. You are an unselfish person, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Duval  laughed good-humouredly at Philip&rsquo;s mild protestation, and began to talk of  other things. Tim went down to the saloon to arrange his notes; Peter turned  in, and the symposium broke up without further conversation. </p>
  <p>This  is only a sample of the many talks they had on the subject of Cholacaca. The  information supplied by Jack was useful, as it showed his three companions  plainly how matters stood. On their arrival at Tlatonac, they were thus well  acquainted with the causes of the war, and could follow future developments  with great interest. And when this last conversation took place, Tlatonac was  not far off. </p>
  <p>After  leaving Havana, where they only stayed a few hours for a run ashore, the yacht  dropped down towards the Bay of Honduras, and drew steadily towards their  destination. The nearer they came, the more excited did Jack become at the  prospect of seeing Dolores once more. As a rule, the young engineer was a  steady, cool-headed fellow; but this love had upset his brain, and he was as  love-sick and inconsequent as any raw lad. Amused at this spectacle, Philip did  his best to restrain Jack&rsquo;s impatience, and kept the engines at full speed, so  that the lover might the sooner arrive within kissing distance of his beloved. </p>
  <p>Within  the circle of the Indian isles the heat grew almost unbearable. Blue sea, blue  sky, and the burning eye of the sun grilling them constantly during the day.  When the west flared red with his setting, and the waters heaved in billows of  crimson, they were glad to welcome the cool night with serene moon and chilly,  gleaming stars. The pitch bubbled sluggishly in the seams of the deck, the  brasses burnt like fire when touched by an incautious hand, and the very air  was tremulous with the heat. In vain, with linen suits, solar topees, and  constant keeping in the shade, they endeavoured to find coolness; the sun found  them out, and baked them with his fierce rays till they were half dead with  exhaustion. The heat did not brown them as is customary in more temperate  climes, but simply squeezed all the life out of their poor bodies, until they waxed  so indolent that did they nothing but lie about in shady corners all day,  longing for the night. Even Peter abandoned his entomology; so, from such  sacrifice, must the intense heat be judged. </p>
  <p>Tim  was a perfect god-send in those glowing days of heat and thirst. He was skilful  at preparing drinks, and concocted beverages which enabled them to hold out  during twelve hours of incessant sun glare. Occasionally they passed an island  covered with masses of palms, cacti, and aloes, and sometimes a distant ship  arose and fell against the line of the horizon; but they were too indolent to  trouble about such trifles. It was nothing but eternal sunshine and eternal  heat. But all things must come to an end, and so did this voyage. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;  said Philip, thankfully, as he broiled in the shade. &ldquo;To-morrow we will sight  British Honduras. Then Tlatonac won&rsquo;t be far off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it will be worse on shore than at sea,&rdquo; sighed Peter, mopping his bald head  with a red-silk pockethandkerchief. &ldquo;Why, if&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Peter, throw that handkerchief overboard,&rdquo; cried Jack,  irritably; &ldquo;the very colour makes me hot.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s silk!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what it is. It&rsquo;s red, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  lose your temper, Jack!&rdquo; said Tim, soothingly. &ldquo;Vamos a tomar las once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  Spanish phrase, meaning, &ldquo;Let us go and take the eleven,&rdquo; was introduced by  Jack, and referred to &ldquo;aguardiente&rdquo; (brandy), which has eleven letters. It was  in constant use, and when the familiar sound struck on their ears, Philip and  Peter lifted their heads anxiously. It is but fair to state, however, that in  the sense in which the saying was used on board the yacht, it referred to lemon  squash, which also has that number of letters. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take one, if you prepare it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!&rdquo;  said Tim, viciously. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. Brew one for yourself. I&rsquo;m not a bar tender.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim&rsquo;s  getting up his Spanish for the ladies,&rdquo; murmured Philip, lazily. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he greets them with carambo, he&rsquo;ll be slung out of Tlatonac,&rdquo; retorted Jack,  who frequently indulged in American slang. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I also know how to make love in Spanish,&rdquo; said the Irishman, bluntly. &ldquo;El  hombre prevenido nunca fue vencido.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  shut up!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does that mean?&rdquo; asked Peter, who was profoundly ignorant of the Castillian  tongue. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means, &lsquo;The prepared man is never conquered,&rsquo; you ignorant creature. Peter, you&rsquo;ll  have to learn Spanish, if only to flirt with old Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  deliberately arose from his chair, and walked down to the saloon. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  Peter&rsquo;s way of remonstrating,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot here; we had  better follow his example.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  did, and in a remarkably short space of time were fast asleep. The siesta had  also been introduced by Jack with such success that they slept all day and sat  up all night, when it was cool. It was the only way they had of making life  bearable. </p>
  <p>The  next morning they were within sight of Tlatonac. A long low line of sand  appeared in the distance, topped here and there with a slender palm. As they  drew nearer, they saw the frowning walls of the forts rising above the waters,  and beyond, on a hill, the red-roofed houses of the city. Above all, the  slender towers and high dome of the cathedral. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;  said Jack, noting the absence of the war-ships. &ldquo;No navy! This looks ominous.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think war has begun?&rdquo; asked Peter, turning round in dismay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows! It looks like it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  at all events, the war-ships can&rsquo;t hurt us now,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;we are under the  guns of the forts.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>From  the central part of the forts a long wharf shot into the blue waters. The bay  was covered with boats; intensely green vegetation clothed the shores, and the  white walls of the forts glistening like silver in the blazing sunlight. And  this was Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  most exposed situation,&rdquo; said Philip, thinking of the war. &ldquo;If the war-ships  start shelling those red roofs, there won&rsquo;t be much of them left.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  addressed Jack; but that young man did not reply. He was thinking of Dolores.  Philip turned towards Peter; but the doctor&rsquo;s mental eye was fixed on clouds of  gorgeous butterflies. Tim! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to see a naval combat in this bay,&rdquo; said Tim, gravely, &ldquo;with war-ships and  torpedoes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  monomaniacs,&rdquo; said Philip, rising. &ldquo;War, butterflies, and Dolores. We&rsquo;d better  go ashore now, lads. I&rsquo;m tired of those three subjects.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V<br>
    Don Miguel Is Communicative</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Why,  look you, Se&ntilde;or, thus the matter stands:<br>
    When one is in a country dangerous,<br>
    And night is round him everywhere&mdash;&rsquo;tis wise<br>
    To venture nothing till the morning&rsquo;s light,<br>
    Lest, in the dark, some hidden pitfall lurk.<br>
    Thus stands our fortune. Traitors full of guile<br>
    Are in our midst&mdash;yet, keeping quiet their plans,<br>
    Would gull us into false security.<br>
    We know not where to strike&mdash;for here, and here,<br>
    Danger may lurk, and yet we dare not strike. </p>
  <p>The  house of Don Miguel Maraquando was situated on one side of the Plaza de los  Hombres Ilustres, opposite to the Cathedral, and near the Calle Otumba. Like  the generality of Mexican mansions, it was built in the Hispano-Moriscan  fashion&mdash;a style of architecture peculiarly adapted to this equatorial climate.  Walls of massive stone, impenetrable to heat, surrounded a patio paved with  variegated tiles and brilliant with tropical flowers. From this patio doors  opened into the various rooms of the house, while above were ranges of sleeping-chambers  fronted by a light iron-railed balcony running round all four sides of the  courtyard. The roof&mdash;generally called the azotea&mdash;was flat, and in many houses is  used for family gatherings in the warm nights or during a temperate day. In  this case, however, the Maraquando family made use of the patio, where the  heat, particularly at noon, was not so great. </p>
  <p>It  was a charming spot, cool, bright and airy, with plenty of brilliant-blossomed  flowers standing round the sides in red, porous jars, and vividly green  creepers which twisted round the squat pillars and clambered to the sunlight by  the ladder of the balconies. An old Aztec sacrificial stone carved with ugly  gods occupied the centre of the court, and here and there appeared misshapen  statues of the same grotesque deities. A light awning, gaily striped with red  and white, made the patio shady, and beneath this were cane chairs for the  accommodation of the lazy, and small tables on which to place refreshments. It  was a veritable castle of indolence, grateful to day-dreamers, and, as such,  peculiarly acceptable to the Cholacacans, who are the least industrious people  on this planet. </p>
  <p>Outside,  the mansion, with its massive doors and iron rejas, presented a gloomy and  forbidding appearance, more like a prison than a dwelling house. On entering  the door, however, and passing through the dim zaguan, the internal  cheerfulness of the patio was accentuated by the dullness without. Indeed, the  sudden emergence into the light was somewhat bewildering, as with blue sky  above and flower-decorated patio below, it was some time before the eye became  accustomed to the blinding brilliance of the whole. Graceful architecture,  hideous idols, the splendour of floral treasures, and silver glitter of the  walls, the patio was a most charming spot, and eminently calculated to make  life in this tropical zone remarkably pleasant. </p>
  <p>Into  this city paradise, created by the hand of man, Jack introduced his friends,  and formally presented them to Don Miguel, Jefe Politico of Tlatonac, who,  having been informed of their arrival, awaited them in his patio according to  the etiquette of the country. He was tall and lean and dry, with a most  astonishing resemblance to Don Quixote as delineated by the pencil of Dor&eacute;. For  coolness, he wore a white linen suit, and shaded his austere face with a  broad-brimed sombrero, which latter he removed with infinite grace on the  appearance of the Englishman. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Welcome,  gentlemen, to Tlatonac,&rdquo; he said majestically, in Spanish; &ldquo;my house and all  therein is at your disposal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>After  this hospitable greeting, he insisted that they should seat themselves in order  to partake of some light refreshment. They had the greatest difficulty in  assuring him that they were not hungry; as, indeed, they had just finished breakfast  before leaving the yacht. Ultimately, in order not to offend their courteous  host, they accepted some pulque, the national beverage of Mexico, and were  sorry for the concession. Jack was used to the drink, and professed to like it;  but the others pronounced it beastly. Those who have tried pulque for the first  time will heartily endorse this opinion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  oh!&rdquo; spluttered Peter, trying to conceal his distaste from their host; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  like bad butter-milk.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would I not give for a glass of whisky! &lsquo;Tis pig-wash, this same.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is certainly not the milk of Paradise,&rdquo; said Philip, in disgust. </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel had retired for a moment in search of cigars for the party, so they  could express themselves freely to Jack. They took full advantage of the opportunity. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Mexicans say the angels in heaven prefer it to wine,&rdquo; said Jack, who had  finished his glass with great gusto. &ldquo;They have a proverb: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lo  beben, los angeles En vez de vino.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say much for the angels&rsquo; taste, then,&rdquo; retorted Philip, crossly. &ldquo;Nastier  stuff I never drank. Raki is bad enough, but it&rsquo;s nectar compared with pulque.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  laughed heartily at the wry faces made by his friends, and comforted them after  the manner of Job&rsquo;s acquaintances. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to drink it, however. Don Miguel will be offended if you do not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  all promptly poured the liquor into some of the flower-bearing jars which  happened, fortunately enough, to be handy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  said Peter, triumphantly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll think we have finished it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  bring a pocket-pistol next time,&rdquo; said Tim, gloomily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be having the  cholera with this stuff.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  here is Don Miguel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Their  host returned with a good supply of cigars, which proved to be more acceptable  than the pulque. Maraquando expressed great surprise that Peter did not smoke. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does he say?&rdquo; asked Peter, woefully ignorant of Spanish. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you ought to smoke.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  shook his head in disgust. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  Don Miguel tobacco is slow poison.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Maraquando  laughed when this was translated to him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be very slow, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;I have smoked for forty years,  and yet the poison has not overtaken me as yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>All  laughed at this speech save Peter, who could not appreciate jokes in the tongue  of Castille. Indeed, he began to find his ignorance of Spanish somewhat  annoying, as his friends, who acted as interpreters, played tricks on him. He  became proficient in the tongue when Do&ntilde;a Serafina took him in hand; but that  was many weeks later. </p>
  <p>All  this time Jack was wondering why Dolores did not appear to welcome him back. As  it was not etiquette to ask directly for the ladies of the family, he made the  inquiry in a roundabout way. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  family I trust are well, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are in excellent health, I thank you, Se&ntilde;or Juan. At present I have but my  daughter with me. Do&ntilde;a Serafina and Dolores are staying for a few days at my  estancio.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was bad news for Jack; but as Don Miguel&rsquo;s eyes were fixed inquiringly on his  face, he was forced to dissemble his sorrow. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Don Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  at present with his ship at Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  with Don Hypolito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  expression on Maraquando&rsquo;s face changed, and he seemed about to burst out into  a furious speech; but, out of courtesy, restrained himself for the present. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will talk of this again,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;I am sure you do not care about  our politics.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  we do,&rdquo; replied Jack, emphatically. &ldquo;This gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;indicating Tim&mdash;&rdquo;is a  special correspondent, sent here by a great English paper, to report on your  war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  war!&rdquo; echoed the Spaniard, with some surprise. &ldquo;How do you know there is to be  a war?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  telegrams to Europe say as much!&rdquo; interposed Tim, speaking in Spanish. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Telegrams  sent by Don Hypolito, I have no doubt,&rdquo; responded Maraquando, grimly. &ldquo;There  will be no war, gentlemen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Carambo!  Sacr&eacute;!</i> Damn!&rdquo; ejaculated Tim, who swore fluently in all three languages. &ldquo;I  have been tricked, then?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Se&ntilde;or Corresponsal. You will have plenty to write about; I will tell  you some astonishing news shortly. Meanwhile, I must present you to my  daughter, Do&ntilde;a Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  girl who appeared at this moment caused them all to rise to their feet, and  assuredly a more beautiful vision could not be seen anywhere. She was a little  sparkling brunette, all eyes and smiles (as Tim afterwards phrased it), and  when she beheld Jack, came forward eagerly to greet him with outstretched  hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Juan,&rdquo; she said, in a deliciously sweet voice, &ldquo;you have returned. Ah, how  sorry Dol&mdash;Do&ntilde;a Serafina will be that she is not here to greet you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  gave a side glance at her father on pronouncing the name of Do&ntilde;a Serafina; and,  by that diplomatic substitution, Philip guessed that she was in the secret of  the lovers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust Do&ntilde;a Serafina will return soon, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said Jack, significantly, after  exchanging courtesies. &ldquo;I am anxious to see Do&ntilde;a Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  put her black fan up to hide the smile on her lips, and intimated that she  expected her aunt back on the morrow. Nothing was said of Dolores; but Jack was  not so dull a lover as not to know that, in this case, the lesser Serafina  included the greater Dolores. Meanwhile, neither Tim nor Philip could keep  their eyes off this Spanish beauty, and Don Miguel graciously presented them to  his daughter. As for Peter, he was examining an ugly clay god at the other end  of the court, which showed that he had no eye for beauty. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  your feet, lady,&rdquo; said Philip, in his best Castillian. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  hands for your kisses, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she responded, coquettishly, whereat the baronet  felt a strange feeling about the region of his heart. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord, Lord!&rdquo; he muttered, as Tim was executing court bows to the lady. &ldquo;Great  Heaven! this cannot be love at first sight. It must be the pulque.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  caught Jack&rsquo;s eye at this moment, and saw a derisive smile on that young man&rsquo;s  lips, whereat he smiled also, as if to intimate that he thought but little of  the dainty beauty. Jack knew better, however. Then Peter was torn away from his  Aztec deity, and presented in due form, making use, at the introduction, of all  the Spanish of which he was master. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Bueno!&rdquo; quoth Peter, in perplexity, when Philip came to his rescue. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  &lsquo;a los pies de usted,&rsquo; Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he whispered quickly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t remember all that,&rdquo; protested the doctor. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  los pres ud worsted!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Do&ntilde;a  Eulalia put up her fan at the sound of Peter&rsquo;s Spanish; but understanding the  drift of his remark, replied gravely enough: </p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&eacute;se  usted los manos, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that, Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  hands for your kisses, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  I have to kiss them?&rdquo; asked Peter, in dismay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  it&rsquo;s only a matter of form.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this assurance, the doctor was much relieved, and not feeling any profound  interest in a dialogue carried on completely in a foreign tongue, returned to  his examination of the Aztec gods. Maraquando was already deep in conversation  with Jack and Tim, so Philip had Do&ntilde;a Eulalia all to himself, and made good use  of this solitude of two. He was glad he knew Spanish. &lsquo;Tis a pleasant language  in which to talk gay nonsense. </p>
  <p>On  her side, Eulalia had no strong objection to the company of this eccentric  American&mdash;all foreigners are Americans with the Cholacacans&mdash;and though he was a  heretic, yet he spoke Spanish beautifully, and had no lack of pretty sayings at  his command. Do&ntilde;a Eulalia would have flirted with a lepero in default of  anything better; and as Don Felipe was a most desirable young man from every  point of view, she lost no time in making herself agreeable. Philip, the cynic,  enjoyed it greatly, thereby proving that a considerable portion of his misogamy  was humbug. With the hour comes the eternal feminine. This was the hour&mdash;Eulalia  the woman. It flashed across Philip&rsquo;s mind at that moment that he was playing  with fire. Confident in his own imperviousness to fire, he went on playing.  Then he burnt himself, and great was his outcry. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always understood,&rdquo; said Cassim to his charming companion, &ldquo;that Cholacacan  ladies were shut up like nuns.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great many of them are, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Eulalia, demurely; &ldquo;but my father is  more liberal in his ideas. He delights in presenting us to his friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  charming&mdash;for the friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how delightful&mdash;for us poor women. I assure you, Se&ntilde;or, that I would not care to  be shut up at all; neither would my cousin Dolores!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard of Do&ntilde;a Dolores from Jack!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  flashed a glance at him from her glorious dark eyes, bit the top of her fan,  and made an irrelevant observation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin admires fair people.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Don Juan is fair. Oh, never fear, Se&ntilde;ora, I know all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  what, Don Filipe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about fair people!&rdquo; replied Philip, skilfully, &ldquo;though, for my part, I prefer  dark ladies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  last remark was too much even for the audacious coquetry of Eulalia, and she,  glancing uneasily at her father, turned the conversation with a dexterity  begotten by long practice. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  aunt, Do&ntilde;a Serafina, is dark. She is our duenna, you know. I am sure you will  find her very charming.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  certainly, Se&ntilde;ora, on your recommendation I&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Tlatonac is charming, also,&rdquo; interposed the lady, smartly. &ldquo;Do you stay long  here, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends on&mdash;shall we say&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Duval.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  intention was to hint Dolores; but Do&ntilde;a Eulalia evidently thought the  acquaintanceship was becoming too intimate, and entrenched herself behind her  fan and a smile. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  does it depend on Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Is there, then, to be a war?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know, Se&ntilde;or. My father thinks it likely. If there is, of course you will  go?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Why should I? Tlatonac has many attractions for me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father will show you all over it to-morrow,&rdquo; rejoined Eulalia, with a mischievous  smile. She knew quite well what he meant, but was not going to betray such  knowledge at such an early period of her acquaintance. The proprieties must be  observed&mdash;even in Cholacaca. Mrs. Grundy is not indigenous to Britain only. She  flourished at Tlatonac under the name of Do&ntilde;a Serafina. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came in a steamer, did you not, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  in my yacht, <i>The Bohemian</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  vessel, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  opened her eyes. This Americano must be very rich to own the boat she had seen  steaming into the harbour. But, then, all Americanos were rich; though not all  so nice as this one. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must do me the honour of coming on board, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said Philip, eagerly. Then,  seeing her draw back in alarm at this audacious proposal, &ldquo;Of course, with Don  Miguel and Do&ntilde;a Serafina. Likewise your cousin. My friend Don Juan is anxious  to see Do&ntilde;a Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; said Eulalia, quickly, glancing towards her father; &ldquo;it is a secret. Do  not speak of it now; but let us talk to the Se&ntilde;or yonder with the spectacles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  cannot talk Spanish.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, he can, Se&ntilde;or, I heard him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  burst out into a merry laugh, and went towards Peter, followed by the reluctant  Cassim. Philip was getting on excellently well, and rather resented the  introduction of a third person into the conversation, even though it was but  harmless Peter. That gentleman would much rather have been left alone to potter  about the patio by himself; but Do&ntilde;a Eulalia, who saw his embarrassment,  wickedly made him attempt Spanish, much to his discomfiture. Philip translated  his compliments to Eulalia, whereon she smiled so graciously on the little man  that the baronet grew restless, and Peter began to think there were other  things in the world besides butterflies. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Don Miguel was having an interesting conversation with Tim and Jack concerning  the state of affairs prevalent at Tlatonac. He was much flattered at the idea  that a &ldquo;gran&rsquo;-diario&rdquo; of England should take such an interest in Central  American politics, and paid Tim, as the Se&ntilde;or Corresponsal, such attention,  that Jack began to wish he were in the Irishman&rsquo;s shoes. He would then have a  better chance of Dolores. As for Tim he discoursed blandly, quite unaware of  the honours being showered on him, and when his Spanish failed, took refuge in  French; when that gave out, he supplied his wants with Italian, so that his  conversation savoured of the Tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues.  However, with Jack&rsquo;s assistance, he managed to get along capitally, and gained  a good deal of useful information from the Jefe Politico. Don Miguel himself  was most eloquent on the subject, and particularly rabid against Xuarez, whom  he seemed to hate as only a Spaniard can hate. Dr. Johnson liked a good hater.  He should have met Don Miguel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito is a dangerous man, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with cold malignity; &ldquo;he  wishes to become President of the Republic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why should he not become President?&rdquo; asked Tim, calmly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he would use his position to destroy the Constitution of Cholacaca. We have not  forgotten Iturbide and Dr. Francia. Cholacaca shall never lie at the mercy of a  tyrant, as did Mexico and Paraguay. No, gentlemen. It was not for such an end  that we threw off the yoke of Spain. Republicans we are, Republicans we remain.  If Don Hypolito succeeds, he will find Tlatonac in ruins.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think that will stop him, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Jack, lightly. &ldquo;If he ruins the  old Tlatonac, he can build up a new one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with peons and Indians,&rdquo; retorted Maraquando, fiercely. &ldquo;We, Se&ntilde;or, are Spaniards,  and will submit to the tyranny of no man, much less this Mestizo of a Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you propose to do, Don Miguel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Junta has already decided that. Don Hypolito is to be arrested, brought here  for trial, and banished from the country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how you are going to capture him at Acauhtzin. It is the headquarters  of his party.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Maraquando  smiled grimly, and waved his hand contemptuously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Xuarez  has no party. A few unimportant estancieros believe in him, certainly; but the  whole population of Tlatonac is in favour of the Government.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not the whole population of Cholacaca,&rdquo; said Duval, significantly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is no matter. The Government hold Tlatonac, and, therefore, has all the power  in its own hands. Acauhtzin! a mere village, whose adherence can do Xuarez no  good.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if it comes to war?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will not come to war, Se&ntilde;or Corresponsal. The fleet have gone to Acauhtzin to  arrest Xuarez, and bring him here for trial.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t do that easily.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel laughed in a saturnine sort of manner, and pulled his moustache  savagely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; said he slowly. &ldquo;I think three war-ships, manned by brave men,  are more than sufficient to arrest one traitor.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so,&rdquo; replied Jack, dropping into Americanese, &ldquo;if you can trust their crews.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son, Don Rafael, commands <i>The Pizarro</i>,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;The  Government can trust him and his crew, if no others.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One  swallow doesn&rsquo;t make a summer,&rsquo; Don Miguel. That&rsquo;s an English proverb.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a very true one. Where did you hear that our navy was not to be trusted, Don  Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  and yonder!&rdquo; said Jack, waving his hand all round the compass. &ldquo;I hear this and  that, Se&ntilde;or, and think over things. The general opinion, I find, is that there  will be a civil war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  needs no prophet to tell that. And afterwards?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  it is said the army will support the Junta, but the navy will strike for  Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I thought so!&rdquo; growled Maraquando, savagely, under his breath. &ldquo;If I&mdash;but no,  Se&ntilde;or, you are mistaken. My son, Don Rafael, is in the navy, and many of the  officers are his personal friends. He only consorts with men of honour, Se&ntilde;or.  I swear that there is no fear of the navy revolting. In a few days, our three  ships will come back with Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  shrugged his shoulders. He was a youth of few words, and saw no reason to waste  breath on such obstinacy. All the same, he held to his opinion. Don Rafael or  no Don Rafael, the three war-ships and their crews were not to be trusted. In  spite of his refusal to believe in such treachery, it seemed as though Don  Miguel also had his doubts on the subject. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will see the President about this you speak of, Se&ntilde;or. It is as well that all  things should be guarded against.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is one other thing that should be guarded against,&rdquo; said Jack, gravely. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Serafina and your niece are some distance from the city, at your estancia. As  there may be a war, the country will not be safe. I suggest that you, Se&ntilde;or,  should ride out and escort them back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid I cannot leave the city at this juncture.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let me go, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Jack, eagerly. &ldquo;In any event, I will have to see the  railway works; they are near your estancia, you know. Let me ride over  to-morrow, and I will bring them back with me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too much honour, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Maraquando politely. &ldquo;Still, if you can  spare the time&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that will be all right, Se&ntilde;or. It is settled, then, I will go to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am your debtor, Don Juan, and accept the offer with a thousand thanks. But your  friends&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we will look round Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Tim, putting up his pocket-book, wherein he  had been making notes; &ldquo;and if you will but introduce me to the President,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando, I shall take it as a favour. It will be useful to me in my  letters to Europe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at your service, Se&ntilde;or Corresponsal. His Excellency will have much pleasure  in receiving you, I am sure. Bueno!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  settles you, Tim,&rdquo; said Duval, in English &ldquo;Philip can go with you, unless he  prefers to remain with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia. But Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  send him after butterflies!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Duval  thought this a good idea, and, turning to Don Miguel, explained how anxious  Peter was in pursuit of insects. Could Don Miguel send him beyond the city in  charge of some one, to hunt for beetles? Maraquando reflected for a moment, and  thought that he could do so. There was an Indian named Cocom, who would attend  to Don Pedro. Unfortunately, he spoke no English. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; said Jack, easily, &ldquo;when my friend is hunting the wily butterfly, he  speaks to no one. All I desire is that he should have a guide, so that he be  not lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  I will see that Cocom goes with Don Pedro to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  called Peter from his interesting conversation with Eulalia, and explained  matters. The doctor was quite agreeable, and wanted to go at once to the yacht,  in order to get his paraphernalia ashore. This ardent desire, however, was not  gratified at the moment, as they could scarcely take leave of their courteous  host in so cavalier a fashion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, Jack,&rdquo; said Philip, at this moment, &ldquo;are we to stay on board the yacht  during our stay here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means. We will go to my house.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  are you a landed proprietor, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a rough kind of diggings, but it&rsquo;s big enough for the lot of us. Don  Miguel,&rdquo; he added, turning to their host, &ldquo;I must now take my leave, with my  friends, as we want to see about our house.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  house is at the disposal of your friends, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand thanks. I kiss your hands, Se&ntilde;or Miguel; but for the present we will  stay at my residence in the Calle Huascar.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  not being etiquette to press the invitation, Don Miguel gravely bowed, and  wished them good-bye for the present. He had to go to a meeting of the Junta in  order to confer about the fleet which had remained away from Tlatonac a long  time. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it will remain a longer time,&rdquo; said Jack, as they emerged on to the street. &ldquo;The  navy is going to revolt to Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe that&rsquo;s true, but the old chap doesn&rsquo;t think so. He&rsquo;ll have his eyes  open soon, or my name&rsquo;s not Tim. Where&rsquo;s Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saying  good-bye to Do&ntilde;a Eulalia,&rdquo; replied Jack, smiling. &ldquo;Ah, by the way, here he is!  Well, Sir Philip Cassim, Baronet, I see you are stabbed by a wench&rsquo;s black eye!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  little harmless conversation,&rdquo; protested Philip, guiltily; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a  mountain out of a mole-hill, Jack. I can take care of my heart; but your  charming brunette friend has fascinated Peter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how that can be,&rdquo; said the doctor, dryly, &ldquo;seeing I couldn&rsquo;t  understand a word she was saying.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  language of the eye, Peter. You must learn that. It is more interesting than  butterflies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you seem to think.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo;  said Tim, suddenly, &ldquo;before we go to your cabin, take us to the  telegraph-office, if there is one here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course there is one here. You want to wire to your editor?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet! I want to arrange matters with the officials. There&rsquo;s going to be trouble  here in a week, anyhow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  soon as that?&rdquo; said Philip, starting. He had not heard the conversation with  Don Miguel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,  and sooner,&rdquo; replied Duval, prophetically. &ldquo;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,  Philip; for, as sure as I stand here, news is now on its way to Tlatonac of the  loss of the navy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; said the baronet, quietly, &ldquo;it was a good thing I brought all those  arms with me. You&rsquo;ll have to learn how to shoot, Peter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Butterflies  and beetles,&rdquo; said Peter, absently. He was thinking of the morrow&rsquo;s sport. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI<br>
    Chalchuih Tlatonac</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">This  is a country of magic; for, lo! in the heat of the noontide,<br>
    Silent and lone is the city, no footfall is heard in the highways,<br>
    Only the grasshopper shrilling, the tinkle of water clear gushing,<br>
    And rarely the sigh of the breezes, that stir the white dust on the pavements.<br>
    Magic! no magic but custom; for this is the time of siesta;<br>
    When sinks the sun, then the city will waken to love and to laughter;<br>
    Lightly the gay senoritas will dance in the cold-shining moonbeams,<br>
    Flirt fan, flash eyes, and beckon, to lovers who long for their kisses,<br>
    Then will the castanets rattle, the little feet dance the bolero,<br>
    And serenades sigh at the windows, in scorning of jealous duennas.<br>
    Magic is not of the noonday; when glimmers the amorous twilight,<br>
    Then is the time of enchantment, of love, and of passionate lovers. </p>
  <p>Cocom  was completely ignorant of his real age. He might have been a hundred, and he  certainly looked as though he had completed his century. Long ago he had left  off counting the flying years and meditating on the mutability of human life.  In fact, he had changed so little that it is doubtful whether he believed in  mutability at all. Wrinkled he was, it is true, and slightly bent, but his  black eyes twinkled with the fire of youth, and he enjoyed his meals. These  things argue juvenility, and, as Cocom possessed them, he evidently knew the  secret of immortality. Perhaps he had found that fountain of youth spoken of by  Ponce de Leon. If so, it had affected his soul not his body. He looked like  Methuselah. </p>
  <p>Yet  he was wonderfully active considering his years, and undertook to introduce  Peter to the butterflies of Central America. Arrayed in his white cotton  drawers and shirt, with his pink zarape gracefully draped over his bent  shoulders, he smoked a long black cigar, and waited the orders of the &ldquo;Americanos&rdquo;  in stolid silence. </p>
  <p>Peter  was affectionately handling his butterfly-net, Tim was finishing his breakfast,  and Jack, in a smart riding-dress, was slashing his high boots with his whip,  impatient to get away. They were looking at Cocom, who had just arrived, and  waiting for Philip, who, as usual, was late for breakfast. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  looks too old to be of much use,&rdquo; said the doctor, disconsolately; &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t  Don Miguel send me a man instead of a mummy?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  the mummy is well up in entomology!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  ought to be that same!&rdquo; cried Tim, with his mouth full; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s had plenty of  time to learn, anyhow. Ask the old cocoanut his age, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you take liberties with his name, Tim. Cocom was a king of Mayapan; and this, I  presume, is his descendant.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Royalty  out at elbows!&rdquo; said Peter, blandly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a king, is it?&rdquo; remarked Tim, staring at the Indian. &ldquo;He looks a mighty  second-hand sort of article. I should be a king myself. Wasn&rsquo;t one of my  ancestors King of Cork?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Philip, entering at this moment; &ldquo;where did you pick  up Methuselah?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Cocom, my guide,&rdquo; said the doctor, proudly introducing Cocom, who removed  his sombrero with a graceful sweep. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are going to hunt the ferocious beetle, are you not? What is he, Jack? An  Aztec?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  a descendant of the Mayas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dethroned king&mdash;no less.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the country round here, Cocom?&rdquo; said Philip, taking no notice of Tim&rsquo;s  joke. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or Americano; all! all!&rdquo; replied Cocom, with grave dignity. &ldquo;Don Pedro will  be safe with me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can show him butterflies?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  I can show him butterflies, ants, beetles, wasps; all the Se&ntilde;or desires to  behold.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  being so, Peter, you had better get away,&rdquo; said Jack, impatiently. &ldquo;I want to  be off, and must see you started first; you can&rsquo;t be trusted to run the show on  your own account.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  quite ready. Good-bye, boys; I will see you this afternoon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  me,&rdquo; said Duval, brusquely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to Maraquando&rsquo;s estancia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  care of the sun, Peter,&rdquo; warned Philip, kindly; &ldquo;your head isn&rsquo;t over strong.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  indignantly repudiated this imputation on his cranium, and forthwith followed  Cocom out of the house, gleefully looking forward to a pleasant day. His ideas  of pleasure were singularly limited. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  quite safe, isn&rsquo;t he, Jack?&rdquo; said Philip anxiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Peter to get  into trouble.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Cocom will look after him. I know the old man well. He is devoted to Don  Miguel, who once saved his life. Cocom will sit on a bank and watch Peter  gasping after butterflies. The exercise will do the doctor&rsquo;s liver good.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are off yourself now, I suppose?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you. Really, Philip, you are the laziest man I know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  house that Jack built is the castle of indolence,&rdquo; explained Philip, sitting  down to table. &ldquo;Go, my friend, and kiss Dolores for me!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do nothing of the sort. I&rsquo;ll kiss her for my own sake! Adios caballeros.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  will you return, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow!  Meanwhile Don Miguel will look after you both. Take care of yourselves.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Con  dios va usted mi amigo!&rdquo; said Cassim, graciously. &ldquo;Now go away, and let me eat  my breakfast.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  departed, and Tim went to the window to see him ride down the street. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a fine boy,&rdquo; he said, returning to the breakfast-table. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores ought  to be proud of having such a lover.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no doubt she is, Tim. It is to be hoped the course of true love will run  smooth with Jack; but what with Don Hypolito and the harlequin opal I have my  doubts. What are your plans, Timothy?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  writing I&rsquo;ll be, all day!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  Come and see Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t. Isn&rsquo;t my chief waiting a letter from me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  industry! Tim, you make me feel ashamed of myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil I do. Then you write my letter, Philip and I&rsquo;ll flirt with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia.  I&rsquo;m a white-headed boy with the female sex.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you. It&rsquo;s not a fair exchange.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  she&rsquo;s a dark-eyed colleen, Philip. You have lost your heart there.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Philip, a trifle doubtfully. &ldquo;I have seen too many pretty faces to be  captured at first sight by a new one. I have other things to think of besides  marriage.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have, but you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Tim, ungrammatically. &ldquo;Now get away with you,  and leave me to my writing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be back in two hours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are not, I&rsquo;ll come and look you up at the Don&rsquo;s. Make love to Do&ntilde;a Eulalia  while you can, Philip, for it&rsquo;s mighty little time you&rsquo;ll have when the row  starts. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  ye hear the cannon&rsquo;s rattle? do ye smell the smoke av battle,<br>
    Whin the Irish bhoys are ridin&rsquo; down the inimy so bould?<br>
    Do ye see the bullets flyin&rsquo;? and your faithful Patrick dyin&rsquo;,<br>
    Wid ne&rsquo;er a sowl beside him dear, to kiss his forehead cowld?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tim,  with that sudden transition from mirth to melancholy so characteristic of the  Celtic race, threw so much pathos into the last two lines that Philip could not  trust himself to reply, and went hastily out of the room. He drew a long breath  of relief when he found himself in the hot sunshine, for that unexpected note  of sorrow from jovial Tim touched him more nearly than he cared to confess. In  spite of his cold demeanour and reserve, Philip was of a very emotional nature,  and that melancholy strain had reached his heart. He was by no means prone to  superstition, but at that moment a sudden question stirred his  self-complacency. Never before had he heard Tim sing so pathetically, and the  unexpectedness of the thing startled him. It seemed to hint at future sorrows.  Poor Tim! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  that Banshee song,&rdquo; he said, with a shiver, as he strolled along towards the  Calle Otumba; &ldquo;it makes me think of death and the grave. These Irishmen take  one at a disadvantage. I won&rsquo;t shake off the feeling the whole day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  forgot all about it, however, when he reached Maraquando&rsquo;s house, for in the  patio he found Eulalia, who greeted him with a brilliant smile. The charm of  her society banished the melancholy engendered by Tim&rsquo;s pessimism, and,  chatting gaily to this strongly vitalised being, who restlessly flashed round  the court like a humming-bird, he recovered his usual spirits. There is more in  juxtaposition than people think. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where are your friends, Don Felipe?&rdquo; asked Eulalia, standing on tip-toe to  pluck a gorgeous tropical blossom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow  me to get you that flower, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; replied Philip, eagerly. &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he  added, as he presented her with the bud, &ldquo;are variously employed. Don Pedro is  out after butterflies with Cocom. Se&ntilde;or Corresponsal is writing for his &lsquo;diario,&rsquo;  and Don Juan&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know where Don Juan is, Se&ntilde;or. Yes; my father told me of his kindness. He will  bring back from the estancia Do&ntilde;a Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  flung open her fan with a coquettish gesture, and raising it to her face,  looked over the top of it at Philip. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know, then, Se&ntilde;or, what you know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo;  replied the baronet, tickled at this delicate way of putting it. &ldquo;I know that  my friend wishes to marry your cousin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay  de mi. It can never be.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not rich enough.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not a Spaniard. My father will never consent. And then,&rdquo; she dropped her  voice, and looked round fearfully. &ldquo;The Chalchuih Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know about that also. But it has nothing to do with this marriage.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has everything to do with it. The Indians look on my cousin as one of  themselves, and, if she married an Americano, she would leave the country. Then  there would be no guardian of the stone, and their god would be angry.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  your cousin, then, to marry as they please?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must marry one of her own people. An Indian or a Mestizo.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  suppose she does not?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Indians will carry her to their forest temple, and keep her there in captivity.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!  How could they seize her in Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Do&ntilde;a  Eulalia nodded her head wisely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know how strong are the Indians, Se&ntilde;or. They are everywhere. If they  want Dolores at their temple, they will be sure to capture her if they choose.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  force?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  by stratagem! They could take her away at any moment, and none of us would see  her again.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what does Don Hypolito say to all this?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  spread out her little hands with a look of disgust. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito wants to marry Dolores because of the Chalchuih Tlatonac! He is a  Mestizo; so the Indians would not mind such a marriage. But she hates him, and  loves Don Juan. Let your friend beware, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  whom! Of Don Hypolito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and of the Indians. It is much feared that Don Hypolito is no good Catholic&mdash;that  he has been to the forest temple and seen&mdash;oh,&rdquo; she broke off with a shudder. &ldquo;I  do not know what he has seen. But he hates Don Juan, and, if he captures him,  will put him to death. Se&ntilde;or&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment, before she could say more, Don Miguel entered the patio. Whereupon  Eulalia whirled away like a black-and-amber bird. Philip looked after her for a  second, thinking how graceful she was, then turned to greet Don Miguel. That  gentleman was as lean and dry and as solemn as ever. How he ever came to be the  parent of this fairy of midnight, Philip could not quite understand. But  doubtless she took after her mother&mdash;the female side of a family generally does,  in looks. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was just conversing with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia,&rdquo; said Philip, responding to Maraquando&rsquo;s  stately greeting &ldquo;Your daughter, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is yours also, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; was Miguel&rsquo;s startling reply. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad!  I wish she was mine,&rdquo; thought Cassim, who knew this Spanish formula too well to  be astonished. &ldquo;By the way, Se&ntilde;or, my friend Don Pedro thanks you for sending  Cocom,&rdquo; he added politely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Pedro is welcome a thousand times to my poor services. And where is the Se&ntilde;or  Correspo&ntilde;sal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Writing  for his diario.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno,  Se&ntilde;or. And Don Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is now on his way to your estancia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am his servant, for such kindness,&rdquo; said Maraquando, gravely. &ldquo;Will you take  some pulque, Se&ntilde;or Felipe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thank you, no,&rdquo; replied Philip, remembering his former experience of the drink.  &ldquo;If not troubling you too much, I would like to see Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at your service, Se&ntilde;or. Shall we depart at once?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  signified his acquiescence, though he would rather have stayed in the cool  patio, and flirted with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia. He knew, however, that Spanish fathers  are not the most amiable parents in the world, and resent too much attention  being paid by foreigners to their womankind; therefore he took leave of the  young lady and departed with Don Miguel. Before Philip parted from that  gentleman, he had explored the city thoroughly, and was quite worn out. </p>
  <p>The  Jefe Politico was a most conscientious cicerone. He took Philip to every  building of any note, and gave him a minute history of all events connected  therewith, from the earliest period to the present time. Fortunately, Tlatonac  was not very old, or he would have gone on for a week without stopping. As it  was, he took nearly all day in directing Philip&rsquo;s attention to dates, Aztec  idols, ruins of teocallis, sites of palaces, to battle-fields, and many other  things too numerous to mention. This information was accurate but wearisome,  and Philip felt it to be so. Maraquando was Prescott and Bancroft rolled into  one, as regards knowledge of history, and, having found a willing listener,  took full advantage of the opportunity. Cassim was too polite to object, but he  heartily wished that Don Miguel would hold his tongue. The most pathetic part  of the whole affair was that the poor man thought he was amusing his guest. </p>
  <p>Tlatonac  is built partly on the seashore and partly on a hill. Within the walls of the  forts frowning over the waters are the dwellings of the flat portion inhabited  by peons and leperos, with a sprinkling of low-caste mestizos. From thence the  houses rise up to the top of the hill, which is crowned by the cathedral in the  Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres. This is the heart of Tlatonac, the aristocratic  quarter, and commands a splendid view of the surrounding country. </p>
  <p>The  Plaza was a very large square, fenced in on three sides by the houses of the  Cholacacan aristocracy, on the fourth by the great cathedral. In the centre was  the zocalo, a green oasis of verdure laid out in winding walks and brilliant  flower-beds. Herein the aristocracy took their walks when the band played in  the cool of the evening, using it as a kind of alameda, wherein to meet their  friends and gossip. It was indeed a charming spot, and its green arcades  afforded a grateful shade from the hot sun which blazed down on the white  stones of the square outside. On leaving the zocalo, they entered the church  dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepcion, which once gave its name to the  town now more generally known by its Indian appellation of Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cathedral, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Don Miguel, as they stood beneath the glory of the  great cupola, &ldquo;is built on the site of a famous teocalli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  dedicated to the Chalchuih Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the false god Huitzilopochtli, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; corrected the Spaniard, gravely. &ldquo;I see  you know the story. Yes, it was here that the son of Montezuma&rsquo;s daughter came  with the shining precious stone which gives its name to the city. He worshipped  his barbaric deities after the fashion of his mother, and built here a teocalli  to the war-god, wherein was preserved the devil stone. Many years after, when  the Conquistadores&mdash;our ancestors, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;arrived, the then possessor of the opal  fled with it into the impenetrable forests, and thus the jewel was lost to the  Crown of Spain. The Conquistadores pulled down the teocalli and built thereon  this church to the glory of Our Lady, at the command of Fray Medina, who  afterwards became the first Bishop of Tlatonac. Is it not beautiful, Se&ntilde;or? and  all for the glory of God and the true cross.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was indeed a beautiful old church, mellowed into restful beauty by the lapse of  years. The floor was of marquetry, hued like a dim rainbow owing to the different  coloured woods. Slender porphyry pillars sprang from the floor to the groined  ceiling in two long rows, and at the far end, under a firmament of sun and  stars and silver moons, with ascending saints and wide-winged angels, arose the  glory of the great altar, sparkling in the dusky atmosphere like a vast jewel.  Before it burned a silver lamp like a red star. Tapestries, richly worked,  depended between the pillars, gorgeous brocades were here, faded silken  draperies there, and everywhere faces of saint, angel, cherubim, and seraphim.  Gilt crosses, pictures of the Virgin, statues of the Virgin, side altars laden  with flowers, silver railings, steps of Puebla marble, like alabaster, and  throughout a dim religious light as the rays of the sun pierced the painted  windows. The fumes of incense permeated the building; there was a sound of  muttered prayers, and here and there a dark figure prostrate before a shrine or  kneeling at the confessional. </p>
  <p>All  this magnificence was toned down by time to delicate hues, which blended the  one with the other and made a harmonious whole. Dingy and old as it was, the  whole edifice was redolent of sacred associations, and it required some  imagination to conceive that where now reigned this quiet and holy beauty once  arose a heathen temple, where the victims shrieked on the altar of a fierce  deity. Religion did not seem very flourishing in Cholacaca, for on this day in  the cathedral there were few worshippers&mdash;no priests. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have few priests now, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; explained Don Miguel, gravely, as they left the  great building. &ldquo;The Jesuits were once powerful in Cholacaca, but they were  expelled some years ago. The priests <i>would</i> meddle with politics, and  when the Church clashes with the Government, well, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;one must go to the  wall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the Jesuits went?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  They were unwilling to go, for Cholacaca is one of the richest mission fields.  Not that I think they have done much good, for though the Indians are outwardly  converted, yet I know for certain that they still secretly worship Huitzilopochtli  and the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think so, Don Miguel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  things! The straws which show the wind&rsquo;s course. On the summit of some of these  ruined teocallis beyond the walls, I have often seen fresh wreaths of flowers.  Nay, in my own patio, before those statues of Coatlicue, Quetzalcoatli, and  Teoyamiqui, I have found offerings of flowers and fruit. &lsquo;Tis also said, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  pursued Maraquando, dropping his voice, &ldquo;that in the hidden Temple of the Opal  the Indians still sacrifice human victims to the war-god. But this may be  false.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  probably! I cannot conceive such horrors,&rdquo; replied Philip, with a shudder; &ldquo;but,  as regards priests, there are still some here, I presume?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly;  but not of the Society of Jesus&mdash;save one. Yes, Padre Ignatius is still here. He  was, and is, so beloved by all that the President had not the heart to banish  him. So he yet works for the Faith in our midst.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to meet Father Ignatius?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall do so, Se&ntilde;or. He is a great friend of mine, and the confessor of my  children. Often does he come to my poor house. But let us walk on, Se&ntilde;or. There  are many things to see. El Palacio Nacional, where dwells his excellency; the  Market Place, and the alameda. We are proud of our alameda, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Thus  talked on Don Miguel, and, amused by the novelty of the scene, Philip stared  round him with great pleasure. They passed the pulquerias, which are the  public-houses of Tlatonac, saw the Palacio Nacional, a huge stone building,  above which flaunted the yellow flag of the Republic, with its device of a  white stone, darting rays of red, yellow, green, and blue, in allusion to the  opal, explored the prison, which held a fine collection of ruffians, and  ultimately arrived at the Market Place. </p>
  <p>It  was the prettiest sight in Tlatonac, and Philip was sorry he had not the power  to transfer the scene with all its varied hues and picturesque figures to  paper. A square, little less large than the great Plaza, surrounded on all  sides by gaily tinted houses. Reds, greens, yellows, pinks, the Plaza was  girdled by a perfect rainbow, and under the gay awnings before these sat the  dealers and their wares. Here were tropical fruits from the tierras calientes,  comprising oranges, bananas, pineapples, melons, peaches, and an infinite  variety of others, all piled in picturesque confusion on the stalls. As to  flowers, the whole place was a mass of blossom, from gorgeous red cactus buds  to modest bunches of violets. Owing to the geography of Mexico and Central  America, the products of both temperate and tropical zones can be found  flourishing at one and the same time. Hence the violets, which Philip had  scarcely expected to see. They put him in mind of English woods&mdash;of the day when  in the Isle of Wight, Jack told him about Dolores. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the Indians are fond of flowers,&rdquo; said Don Miguel, when Philip expressed his  surprise at the profusion of blossoms. &ldquo;It is a taste they inherit from their  ancestors. The Aztecs, you know, were famous for floriculture. We love flowers  just as passionately; and, go where you will in Tlatonac, you will find  blooming gardens gay with flowers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a graceful taste, and one which the climate enables you to gratify to the  full.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt, Se&ntilde;or. We possess three climates in which flourish different products of  Nature. Tlatonac is in the tierra calienti, or hot country. Higher up, on the  table-lands it is less tropical, and is called the tierra templada, while the  snow-clad mountain peaks, where flourish pine trees, oaks, and hemlocks, is  known by the name of the tierra fria. Thus, you see, in our country we possess  all the climates of the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  rare advantage. Central America is a favoured country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  all save its rulers,&rdquo; sighed Maraquando, regretfully. &ldquo;Nor is its population what  it should be. I tell you, Se&ntilde;or, this land should be the most powerful in the  world. It is the most favoured spot on earth&mdash;the garden of Paradise; but what  with our incessant civil wars, our incompetent governors, and, of late, the  tyranny of the Church, the whole continent is demoralised. Ah, if we but had  the man who could weld all our foolish Republics into one great nation! Then,  indeed, would we be the glory of the earth.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito Xuarez evidently looks upon himself as that man.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito!&rdquo; echoed Maraquando, scornfully. &ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or; he has the instincts of a  tyrant. He would grind down the people as the Conquistadores did their  ancestors. Were he pure minded and noble in his ambition, I&mdash;even I, Miguel  Maraquando&mdash;would support him. I would lay aside all prejudices to aid him to  make our country great. But I know the man, Don Felipe. He is a half-bred, a  treacherous scoundrel, who wants to be the Santa Anna of the Republic. Let him  beware of Iturbide&rsquo;s fate!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events, he intends to become Emperor,&rdquo; persisted Philip, calmly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  The Junta has decided that he is to be banished from Cholacaca. Already the  fleet is at Acauhtzin to arrest him, and to-morrow we send up a special message  that he is to be brought to Tlatonac at once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  he refuses to come?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will be brought by force.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  provided the fleet do not support his cause.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  too, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Maraquando, thoughtfully; &ldquo;so said Don Juan last night. It  may be so, and yet I hope, for the sake of the country, that the affair may be  ended at once. I believe the navy will continue faithful. My own son, Don  Rafael, is in command of one ship; yet I mistrust Xuarez and his oily tongue.  Yes, Se&ntilde;or, I have thought much since Don Juan and the Se&ntilde;or Correspons&atilde;l spoke  to me last night. I have conferred with His Excellency, the President.  Therefore have we decided to send up a message to-morrow, ordering the return  of the fleet with or without Xuarez. It does not do to trust him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have another man-of-war, then, to go to Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  we have a small steamer. But she is quick, and will go there and return in no  time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if she is permitted to do so,&rdquo; thought Philip; but he did not say this  aloud, lest Don Miguel should grow angry. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  even if the fleet does revolt, we will have the torpederas,&rdquo; said the Jefe,  cheerfully. &ldquo;They are now on their way from England. His Excellency received a  telegram yesterday.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you have the torpederas, you can do a good deal,&rdquo; replied Philip, lighting a  cigarette: &ldquo;and if there is a war, Don Miguel, my yacht is at the service of  the Government.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand, thousand thanks, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; said Miguel, smiling gratefully; &ldquo;but I hope  and trust there will be no occasion for us to ask you to make such a sacrifice.  However, we shall soon know&mdash;in three days at the most. If the fleet are true to  us, they will bring back Don Hypolito. If not, we shall know what steps to take  to defend Tlatonac from being bombarded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Cassim, thoughtfully, &ldquo;you have a telegraph-station here.  In which direction do the wires run?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the Se&ntilde;or Correspons&atilde;l wishes constant communication with England, should there  be a war. Now, if the wires go north to Acauhtzin, they can be cut by Don  Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true, Don Felipe. Fortunately they do <i>not</i> run north. No; the wires  run south to Janjalla which town will certainly remain faithful to the  Government. From thence all messages can with ease be transmitted to England.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  was pleased at this, as he saw that Tim would be enabled to transmit messages  to England with the greatest ease, and thus cover himself with glory. They  conversed for a few minutes on the subject, and then left the market for the  alameda. </p>
  <p>It  was a most delightful promenade. High trees on either side, whose branches  formed a green arcade above the heads of the promenaders. Beds of roses in  profusion&mdash;brilliant tropical plants, bronze statues, marble statues, and plenty  of pleasantly situated seats. One portion was reserved for those who chose to  walk, another for horses and their riders. Hither came all the aristocracy of  the city, when they grew weary of the zocala of the Plaza de los Hombres  Ilustres, and on this day the alameda was crowded. </p>
  <p>In  a gaily decorated bandstand, an excellent company of musicians played bright  music, mostly airs from comic operas, and Philip was amused to hear  Offenbachian frivolities sounding in this spot. They seemed out of place. The  musicians had no sense of the fitness of things. They should have played  boleros fandangos&mdash;the national music of Spain&mdash;instead of which they jingled the  trashy airs of minor musicians. </p>
  <p>The  alameda was thronged by a motley crowd, presenting more varied features than  are to be seen in any other part of the world. Indian women squatting at the  corners selling fruit and pulque, beautiful se&ntilde;oritas with black mantillas and  eloquent fans, gay young cavaliers dashing along on spirited horses, in all the  bravery of the national costume, and not seldom a sour-looking duenna, jealously  watching her charge. Occasionally a priest in shovel-hat and black cassock&mdash;but  these were very rare. The army was also represented by a number of  gaily-dressed officers who smoked cigarettes, smiled at the se&ntilde;oritas, and  clanked their huge spurs ostentatiously together. It was a gay scene, and  Philip admired it greatly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never seen such a mixed crowd anywhere,&rdquo; he said, lightly, &ldquo;save in the  Strada Reale in Valetta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  said Maraquando, after a pause, &ldquo;and what do you think of Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a terrestrial Paradise,&rdquo; replied Philip, &ldquo;and Hypolito is the serpent.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII<br>
    Dolores</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Your  eyes<br>
  Are dark as midnight skies,<br>
  And bright as midnight stars,<br>
  Their glance<br>
  Is full of love&rsquo;s romance,<br>
  When no hate loving mars.<br>
  Oh let those eyes look down on me,<br>
  Oh let those glances wander free,<br>
  And I will take those stars to be<br>
  My guides for life,<br>
  Across the ocean of wild strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores! </p>
  <p class="poem">My  heart<br>
  Those looks have rent apart,<br>
  And now &lsquo;tis torn in twain;<br>
  Oh take<br>
  That broken heart, and make<br>
  With kiss it whole again;<br>
  Oh lightly from thy lattice bend,<br>
  Give but a smile, and it will mend,<br>
  Then love will love be till we end<br>
  Our life of tears,<br>
  For some sweet life in yonder spheres,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolores! </p>
  <p>The  next day Jack came back with Dolores and Do&ntilde;a Serafina. He was puffed up with  exceeding pride at his good fortune, for it is not every young man in Central  America who gets a chance of talking unreservedly with the girl of his heart.  The Cholacacans treat their women folk as do the Turks: shut them up from the  insolent glances of other men, and only let them feel their power over the  susceptible hearts of cavaliers at the yearly carnival. Jack never did approve  of these Orientalisms, even in his days of heart-wholeness, and now that his  future hinged on the smile of Dolores, he disapproved of such shuttings up more  than ever. </p>
  <p>Fortunately  Don Miguel was not a Turk, and gave his womenfolk greater freedom than was  usual in Tlatonac. Dolores and her cousin were not unused to masculine society,  and Do&ntilde;a Serafina was the most good-natured of duennas. Consequently they saw a  good deal of the creature man, and were correspondingly grateful for the  seeing. Still, even in Cholacaca it is going too far to let a young unmarried  fellow ride for many miles beside the caleza of two unmarried ladies. So far as  Do&ntilde;a Serafina was concerned, it did not matter. She was old enough, and ugly  enough, to be above suspicion; but Dolores&mdash;ah, ah!&mdash;the scandal-mongers of  Tlatonac opened their black eyes, and whispered behind their black fans, when  they heard of Don Miguel&rsquo;s folly, of the Se&ntilde;or Americano&rsquo;s audacity. </p>
  <p>As  a rule, Don Miguel, proud as Lucifer, would not have permitted Jack to escort  his sister and niece in this way; but the prospect of a war had played havoc  with social observances. Don Rafael was away, Don Miguel could not leave the  capital, and the ladies certainly could not return by themselves, over bad  roads infested by Indians. Thus, the affair admitted of some excuse, and Don  Miguel was grateful to Jack for performing what should have been his duty. He  did not know that the gratitude was all on the other side, and that Duval would  have given years of his life for the pleasant journey, obtained with so little  difficulty. If he had known&mdash;well, Don Miguel was not the most amiable of men,  so there would probably have been trouble. As it was, however, the proud  Spaniard knew nothing, not even as much as did the gossips of Tlatonac; so Jack  duly arrived with his fair charges, and was duly thanked for his trouble by the  grateful Maraquando. Fate was somewhat ironical in dealing with the matter. </p>
  <p>That  journey was a glimpse of Paradise to Jack, for he had Dolores all to himself.  Do&ntilde;a Serafina, being asleep, did not count. A peon, with a long cigar, who was  as stupid as a stone idol, drove the caleza containing the two ladies. Do&ntilde;a  Serafina, overcome by her own stoutness, and the intense heat, slept heavily,  and Jack, riding close to the carriage, flirted with Dolores. There was only  one inconvenience about this arrangement&mdash;the lovers could not kiss one another. </p>
  <p>It  was a long way from the estancia, but Jack wished it was longer, so delightful  was his conversation with Dolores. She sat in the caleza flirting her big fan,  and cooing like a dove, when her lover said something unusually passionate.  Sometimes she sent a flash of her dark eyes through the veil of her mantilla,  and then Jack felt queer sensations about the region of the heart. A pleasant  situation, yet tantalising, since it was all the &ldquo;thou art so near and yet so  far&rdquo; business, with no caresses or kisses. When the journey came to an end,  they were both half glad, half sorry; the former on account of their inability  to come to close quarters, the latter, because they well knew they would not  again get such a chance of unwatched courting. </p>
  <p>Eulalia,  who guessed all this pleasantness, received her cousin with a significant  smile, and took her off to talk over the matter in the solitude of the bedroom  they shared together. Don Miguel seized on his sleepy sister in order to  extract from her a trustworthy report as to how things were at the estancia,  and Jack departed to his own house, to announce his arrival and that of  Dolores. </p>
  <p>It  was late in the afternoon, for the journey, commencing at dawn, had lasted till  close on four o&rsquo;clock, and Jack found his three friends enjoying their siestas.  He woke them up, and began to talk Dolores. When he had talked himself hoarse,  and Peter asleep, quoth Philip&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the railway works?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t been near them,&rdquo; said Jack, innocently; whereat Tim and Philip laughed  so heartily that they made him blush, and awoke Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Peter sleepily. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s  love affairs,&rdquo; replied Philip, laughing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  by the same token we&rsquo;ll soon be talking of your own,&rdquo; said Tim, cruelly. &ldquo;If  you only knew the way he&rsquo;s been carrying on with the black-eyed colleen, Jack!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  retorted Cassim, reddening; &ldquo;I walked about Tlatonac with Don Miguel yesterday.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  flirted with Eulalia last night, anyhow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be jealous, Tim. It&rsquo;s a low-minded vice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  so that is the way the wind blows, Philip,&rdquo; said Jack, stretching himself. &ldquo;I  knew you would fall in love with Eulalia. Now, it&rsquo;s no use protesting. I know  the signs of love, because I&rsquo;ve been through the mill myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  days&rsquo; acquaintance, and you say I love the girl! Try again, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I! Time counts for naught in a love affair. I fell in love with Dolores in two  minutes!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s the way with us all,&rdquo; said Tim, reflectively. &ldquo;When I was in Burmah,  there was a girl in Mandalay&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim,  we don&rsquo;t want any of your immoral stories. You&rsquo;ll shock Peter&mdash;confound him, he&rsquo;s  asleep again, like the fat boy in Pickwick. Well, gentlemen both, I am about to  follow the doctor&rsquo;s example. I&rsquo;ve been riding all day, and feel baked.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long do you intend to sleep, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  hour or so. Then we&rsquo;ll have something to eat, and go off to Maraquando&rsquo;s to see  the ladies. We must introduce Peter to his future wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begad,  I may fall in love with Do&ntilde;a Serafina myself!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  possible, if you are an admirer of the antique,&rdquo; retorted Jack, and went off to  his bedroom for a few hours&rsquo; sleep. Even lovers require rest, and bucketing  about on a half-broken horse for the best part of the day under a grilling sun  was calculated to knock up even so tough a subject as Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith!&rdquo;  remarked Tim, when Jack&rsquo;s long legs vanished through the doorway, &ldquo;if old  Serafina smiles on Peter, and those girls flirt with you and Jack, I&rsquo;ll be left  out in the cold. Another injustice to Ireland.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to the alameda to-morrow, and pick out a se&ntilde;orita to be your own private  property.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  and get a knife in my ribs. I&rsquo;m more than seven, Philip. Why, there was once a  girl in Cape Town who had a Boer for a sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you took the girl, and the Boer didn&rsquo;t like it. I know that story, Tim. It&rsquo;s a  chestnut. You told it in that book of sketches you wrote. Go on with your work;  I&rsquo;m sleepy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow&mdash;ow!&rdquo;  yawned Tim, lazily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sleep myself, but that I have to write up this  interview with Gomez. Did I tell you about it, Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  you&rsquo;ve told me three times, and given three different versions. Keep the fourth  for <i>The Morning Planet</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the President said&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all about that,&rdquo; muttered Philip, crossly. &ldquo;What you said&mdash;what he said&mdash;what  Maraquando said&mdash;and how you all lied against one another. Do let us sleep, Tim.  First Jack, then you. Upon my&mdash;upon my word&mdash;upon&mdash;on!&rdquo; and Philip went off into a  deep slumber. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the interview with Gomez won&rsquo;t have the same effect on my readers,&rdquo; said  Tim, blankly to himself, &ldquo;or it&rsquo;s the sack I&rsquo;ll be getting. Come on with ye! &lsquo;There  will be no war&rsquo;, said the President. That&rsquo;s a lie, anyhow; but he said it, so  down it goes. Oh, my immortal soul, it&rsquo;s a liar I am.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then  he began scratching the paper with a bad pen, and there was peace in the land. </p>
  <p>That  night they duly arrived at Maraquando&rsquo;s house in order to ask how politics were  progressing. This was the excuse given by three of them; but it was false, as  Tim well knew. He alone took an interest in politics. Even Peter had ceased to  care about Don Hypolito, and the opal stone, and the possible war. He&mdash;under  orders from Jack and Philip, who wanted the girls to themselves&mdash;made himself  agreeable to Do&ntilde;a Serafina. Unaccustomed, by reason of her plain looks, to such  attentions, she enjoyed the novelty of the thing, and thought this fat little  Americano delightful. It is true that their conversation was mostly pantomimic;  but as the doctor knew a few words of Spanish, and Serafina had learnt a trifle  of English from Jack, filtered through Dolores, they managed between them to  come to a hazy understanding as to what they were talking about. </p>
  <p>Never  till that moment did Philip feel the infinite charm of that languorous Creole  life, so full of dreams and idleness. Sitting beside Eulalia in the warm gloom,  he listened to her sparkling conversation, and stared vaguely at the beauty of  the scene around him. In the patio all was moonlight and midnight&mdash;that is as  regards the shadows, for the hour was yet early. Here and there in the violet  sky trembled a star with mellow lustre, and the keen, cold shafts of moonlight,  piercing the dusk, smote the flowers and tessellated pavement with silver rays.  Pools of white light lay on the floor welling into the shadow even to the  little feet of Eulalia. The court wore that unfamiliar look, so mysterious, so  weird, which only comes with the night and the pale moon. And then&mdash;surely that  was music&mdash;the trembling note of a guitar sounding from the shadowy corner in  which Jack and Dolores were ensconced. </p>
  <p>In  the glimmering light Philip could see the grotesque gestures of Serafina and  the doctor, as they pantomimed to one another on the azotea, and the red tip of  Miguel&rsquo;s cigar, as he strolled up and down on the flat roof talking seriously  with Tim. Through the warm air, heavy with the perfume of flowers, floated the  contralto voice of Dolores. The song was in Spanish, and that noble tongue  sounded rich and full over the sweeping music of the guitar. As translated  afterwards by Philip (who dabbled in poetry), the words ran thus: </p>
  <p class="poem">In  Spain! ah, yes, in Spain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When day was fading,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard you serenading,<br>
  While shed the moon her silver rain,<br>
  The nightingale your song was aiding,<br>
  My tresses dark I then was braiding,<br>
  When to my chamber upward springing<br>
  There came the burden of your singing,<br>
  Nor was that singing vain<br>
  In Spain&mdash;dear Spain.</p>
  <p class="poem">From  Spain! yes, far from Spain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two now wander;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here as yonder<br>
  A hopeless love for me you feign.<br>
  Alas! of others thou art fonder,<br>
  And I, forsaken, sit and ponder.<br>
  Yet once again your voice is ringing,<br>
  I hear the burden of that singing.<br>
  Alas! I fled in vain<br>
  From Spain&mdash;dear Spain.</p>
  <p>They  applauded the song and the singer, Jack looking across to Philip as much as to  say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she an angel?&rdquo; If Philip thought so, he did not say so, being busy  with Eulalia. They were talking Chinese metaphysics, a pleasant subject to  discuss with a pretty girl well up in the intricacies thereof. As to Jack and  his angel! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querida!&rdquo;  murmured Dolores, slipping her hand into that of her lover&rsquo;s under cover of the  darkness; &ldquo;how lonely has my heart been without thee.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angelito,&rdquo;  replied Jack, who was an adept at saying pretty things in Spanish; &ldquo;I left  behind my heart when I departed, and it has drawn me back to your side.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  How long will we be together, Juan? I am afraid of this war; should Don  Hypolito conquer!&rdquo; Here she paused and slightly shuddered. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  shall not conquer, cara. What can he do with a few adherents against the power  of the Government?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  the Indians&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are afraid they will join with him. To what end? Xuarez cannot restore the  worship of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juan!&rdquo;  said Dolores, anxiously, &ldquo;it is not of Xuarez I am so much afraid as of the  Indians. If there is a war, they may carry me off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carry  you off!&rdquo; repeated Jack, in a puzzled tone of voice. &ldquo;Why, how could they do  that? and for what reason?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  could do it easily by some subtle device; bolts and bars and walled towns are  nothing to them when they set their hearts on anything. And they would carry me  away because I am the guardian of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you all this?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he does not worship the opal or the old gods. He is a devout Catholic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  says Padre Ignatius; but I think he is one of those who go to the forest  sanctuary. He knows much.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  says nothing. It is death for him to betray the secrets of that Aztec worship.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  Juan, alma de mi alma. The life of Cocom was saved by my uncle Miguel, and with  him gratitude is more powerful than religion. He told me while you were away,  that the opal has prophesied war, and on that account the Indians are alarmed  for me. Should there be no guardian of the opal, Huitzilopochtli will be angry,  and lest I should be killed in the war as soon as the revolt takes place, the  Indians will carry me for safety into the heart of the country&mdash;into those  trackless forest depths more profound than the sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  shall never do so while I am at hand,&rdquo; said Jack, fiercely; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t  believe this story of Cocom&rsquo;s. You cannot be in such danger.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid it is true; besides, that is not the only danger&mdash;Don Hypolito!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wishes to marry me, Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Duval  laughed softly, and pressed the little hand, that lay within his own. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk ancient history, querida; I thought we settled that I was to be the  favoured one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true! ah, yes, thee alone do I love,&rdquo; whispered Dolores, tenderly; &ldquo;but when  you departed, Juan, he came to me, this Don Hypolito, and spoke of love.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  his impudence!&rdquo; muttered Jack, in English. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say you, Juan? Oh, it was terrible! He said, if I became not his wife, that he  would plunge the country into war. I did not believe that he could do so or  would dare to do so. I refused. Then he spoke of my love for you, and swore to  kill you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  have to catch me first, Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There  will be war,&rsquo; said this terrible one, &lsquo;and I will tear down the walls of  Tlatonac to seize you. This Americano will I slay and give his body to the  dogs.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  idle talk, mi cara,&rdquo; said Duval, scornfully; &ldquo;I can protect myself and you.  What more did he say?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little  more; but it was the same kind of talk. When he departed, I spoke to my uncle;  but Don Hypolito had by that time gone to Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Don Miguel angry?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  angry! But he could do nothing. Don Hypolito was far away on the waters.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  will return with fire and blood,&rdquo; said Jack, gloomily; &ldquo;but never fear,  Dolores. My friends and myself will protect you from this insolent one. If we  are conquered, we shall fly to my own land in the vessel of Don Felipe!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what of Eulalia?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  replied her lover, waggishly; &ldquo;I think you can trust Don Felipe to look after  Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think there will be a war, Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks like it. However, we shall know for certain when the messenger comes back  from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  my uncle told me the boat had gone up to-day to bid the fleet return.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wild-goose chase only,&rdquo; thought Jack, but held his peace, lest he should alarm  Dolores. </p>
  <p>Fearful  of attracting her uncle&rsquo;s attention by speaking too much to Jack, the Spanish  beauty crossed over to where Philip and Eulalia were sitting. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Felipe!&rdquo; said Dolores, gaily, &ldquo;wherefore do you laugh?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is at Don Pedro and my good aunt,&rdquo; replied Eulalia, before Philip could speak. &ldquo;Behold  them, Dolores, making signs like wooden puppets.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Dolores  turned her eyes towards the couple leaning over the azotea railing, and began  to laugh also. Then Jack came over and demanded to be informed of the joke. He  was speedily informed of the performance going on above; so that the two actors  had quite an audience, although they knew it not. Indeed the affair was  sufficiently grotesque. It was like a game of dumb crambo, as Peter acted a  word, and the old lady tried to guess his meaning. </p>
  <p>For  instance, wishing to tell her how he captured butterflies, Peter wagged his  hands in the air to indicate the flight of insects, then struck at a phantom  beetle with an imaginary net. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pajaros!&rdquo;  guessed Do&ntilde;a Serafina, wrongly. Peter did not know this was the Spanish for &lsquo;birds,&rsquo;  and thought she had caught his meaning. The lady thought so too, and was  delighted with her own perspicuity. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno,  Se&ntilde;or! You catch birds! To eat?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  imitated eating, whereon Peter shook his head though he was not quite sure if  the Cholacacans did not eat beetles. Foreigners had so many queer customs. </p>
  <p>Seeing  Peter misunderstood, Do&ntilde;a Serafina skipped lightly across the azotea, flapping  her arms, and singing. Then she turned towards the doctor, and nodded  encouragingly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Birds!&rdquo;  she said, confidently. &ldquo;You eat them?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Now  Peter knew that &lsquo;comida&rsquo; meant eating; but quite certain that Do&ntilde;a Serafina did  not devour beetles, set himself to work to show her what he really meant. He  ran after imaginary butterflies round the azotea, and, in his ardour, bumped up  against Tim. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the devil are you after?&rdquo; said Tim, displeased at his conversation with  Maraquando being interrupted. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you behave yourself, you ill-conducted  little person.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they eat beetles, here?&rdquo; asked Tim, eagerly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beetles!  they&rsquo;d be thin, if they did,&rdquo; said Tim, drily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do you eat  beetles, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; he added, turning to Don Miguel. </p>
  <p>The  Spaniard made a gesture of disgust, and looked inquiringly at his sister. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Los  pajaros,&rdquo; explained Do&ntilde;a Serafina, smiling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  &lsquo;tis birds she&rsquo;s talking about!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Birds!&rdquo;  replied the doctor, blankly. &ldquo;I thought I showed her butterflies. This way,&rdquo;  and he began hovering round again. </p>
  <p>Tim  roared. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll  think you have gone out of what little mind you possess, Peter!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  pobrecito,&rdquo; said Serafina, when the meaning of the pantomime was explained, &ldquo;I  thought he was playing at a flying bird.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  never make your salt as an actor, Peter,&rdquo; jeered Tim, as they all laughed over  the mistake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better call up Philip and Jack to keep you straight. Jack,  come up here, and bring Philip with you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Jack, from the depths below, where they had been watching the  performance with much amusement; &ldquo;we are coming.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  quartette soon made their appearance in the azotea, where Peter&rsquo;s mistake was  explained. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  it again, Peter,&rdquo; entreated Philip, laughing; &ldquo;you have no idea how funny you  look flopping about!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled the doctor, ruffled. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t they talk English?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Dolores can talk a little,&rdquo; said Jack, proudly &ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita talk to my friend in  his own tongue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a nice day,&rdquo; repeated Do&ntilde;a Dolores, slowly; &ldquo;&lsquo;ow do you do?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  well, thank you,&rdquo; replied Peter, politely; whereat his friends laughed again in  the most unfeeling manner. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you can laugh,&rdquo; said Peter, indignantly; &ldquo;but if I was in love with a girl, I  would teach her some better words than about the weather, and how do you do!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have done so,&rdquo; replied Jack, quietly; &ldquo;but those words are for private use.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment Dolores, laughing behind her fan, was speaking to Do&ntilde;a Serafina,  who thereupon advanced towards Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can speak to the Americano,&rdquo; she announced to the company; then, fixing Peter  with her eye, said, with a tremendous effort, &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said the modest Peter, taken aback, &ldquo;she said, &lsquo;darling&rsquo;!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo;  repeated Serafina, who was evidently quite ignorant of the meaning. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  one of the words for private use, eh, Jack?&rdquo; laughed Philip, quite exhausted  with merriment. &ldquo;A very good word. I must teach it to Do&ntilde;a Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  too bad of you, Do&ntilde;a Dolores,&rdquo; said Jack, reproachfully; whereat Dolores  laughed again at the success of her jest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  the Se&ntilde;or have good sport with Cocom,&rdquo; asked Don Miguel, somewhat bewildered at  all this laughter, the cause of which, ignorant as he was of English, he could  not understand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you have a good time, Peter,&rdquo; translated Tim, fluently, &ldquo;with the beetles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  splendid! tell him splendid. I captured some Papilionidae! and a beautiful  little glow-worm. One of the Elateridae species, and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t translate all that jargon, you fat little humming-bird! He had good  sport, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he added, suddenly turning to Don Miguel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  replied the Spaniard, gravely, &ldquo;it is well.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was no use trying to carry on a common conversation, as the party invariably  split up into pairs. Dolores and Eulalia were already chatting confidentially  to their admirers. Do&ntilde;a Serafina began to make more signs to Peter, with the  further addition of a parrot-cry of &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; and Tim found himself once more  alone with Don Miguel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have written out my interview with the President,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;and it goes  to England to-morrow. Would you like to see it first, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it so pleases you, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  then I shall bring it with me to-morrow morning. Has that steamer gone to  Acauhtzin yet?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  afternoon it departed, Se&ntilde;or. It will return in two days with the fleet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so, Don Miguel, but I am not very certain,&rdquo; replied Tim, significantly. &ldquo;His  Excellency Gomez does not seem very sure of the fleet&rsquo;s fidelity either.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are many rumours in Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Maraquando, impatiently. &ldquo;All lies spread  by the Opposidores&mdash;by Xuarez and his gang. I fear the people are becoming  alarmed. The army, too, talk of war. Therefore, to set all these matters at  rest, to-morrow evening his Excellency the President will address the  Tlatonacians at the alameda.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  at the alameda?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  most of them will be assembled there at the twilight hour, Se&ntilde;or. It is to be a  public speech to inspire our people with confidence in the Government, else  would the meeting be held in the great hall of the Palacio Nacional.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would like to hear Don Franciso Gomez speak, so I and my friends will be at the  alameda.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will come with me, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal,&rdquo; said Miguel, politely; &ldquo;my daughter,  niece, and sister are also coming.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  more the merrier! It will be quite a party, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a serious position we are in,&rdquo; said Maraquando, gravely; &ldquo;and I trust the  word of his Excellency will show the Tlatonacians that there is nothing to be  feared from Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment Do&ntilde;a Serafina, who had swooped down on her charges, appeared to say  good night. Both Dolores and Eulalia were unwilling to retire so early, but  their aunt was adamant, and they knew that nothing could change her resolution,  particularly as she had grown weary of fraternising with Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno  noche tenga, Vm,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Serafina, politely, and her salutation was echoed  by the young ladies in her wake. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Con  dios va usted, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; replied Tim, kissing the old lady&rsquo;s extended hand,  after which they withdrew. Dolores managed to flash a tender glance at Jack as  they descended into the patio, and Philip, leaning over the balustrade of the  azotea caught a significant wave of Eulalia&rsquo;s fan, which meant a good deal.  Cassim knew all those minute but eloquent signs of love. </p>
  <p>Shortly  afterwards they also took their leave after refusing Maraquando&rsquo;s hospitable  offer of pulque. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; said Tim, as they went off to their own mansion; &ldquo;not while there is good  whisky to be had.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  pulque isn&rsquo;t bad,&rdquo; protested Jack, more for the sake of saying something than  because he thought so. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  drink it yourself, Jack, and leave us the crather!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talking  about &lsquo;crathers,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Philip, mimicking Tim&rsquo;s brogue, &ldquo;what do you think of  Do&ntilde;a Serafina, Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  nice old lady, but not beautiful. I would rather be with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you, indeed?&rdquo; retorted Cassim, indignantly. &ldquo;As if she would understand those  idiotic signs you make.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are quite intelligible to&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, boys!&rdquo; said Tim, as they stopped at the door of Jack&rsquo;s house, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll  get plenty of fighting without starting it now. There&rsquo;s going to be a Home Rule  meeting to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where,  Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the alameda, no less. His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant is to speak to the  crowd.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  tell a lot of lies, I expect,&rdquo; said Jack, sagely. &ldquo;Well, he can say what he  jolly well pleases. I&rsquo;ll lay any odds that before the week&rsquo;s out war will be  proclaimed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  was a truer prophet than he thought. </p>

  <p>Padre  Ignatius always said that his flock were true and devout Catholics, who  believed in what they ought to believe. Strictly speaking, the flock of Padre  Ignatius was limited to the congregation of a little adobe church on the  outskirts of the town, but his large heart included the whole population of  Tlatonac in that ecclesiastical appellation. Everyone knew the Padre and  everyone loved him, Jesuit though he was. For fifty years had he laboured in  the vineyard of Tlatonac, but when his fellow-labourers were banished, the  Government had not the heart to bid him go. So he stayed on, the only  representative of his order in all Cholacaca, and prayed and preached and did  charitable works, as had been his custom these many years past. With his thin,  worn face, rusty cassock, slouch hat, and kindly smile, Padre Ignatius,  wonderfully straight considering his seventy years, attended to the spiritual  wants of his people, and said they were devout Catholics. He always  over-estimated human nature, did the Padre. </p>
  <p>So  far as the Padre saw, this might have been the case, and nobody having the  heart to undeceive him, he grew to believe that these half-civilised savages  were Christians to the bone; but there was no doubt that nine out of every ten  in his flock were very black sheep indeed. They would kneel before the gaudy  shrine of the adobe chapel, and say an Ave for every bead of the rosary, but at  one time or another every worshipper was missing, each in his or her turn. They  had been to the forest for this thing, for that thing; they had been working on  the railway fifty miles inland, or fishing some distance up the coast. Such  were the excuses they gave, and Padre Ignatius, simple-hearted soul, believed  them, never dreaming that they had been assisting in the worship of the  Chalchuih Tlatonac in the hidden temple of Huitzilopochtli. </p>
  <p>The  belief in the devil stone was universal throughout Cholacaca. Not only did the  immediate flock of Padre Ignatius revere it as a symbol of the war-god, but  every person in the Republic who had Indian blood in his or her veins firmly  believed that the shining precious stone exercised a power over the lives and  fortunes of all. Nor was such veneration to be wondered at, considering how  closely the history of the great gem was interwoven with that of the country.  The shrine of the opal had stood where now arose the cathedral; the Indian  appellation of the jewel had given its name to the town; and the picture  representation of the gem itself was displayed on the yellow standard of the  Republic. Hardly any event since the foundation of the city could be mentioned  with which the harlequin opal was not connected in some way. It was still  adored in the forest temple by thousands of worshippers, and, unknown as it was  to the padres, there were few peons, leperos, or mestizos who had not seen the  gem flash on the altar of the god. Cholacacans of pure Spanish blood, alone  refrained from actual worship of the devil stone, and even these were more or  less tinctured with the superstition. It is impossible to escape the influence  of an all-prevailing idea, particularly in a country not quite veneered by  civilisation. </p>
  <p>On  this special evening, when President Gomez was to address the populace, and  assure them that there would be no war, the alameda presented an unusually  lively appearance. It had been duly notified that His Excellency would make a  speech on the forthcoming crisis, hence the alameda was crowded with people  anxious to hear the official opinion of the affair. The worst of it was, had  Gomez but known it, that the public mind was already made up. There was to be  war, and that speedily, for a rumour had gone forth from the sanctuary of the  opal that the gem was burning redly as a beacon fire. Everyone believed that  this foreboded war, and Gomez, hoping to assure the Tlatonacians of peace,  might as well have held his tongue. They would not believe him as the opal  stone had prophesied a contrary opinion. But beyond an idle whisper or so,  Gomez did not know this thing, therefore he came to the alameda and spoke  encouragingly to the people. </p>
  <p>From  all quarters of the town came the inhabitants to the alameda, and the vast  promenade presented a singularly gay appearance. The national costumes of  Spanish America were wonderfully picturesque, and what with the background of  green trees, sparkling fountains, brilliant flower-beds, and, over all, the  violet tints of the twilight, Philip found the scene sufficiently charming. He  was walking beside Jack, in default of Eulalia, who, in company with Dolores,  marched demurely beside Do&ntilde;a Serafina. This was a public place, the eyes of  Tlatonac gossips were sharp, their tongues were bitter, so it behoved discreet  young ladies, as these, to keep their admirers at a distance. In the patio it  was quite different. </p>
  <p>Tim  had gone off with Don Miguel, to attach himself to the personal staff of the  President, and take shorthand notes of the speech. It had been the intention of  Peter to follow his Irish friend, but, unfortunately, he lost him in the crowd,  and therefore returned to the side of Philip, who caught sight of him at once. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Tim?&rdquo; asked the baronet, quickly; &ldquo;gone off with Don Miguel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  to the Palacio Nacional.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you were going?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  lost sight of them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  excuse, Peter,&rdquo; interposed Jack, with a twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;You remained  behind to look at the Se&ntilde;oritas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  indignantly repudiated the idea. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  heart is true to his Poll,&rdquo; said Philip, soothingly; &ldquo;thereby meaning Do&ntilde;a  Serafina. Darling!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  mimicked the old lady&rsquo;s pronunciation of the word, and Jack laughed; not so  Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  you do go on about Do&ntilde;a Serafina?&rdquo; he said fretfully. &ldquo;After all, she is not so  very ugly, though she may not have the thirty points of perfection.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Peter, I didn&rsquo;t know you were learned in such gallantries; and what are the  thirty points of perfection?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  doctor was about to reply, when Cocom, wrapped in his zarape, passed slowly by,  and took off his sombrero to the party. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dios, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Cocom, gravely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  Indian friend,&rdquo; remarked Jack, with a smile. &ldquo;Ven aca Cocom! Have you come to  hear the assurance of peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  will be no peace, Se&ntilde;or Juan. I am old&mdash;very old, and I can see into the future.  It is war I see&mdash;the war of Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Is that your own prophecy or that of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of the Chalchuih Tlatonac, Don Juan,&rdquo; replied Cocom, who always  assumed the role of a devout Catholic; &ldquo;but I hear many things. Ah, yes, I hear  that the Chalchuih Tlatonac is glowing as a red star.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that means war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means war, Se&ntilde;or, and war there will be. The Chalchuih Tlatonac never deceives.  Con dios va usted Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jack, thoughtfully, as Cocom walked slowly away; &ldquo;so that is the temper of  the people, is it? The opal says war. In that case it is no use Gomez saying  peace, for they will not believe him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>During  this conversation with the Indian, Philip had gone on with Peter, so as to keep  the ladies in sight. Jack pushed his way through the crowd and found them  seated near the bandstand, from whence the President was to deliver his speech.  As yet, His Excellency had not arrived, and the band were playing music of a  lively description, principally national airs, as Gomez wished to arouse the  patriotism of the Tlatonacians. </p>
  <p>The  throng of people round the bandstand was increasing every moment. It was  composed of all sorts and conditions of men and women, from delicate se&ntilde;oritas,  draped in lace mantillas, to brown-faced Indian women, with fat babies on their  backs; gay young hidalgos, in silver-buttoned buckskin breeches, white ruffled  shirts, and short jackets, and smart military men in the picturesque green  uniform of the Republic. All the men had cigarettes, all the women fans, and  there was an incessant chatter of voices as both sexes engaged in animated  conversation on the burning subject of the hour. Here and there moved the  neveros with their stock of ice-creams, grateful to thirsty people on that  sultry night, the serenos keeping order among the Indians with their short  staves, and many water-carriers with their leather clothes and crocks. Above  the murmur of conversation arose the cries of these perambulating traders. &ldquo;Tortillas  de cuajuda,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bocadillo de Coco,&rdquo; and all the thousand and one calls announcing  the quality of their goods. </p>
  <p>Many  of the ladies were driving in carriages, and beside them rode caballeros,  mounted on spirited horses, exchanging glances with those whom they loved. The  air of the alameda was full of intrigue and subtle understandings. The wave of  a fan, the glance of a dark eye, the dropping of a handkerchief, the removal of  a sombrero, all the mute signs which pass between lovers who dare not speak,  and everywhere the jealous watching of husbands, the keen eyes of vigilant  duennas. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very like the Puerta del Sol in Madrid,&rdquo; said Philip in a low whisper, as he  stood beside Eulalia; &ldquo;the same crowd, the same brilliance, the same hot night  and tropic sky. Upon my word, there is but little difference between the Old  Spain and the New.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed Eulalia, adjusting her mantilla; &ldquo;how delightful it must be in Madrid!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  more delightful than here, Se&ntilde;orita. At least, I think so&mdash;now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  cast an anxious glance at her duenna, and made a covert sign behind her fan for  him to be silent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  to my aunt, Don Felipe!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather speak to you,&rdquo; hinted Philip, with a grimace. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  young ladies speak to whom they please in your country?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should rather think so. In my country the ladies are quite as independent as  the gentlemen, if not more so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  oh! El viento que corre es algo fresquito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wind which blows is a little fresh,&rdquo; translated Philip to himself; &ldquo;I suppose  that is the Spanish for &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rsquo; But it is true, Se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; he  added quickly, in her own tongue; &ldquo;you will see it for yourself some day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear not. There is no chance of my leaving Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows?&rdquo; replied Philip, with a meaning glance. </p>
  <p>Eulalia  cast down her eyes in pretty confusion. Decidedly this Americano was  delightful, and remarkably handsome; but then he said such dreadful things. If  Do&ntilde;a Serafina heard them&mdash;Eulalia turned cold at the idea of what that vigorous  lady would say. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  chattered the duenna at this moment; &ldquo;they are playing the &lsquo;Fandango of the  Opal!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was a local piece of music much in favour with the Tlatonacians, and was  supposed to represent the Indian sacred dance before the shrine of the gem. As  the first note struck their ears, the crowd applauded loudly; for it was, so to  speak, the National Anthem of Cholacaca. Before the band-stand was a clear  space of ground, and, inspired by the music, two Mestizos, man and woman,  sprang into the open, and began to dance the fandango. The onlookers were  delighted, and applauded vehemently. </p>
  <p>They  were both handsome young people, dressed in the national costume, the girl  looking especially picturesque with her amber-coloured short skirt, her  gracefully draped mantilla, and enormous black fan. The young fellow had  castanets, which clicked sharply to the rhythm of the music, as they whirled  round one another like Bacchantes. The adoration of the opal, the reading of  the omen, the foretelling of successful love, all were represented marvellously  in wonderful pantomime. Then the dancers flung themselves wildly about, with  waving arms and mad gestures, wrought up to a frenzy by the inspiriting music.  Indeed, the audience caught the contagion, and began to sing the words of the  opal song&mdash; </p>
  <p class="poem">Breathe  not a word while the future divining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True speaks the stone as the star seers above,<br>
  Green as the ocean the opal is shining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green is prophetic of hope and of love.</p>
  <p class="poem">Kneel  at the shrine while the future discerning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how the crimson ray strengthens and glows;<br>
  Red as the sunset the opal is burning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red is prophetic of death to our foes.</p>
  <p>At  this moment, the carriage of the President, escorted by a troop of cavalry,  arrived at the band-stand. The soldiers, in light green uniforms, with high  buff boots, scarlet waistbands, and brown sombreros, looked particularly  picturesque, but the short figure of the President, arrayed in plain evening  dress, appeared rather out of place amid all this military finery. The only  token of his Excellency&rsquo;s rank was a broad yellow silk ribbon, embroidered with  the opal, which he wore across his breast. Miguel Maraquando and Tim were in  the carriage with the President, and the Irishman recognised his friends with a  wave of his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  is in high society,&rdquo; said Peter, with a grin. &ldquo;We will have to call him Don Tim  after this.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  call you &lsquo;Donkey&rsquo; after this, if you make such idiotic remarks,&rdquo; replied Jack,  severely. &ldquo;Be quiet, doctor, and listen to the speechifying.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  President was received with acclamation by those in the alameda, which showed  that Tlatonac was well disposed towards the established Government. It is true  that one or two friends of Xuarez attempted to get up a counter demonstration;  but the moment they began hissing and shouting for Don Hypolito, the serenos  pounced down and marched them off in disgrace. His Excellency, attended by Don  Miguel and several other members of the Junta, came forward, hat in hand, to  the front of the band-stand, and, after the musicians had stopped playing the &ldquo;Fandango,&rdquo;  began to speak. Gomez was a fat little man, of no very striking looks; but when  he commenced speaking, his face glowed with enthusiasm, and his rich, powerful  voice reached everyone clearly. The man was a born orator, and, as the noble  tongue of Castille rolled sonorously from his mouth, he held his mixed audience  spell-bound. The listeners did not believe in his assurances, but they were  fascinated by his oratory. </p>
  <p>It  was a sight not easily forgotten. The warm twilight, the brilliant equatorial  vegetation, the equally brilliant and picturesque crowd, swaying restlessly to  and fro; far beyond, through a gap in the trees, in the violet atmosphere, the  snow-clad summit of Xicotencatl, the largest of Cholacacan volcanoes, and  everywhere the vague languor of the tropics. Gomez, a black figure against the  glittering background of uniforms, spoke long and eloquently. He assured them  that there would be no war. Don Hypolito Xuarez had no supporters; the Junta  was about to banish him from the country; the prosperity of Cholacaca was fully  assured; it was to be a great nation; he said many other pleasant things, which  flattered, but deceived not the Tlatonacians. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; thundered the President, smiting his breast, &ldquo;I, who stand here&mdash;even,  I, Francisco Gomez, the representative of the Republic of Cholacaca&mdash;tell you  that our land still rests, and shall rest under the olive tree of Peace. We  banish Don Hypolito Xuarez&mdash;we banish all traitors who would crush the sovereign  people. The rulers of Cholacaca, elected by the nation, are strong and wise.  They have foreseen this tempest, and by them it will be averted. Believe not,  my fellow-countrymen, the lying rumours of the streets! I tell you the future  is fair. There will be no war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment he paused to wipe his brow, and then, as if to give the lie to his  assertion, in the dead silence which followed, was heard the distant boom of a  cannon. Astonished at the unfamiliar sound, the Tlatonacians looked at one  another in horror. Gomez paused, handkerchief in hand, with a look of wonderment  on his face. No one spoke, no one moved, it was as though the whole of that  assemblage had been stricken into stone by some powerful spell. </p>
  <p>In  the distance sounded a second boom, dull and menacing, there was a faint roar  far away as of many voices. It came nearer and nearer, and those in the alameda  began to add their voices to the din. Was the city being shelled by the  revolting war-ships; had Don Hypolito surprised the inland walls with an army  of Indians. Terror was on the faces of all&mdash;the clamour in the distance came  nearer, waxed louder. A cloud of dust at the bend of the avenue, and down the  central walk, spurring his horse to its full speed, dashed a dishevelled rider.  The horse stopped dead in front of the band-stand, scattering the people hither  and thither like wind-driven chaff; a young man in naval uniform flung himself  to the ground, and ran up to the astonished President. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  Excellency, the fleet have revolted to Don Hypolito Xuarez! He is entrenched in  the rebel town of Acauhtzin. I alone have escaped, and bring you news that he  has proclaimed war against the Republic!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  roar of rage went up to the sky. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! The prophecy of the Chalchuih Tlatonac!&rdquo; cried the multitude. &ldquo;Viva el  Republica! Death to the traitor Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Gomez  was listening to the messenger, who talked volubly. Then the President turned  towards the people, and, by a gesture of his hand, enjoined silence. The roar  at once sank to a low murmur. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  Don Rafael Maraquando says is true,&rdquo; said Gomez, loudly. &ldquo;This traitor, Xuarez,  has seduced the allegiance of the fleet&mdash;of Acauhtzin. The Republic must prepare  for war&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  could speak no further, for his voice was drowned in the savage roaring of the  multitude. Everyone seemed to have gone mad. The crowd of people heaved round  the band-stand like a stormy sea. A thousand voices cursed the traitor Xuarez,  lauded the Republic, and repeated the prophecy of the harlequin opal. The whole  throng was demoralised by the news. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!  War! To Acauhtzin!&rdquo; roared the throats of the mob. &ldquo;Death to Xuarez! Viva el  Republica! Viva libertad!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Gomez  made a sign to the band, which at once burst out into the Fandango of the Opal.  A thousand voices began singing the words, a thousand people began to dance  wildly. Ladies waved their handkerchiefs, men shouted and embraced one another,  and amid the roar of the mob and the blare of the band, Don Francisco Gomez  entered his carriage and drove away escorted by the cavalry. </p>
  <p>Tim  fought his way through the crowd down from the band-stand, and reached the  Maraquando part, where he found the three ladies, more excited than frightened,  standing for safety in the circle formed by the five men. Two of the men were  embracing&mdash;Don Miguel and his son. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a great day for Cholacaca,&rdquo; cried Tim, excitedly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it  for a fortune. Viva el Republica! Ah, Peter, my boy, this is better than the  butterflies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son! my son, how did you escape?&rdquo; said Don Miguel, throwing his arms round  Rafael&rsquo;s neck. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you all at the house, my father,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;Let us go  now with the ladies to our home. Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he added, turning to the Englishmen,  &ldquo;you will come, too, I trust?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was no easy matter to get through the crowd, but ultimately the five men  managed to push a path to a caleza for the ladies, placed them therein, and  when it drove off, hastened themselves to the Casa Maraquando. </p>
  <p>The  whole city was in commotion. In the Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres a crowd had  collected to salute the great yellow standard of the Republic, which streamed  from the tower of the Palacio Nacional. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! the opal! The prophecy of the Tlatonac Chalchuih,&rdquo; roared the crowd,  stamping and yelling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will believe in that stone more than ever now,&rdquo; whispered Philip to Jack, as  they entered the zaguan of Maraquando&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;What do you think of it, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s easy to prophesy when you know,&rdquo; retorted Jack, scornfully. &ldquo;Of course,  Xuarez told the Indians he was going to revolt, and the priests of the temple  have used the information to advertise the stone. Of course it grew red, and  prophesied war under the circumstances. That is all the magic about the affair.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  the patio the ladies were waiting for them in a state of great excitement, and  welcomed Don Rafael as one returned from the dead. He embraced his sister,  cousin, and aunt; which privilege was rather envied by the four friends, as  regards the first two, and was then formally introduced to the Englishmen. His  eye flashed as he saluted Tim and heard his vocation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have plenty to write about, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal,&rdquo; he said, fiercely; &ldquo;there  will be a war, and a bitter war too. I have barely escaped with my life from  Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all about it, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Tim, taking out his pocket-book; &ldquo;and the news  will go off to London to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand regrets, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal, that I cannot give you a detailed account  at present, but I am worn out. I have not slept for days!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pobrecito,&rdquo;  cried the ladies, in a commiserating tone. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will, at all events, tell you shortly,&rdquo; resumed Rafael, without taking any  notice of the interruption. &ldquo;I commanded <i>The Pizarro</i>, and went up to  Acauhtzin to arrest Xuarez, according to the order of the Government. As he  refused to surrender, and as the town had declared in his favour, I thought we  would have to bombard it. But think, Se&ntilde;ores, think. When I came back to my  ship, I was arrested by my own crew, by my own officers. Seduced by the oily  tongue of Xuarez, they had revolted. In vain I implored! I entreated! I  threatened! I commanded! They refused to obey any other than the traitor  Xuarez. The other ships behaved in the same way. All the officers who, like  myself, were known to be true to the Government, were arrested and thrown into  prison, I among the number.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay  de mi,&rdquo; cried Serafina, in tears, &ldquo;what an indignity!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Rafael was choking with rage, and forgot his manners. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!&rdquo;  he swore roundly, &ldquo;behold me, gentlemen. Look at my uniform! Thus was it  insulted by the rebels of Acauhtzin, whose houses, I hope, with the blessing of  God, to burn over their heads. I swear it!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  wrenched a crucifix from his breast, and kissed it passionately. It was a  striking scene: the dim light, the worn-out young fellow in the ragged uniform,  and his figure black against the lights in the patio, passionately kissing the  symbol of his faith. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you escape, my son,&rdquo; said Maraquando, whose eyes were flashing with hatred  and wrath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a man&mdash;one of my sailors, to whom I had shown favour&mdash;he was made one of the  prison guards, and, out of kindness, assisted me to escape; but he was too  fearful to help any of the others. In the darkness of night, I cut through my  prison bars with a file he had given me. I climbed down the wall by a rope,  and, when on the ground, found him, waiting me. He hurried me down to the water&rsquo;s  edge, and placed me in a boat with food for a few days. I rowed out in the  darkness, past the ships, and luckily managed to escape their vigilance. Then I  hoisted the sail, and, as there was a fair wind, by dawn I was far down the  coast. I need not tell you all my adventures, how I suffered, how I starved,  how I thirsted&mdash;cursed, cursed, Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  stamped with rage up and down the patio while the ladies exclaimed indignantly  at the treatment to which he had been subjected. Then he resumed his story  hurriedly, evidently wishing to get it over&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  morning, I fortunately fell in with the steamer sent up by the Government,  which picked me up. I told the captain all, and he returned at once with the  news, arriving at Tlatonac some time ago. I ordered him to fire those guns  announcing my arrival, and hearing his Excellency was addressing a meeting at  the alameda, jumped on a horse and rode here. The rest you know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;  said Tim, who had been busily taking notes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to the telegraph-office,  Se&ntilde;ores. Good night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim  went off, and the others were not long in following his example. Overcome by  fatigue, Don Rafael had fallen, half-fainting, in a chair, and the ladies were  attending to him; so, seeing they were rather in the way, Jack and his friends,  saying good night, left the house. </p>
  <p>The  city was still heaving with excitement. Bands of men went past dancing and  singing. The bells clashed loudly from every tower, and every now and then a  rocket scattered crimson fire in the sky. War was proclaimed! the whole of  Tlatonac was in a state of frenzy, and there would be no sleep for anyone that  night. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  in for it now,&rdquo; said Jack, jubilantly, &ldquo;hear the war-song!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  band of young men with torches tramped steadily towards the Square, singing the  National Anthem of Tlatonac. Philip caught the last two lines roared  triumphantly as they disappeared in the distance: </p>
  <p>Red  as the sunset the opal is burning,<br>
    Red is prophetic of death to our foes. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX<br>
    The Call To Arms</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Ta ra ra! Ta ra ra!<b><br>
  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trumpets  are blowing,<br>
  And thrice hath their brazen notes pealed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle! to battle the soldiers are going,<br>
  To conquer or die on the field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On, soldiers! brave soldiers, who venture your lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fight for your country and sweethearts and wives.</p>
  <p class="poem">Ta  ra ra! Ta ra ra!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drums roll like thunder,<br>
And women&rsquo;s tears falling like rain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lovers! for lovers are parted asunder,<br>
  Till victory crowns the campaign.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On, soldiers! brave soldiers go forth to the fray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close with the foe in their battle array.</p>
  <p class="poem">Ta  ra ra! Ta ra ra!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banners are flying,<br>
  And horses prance proudly along,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For women! for women are bitterly crying,<br>
  As passes the red-coated throng.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On, soldiers! brave soldiers! soon homeward you&rsquo;ll  ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encircled with bay leaves and greeted with pride.</p>
  <p>At  this eventful moment of its history, Cholacaca woke from its slumber of years,  as did the Sleeping Beauty from her century sleep. No more the lethargic life,  the indolent enjoyments, the languorous dreamings in an enchanted city. A sharp  breath of war from the north swept away the sedative atmosphere; the thunder of  the cannon roused Tlatonac to unexampled excitement. Rebellion and preparation  for invasion at Acauhtzin, indignation and preparation for defence, for  punishment in the capital of the Republic. In these days of alarm and danger,  the city resembled one vast camp, and the descendants of the Conquistadores,  the posterity of the Mayas, proved themselves to be not unworthy of their  glorious traditions, both Spanish and Indian. It was a turning-point in the  history of the Republic. </p>
  <p>The  two persons most desirous for the speedy commencement of this fratricidal war  were Tim and Don Rafael: the former as he wished information for his journal,  the latter because he was burning to revenge the insults and indignities to  which he had been subjected by the rebels at Acauhtzin. Jack was rather  dismayed at the near prospect of hostilities, fearing lest harm should result  therefrom to Dolores at the hands of Don Hypolito, or those of the Forest  Indians. For their part, Philip and Peter assumed a neutral position, the one  from indolence, the other because he was entomologically engaged. What was the  hunting of men compared with the hunting of butterflies, the capture of rebels  with the capture of rare beetles? No, Peter preferred science to war. </p>
  <p>The  loss of the fleet was a great blow to the strength of the Government, as it,  comparatively speaking, placed the capital at the mercy of the rebel, Xuarez.  Communication between the two places was only possible by water, owing to the  roughness and savagery of the interior, so the Government were unable to march  their troops to Acauhtzin, and nip the rebellion in the bud. On the other hand,  as soon as Xuarez had completed his plans, he would doubtless come south with  his ships and bombard Tlatonac from the sea. Most of the city being built on  the hill, topped by the vast fabric of the cathedral, offered considerable  advantages to the besiegers, and as their vessels would keep well out of the  range of the forts, it would be difficult to silence their guns. </p>
  <p>From  this point of view the outlook was certainly not encouraging, but the Junta did  its best by every possible means to guard against possible contingencies. The  army was drawn up in the Plaza de San Jago, and reviewed by the President in  person. He made a brilliant speech, reminded the troops of their glorious  predecessors, who had thrown off the yoke of Spain, implored them not to  disgrace the Flag of the Opal, and promised them a speedy victory over these  audacious rebels if they would but be true to their leaders. The troops  received this patriotic oration with acclamation, cheered the brave little man  at the conclusion of his address, uncovered to salute the flag of Cholacaca,  and swore, one and all, to leave no rebel alive in Acauhtzin or elsewhere. It  was a scene of tremendous excitement, and patriotism was at fever-heat in  Tlatonac the whole of the day. </p>
  <p>The  great banner of the Republic, only seen on special feast-days, was on this  occasion brought forth from the Treasury by order of Gomez and displayed to the  troops. It was truly a gorgeous flag. Composed of yellow silk, covered with  featherwork, after the manner of the Aztecs, it glittered in the sunlight like  a vast jewel. The sacred stone in the centre was represented by a cluster of  real opals from Queretaro, and the red, green, blue, and yellow rays therefrom  were composed of ruby, emerald, turquoise and topaz stones. It was the sacred ensign  of Cholacaca, the palladium of the Republic, and in the estimation of the  inhabitants was held to be as sacred as the holy standard of the Osmanli. When  its splendours streamed in the warm air, with flash of feather and glitter of  jewel, a shout arose from soldiers and civilians alike which might have been  heard at Acauhtzin. With that flag waving over them the Tlatonacians could not  think of anything but victory. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like the standard of Harold at the Battle of Hastings,&rdquo; said Philip, looking  at the splendid flag. &ldquo;It is to be hoped it will not bring Gomez such bad luck.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it, my boy,&rdquo; replied Tim, who was busy with his inevitable note-book. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re  going to be the death and glory lads this time, anyhow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  quite identify yourself with the Government, I see, Tim,&rdquo; remarked Peter, who  was standing by the caleza of Do&ntilde;a Serafina. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  shouted Tim, playfully, &ldquo;have we a traitor here? Away with ye, Peter, or I&rsquo;ll  stick a pin in you, like one of those butterflies you&rsquo;re so fond of impaling.  Don&rsquo;t I come of a fighting family myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal angry?&rdquo; asked Dolores of Jack, in alarm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;orita; he is patriotic. His nation always make a noise when they grow  patriotic. Sing the &lsquo;Wearing of the Green,&rsquo; Tim,&rdquo; he added, in English. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  St. Patrick! &lsquo;tis the &lsquo;Opal Fandango&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have to learn, sir. Be quiet, Jack.  The troops are marching past the saluting-point.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  great standard was waving over the heads of the Presidential staff, near which  were the Maraquando party and their friends. Don Miguel himself was with His  Excellency, mounted on a fiery steed, which he managed with the consummate ease  of a practised rider. The band was playing the &ldquo;March of Zuloaga,&rdquo; in allusion  to the hero who had founded the Republic. To its stirring strains the troops  marched past, saluting Gomez and his officers as each regiment came abreast of  the flag. </p>
  <p>The  Plaza de San Jago, a vast clear space used for the parade-ground of the  Cholacacan army, was quite filled with the troops, as there could not have been  less than two thousand present. This was not the full power of the army, for  Janjalla, Chichimec, Puebla de los Naranjos, and many of the inland towns, were  garrisoned with troops. Already messages had been sent to the commandants of  these outlying garrisons to march with their full strength of men to the  capital, but as yet they had not arrived, and the two thousand soldiers present  in the great plaza represented all the men at the immediate disposal of the  Government. </p>
  <p>It  was a splendid sight to see these soldiers marching past the saluting-point,  as, with few exceptions, they were a fine body of men. The uniforms were gaudy,  and somewhat fantastical, and each regiment had its special flag and  appellation. There was the Regimiento de los Pajaros, whose banner, like that  of the Republic, was composed of humming-bird&rsquo;s feathers; the Regimiento de  Zuloaga, who marched under the pictured face of the founder of Cholacaca; the  Regimiento de Fray Medina, bearing the pennant of the Church, embroidered with  the cathedral of which that monk was the builder; and many others, all looking  ready and fit for work in the field. The eyes of the President flashed with  enthusiasm as file after file of men ranged past and the inspiriting music of  the &ldquo;Zuloaga March&rdquo; added not a little to the patriotism of his feelings. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Xuarez  is already conquered,&rdquo; he said to Maraquando, who rode beside him. &ldquo;He can  oppose no troops to ours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  the exception of the Regimiento de Huitzilopochtli, which is at present at  Acauhtzin and has doubtless embraced his cause.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  Se&ntilde;or, and he also will stir up the Indians!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not care for the Indians,&rdquo; replied Maraquando, quietly, &ldquo;they cannot stand  against troops armed as ours. If he attacks Tlatonac by land he will be beaten,  but Xuarez is too crafty to venture so rashly. He has the fleet, and will  blockade the city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  him do so,&rdquo; retorted Gomez, in a fiery tone; &ldquo;we do not depend on foreign  countries for our food. He cannot starve us out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough; but while he has the fleet he can prolong the war to an indefinite  period. Unless we can march our troops to Acauhtzin, and crush him at his  head-quarters, there is no way of bringing the rebellion to a conclusion.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we have no ships! Carambo! It is unfortunate. But no matter. The Republic is  rich; she has money! We will send for ships of war, for guns, for engineers,  and sooner or later will invest Acauhtzin. Then Xuarez will meet with the fate  he deserves.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment the crack cavalry regiment of Cholacaca passed proudly by, with  waving plumes and prancing horses. Deprived of his ship by Xuarez, Don Rafael  had asked for and obtained a commission in this corps, and was now riding at  the head of his men with his brother officers. Accustomed from childhood, like  all American Spaniards, to horses, he had no difficulty in exchanging the deck  for the saddle, and looked a gallant figure as he dashed past on his fiery  mustang. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad,  Jack, we must enlist also, like Don Rafael,&rdquo; said Philip, gaily, as they saw  the young man gallop past. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores,&rdquo; he added, turning to her, &ldquo;we are  going to become soldiers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Regimiento de las Se&ntilde;oritas!&rdquo; exclaimed Do&ntilde;a Eulalia, clapping her hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  se&ntilde;orita! A regiment of women?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  no!&rdquo; interposed Do&ntilde;a Serafina, with a fascinating smile; &ldquo;it is a corps raised  in the last war by the ladies of Tlatonac. See! here come the valiant ones.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foot  soldiers!&rdquo; said Jack, in disgust, as the regiment filed past; &ldquo;no, Do&ntilde;a  Serafina. Nothing less than a cavalry corps will suit us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  can Don Pedro ride, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that about me?&rdquo; asked Peter, overhearing his name. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Serafina wants you to enlist,&rdquo; explained Philip, maliciously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Peter, firmly; &ldquo;I will physic the soldiers, and cut off their legs and  arms; but I am a man of peace, and I will not enlist.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  little duffer!&rdquo; said Tim, reverting to his school-boy phraseology, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make  you doctor of the regiment. I&rsquo;d like to enlist myself, but the editor would  never hear of such a thing. It&rsquo;s my walking ticket I&rsquo;d be getting if I did.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Philip and myself shall enlist,&rdquo; observed Jack, brightly. &ldquo;You, Peter, shall  attend to us when we are wounded, and Tim shall cover us with glory in the  columns of <i>The Morning Planet</i>. He shall be the bard to celebrate our  deeds.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  scheme was explained to the ladies and found much favour in their sight. In  fact, the whole female population of Tlatonac was seized with a violent attack  of &ldquo;scarlet fever,&rdquo; and no one who was not a soldier found any favour in their  eyes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be as valiant as the Cid,&rdquo; said Dolores, looking tenderly at Jack from  behind her black fan. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  you to smile on me, I can scarcely be a coward,&rdquo; he replied, in a low tone so  as not to reach the vigilant ears of the duenna. &ldquo;I will ask His Excellency for  a commission in your cousin&rsquo;s regiment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you also, Don Felipe,&rdquo; said Eulalia, vivaciously. &ldquo;El Regimiento del Caballeros  is the finest in the army. You would look so well in the uniform.&rdquo; She flashed  a bewitching look at Philip, which sent that young man&rsquo;s blood spinning through  his veins. He had quite given up fighting against his fate, and was fathoms  deep in love. Do&ntilde;a Eulalia could use her eyes with great effect, and Philip had  now surrendered at discretion. It is only fair to say that the victress took no  undue advantage of her conquest. Indeed, Philip did not know yet if she  returned his love. Eulalia was a born coquette, and he was terribly afraid lest  she should be only amusing herself. This enlistment in the army might clinch  the matter, and induce her to smile on his suit. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your sake, I will play the bear,&rdquo; he whispered, alluding to a foolish custom of  the Cholacacans whereby a young man walks up and down in front of the window of  his beloved like a bear. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I do not care for you to play the bear, Se&ntilde;or. Fight in the regiment of my  brother, and when you return victorious&mdash;well, who knows?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  looked, Eulalia smiled significantly. They thoroughly understood one another,  in spite of Do&ntilde;a Serafina and the restrictions of Cholacacan courtship. Eyes  can speak as eloquently as can tongues, and are quite as intelligible&mdash;to the  initiated. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kismet!&rdquo;  muttered Philip, as he went off the parade-ground with the ladies and his  friends; &ldquo;it is, written.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is written?&rdquo; asked Peter, who was always overhearing what was not meant for his  ears. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  marriage to Do&ntilde;a Serafina,&rdquo; laughed Philip, promptly; whereat the doctor shook  his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man can&rsquo;t marry his grandmother.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  said no more; but returned to the side of Do&ntilde;a Eulalia, who had placed herself  as far away from her duenna as was possible. This precaution was scarcely  needed, as Do&ntilde;a Serafina had eyes for no one but Peter. She had not yet given  up all hope of marriage, even at the mature age of five and forty. Peter was  young and innocent; therefore Do&ntilde;a Serafina selected him as her victim, and  under the guise of teaching him Spanish, strove to entangle him in her elderly  meshes. Her eyes were still brilliant, and long experience had taught her how to  use them. It was so much waste time as regards Peter. He was so impossible. </p>
  <p>On  leaving the Plaza de San Jago, the troops marched to their several quarters in  the forts, and his Excellency the President went to inspect the defences of the  city. Tlatonac was completely girdled by strong stone walls, and defended by  heavy metal cannon, so that in the event of a sortie, particularly by a horde  of naked Indians such as Xuarez&rsquo;s force would be, there was but little doubt  that the invaders could be easily repulsed with great slaughter. As regards a  land attack from the interior, this was well enough, but if Xuarez bombarded  the town there was no doubt that he could speedily reduce Tlatonac to a heap of  ruins. Gomez trusted to the impassable forests between the capital and  Acauhtzin to protect him from an inland invasion, and as the sea-forts were  defended by heavy guns, hoped to cripple the ships of the enemy before they  could do much harm. </p>
  <p>The  forts defending the coast were therefore the most important in his eyes, and,  after examining the interior defences, he rode down to the sea front to inspect  the preparations for keeping the ships of Xuarez beyond bombarding distance of  the town. Thanks to English engineers, and a lavish outlay of money, the forts  were superb pieces of workmanship; and their lofty walls frowning over the bay,  with the muzzles of guns protruding from their embrasures, promised a difficult  task to the invaders. </p>
  <p>Between  the two principal forts was the gate of the town, which opened into a low stretch  of land covered with fishing-huts, through which a road ran down to the wharf. <i>The  Bohemian</i> was lying close under the guns of the city, so that in the event  of their being discharged, she would sustain no damage; and as His Excellency  rode out of the city gate, his eyes rested admiringly on the beautiful little  craft. </p>
  <p>Only  momentarily, however, for at that instant a cry burst from the lips of his  aide-de-camp; and Gomez looked seaward. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>The  Pizarro!</i>&rdquo; he cried in surprise. </p>
  <p>It  was indeed the old ship of Don Rafael, which was steaming slowly southward, a  white flag fluttering at her mainmast head. Rafael uttered an ejaculation of  rage, and Gomez turned his horse to ride back into the city, not knowing with  what intentions the war-ship had come. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Tim, catching the President&rsquo;s horse by the bridle; &ldquo;the  vessel has a white flag, so she has come with a message from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  Dios, we do not treat with rebels, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not be rash, Excelencia. It is as well to know all these dogs have to say. See!  they are lowering a boat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was indeed the case. A quarter of a mile from the shore, <i>The Pizarro</i> cast anchor, fired three guns with blank cartridge, and then the boat already  lowered was seen pulling straight for the wharf. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal,&rdquo; said Gormez, sorely against his will; &ldquo;let it be as you  say. We will wait here for their leader. But I am sorely tempted to order the  forts to open fire on that boat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mistake, Excelencia,&rdquo; interposed Maraquando at this moment; &ldquo;we are civilised  people, and must observe the rules of war. Besides,&rdquo; he added significantly,  letting his eyes rest on Tim, &ldquo;have we not here the Correspo&ntilde;sal? and all we do  he will write off to England.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said the President again; &ldquo;we will wait.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  thunder of the cannon had brought a tremendous crowd to the walls, and down on  to the beach. From the Presidential staff up to the gate, was one black mass of  people, heaving with excitement. All kinds of rumours were flying from lip to  lip. <i>The Pizarro</i> had come to bombard the town, and her consorts were now  on their way for the same purpose. The vessel had returned to its allegiance,  and had brought Xuarez to Tlatonac for punishment. All were disturbed,  startled, puzzled, and watched with lynx eyes the little boat with the white  flag at its stern now drawing steadily near to the wharf. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up now, Tim?&rdquo; asked Philip, pushing his way through the crowd. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  message from Don Hypolito, no less,&rdquo; replied Fletcher, without turning round. &ldquo;See!  he is standing up in the boat. Be Jove! it&rsquo;s a priest.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be Padre Ignatius,&rdquo; cried Jack, who had a remarkably keen sight. &ldquo;He went  up to Acauhtzin, on some Church business, a week or so ago. Shovel-hat, white  hair! Carambo! It <i>is</i> Padre Ignatius!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  name of the priest speedily became known, and the crowd cheered, for the Padre  was well known in Tlatonac. Gomez swore. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrajo!  He sends the Padre to make terms!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terms  with those dogs!&rdquo; cried Don Rafael, stamping his foot. &ldquo;Excelencia, I would  hang them all.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Como,  no!&rdquo; muttered the President, his fingers closing viciously on the bridle-rein; &ldquo;but  we will hear what the Padre has to say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time the boat had reached the wharf, and Padre Ignatius, nimble as a young  man, sprang up the wooden steps leading from the water. The moment he was out  of the boat it turned seaward again, and before the onlookers could recover  from their surprise, the oars were flashing in and out of the waves as it sped  back to the war-ship. A roar of rage burst from the lips of all. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  Dios!&rdquo; swore Maraquando, livid with wrath, &ldquo;they have only landed the Padre,  and now take themselves out of danger. Order the forts to open fire,  Excelencia!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Gomez  had only to throw up his hand and the cannon would vomit fire. Knowing this,  Jack stepped up impulsively to the President. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  not hasty, Se&ntilde;or, I beg of you. See, the Padre carries a white flag! He brings  a message from Xuarez! First hear what it is, and then decide.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  Excellency moved uneasily in his saddle, and bit his nether lip. He would  dearly have liked to have pounded the rebel war-ship into matchwood for her  insolent daring in thus defying the Government of Cholacaca, but he could not  but see that such an extreme measure would be impolitic. Therefore he  restrained his rage, and waited the approach of the Padre, who was now near at  hand. Gomez, a true son of the Church, uncovered as the priest paused before  him. The Padre raised his hand in token of benediction, and the staff also  uncovered. With the atheistical opinions now prevalent in Cholacaca they would  not have done this for any priest save Padre Ignatius, who was much beloved by  rich and poor. As for Tim, he had his note-book out, and a greedy little  pencil, ready to take down every word of the forthcoming conversation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vaya  usted con Dios Excelencia!&rdquo; said the Padre, gravely. &ldquo;I come from  Acauhtzin&mdash;from Don Hypolito Xuarez, with a message to the Junta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  message to the Junta from rebels, Reverend Father?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my duty to prevent this fratricidal war, if possible,&rdquo; replied Ignatius,  mildly. &ldquo;I have spoken with Xuarez, and have persuaded him to send me hither  with a message of peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that message?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  be spoken here, my son. Let us go to the Palacio Nacional!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all means, my father. Will you not ride thither. One of my officers will give  you his horse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Three  or four of the officers at once dismounted, and begged Padre Ignatius to mount;  but he refused their offers gently with a wave of his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my children. I will walk thither. Ride on, Excelencia I will be with you soon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But <i>The Pizarro</i>, Padre!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  lie off there till my message is delivered and the answer given. If the terms  are accepted, one gun will be the sign; if refused, two guns, and the war-ship  will return to the north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Gomez, with a meaning smile, as he turned his horse&rsquo;s head towards the  gate, &ldquo;they are afraid to trust themselves in the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X<br>

  <p class="poem">With  cross in hand, the pious father goes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From camp to camp on Heaven&rsquo;s errand bent;<br>
  Soothing the wretched, overborne with woes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the weary bringing sweet content. </p>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  gentle soul, too kind for this rude earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What virtues doth thy being comprehend;<br>

  <p>Tim  was ubiquitous. He seemed neither to eat nor sleep, but, note-book in hand,  followed the President about everywhere, with the idea of gathering material  for his letters to <i>The Morning Planet</i>. From the Plaza de San Jago he had  gone down to the sea gate of Tlatonac, where the meeting with Padre Ignatius  took place, and from thence returned to the Palacio Nacional, at the heels of  Gomez. In view of the message from Xuarez, the Junta had been hastily convened,  and now the great hall of the palace was crowded with deputies waiting to hear  the words of the Padre. </p>
  <p>Owing  to the influence of Don Miguel, which was supreme in Tlatonac, Jack and Philip  were admitted to the meeting, and they, in company with Tim, who was present by  virtue of his office, watched the scene with great interest. It is not every  day that one has the chance of seeing the naked machinery of the Government. In  this vast chamber was the motive force which kept the machine going. Now, the  Governmental machine was out of order, and Padre Ignatius, as a moral engineer,  was trying to put it right again. He advocated delicate handling of the suasive  kind. Gomez, rough work, in the manner of blows, and brute strength. As to  Xuarez&mdash;well, he was the wheel which had put the engine out of gear; and, until  that wheel was forced back into its proper position, or taken out of the Cholacacan  machine altogether, there was but little chance of the reversion to the old  smooth running. This is a parable to illustrate the importance of that hastily  convened meeting. Tim was the only one of the four friends who understood the  matter thoroughly. </p>
  <p>Don  Francisco Gomez took his place in the Presidential chair, which stood beneath a  gorgeous yellow satin canopy of anything but Republican simplicity. The opal  arms of Cholacaca were above this drapery, the seat of power below; and therein  sat President Gomez, with a fierce light in his eyes, and an ominous tightening  of his lips. He was in a critical position, and he knew it. The ship of the  Republic was among the breakers, and he, as helmsman, had to steer her into  open sea again. With a disorderly crew, this was no easy task. </p>
  <p>The  members of the Junta took their seats in silence. They were like a class of  schoolboys before their master, and, as Gomez cast his eyes over their ranks,  he could pick out here and there the men whom he knew would be troublesome. To  understand his difficulty, it is necessary to explain the exact position of  politics in Cholacaca. Tim was doing this in a low, rapid voice to Philip,  pending the appearance of Padre Ignatius. Jack listened to the explanation with  interest, and every now and then threw in a word of enlightenment. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  in England,&rdquo; said Tim, speaking in Philip&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;there are two political  parties, broadly speaking. The Liberals and Conservatives. These, again, are  sub-divided into smaller parties. On the Conservative side, there is the party  now in power, the aristocratic party, who believe in electing one of their own  order as President, and think the common people should have nothing to do with  politics.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the party of Don Miguel and the President?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  their political programme is to govern on oligarchical principles. Cholacaca  and its loaves and fishes, for the aristocrats only. That is one party. The  other is the clericales, who would govern through the Church, and place the  supreme power of the Republic in the hands of priests. Since the expulsion of  the Jesuits, however, this party is defunct, and a good thing, too. I&rsquo;m a true  son of the Church,&rdquo; added Tim, relapsing into his brogue; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe  in the priests meddling with politics.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there is a third party,&rdquo; said, Jack, taking up the explanation; &ldquo;what we may  term the Liberal-Conservative party, if such a thing be possible. They believe  in aristocratic government, with the consent of the people. That is, the people  can elect as President one of the aristocrats, but not one of themselves.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about the Liberals?&rdquo; asked Philip, deeply interested. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  one party of the Liberals want democracy&mdash;pure unadulterated Republicanism. A  second party desire military rule, which would be nothing more or less than  despotism, supported by a standing army under the thumbs of a few martinets in  power. Then there is a Free Lance party, where each individual desires the  loaves and fishes for himself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the party of Don Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  not here,&rdquo; said Tim, waving his hand towards some empty seats; &ldquo;they have all  gone to Acauhtzin, and are now regarded as rebels by the Government. They  desire a kind of civil despotism as opposed to the military party&mdash;a dictator  with supreme power, who can act as he damn well please.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven  political parties!&rdquo; observed Cassim, derisively. &ldquo;If too many cooks spoil the  broth, too many political parties will certainly spoil Cholacaca. But they all  seem to be afraid of one another. Don Xuarez has at least the courage of his  opinions.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is because his party is now strong enough to show fight. The others are all  split up into small bodies, who quarrel among themselves and disagree with the  President.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  presume they will all oppose Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally.  They are dogs in the manger; they can&rsquo;t get the supreme power of Cholacaca  themselves, and won&rsquo;t let Xuarez have it. I wonder what proposition the Padre  brings from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  here he is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Padre  Ignatius, in his rusty black cassock, advanced, holding his shovel-hat clasped  to his breast. Pausing in front of the President, where he could command the  attention of all, he cast up his eyes to heaven, as if seeking for strength to  sustain him in his difficult task of reconciling the factions which threatened  to involve Cholacaca in civil war. With his pale, refined face, his silver  locks, and tall, slender figure, he looked a remarkably striking personage, and  put Philip in mind of a picture he had once seen of Las Casas, the great Indian  missionary. </p>
  <p>When  he paused and thus sought inspiration in silent prayer, Gomez struck a silver  bell on the desk before him. Instantly there was a dead silence, the murmur of  voices was stilled, and every eye was turned towards the gentle priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  children,&rdquo; said Padre Ignatius, in a weak voice, which gathered strength as he  proceeded, &ldquo;some weeks ago I went to Acauhtzin on the business of our Holy  Church. There I found Don Hypolito Xuarez, who was not then in arms against the  Junta. I knew, however, that he was a restless spirit, and, observing signs of  dissatisfaction in the town, dreaded lest he should fan these embers of  discontent into the flame of civil war. To Don Hypolito did I speak, but he  disclaimed any intention of doing aught to break the peace of the Republic. In  this, my children, he spoke falsely.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  sullen murmur ran through the chamber. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Noting  these signs of discontent, I did not return to Tlatonac, but waited to see if  aught should occur. Nothing took place till the arrival of the fleet to arrest  Xuarez. Ah, my children, that was a fatal mistake. It roused him from  discontented quietness into a state of open rebellion. He convened a meeting in  the market-place of Acauhtzin, he told the populace he was to be arrested as a  traitor, and called on them to stand by him in his peril. What promises he made  use of I can hardly tell you, they were many and false; but those of the town  believed him, and swore to assist his cause. The officers and crews of the  fleet had already been tampered with by Xuarez before he left Tlatonac, and to  a man they all went over on his side on hearing that Acauhtzin had done so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  all! Not all, my father,&rdquo; cried Don Rafael, springing up from where he sat by  Maraquando; &ldquo;there are many who still remain faithful to the Junta&mdash;I among the  number. We were cast into prison, and, by a miracle, I escaped, to bring the  news to Tlatonac. I am free; but my friends&mdash;my faithful friends&mdash;are in the  prison of Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Padre  Ignatius looked sadly at the young man. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were faithful when you escaped,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;They were in prison my son;  but now they are free, and have joined the rebels!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrajo!&rdquo;  swore Don Rafael, stamping with rage. &ldquo;The traitors! the dogs! Canalla! I spit  on them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  call the Se&ntilde;or to order!&rdquo; cried Gomez, for the sake of formality, though his  sympathies were with those of the young man. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask the pardon of His Excellency, and that of this Honourable Assembly,&rdquo;  replied Rafael, sitting down; &ldquo;but my friends to be traitors! Por Dios! if I  meet with them, I will show no mercy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reverend  Father,&rdquo; said the President, when the young man had resumed his seat, &ldquo;all that  you have said is the way in which Xuarez has revolted. Tell us of his message!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Don Hypolito, when I heard these things,&rdquo; said the Padre, slowly. &ldquo;I  went to him, Se&ntilde;ores, and prayed him not to plunge the country into civil war.  At first he refused to listen to me, saying he was strong enough to crush the  Republic to the dust!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!  Carrajo! Canalla!&rdquo; cried a hundred voices, and many of the members sprang to  their feet to speak. A Babel of voices ensued; but at length, by repeated  ringing of his bell, the President secured silence for a few minutes, and Padre  Ignatius went on with his speech. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito said he had the aid of Acauhtzin; of the Regimiento de  Huitzilopochtli, of the fleet, and, if needs be, could secure the help of the  forest Indians!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! The Chalchuih Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  cried the priest, emphatically; &ldquo;by making use of that unholy stone! Xuarez is  no true son of the Church, my children. He is a heretic, an idolater! He told  me plainly that he worshipped and believed in the opal of Huitzilopochtli, and  would make use of the superstition it engendered among the Indians, to further  his own ends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Another  roar of wrath arose from the assemblage which the President was quite unable to  quiet. Padre Ignatius lifted his thin hand in token of entreaty, and the tumult  ceased. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  need not say what he said to me, what I said to him; but I forced him to make an  offer to the Junta, which, if accepted, will suspend all hostility. I implore  you, Se&ntilde;ores, to accept this offer, and avert this fratricidal war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  offer! the message!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you know, Se&ntilde;ores, the Presidency is held for four years, and that he who has  been our ruler cannot be re-elected! His Excellency, Don Francisco Gomez, has  now held this honourable office for three years and a half. In six months it  becomes vacant, and Don Hypolito Xuarez offers, if you make him President of  Cholacaca, to return to his allegiance.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  cried Maraquando, springing to his feet, amid a deafening cheering. &ldquo;What!  elect Xuarez for our President&mdash;place the supreme power in his hands? Give to  ourselves a Dictator who will rob us of our liberties! Never! Never! Never!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Francia! No Iturbide! No, Santa Anna!&rdquo; yelled the excited members. Gomez called  the assemblage to order. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  these the only terms on which Xuarez will return to his allegiance?&rdquo; he asked  the priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  only terms. If they are accepted, fire one gun, and <i>The Pizarro</i> will  steam to Acauhtzin to tell Xuarez that the war will not take place. Two guns,  and then, oh, my children, the vessel will go northward to bring desolation  upon us. There will be war&mdash;red war; brother will be arrayed against brother;  our towns will be laid in ashes; our peaceful community will struggle in deadly  strife. I urge you, implore you, to accept this offer and avert disaster!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  will be war!&rdquo; sang out some man in the crowd. &ldquo;The opal is red!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal is red! the opal is red!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you Catholics?&rdquo; cried Padre Ignatius, his voice ringing forth like a trumpet. &ldquo;Are  you sons of the Church or children of the devil? That stone is the work of  Satan! Obey it, and you will bring ruin on yourselves, on your families, on your  country. In the name of this sacred symbol,&rdquo; he thundered, holding up the  cross, &ldquo;I command you to put this evil from your hearts. The devil stone speaks  war the holy cross commands peace. Obey it at the peril of your souls&mdash;of your  salvation. I say Peace! Peace! Peace! In the name of the Church&mdash;Peace! At your  peril&mdash;War!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  whole man was transfigured as he stood intrepidly facing the furious assemblage  with the uplifted cross. There was no fear in his eyes, there was no trembling  of the hand which upheld the symbol of Christianity. He was no longer Padre  Ignatius, the gentle priest whom they knew. It was a priest, the representative  of the awful power of Rome, with the thunders of the Vatican at his back, with  salvation in this world, and in the next at his will, holding their souls in  the hollow of his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Richelieu,&rdquo;  murmured Philip, softly. </p>
  <p>For  a moment the assemblage was awed. Many were atheists who believed in nothing;  some idolaters, who trusted in the devil stone, all were superstitious, and they  quailed before that frail old man who faced them so dauntlessly. Suddenly, as  it were, the influence passed away, the devil-stone conquered the cross. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!  War!&rdquo; yelled the deputies, springing to their feet. &ldquo;No priests! no Jesuits! To  the vote! to the vote!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Gomez  arose to his feet. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;  he cried, loudly, &ldquo;I respect the Padre for his effort to avert the war. His  mission is to bring peace, and he has striven to do so. But it cannot be. The  Cholacacan Republic cannot yield to the insolent demands of Xuarez. We choose  our rulers freely, without coercion. In six months I surrender my office and  will you permit Don Hypolito Xuarez, traitor and scoundrel, to profane this  chair? No, Se&ntilde;ores; a thousand times no! We know the nature of this man who aspires  to play the part of a tyrant. Place him in this seat of power, and he will  break every law of our glorious constitution. Will that liberty which was won  by the blood of our fathers, by the heroism of Zuloaga, be trodden under foot  at the bidding of this man? He comes, not to implore you to elect him supreme  magistrate of the Republic. He comes with an army at his back, and commands  you&mdash;I say commands you&mdash;to make him Dictator!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!  War! Down with Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is this traitor, to dare our power? He has the fleet, it is true&mdash;traitors that  they are!&mdash;but we have the army. We have money. We can buy a new fleet. Our  soldiers shall break up his power. Let us hurl back in his face this insolent  defiance, and sweep away Xuarez and his partisans in torrents of blood!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!  War! The opal burns red.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the opal burns red. And our hearts burn with indignation at the insolence of  this man. I swear,&rdquo; cried the President, drawing his sword. &ldquo;I swear, by my  sword, by the Chalchuih Tlatonac, that I shall not sheath this weapon till it  has exterminated these traitors, and purified the Republic. Hear me, God!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear  us, God!&rdquo; And a myriad swords flashed in the air. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  I put the offer of the traitor Xuarez to the vote?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! War! war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Ignatius  tried to speak, but he saw that the Junta was unanimous in proclaiming war. His  cross fell from his nerveless hands; his head sunk on his breast. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy  Mary, have mercy on these misguided men.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  passed out of the hall in dejected silence, and after him swept a whirlwind of  men, headed by the President. Outside the Palacio Nacional, a crowd of people  were waiting to hear the decision of the Junta. Standing on the marble steps of  the palace, Don Francisco caused the standard of the Republic to be unfurled,  and waved his bare sword in the air. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the name of the Junta! In the name of the free people of the great Republic of  Cholacaca, I proclaim war against the traitor Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!  war! war!&rdquo; yelled the mob, frantically. &ldquo;The opal burns red! War! war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then,  with one accord, the rabble dashed down to the sea-gate of the city. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are they going there for, Tim?&rdquo; asked Philip, as they were borne along by the  living torrent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  hear the cannon answer Xuarez, if I mistake not. Holy Virgin! what devils these  are when their blood is up!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>From  the Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres the crowd rolled down the steep of the Calle  Otumba, passed into the Calle Mayor, and in a few minutes the city was vomiting  hundreds of infuriated men out of her gates on to the beach and wharf. </p>
  <p>Far  away on the azure sea lay the vast bulk of <i>The Pizarro</i>, with the flag of  the Republic floating at her main-mast, in conjunction with the white pennant  of peace. The crowd held their breath, and throughout the vast assemblage there  was not a sound. The waves lapping on the beach could alone be heard, and each  man in that mighty congregation held his breath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  gun for &lsquo;yes!&rsquo; Two guns for &lsquo;no!&rsquo; &rdquo; muttered Jack, in Tim&rsquo;s ear. </p>
  <p>At  that instant a puff of smoke broke from an embrasure of the rear fort, and a  gun thundered out its defiance to Xuarez. In another minute, before the echo of  the first died away, a second gun from the other fort roared out in the still  air, and there was an answering roar from the crowd below. </p>
  <p>The  flag of peace! the flag of the opal were suddenly lowered from the mast of <i>The  Pizarro</i>, and up went a fierce red banner, foretelling war and disaster. The  mob yelled with rage, the guns of <i>The Pizarro</i> sent forth an insolent  defiance, and in a few minutes, with the smoke pouring black and thick from her  funnels, the great vessel stood out to sea. </p>
  <p>The  War of Cholacaca had commenced. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI<br>
    The Drama Of Little Things</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Many  things happen!<br>
    They are the daily events of our lives, we note them with idle indifference.<br>
    The lover kisses his dear one, she sighs on his throbbing bosom,<br>
    He springs on his waiting horse, and waving his hand at parting,<br>
    Thinks that the morrow for certain, will bring her again to his kisses,<br>
    Alas! he knows not that Fate is capricious!<br>
    That never again will the dear one respond to his welcome caresses!<br>
  &ldquo;Good-bye for an hour!&rdquo; ah, sorrow. That good-bye means &ldquo;farewell for ever.&rdquo;<br>
    And yet they know not this future, and so, parting happy,<br>
    Go east and west gladly, to anguish apart till they perish. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quiere  a fumar, Juan,&rdquo; said Dolores, holding out a small case to Jack, with a  coquettish smile. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campeacheanos!&rdquo;  replied her lover, selecting one carefully, &ldquo;these are for men only. I hope you  don&rsquo;t smoke these, mi cara.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I but use cigarros de papel. This case belongs to my cousin, Don Rafael. Now it  is yours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will Don Rafael say?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say!  Why, nothing, of course. He made me a present of the campeacheanos.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  did he?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, suspiciously. &ldquo;You seem to be fond of your cousin,  Dolores!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally!  It is my duty,&rdquo; replied Dolores, demurely, and dropped her eyes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Duval, briefly, and busied himself in lighting a cigarette. </p>
  <p>It  was late in the afternoon, and they were on the azotea of Maraquando&rsquo;s house  alone, save for the presence of Do&ntilde;a Serafina; but she was asleep, and,  therefore, did not trouble them. As before stated, the Casa Maraquando was on  the summit of the hill, and from the roof they could look down into the valley  below. Ring after ring of houses encompassed the rise, and on the flat,  trending towards the sea, street, and house, and plaza, and wall, were laid out  as in a map. To the left, the vast space of the parade-ground; to the right,  the crowded quarter of the peons, a mass of huddled huts, red-roofed,  white-walled, and between the two the broad street leading from the foot of the  hill down to the sea-gate. </p>
  <p>On  the parade-ground companies of soldiers were man&oelig;uvring. Here and there the  bright colours of uniforms could be seen in the streets. Sometimes a distant  trumpet rang out shrilly, or the muffled thunder of drums came faintly to their  ears. Within the walls of the city all was bustle and military pomp, the place  was one vast camp. Beyond, the white line of the walls and the infinite stretch  of azure sea glittering in the sunshine. </p>
  <p>Peter,  in company with Cocom, had gone outside the inland walls for a final butterfly  hunt before the outbreak of war, when, in view of the suburbs being deserted,  he would have to abandon his favourite pursuit. Down in the Plaza de San Jago,  Sir Philip Cassim was assisting Don Rafael to drill his men, and Tim was, as  usual, haunting the telegraph-office and the Palacio Nacional. He spent all his  time between these two places, collecting news, and despatching messages. Only  Jack was idle; Jack, who, decked out in the gaudy uniform of the Regimient de  los Caballeros, set on the azotea flirting with Dolores and smoking innumerable  cigarettes. With masculine vanity, he had come there especially to show himself  to the lady of his heart, in his new uniform, and, finding Do&ntilde;a Serafina  asleep, had waited to speak to Dolores for a few minutes before joining Philip  in the plaza below. The few minutes had, by this time, lengthened into  half-an-hour. </p>
  <p>Without  doubt Jack looked remarkably handsome in his uniform, and Dolores acknowledged  this to herself as she glanced at him from behind the safe shelter of her fan.  He was as fine as a humming-bird, and tinted like a rainbow. The Mexican dress  became him admirably, and in that brilliant climate the bright colours did not  look too pronounced. </p>
  <p>The  uniform consisted of calzoneros of dark green velvet split from the thigh  downward, slashed with braid, set with rows of silver buttons, and filled with  the calzoncillos of white muslin. A short, tight-fitting jacket of yellow cloth  embroidered with gold, over a full white shirt, puffing out at the hips, open  sleeves, a scarlet-silk sash round the waist sustaining a brace of pistols and  a Spanish knife. Finally, boots of tanned leather with heavy spurs hanging with  little bells. Over all his finery, Jack wore a picturesque zarape of dark blue,  and a sombrero of the same colour encircled with a broad band of gold. In this  picturesque costume, his fine figure was seen to its best advantage; but Jack  was already regretting his plain English riding-suit of unadorned grey. </p>
  <p>At  present, however, he was not thinking of his fine feathers, or of the two men  waiting for him in the Plaza de San Jago, but of the last remark of Dolores. </p>
  <p>Jack  had no reason to be jealous of Don Rafael, as he, to all appearances, cared  more for war than for women; yet, because Dolores admitted that she liked her  cousin, this foolish young man began to sulk. The girl watched him with great  amusement for a few minutes, and then made a malicious remark in reference to  his uniform. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pajaro  precoso!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am a precious bird, am I?&rdquo; said Jack, ungraciously; &ldquo;but not precious to you,  Dolores. Don Rafael&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my cousin&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like cousins,&rdquo; muttered Duval, obstinately, keeping his eyes away from  her face, whereat Dolores rapped him smartly on the fingers with her closed  fan. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will eat all the cousins of your killing, Juan. Turn your face to me, child  that you are. Santissima! What a cross face! Se&ntilde;or Caballero, you are jealous!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  admitted Jack, reluctantly. </p>
  <p>Dolores  glanced at her aunt, to make sure that she was asleep, then bending towards  this foolish lover, kissed him on the cheek. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you jealous now, querido?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  answered Jack, returning the kiss with interest; &ldquo;I am a fool not to trust you  thoroughly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are! Hush! Enough! My aunt may awake.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  she! So you love me only, Dolores? And Don Rafael&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  betrothed to a lady of Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dolores!&rdquo; sighed Jack, much relieved, and kissed her again. In fact, he would  have saluted her several times, had not Dolores spread her fan between their  two faces as a shield. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Do&ntilde;a Serafina may awaken, and then&mdash;&rsquo;Dios de mi alma,&rsquo; what would my uncle  say?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must know sooner or later.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till the war is over, querido. Till Don Hypolito is slain, and you return  covered with glory. Then my uncle can refuse you nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  I will wait. And, after all, Dolores, I am not quite a foreigner. I have dwelt  so long in Mexico that I know all your manners and customs. Now I have even  assumed the dress of Cholacaca, so I am quite one of your own people.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a heretic!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Padre Ignatius has been talking to you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  querido; my aunt&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  never mind your aunt. If I mistake not, she admires a heretic herself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;El  hombrecillo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  by the little man you mean Don Pedro, yes. But oh, my soul, do not let such  things as this separate us. You love me, Dolores? You will be true to me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear it!&rdquo; cried the girl, throwing herself on his breast; &ldquo;I swear it&mdash;by the  opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! not that. You surely don&rsquo;t believe in the devil stone?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I a child to believe?&rdquo; laughed Dolores, scornfully. &ldquo;No; I am a true daughter  of the Church; but I believe this opal to be mine, and if I can get it I will  do so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will both try and obtain it, though I am afraid there is but little chance of  doing so. We know not where is the temple.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  knows.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but Cocom will not tell. But enough of the opal. We will talk of it again.  Meanwhile, tell me to whom is Rafael engaged? He has told me nothing about it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he has told no one save me, lest it should reach the ears of my uncle, and thus  anger him. The lady my cousin loves is Do&ntilde;a Carmencita de Tejada&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  ejaculated Jack, in surprise. &ldquo;The daughter of Xuarez&rsquo;s right-hand man?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the daughter of Don Jos&eacute; de Tejada, the rebel. So, you see, he does not let his  father know of his love, for Don Miguel would never consent to his son becoming  the husband of a traitor&rsquo;s child.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true. Poor Rafael! The course of his love does not seem likely to run smooth.  Still, when the war is over, he may be more fortunate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  the war,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Dolores, sadly. &ldquo;This terrible war. How I tremble to think  of what is before us. Should Don Hypolito conquer&mdash;&rdquo; She covered her face with  her hands, shuddering violently. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito will not conquer,&rdquo; replied Jack, soothingly taking her to his breast. &ldquo;We  will humble him to the dust before three months are ended. Besides, if the  worst comes, we can fly to Europe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay,  de mi. May it not come to that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;  said Duval, solemnly; and they remained clasped in each others arms, with  hearts too full for speech. </p>
  <p>Suddenly  they heard the sound of a prolonged yawn, and had just time to separate before  Do&ntilde;a Serafina caught them in that close embrace. Fortunately, they had been  hidden by an angle of the azotea wall, so the good lady, who had just awakened,  and was still bemused with sleep, saw nothing. When she was thoroughly awake,  however, she espied Jack in all the bravery of his uniform, and came forward  with a light step and an exclamation of delight. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;El  Regimiento de los Caballeros!&rdquo; she exclaimed, admiringly. &ldquo;Santissima! how the  uniform does become you, Don Juan. I do so admire handsome Americanos,&rdquo; added  the lady, languidly. Dolores laughed at this na&iuml;ve confession, but Jack, modest  Jack, blushed through the tan of his skin. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Do&ntilde;a Serafina, I am much obliged, I kiss your hands,&rdquo; he answered, confusedly. &ldquo;I  have just arrived&rdquo;&mdash;he had been there half an hour&mdash;&rdquo;just arrived, Se&ntilde;ora, and I  had not the heart to disturb you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  the child spoken?&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Serafina, waving her fan towards Dolores, who  stood with downcast eyes, inwardly convulsed, outwardly demure. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes; a little. She has not the brilliant tongue of her aunt,&rdquo; replied Jack,  artfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pobrecita!  She is young; she is a kitten. She will yet improve. I was the same at her age.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you were,&rdquo; thought Jack, with secret apprehension, surveying her portly  form. &ldquo;I hope Dolores won&rsquo;t be the same at your age.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Don Pedro?&rdquo; asked the duenna, languidly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  lay his heart at your feet this evening, Se&ntilde;ora.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is his Don Juan,&rdquo; responded the lady, graciously. It was a mere figure of  speech; but Jack was secretly amused to think how alarmed Peter would be  hearing of such an offer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  this war, Se&ntilde;or Americano; this terrible war! How I fear it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not be afraid, Se&ntilde;ora. We will protect you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes; I am sure of that. But my nephew, Se&ntilde;or? Don Rafael! He is much angered.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the war?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima,  no! At his ship, which still sails up and down in front of Tlatonac. What does  it mean, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  turned in the direction indicated by her fan, and saw a large ship far out on  the wrinkled sea. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that <i>The Pizarro</i>? I did not know,&rdquo; he said in some perplexity. &ldquo;I  understood she had departed to Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  cousin says it is <i>The Pizarro</i>,&rdquo; interposed Dolores at this moment; &ldquo;and  we know not why she stays.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  notice she keeps well out of the range of the fort guns,&rdquo; muttered Jack,  anxiously. &ldquo;Hum! it is curious. Perhaps she is sent by Don Hypolito to carry  off Do&ntilde;a Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  old lady made a gesture to avert the evil eye. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  not such things, Se&ntilde;or. That terrible man! He might carry me off even here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he might, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; replied Jack, trying to be serious. &ldquo;I would advise yourself  and the young ladies to keep within doors.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Don Hypolito can carry us off from the middle of Tlatonac, he is cleverer than  I think,&rdquo; said Dolores, contemptuously; &ldquo;but what can be the reason of <i>The  Pizarro</i> thus guarding the town?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have it!&rdquo; cried Jack, suddenly enlightened. &ldquo;She is watching for the arrival of  the torpedo-boats. Yes, that is her game. She wishes to meet them before they  know of the revolt, and thus seduce them to the cause of Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; exclaimed both ladies at once. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true! I am sure of it,&rdquo; responded Jack, hurriedly. &ldquo;I must speak to Don  Rafael about this. &lsquo;Adios, se&ntilde;oritas! Con Dios vayan ustedes.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  young engineer kissed the hands of both ladies, and clattered down the steps on  his way to the patio. Just as he was passing through the zaguan, he heard a  light foot hasten after him, and before he reached the door, Dolores was in his  arms. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  left my aunt on the azotea,&rdquo; she said, breathlessly. &ldquo;One kiss, querido, before  you go! There;&mdash;and there! Oh, my soul! Be careful of yourself. I go, at  vespers, to pray for you at the shrine of our Lady.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angel!  Such prayers will be my safeguard in all dangers!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Padre  Ignatius has promised me a sacred relic which preserves the wearer from harm.  He gives it to me this evening. I will bring it to you. To-night you will be  here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  at the eighth hour. Adios, angelito!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  embraced hurriedly, and Dolores returned to the azotea to explain her sudden  absence to Do&ntilde;a Serafina as best she could; while Jack, filled with joy at  these proofs of her love, gaily danced down the street on his way to the Plaza  de San Jago, where Philip waited him. </p>
  <p>Everywhere  soldiers, everywhere the beating of drums, the shrilling of trumpets, the  waving of flags, and oftentimes the martial strains of the &ldquo;Opal Fandango.&rdquo; The  city of Tlatonac had awakened from its sleep of years, and in every street, in  every house, activity prevailed. It was not a city; it was a camp. The inhabitants,  almost to a man, had become soldiers, and flattered by the women, dressed in  gaudy uniforms, excited by frequent draughts of aguardiente, they fancied  themselves invincible. Every evening fireworks were let off in the principal  squares, bands of soldiers marched nightly through the streets, singing the  national song of the opal; and at times the enthusiasm arose to such a pitch  that the whole city was convulsed with a delirium of joy. In the opinion of  Tlatonac, the rebel Xuarez was already conquered. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope this enthusiasm is not born of Dutch courage,&rdquo; said Jack to himself, as he  elbowed his way through an excited throng; &ldquo;but it seems too violent to last.  These howling wretches see Xuarez in chains, pleading for his life; but they  don&rsquo;t see the events which are bound to occur before such a thing takes place.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Abajo  los Oposidores! Viva el Republica! Mueran a Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shout  away, mis amigos,&rdquo; muttered Duval, grimly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see if you&rsquo;ll shout as loudly  when the bombs are cracking over the city. If <i>The Pizarro</i> sent one now,  I guess you&rsquo;d not be so lively.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  the Plaza de San Jago, soldiers were being drilled. A fine body of men was El  Regimient de los Caballeros, and a gallant show they made as they wheeled their  horses into line. Philip, arrayed in the same style as Jack, was reining his  steed beside Colonel Garibay, the commander of the troop, and on the other side  of him rode Don Rafael, late a captain in the navy, now a captain on land. Don  Rafael, a handsome, dark-eyed young man, full of fiery earnestness, and not  unlike his sister in appearance, though lacking her softer feminine grace, had  taken a great fancy to Philip, with whom he had become very intimate. Jack  Duval he knew of old, and liked immensely; but Cassim&rsquo;s character was more in  accordance with his own, therefore they were comrades by the rule of like  drawing to like. </p>
  <p>Colonel  Garibay was greatly gratified that these two young Americanos had joined his  troop as volunteers, and made things as pleasant for them as he possibly could.  He commanded one of the crack regiments of the Cholacacan army, and was  determined that it should not belie its reputation in the coming war. Hitherto  it had but reaped laurels in frontier wars against the Indians; but now it was  for the first time to combat with a civilised foe, and would have a good  opportunity of showing to the world of what stuff its men were made. </p>
  <p>The  regiment deployed into thin lines, massed into compact columns, charged at the  gallop, retired in good order, and proved themselves in all the complicated  evolutions of a cavalry corps to be thoroughly disciplined soldiers. In the  burning sun, with the grey dust whirling up in clouds from the restless feet of  the horses, the columns expanded and contracted like the glittering lengths of  a snake, and at every sound of the bugle the lines changed their position with  the utmost military precision. For three hours Garibay kept his troop hard at  work. At length even his insatiable soul was satisfied at their state of  efficiency, and to the stirring strains of the &ldquo;Zuloaga March&rdquo; the men filed  off the ground. </p>
  <p>In  other parts of the plaza infantry regiments were drilling and, after a time,  these also dispersed, so that by the hour of sundown the great square was  almost deserted, save for scattered groups of soldiers discussing the coming  war. Jack, in company with Philip and the Colonel, went off to the quarters of  the latter in the sea-fort, and there they proceeded to make themselves  comfortable. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am pleased with my children, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Garibay, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but I would  I commanded foot instead of horse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore  so, Don Rodrigo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  this reason, Se&ntilde;or Felipe. Our country is so mountainous that, save on the  plains, there is but little use for cavalry. The seat of the war will be at  Acauhtzin, and there the land is all mountains. Consequently the infantry will  be of most service up yonder. If, however, the enemy come south to Tlatonac and  Janjalla, our cavalry can meet them in the open plains surrounding these towns.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito will certainly come south,&rdquo; said Jack, sagely. &ldquo;He will not wait for  the Republic to send troops up to Acauhtzin, but embark his troops on the  war-ships, and try his fortunes down in this direction. Besides, Xuarez knows  that the Republic has no transports for the troops.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  war-ships, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, gravely, &ldquo;that is true. But by order of  his Excellency, all merchant-vessels of a certain tonnage have been seized in  the port of Tlatonac, and requisitioned for the service of transporting troops  to Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce! And what say the owners to such high-handed proceedings?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  owners have been paid. So, you see, we can embark our men on these ships, and  sail north to&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  be knocked to pieces by the war-ships,&rdquo; finished Philip, coolly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  you forget the torpederas will be here soon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if <i>The Pizarro</i> will let them pass her,&rdquo; said Duval, meaningly. &ldquo;I see  she is cruising constantly up and down.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think, Don Juan, she is waiting for the arrival of the torpederas?&rdquo; asked  the Colonel, anxiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure of it, Colonel. Don Miguel informed me that the torpedo-boats had  started from England. Xuarez, who has his spies in England, also knows this,  and sent <i>The Pizarro</i> south with a twofold object: to dictate terms to  the Republic, and intercept the torpederas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  failed in the first, however,&rdquo; observed Philip, hopefully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  but he may not fail in the second.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said the Colonel, earnestly, &ldquo;<i>The Pizarro</i> dare not  stop the torpedo-boats&mdash;they could sink her in no time. She has no defence  against them&mdash;no nets, for those were left at Tlatonac when the fleet went  north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the more reason that Xuarez should capture the torpedo-boats,&rdquo; retorted Jack,  hotly. &ldquo;<i>The Pizarro</i> will not try force, mi Colonel! No; the torpederas  left England before war was proclaimed; therefore, those in charge know nothing  of the disaffection of the fleet, of the rebellion of Xuarez. If they meet <i>The  Pizarro</i>, they will stop when she signals; their commanders will go on board  in blissful ignorance, and be either seduced to the cause of Xuarez, or  retained as prisoners of war. In either case, the torpederas, taken by  surprise, will be captured, and accompany <i>The Pizarro</i> to the north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  What you say is true, Se&ntilde;or! Santissima! What ill-fortune!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  torpederas must be warned!&rdquo; exclaimed Philip, quickly. &ldquo;I will speak to His  Excellency, and offer the services of my yacht to the Republic. If my offer is  accepted, I will get steam up on <i>The Bohemian</i>, and stand out to sea at  once. Cruise up and down till I see the torpederas, and then warn them of their  danger.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and be chased all the time by <i>The Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t catch <i>The Bohemian</i>. I&rsquo;d back my boat against the combined speed of  the whole rebel navy. It is the only chance of saving the torpedo-boats from  the clutches of Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pity my railway is not finished,&rdquo; said Jack, regretfully; &ldquo;then we could have  ran up the whole army to Acauhtzin without trouble. As it is, the only passage  is by sea, and I am afraid the war-ships render that impossible.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  far have you got with the line, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  fifty miles. It stops in the centre of a dense forest, so it is worse than  useless&mdash;to Xuarez as to ourselves.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment Don Rafael entered, in a state of great excitement. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ola,  Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he said, gaily; &ldquo;I have just come from the presence of His Excellency  and my father; it is the intention of the Junta to send an embassy to  Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  treat with Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo!  no!&rdquo; retorted the young man fiercely; &ldquo;to promise freedom to the rebels, if  they lay down their arms and deliver up Xuarez for punishment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Colonel  Garibay shook his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t do that, mi amigo! if I know anything of Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true that he has great influence over them,&rdquo; said Rafael, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but  the power of the Opposidores is as nothing before that of the Junta; if they  are wise, they will lay down their arms.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are not wise, however,&rdquo; said Jack, dryly; &ldquo;and they won&rsquo;t lay down their arms.  And how does the embassy propose to get to Acauhtzin?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is said that Se&ntilde;or Felipe has offered his ship to the Junta,&rdquo; said Rafael,  bowing courteously to the baronet; &ldquo;and the Junta have decided to accept that  grand offer with a thousand thanks.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  cried Philip, heartily. &ldquo;I am glad <i>The Bohemian</i> will be of some service.  Yes, Don Rafael, my yacht is at the disposal of the Government. But tell me,  Se&ntilde;or, who goes north with the embassy?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yourself,  Se&ntilde;or Felipe, if you will come; my father and myself, with a company of  soldiers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  yourself, Don Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  young hidalgo blushed, and rolled a cigarette with pretended indifference. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!  Oh, I wish to hurl defiance in the teeth of Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  had received a hint of Don Rafael&rsquo;s passion and as Jack was busily talking with  Garibay, approached the captain with a smile. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all?&rdquo; he whispered, smiling. </p>
  <p>Don  Rafael looked at him steadily, and then caught his hand with a sudden passion  of friendship. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  mi amigo. I wish to see Do&ntilde;a Carmencita, and, if possible, carry her south.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  she come, Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she loves me; her father is cruel to her; she will come, if you will permit it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  my ship and all I have is at your disposal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand thanks, Don Felipe,&rdquo; said Rafael, cordially pressing his friend&rsquo;s  hand; &ldquo;I will take advantage of your kindness. Not a word to my father, Se&ntilde;or.  He knows nothing as yet; I will tell him all at Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be silent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gracias  mi amigo. I will give you my help in the like case.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will certainly be needed some day,&rdquo; replied Philip, significantly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not as yet. Ah, Se&ntilde;or, you do not then know what it is to love.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  I?&rdquo; thought Philip, and saw before him, as in a dream, the fair face of Do&ntilde;a  Eulalia. </p>
  <p>It  was now late, so, after they had dined with Garibay, the two Englishmen, at the  invitation of Don Rafael, went to the Casa Maraquando. </p>
  <p>When  they arrived, to their surprise, all was in confusion. The servants were  running aimlessly about, Do&ntilde;a Serafina and Eulalia were in tears, and Don  Miguel was cursing loud and deep. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; asked the young men in alarm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores  is lost!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII<br>
    A Strange Disappearance</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Shepherds  kind! my love hath left me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore am I filled with woe;<br>
    Of my heart hath she bereft me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thievish nymph! why didst thou so?<br>
    Ah, well-a-day! True love is a jewel!<br>
    Why hence away? Oh, my Chloe cruel.<br>
    Tell the damsel, should ye meet her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, alas! no heart have I,<br>
    For her love I would entreat her;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fickle maid, why didst thou fly?<br>
    Ah, well-a-day! True love is a jewel!<br>
    Why hence away? Oh, my Chloe cruel.<br>
    Prythee shepherds, her discover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I her face again would see;<br>
    Still am I her longing lover;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet coquette, return to me!<br>
    Ah, well-a-day! True love is a jewel!<br>
    Why hence away? Oh, my Chloe cruel.</p>
  <p>Dolores  lost! Jack&rsquo;s thoughts immediately became busy with Don Hypolito, and the Forest  Indians. Could it be that she had been carried off by one of these, and if so,  by which of the two? It was now nine o&rsquo;clock, and Jack had left her on the roof  of the azotea at four. It seemed impossible that in so short a period the girl  could have utterly disappeared. At the same time, by the strict social  observances of Tlatonac, Dolores should have returned from her visit to the  cathedral before dark, and as she had not done so, there seemed to be  reasonable ground for apprehension. </p>
  <p>Such  excitement reigned in the house that it was some time before either Jack or  Philip could extract the reasons for such belief from the alarmed inmates. As poor  Duval was terribly upset at the thought that Dolores was lost, Philip took  affairs into his own hands with great promptitude, and proceeded to  cross-examine the maid who had last seen her. This damsel, by name Marina, was  of pure Indian extraction, and cunning past all knowing. At the present time,  however, owing to the reproaches of Do&ntilde;a Serafina, and the scoldings of Don  Miguel, she was reduced to a kind of moral pulp, not having even sufficient  energy to lie according to custom. </p>
  <p>Philip  spoke to Don Miguel as to the advisability of extracting information from this  girl; and at once Marina was brought before him. She was terribly afraid of the  Se&ntilde;or Americano, who looked so stern and evidently thought Philip was about to  order her immediate execution. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marina!&rdquo;  asked Philip, slowly, in Spanish, &ldquo;where did you last see the Se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!  Se&ntilde;or Americano!&rdquo; replied the frightened poblana, clasping her hands, &ldquo;it was  in the great church. The Se&ntilde;orita was kneeling at the shrine of Our Lady,  and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; said Philip, seeing she hesitated. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  Dios, Se&ntilde;or, I thought no harm; but I saw Pepe at the door of the church, and  he beckoned to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Pepe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hechicera!&rdquo;  broke in Do&ntilde;a Serafina, wildly, &ldquo;that good-for-nothing Pepe is your lover. And  you went to him, ladroncilla? Eh, yes! You left the Se&ntilde;orita. Oh, wicked one!  Oh, child of Satan!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  for a moment, I swear! Por todos santos! it was not long. When I returned to  the shrine, Do&ntilde;a Dolores was gone. I thought she had departed to see Padre  Ignatius, and I waited. A long time I waited, Se&ntilde;or Americano, but she came  not. Then I believed she had returned to the casa, and I was afraid of being  punished, so I did not come back here till late! She is not here! ay de mi! and  I know not where is the poor angel! Madre de Dios! what misfortune!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was nothing more to be got out of the terrified girl, as she but repeated this  story over and over again. She had gone with Dolores to the cathedral, had  spoken to Pepe, and then lost sight of her mistress. Inquiries were made for  Pepe, who was a zambo, that is, the offspring of an Indian and an African. To  all accounts, he inherited the worst vices of both races, and was an idle,  drunken vagabond, who had been frequently punished by Don Miguel for thieving.  It was possible that, out of revenge, the zambo might have decoyed Dolores  beyond the walls, and there surrendered her to the Indians. Maraquando thought  that this might be the case. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Jack, when this explanation was suggested, &ldquo;Dolores was afraid of the  Indians, and would not believe any message brought by such a man. But she told  me to-day that she wished to see Padre Ignatius. Perhaps he was not in the  cathedral, and she went to his chapel beyond the walls. Once there, and all things  are possible.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be so,&rdquo; cried Don Miguel, sadly. &ldquo;I have sent out men to ride everywhere  beyond the walls, and try to discover traces. They will certainly go to the  chapel, and ask the Padre if my poor child has been there!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay  di mi! what sorrow,&rdquo; cried Eulalia, whose pretty face was disfigured by tears; &ldquo;if  Dolores is with the Indians, they will sacrifice her to the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so, hermanita!&rdquo; cried Rafael, hastily, &ldquo;she is the guardian of the opal! They  would not dare to do this! If she is with the Indians, her life is safe. But  Don Hypolito!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrai!&rdquo;  exclaimed his father, fiercely, &ldquo;what of that false one?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  swore to carry off Dolores, and make her his wife. This demonio of a Pepe was  once in the household of Xuarez. He may be in his pay now, and have decoyed my  cousin down to the sea-beach, beyond the gate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how could he take her from thence?&rdquo; asked Philip, in perplexity. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrambo,  Se&ntilde;or! do you forget that <i>The Pizarro</i> has been cruising before Tlatonac  for days past. It was not to watch the torpederas coming, as we thought. By San  Jago, it was to capture and carry off Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  cannot be!&rdquo; said Jack, in despair. &ldquo;<i>The Pizarro</i> would not dare to come  under the guns of the fort!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  could do so in the darkness.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the search lights.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are at present useless,&rdquo; cried Don Miguel striking his breast with his hand; &ldquo;the  electric apparatus is out of repair, and the engineers are now attending to it.  What misfortune! Dios! It may be as Rafael says. Pepe decoyed Dolores to the  beach, and from thence she could be taken to the war-ship.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  was horrified at this possibility. It was not very probable that such a thing  had happened; still, it might have taken place. If it were so, Dolores would be  now on board <i>The Pizarro</i>, steaming north to Acauhtzin&mdash;to Xuarez, whom  she hated and feared. He was about to speak his mind on the subject when Tim,  in a great flurry, arrived with Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is all this about?&rdquo; cried Tim, rushing up to Jack. &ldquo;Is Do&ntilde;a Dolores missing?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  drew him away from Jack, who was too overwhelmed to answer questions, and  hurriedly explained all that had occurred. The Irishman scratched his head, but  could suggest nothing save that they should search the country. A sudden idea  struck Philip. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;  he said quickly, turning towards the doctor, &ldquo;what time did you return from  your beetle hunting?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  sunset.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left  me as soon as we entered the town, in order to pray at the cathedral. He has  done the same thing regularly every time we have returned to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom!&rdquo;  cried Jack, jumping to his feet at the mention of the name, &ldquo;why, Philip, do  you think he decoyed Dolores away?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows! She is either with the Indians or with Xuarez. Cocom or Pepe, as  emissaries of Don Hypolito, may have carried her off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  foregoing had been spoken in English, and, ignorant of the language, Rafael  could only understand the names. He glanced eagerly from one to the other, and  spoke quickly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom!  Pepe! What is this, Se&ntilde;or Felipe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Whereat  Philip began to explain, but was interrupted by the entrance of Padre Ignatius.  The good priest looked much disturbed, and raised his hand to bless those in  the room. Do&ntilde;a Serafina and Eulalia flung themselves at his feet, and were so  overwhelmed with grief that they had to be taken away. When they had gone,  Padre Ignatius turned to the men. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  sons, I hear evil news. Is it true that Do&ntilde;a Dolores is missing?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  do you know where she is?&rdquo; asked Jack, imploringly, laying his hand on the  rusty sleeve of the priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  no,&rdquo; replied the Padre, shaking his head; &ldquo;all the afternoon did I wait for her  in the cathedral, but she came not!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not go to your own church, my father?&rdquo; questioned Rafael, eagerly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my son. I thought she might have done so, and repaired thither. But the  sacristan tells me no one has been to the shrine this day. The messengers you  sent out to seek for the poor lady came to the chapel to ask me if I had seen  her, and it was then that I first heard of your great loss.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  you the Indians have her?&rdquo; asked Philip, anxiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!  who knows, Se&ntilde;or? The idolaters have been worshipping the devil stone greatly  of late, and it may be that they have carried off Do&ntilde;a Dolores to assist in the  ceremonies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to sacrifice her?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima  Virgen! no, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; rejoined the Padre, hastily. &ldquo;The idolaters look on her as  the guardian of the stone, as one under the protection of the god himself. If  they have carried her off,&rdquo; added the priest, emphatically, &ldquo;her life is safe,  and her honour. But my son, Don Hypolito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think&mdash;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing, my son. But there is one Pepe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  zambo? Yes, Padre.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hired a boat this afternoon from one of the fishers, saying he was about to go  up the coast to see his mother. I heard of that by chance, my children. When it  was told to me that Pepe had been seen hanging about the doors of the  cathedral, I went from my chapel to the sea-port at once, and there I find that  the boat and Pepe are both gone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo!&rdquo;  swore Rafael, giving voice to the general opinion, &ldquo;he has carried Dolores off  to <i>The Pizarro</i>. Ladron!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may not be so,&rdquo; said Philip, thoughtfully; &ldquo;Cocom is also missing. Do&ntilde;a Dolores  may have gone with him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Peter, angrily. &ldquo;Cocom is a good fellow, and devoted to  Do&ntilde;a Dolores. He would not harm a hair of her head.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a queer business,&rdquo; cried Tim, in perplexity; &ldquo;&lsquo;tis either Cocom or Pepe. I am  certain it is the last of them. <i>The Pizarro</i> wasn&rsquo;t cruising up and down  for nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  torpedo-boats&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the devil with them! Hasn&rsquo;t Xuarez his spies in England as well as the Junta?  He knows the torpedo-boats are not due here for at least a fortnight, so why  should he waste time in searching for them now? By all the saints,&rdquo; shouted  Tim, raising his enormous fist, and crashing it down on the table, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis Don  Hypolito who has the poor girl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was nothing more to be said in the matter as the opinions of everyone were  divided. Don Rafael, Philip, and Peter believed that Dolores had been carried  off by Don Hypolito, as also did Padre Ignatius; while Don Miguel, Tim, and  Jack were equally confident that she was in the power of the forest Indians.  The Englishmen went back to their house, and, as nothing could be done till  morning, Philip spent most of the night trying to comfort Jack, who refused to  go to bed, and walked up and down the sitting-room till close on dawn. At last  the baronet persuaded him to lie down and have some rest, but he only slept  fitfully. At dawn he was on his feet again, and away to the house of  Maraquando, to hear if any news had arrived concerning Dolores. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor Jack, you will kill yourself,&rdquo; said Philip anxiously looking at the young  man&rsquo;s haggard face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Jack, grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold out until I find Dolores. And find  her I will, whether she is in that d&mdash;d temple, or with the cursed Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she is with Don Hypolito,&rdquo; said Philip, as he hurried along beside his friend, &ldquo;we  can go up to Acauhtzin in my yacht, and demand her to be given up; but if the  Indians have her, I am afraid we shall never see her. No one knows where the  temple is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care if it is in the moon,&rdquo; cried Duval, doggedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hunt those  infernal Indians out and make them pay for this. Of two evils I choose the  least, and I trust and believe she is with those opal-stone fanatics rather  than at Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a devil!&rdquo; rejoined Jack, fiercely. &ldquo;If she is with him, God help her! And  God help him!&rdquo; added the young man, in a low voice of concentrated hatred, &ldquo;if  I get my fingers on his throat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  heartily endorsed this opinion; but, afraid of adding to Jack&rsquo;s worry, kept his  thoughts to himself. They speedily arrived at Casa Maraquando, and found Rafael  on the azotea, looking seaward with a marine telescope. He turned round sharply  as he heard their footsteps, and pointed due east. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is gone,&rdquo; he said, with a gesture of despair. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores?&rdquo;  said Jack, whose brain only held one idea. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and <i>The Pizarro</i>!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, I am afraid Do&ntilde;a Dolores has been carried off by Don Hypolito,&rdquo;  observed Philip, taking the glass from Rafael. &ldquo;No doubt that cursed zambo  induced her to go down to the sea-gate on some pretext, and then took her off  to the war-ship, which stood in to land under cover of darkness.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard anything?&rdquo; asked Jack, paying no attention to this speech, but  turning to Don Rafael. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Dolores, nothing. All the messengers sent out have returned without tidings. It  is stated that the Chalchuih Tlatonac is burning red, and thus proclaiming war.  To propitiate the god, some great feast is to take place; but whether Dolores  has been seized by the Indians and carried to their temple to assist at the  ceremony I do not know. Not a single trace of her can be found.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  has disappeared&mdash;so has Pepe and Marina?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marina?&rdquo;  cried Jack, starting. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but that is not the worst. My father, as a member of the Junta, had plans of  the fortifications to Tlatonac. These have been stolen&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stolen?&rdquo;  interrupted Philip, who had been vainly sweeping the horizon in search of <i>The  Pizarro</i>; &ldquo;and by Marina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  my father thinks. My belief of last night is true, Se&ntilde;ores. That ladron Pepe is  a spy in the service of Hypolito. He seduced Marina into stealing the plans  from my father&rsquo;s room, and now they have gone off together in that boat to <i>The  Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  Rafael,&rdquo; replied Cassim, decisively. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores was missing while Marina was  in this house. She was still here when Padre Ignatius came with the news that  Pepe and the boat were gone. Doubtless she has stolen the plans; but she could  not have escaped as you say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a mere detail,&rdquo; said Jack, hastily. &ldquo;Marina is an Indian, and knows the  whole country round for miles. After stealing the plans, she doubtless slipped  out of the country gate and travelled up the coast. There a boat from <i>The  Pizarro</i> could pick her up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Don Miguel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father was summoned before dawn to a special meeting of the Junta. I believe  the assemblage has been sitting all night to deliberate on what is to be done.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my poor Dolores,&rdquo; groaned Jack, covering his face with his hands; &ldquo;where are  you now?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is on board <i>The Pizarro</i>, I doubt not, Don Juan,&rdquo; said Rafael,  approaching the young English-man, &ldquo;I feel sure this is the case. But courage,  mi amigo, we will save your dear one yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear one!&rdquo; stammered Duval, in some perplexity. </p>
  <p>Don  Rafael slipped his arm within that of Jack&rsquo;s, and smiled kindly. &ldquo;Oh, I know  all, Juan. Dolores told me of your love when I returned from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are not angry?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  mi amigo! Why should I be angry? It is true you are an Americano&mdash;a heretic! but  do I not know what love is myself? This makes me kind to you, and when the war  is over, I will do all in my power to aid you with my father.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gracias  Rafael!&rdquo; rejoined Duval, wringing his friend&rsquo;s hand with intense gratitude; &ldquo;but  first we must rescue Dolores from the Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you she is not with the Indians, Jack,&rdquo; said Philip, who had been at the  other end of the terrace and just returned within earshot; &ldquo;she is on board <i>The  Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so also, Juan. If so, we will chase the war-ship in the vessel of Don  Felipe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I have given her to the Junta, for political, purposes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  that is so. But when my father returns from the Palacio Nacional, I am certain  he will request you, in the name of the Republic, to start for Acauhtzin before  noon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  order to demand the surrender of Xuarez,&rdquo; said Jack, clenching his fist; &ldquo;those  rebels will not do that; but if Dolores is there, I will save them the trouble  of answering, by man-handling Don Hypolito till he&rsquo;ll be fit for nothing but  his bed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dos  pajaros al un golpe,&rdquo; replied Rafael, significantly. &ldquo;Dolores and Xuarez being  the birds, you, mi amigo, the stone. Ah!&rdquo; he added, as the bell in the  cathedral tower chimed the hour, &ldquo;there is eight o&rsquo;clock. I think it will be as  well, Se&ntilde;ores, to have something to eat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  couldn&rsquo;t eat a thing,&rdquo; said Jack, abruptly, as they descended the staircase to  the patio. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is wrong, Juan. You will need all your strength to regain Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are the ladies?&rdquo; asked Philip, anxious to see Do&ntilde;a Eulalia. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are not yet up, Don Felipe! Nor do I wish to disturb them, for they are worn  out with sorrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>On  hearing this, Philip agreed that it would be better to let them rest, and  accepting Rafael&rsquo;s invitation, they sat down to a hastily spread meal. In the  middle of it, Don Miguel, followed closely by the ubiquitous Tim, entered the  patio. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Buenos  Dias, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Maraquando, as the young men arose from their meal. &ldquo;I  have news.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Do&ntilde;a Dolores, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Don Felipe. Sad news! Alas! there is no doubt of it. She is on board <i>The  Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is this, my father?&rdquo; asked Rafael, as Jack resumed his seat with a visage of  despair. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fishing-boat came into the port late last night, and the men reported that they  had passed a skiff containing a man and a veiled woman, making for <i>The  Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores!&rdquo;  sighed Jack, sadly; &ldquo;but then, Se&ntilde;or Maraquando,&rdquo; he added, with reviving hope,  &ldquo;it might have been Marina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or. Marina was here when Padre Ignatius told us the boat was taken. I fear  it is true. My poor niece has been decoyed away by that accursed zambo, and  carried to the war-ship. Now she is on her way to Acauhtzin&mdash;to the rebel  Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer  up, old fellow!&rdquo; cried Tim, thumping Jack on the shoulder, with a heavy but  kindly fist. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the colleen back soon. We&rsquo;re all going to fight the  rebels this day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that, Tim? <i>The Bohemian</i>&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  on, Jack! Don Miguel is speaking; he&rsquo;ll tell you all!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Felipe,&rdquo; said Maraquando, removing his sombrero with suave courtesy; &ldquo;in the  name of the Republic of Cholacaca, I have to thank you for the offer of your  ship, and to inform you that the Junta gladly accepts your aid with a thousand  thousand thanks.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  pleasure is mine, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Philip, courteously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Junta, Don Felipe,&rdquo; resumed Don Miguel gravely, &ldquo;desire to know if you can  leave Tlatonac by noon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  Se&ntilde;or. By noon <i>The Bohemian</i> will steam northward. Are you to be of the  party, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret to say I am not, Se&ntilde;or. His Excellency is pleased to consider that I  will be more useful by his side. The message to Xuarez will be delivered by Don  Alonzo Cebrian, the Intendante of the province of Xicotencatl. He will be  accompanied by Colonel Garibay, my son Don Rafael, Captain Velez and about  twenty soldiers. Can your vessel hold such a company, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes. If they don&rsquo;t mind a little discomfort, Don Miguel. <i>The Bohemian</i> is  rather small for such a number.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortunately,  the voyage will not take long,&rdquo; added Jack, thankfully. &ldquo;With myself and you,  Philip, the number tots up to twenty-six passengers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven,  Jack,&rdquo; interposed Tim, quickly &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to miss the fun.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your business, Tim,&rdquo; remonstrated Philip, in alarm, afraid lest Fletcher&rsquo;s  fighting propensities should cause trouble at Acauhtzin. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  isn&rsquo;t this my business, sir? Interview with the rebel leader! It&rsquo;s a fine article  I&rsquo;ll get out of that same, Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  you are, Tim. I&rsquo;ll be glad of your company. But Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  leave him behind, to look after the ladies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Miguel,&rdquo; said Jack, who had been thinking deeply, &ldquo;is the boat of Se&ntilde;or Felipe  to sail under the English or the Cholacacan flag?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the flag of the opal, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, Se&ntilde;or, a few shots will send her to the bottom, as she approaches  Tlatonac. Don Hypolito will suspect treachery and fire on the ship.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  dare not fire on the opal banner, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t trust him. He&rsquo;s a scoundrel,&rdquo; retorted Jack, savagely. &ldquo;Besides, war  is proclaimed, and Xuarez won&rsquo;t want any messages of peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Maraquando,&rdquo; said Philip, gravely, &ldquo;I think it will be best to approach  Acauhtzin under the English flag. When Don Alonzo delivers the message of the  Junta, we can hoist the opal banner.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will speak to his Excellency on the subject, Don Felipe,&rdquo; replied Maraquando, a  trifle haughtily, feeling rather nettled at the implied hint of the opal banner  being treated with disrespect. &ldquo;Meanwhile, you will be ready to start at noon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or; at noon precisely.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  His Excellency and the Junta will be at the sea-gate to see you depart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>After  this, the three Englishmen bowed, and departed to get themselves ready for the  journey to Acauhtzin. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say, Philip! You rather put the old gentleman&rsquo;s back up!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  confound it. I don&rsquo;t want <i>The Bohemian</i> split up into matchwood. Xuarez  will fire on the opal flag; but he&rsquo;ll think twice before he insults the Union  Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  him try,&rdquo; said Tim, grimly; &ldquo;and if I&rsquo;m not kicking my heels at the bottom of  the sea, I&rsquo;ll wire to London about the insult, and bring the British navy like  hornets about his ears. Come, John, my boy! Wake up! We&rsquo;re going to bring back  your darling.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if we can get her from Xuarez,&rdquo; said Jack gloomily; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m terribly  afraid. If any harm has happened to her, I&rsquo;ll kill him. By gad, I&rsquo;ll choke the  life out of him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  help you, Jack,&rdquo; said Philip, earnestly, for his blood boiled at the thought of  Dolores in the grasp of Xuarez; &ldquo;but I think you&rsquo;ll find Dolores can look after  herself. Besides, Xuarez will be too much afraid of his allies, the Indians, to  harm her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must change those fine feathers, boys,&rdquo; said Tim, suddenly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it will never do to let Don Hypolito know you&rsquo;re in this shindy. Afterwards it  doesn&rsquo;t matter; but, with the Union Jack flying, you can&rsquo;t dress as Cholacacan  soldiers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  is right,&rdquo; said Jack, after a pause; &ldquo;we will change our clothes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not our intentions, Jack,&rdquo; said Philip, anxious to keep up his friends&rsquo;  spirits. &ldquo;Dolores or war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Duval, with intense earnestness; &ldquo;with me it is &lsquo;Dolores or death!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII<br>
    Away To The North</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  leave the south, the languid south,<br>
  Its cloudless skies, its weary calms;<br>
  The land of heat, and glare, and drouth,<br>
  Where aloes bloom, and spring the palms.<br>
  There water is the best of alms,<br>
  To cool the ever-parched mouth;<br>
  Oh, with the breezes bearing balms,<br>
  Fly northward from the languid south.</p>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  seek the bitter northern skies,<br>
  Where falls the snow, and blows the sleet;<br>
&lsquo;Mid which the stormy sea-bird cries,<br>
  And circles on its pinions fleet.<br>
  On rocky shores the surges beat,<br>
  And icebergs crystalline arise,<br>
  Life thrills our veins with tropic heat,<br>
  Beneath the bitter northern skies.</p>
  <p>Once  more <i>The Bohemian</i> was breasting the warm waves of the Pacific, and  seemed to rejoice in her freedom like a sentient thing, as she plunged  north-ward to Acauhtzin. The smoke poured black from her wide-mouthed funnel,  the blades of her propeller, lashing the waters to foam, left behind her a long  trail of white, and her sharp nose dipped and fell in the salt brine with every  pulsation of the pistons. Beneath the folds of the Union Jack, streaming in the  wind, were gathered the Englishmen and the Cholacacans, all light-hearted and  hopeful, despite the undoubted peril of their mission. It was no light task to  beard Xuarez in his stronghold, to assert the authority of the Republic in the  teeth of his army. The mission was a valiant one, but foolhardy, and Tim, if no  one else, looked for anything but a peaceful termination to the voyage. </p>
  <p>The  distance to Acauhtzin was something over three hundred miles, and as <i>The  Bohemian</i> was swirling along at the rate of seventeen knots an hour, it was  hoped she would reach her destination in fifteen hours or thereabouts. Owing to  one thing and another, the yacht had not left Tlatonac till close on four o&rsquo;clock  in the afternoon; so, making all allowance for possible accidents and  stoppages, at the rate she was going, Philip calculated that he would fetch the  northern capital about dawn. He did not wish to venture too near the port in  the darkness, as the war-ships were protecting the town, and not seeing the English  ensign, might open fire on his yacht, under the impression that she was an  enemy. With this idea the engines were slowed down during the voyage, and <i>The  Bohemian</i> was timed to enter the port some time before noon of the next day. </p>
  <p>Owing  to the number of people on board (twenty-six souls, in addition to the crew),  it was somewhat difficult to provide all with accommodation. Fortunately,  however, the nights were warm and rainless, so the soldiers made themselves  comfortable on deck, and slept soundly enough, wrapped in their military  cloaks. The sailing-master of <i>The Bohemian</i>, a tough old salt, by name  Simon Benker, growled a good deal at the way in which his spotless decks were  being spoiled, but Philip managed to smooth him down by representing the seriousness  of the situation. Benker submitted with but ill grace. The yacht was the pride  of his life, the darling of his heart, and he had no great love for the  inhabitants of Cholacaca. However, Sir Philip was master, and gave the soldiers  permission to camp out on deck, so Benker was forced to acquiesce in the  arrangement. </p>
  <p>The  ambassadors, in company with the three Englishmen, took up their quarters in  the state-room and cabins. As there were not enough bunks, some of them had to  sleep in the saloon, so the younger members of the party gave up the  sleeping-berths to the elders, and did their best to make shift in a  rough-and-ready fashion. As they sat up late, however, and got up early, this  inconvenienced them but little, and the utmost good humour prevailed above and  below during the voyage. The crew, with the exception of Benker, fraternised  with the soldiers, and their masters entertained the Spanish hidalgos; so,  despite all inconveniences, things went off capitally. Even Jack plucked up his  spirits now that he was on his way to rescue Dolores, and Philip&rsquo;s excellent  brand of champagne had a wonderful effect of keeping the temperament of all up  to what Tim called, &ldquo;concert pitch.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Alonzo Cebrian was a pompous old man, whose every second word was, &ldquo;I, the  Intendante.&rdquo; He was as proud as Lucifer, and never alluded to the rebels save  by the opprobrious names of canalla, ladrons, demonios, all of which terms were  echoed regularly by Captain Velez. This young gentleman, a good-looking  spendthrift, with a rather scampish reputation, played the part of echo to  please the Intendante, whose daughter he wished to marry for her dowry. The  lady was plain, but her father was rich; so Captain Velez was quite willing to  sacrifice his good looks and bachelor freedom on the altar of matrimony,  provided he was well paid for doing so. Don Rafael was in the highest of  spirits at the prospect of seeing Do&ntilde;a carmencita, and kept things going by the  liveliness of his sallies, while Colonel Garibay smoked endless cigarettes and  spoke but little. </p>
  <p>After  an excellent dinner, which was done full justice to by the hungry Spaniards,  they all went on deck, and sat down to smoke and talk. First and foremost, they  all paid Sir Philip handsome compliments about the beauty and speed of <i>The  Bohemian</i>, and then drifted gradually into the one subject of the hour&mdash;the  war with Xuarez&mdash;the embassy to Xuarez&mdash;the certainty of punishing Xuarez. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begad!  Philip,&rdquo; whispered Tim, who was smoking a villainous black clay pipe, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all  Xuarez and nothing else. Is he the only man the Opposidores have?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it appears,&rdquo; replied Philip, leaning back in his chair; &ldquo;the whole row seems to  hinge on Xuarez. Is that not your opinion, Don Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that, mi amigo? I do not understand English.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Xuarez is the only capable man on the side of the Opposidores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ladrons!&rdquo;  interrupted Don Alonzo, with stately spite. &ldquo;I, the Intendante, think  otherwise. Xuarez is clever; but, Se&ntilde;ores, no one is so clever as Tejada!  Canalla!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Canalla!&rdquo;  echoed Velez, removing his cigarette, &ldquo;no one is so clever as Tejada!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Jos&eacute; is being deceived by Xuarez,&rdquo; said Rafael, ruffled at this allusion to his  proposed father-in-law; &ldquo;he is a pompous old fool, and, if he is wise, will  leave Acauhtzin with his family, and place himself under the protection of the  Republic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; replied Garibay, decisively; &ldquo;he is of too much service to  Xuarez. The Opposidores have but little wealth, and Tejada is a rich man.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no matter, Se&ntilde;ores. I, the Intendante, will arrest them both, and carry them in  chains to the Junta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid that will be more difficult than you imagine, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Rafael,  dryly. &ldquo;Xuarez is adored by the townspeople of Acauhtzin. He has a passably  good army, the friendship of the Indians, who are being urged on to war by that  prophetic opal, and a capital fleet. With all these at his command, he would be  a fool to yield at the mere reading of a decree. No. This war will be a long  one&mdash;a difficult one&mdash;and it is doubtful if, in the end, Don Hypolito will not  conquer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Garibay  frowned, and looked sternly at the young man. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  your sympathies with the Opposidores, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means. I see in Xuarez a possible tyrant, an unscrupulous scoundrel; but I  am not so blinded as to overlook his talents. Already he has scored heavily  against us. The securing of the fleet, the gaining of Acauhtzin to his  interest, and all without a blow. Believe me, Colonel, I speak truly when I say  Xuarez is a foe to be dreaded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will not dare to defy the decree of the Republic,&rdquo; said the Intendante,  pompously. &ldquo;When I read this,&rdquo; added Don Alonzo, tapping his breast pocket,  where lay the official paper, &ldquo;he will yield.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;  echoed Velez, parrot-like, &ldquo;he will yield. Carambo! He dare not defy Don Alonzo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Xuarez is a second Montezuma, to yield in the presence of his army,  Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; cried Rafael, vehemently. &ldquo;I tell you no! Were he alone, he would  resist arrest. How much more so, then, when supported by the devotion of  hundreds. I am a true subject of the Republic; I hate, dread, and scorn Don  Hypolito. But I do not despise him. He will be the Napoleon of Cholacaca. Let  the Republic beware!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  bah!&rdquo; said Colonel Garibay, while Don Alonzo snorted with indignation. &ldquo;Xuarez  may be a clever man; but he is no general. Why, he does not even make the first  move!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he bides his time. When he does move, Tlatonac will hear of it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean, he will bombard the city?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and no! I will explain. Excuse me one moment, Se&ntilde;ores. I go for a map of the  country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Rafael ran down to the cabin; and during his absence the Intendante and Captain  Velez scoffed at the idea that Xuarez would be a dangerous enemy. They had a  duet in a braggadocio vein. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will yield, Se&ntilde;ores, when I read this decree.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  troops of Tlatonac alone can crush him,&rdquo; added Velez, confidently. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will swallow these rebels at a mouthful. I, the Intendante, say so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  war will be a mere military promenade!&rdquo; said his echo. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  said the French at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war,&rdquo; interjected  Philip, grimly, &ldquo;but they made a mistake. What is your opinion, Colonel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with Don Rafael,&rdquo; replied Garibay, slowly &ldquo;I am by no means inclined to  undervalue our opponent. Xuarez is as cunning as Satan, and as ambitious. His  first moves in this war have resulted to his own advantage; therefore I am not  so confident of a speedy termination to this campaign as are these gentlemen.  Fire-crackers, such as reading a decree will not frighten a man like Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you think this journey useless?&rdquo; asked Jack, who was of much the same opinion  himself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,  Se&ntilde;ors. I believe we are on the eve of a terrible struggle, and to whom will  result the advantage I know not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  all the Junta were as faint-hearted as yourself and Don Rafael, we would yield  without a blow,&rdquo; said the Intendante, bitterly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  a blow,&rdquo; from Velez, in the same tone! &ldquo;Carambo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wrong, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; cried the Colonel, with fiery earnestness, &ldquo;I am not  faint-hearted. I will fight against Xuarez to the last. But is it wise to scoff  at this man as you are doing? I tell you he is a master-spirit, such as rises  once in a century, and, as such, is all-powerful, even against the great power  of the Republic. He is one of those men who change the destinies of nations. A  Napoleon, a Garibaldi, a Washington. From my soul, Se&ntilde;ores, I trust we shall  win, and save the Republic; but it is as well to look on both sides of the  question. Blind security is not wise. Por todos Santos, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; cried Garibay,  rising to his feet in his excitement, &ldquo;see how this man has already succeeded.  Acauhtzin, the most important town next to the capital, is in his hands, our  fleet has gone over entirely to his side; and have you forgotten the treachery  of Marina and Pepe. A full plan of the fortifications of Tlatonac is before  him. If he can do this much, he can do more. Till the end, I shall support the  Republic, and resist a possible Dictator; but do not sneer at Xuarez! I tell  you he is a great man!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was an unexampled outburst for the ordinarily calm Colonel, and he sank back in  his chair with a look of agitation on his usually impassive face. The  Intendante and Velez were for the moment impressed; yet, soon recovering their  obstinate belief in the invulnerability of the Republic, would have replied,  but that at this moment Don Rafael made his appearance with a small map. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  pardon, Se&ntilde;ores, that I have been so long!&rdquo; apologised Rafael, sitting down  promptly, and spreading out the map on his own and Philip&rsquo;s knees. &ldquo;Look, now,  mis amigos, and I will tell you how this campaign will be conducted!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know, Se&ntilde;or? Are you in the confidence of Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a gentleman, no traitor!&rdquo; replied Rafael, haughtily, to the insulting  question of the Intendante. &ldquo;I know something of Don Hypolito&rsquo;s plans, because  he spoke of them to Don Jos&eacute; de Tejada. Before the revolt of the fleet, I was a  visitor at the house of that gentleman, and so learned much. Had Don Jos&eacute; known  that I would remain true to the Republic, he would have been more cautious. As  it was, he spoke sufficiently clearly to let me understand the broad outlines  of the campaign as designed by Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said the Intendante, politely, &ldquo;I ask your pardon, Don Rafael. And this plan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo;  said Rafael, tracing with his finger the various points; &ldquo;here is  Acauhtzin&mdash;there Tlatonac!&mdash;and at the extreme south you see Janjalla! This last  town will be attacked first.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the reason?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrai!  can you not see, Se&ntilde;or Garibay? Between Tlatonac and Acauhtzin are nothing but  mountains&mdash;no roads, no open spaces. All giant hills, terrible precipices, a few  paths made by Indians, and inhospitable deserts, where the land happens to be  flat for a few miles. How then can Xuarez convey his army to the capital in  that direction?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true! And most of his soldiers are dragoons.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  he could attack Tlatonac with Indians who are used to their rugged country; but  savages, as Xuarez well knows, can do little or nothing against trained troops.  In conjunction with his own army, they can do something; but, alone, they are  almost useless. Bueno! You see he, will not attack from the north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why attack Janjalla instead of Tlatonac?&rdquo; asked Tim, who was anxiously  following this discussion, pencil and note-book in hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  to the south,&rdquo; replied Don Rafael, promptly. &ldquo;No mountains between Janjalla and  Tlatonac&mdash;nothing but rich plains&mdash;broad spaces on which armies can man&oelig;uvre.  Now, if Xuarez conveys his troops by the war-ships south to Janjalla, he can  bombard and perhaps take that city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  the Intendante, deny that!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible  to take Janjalla,&rdquo; echoed Velez, nodding his head wisely. </p>
  <p>Rafael  shrugged his shoulders. It was next to impossible to argue with these obstinate  people who would only look at one side of the question. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will grant that Janjalla falls into the power of Xuarez,&rdquo; said Garibay,  impatiently; &ldquo;and afterwards?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo;  resumed the young man, &ldquo;Xuarez will garrison the town, and concentrate all his  troops there.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thus  leaving Acauhtzin open to attack,&rdquo; said Jack, satirically. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means. The war-ships will prevent our troops getting to that town. We cannot  get to it by land, and the sea will be blockaded by the rebel fleet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  the torpederas&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  unless the torpederas arrive,&rdquo; replied Rafael significantly; &ldquo;but it is  doubtful as to whether the Junta or Xuarez will get them. However, I am only  supposing all these things being in favour of the Opposidores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  We will look at the matter from Don Hypolito&rsquo;s point of view,&rdquo; said Philip,  quietly. &ldquo;His troops are concentrated at Janjalla. Between that town and  Tlatonac are open plains&mdash;and,&rdquo; added Philip, dryly, &ldquo;the armies of the  Republic!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  But let us presume, for the sake of argument, that Xuarez makes three  simultaneous attacks. With his regular army on the plains, with the Indians  from the north on Tlatonac&mdash;and from the sea by a bombardment from the  war-ships.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  muttered Garibay, biting his fingers; &ldquo;that man is a general.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  troops of the Republic will conquer everywhere,&rdquo; said Don Alonzo, gravely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everywhere!&rdquo;  repeated his umbra. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is to be hoped so, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Tim, significantly, &ldquo;the Republic will need  all the help she can get to defend herself in three places at once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my opinion,&rdquo; observed Rafael, calmly, &ldquo;there is only one way to end the war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  a naval victory. The Junta must secure the torpederas. We must have more  war-ships, and cripple Don Hypolito&rsquo;s power on the sea. Then he will be unable  to convey his troops to Janjalla&mdash;unable to bombard Tlatonac, and remain shut up  in Acauhtzin, where we can crush him at our leisure.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Garibay  disagreed with this view of the matter, and accused Rafael of looking solely at  the matter from a naval point of view. A hot discussion ensued, in which every  possible attack, repulse, strategy, and battle, was talked over far into the  night. Philip and Jack grew weary of this incessant argument, and slipped down  to the saloon, where they chatted about Dolores. Overhead they heard the  hot-tempered Spaniards arguing fiercely, and several times thought they would  come to blows so warm grew the discussion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Egad,  Jack! I&rsquo;m glad this voyage ends to-morrow,&rdquo; said Philip, as they turned in, &ldquo;or  they will certainly murder one another.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  grunt was Jack&rsquo;s unsatisfactory reply. He was, almost asleep, and already  dreaming of rescuing Dolores from the clutches of Don Hypolito. </p>
  <p>After  a time, those on deck grew tired of such unprofitable talk, and one by one came  down to snatch a few hours&rsquo; sleep. In the space of fifteen minutes everyone was  snoring, and the yacht flew northward with her cargo of sleeping men. Benker  was in charge of the wheel, and as he had been in these waters years before,  knew every inch of the coast. Keeping the boat about a mile from the shore, he  headed her straight for Acauhtzin, which was many miles away, in the curve of  the land where it stretched eastward into the Carribean Sea. </p>
  <p>It  was a perfectly calm night. Stars and moon, a placid sea, and the yacht  swirling through the liquid plain with a slight roll. To the right, the  infinite expanse of the waters heaving against the horizon; to the left, the  long, low line of the coast, with its dim masses of foliage, and here and there  a snow-clad mountain peak. Benker twirled the wheel, chewed his quid, and  looked every now and then in disgust at the sleeping forms of the soldiers  encumbering the white decks of the yacht. Moonlight and starlight, the throb of  the screw, the singing of the wind through the rigging, and the hiss of the  waves seething past; it was wonderfully beautiful. The boat sped onward like a  shadow amid a world of shadows, and the most prosaic soul would have been  touched by the profound beauty of this watery world. Not so Simon Benker. He was  used to it all, and regarded nothing but his work and the soldiers. </p>
  <p>Then  the east began to palpitate with the coming dawn. Lines of dim light low down  on the horizon&mdash;yellow bands which melted to pale green, and flushed to delicate  rose colours. Higher and higher the coming day dyed the sky in opaline hues,  the stars fled westward, the wan moon paling before this fierce splendour, hid  her face behind a bank of clouds. The dark world of waters became tinged with  rainbow hues, then one thick yellow shaft of light smote the zenith with heavy  brilliance. Ray after ray shot out like the spokes of a wheel, and suddenly the  intolerable glory of the sun leaped from the nether world. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo;  said Jack to Philip, who had come on deck to see the sunrise, &ldquo;yonder, my boy,  is the Harlequin Opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it is as brilliant and as many-tinted as that,&rdquo; replied the baronet, staring at  the gorgeous sky and sea, &ldquo;it must, indeed, be a wonderful gem. Benker, how is  she going?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no soul,&rdquo; said Duval, turning away. &ldquo;I am going down to have a tub.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  thereupon vanished again, was shortly followed by Philip, after he had  satisfied himself that <i>The Bohemian</i> had done good work during the hours  of darkness. Afterwards they awoke their sleeping companions, and had breakfast,  when the Spaniards were introduced to several English dishes, of which they  approved greatly. </p>
  <p>The  heavens were now a pale turquoise blue, the sun mounting towards the zenith was  already beginning to burn hotly, and all were assembled on deck impatiently  waiting to catch sight of their destination. Here and there on the green shore,  amid the forests they could see Indian settlements, and at times light canoes  skimmed the surface of the waves. Towards eleven o&rsquo;clock a white spot appeared  on the land straight ahead. Don Rafael, who was standing by Philip, touched the  young man&rsquo;s arm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Acauhtzin!&rdquo;  he said, cheerfully; &ldquo;we will be there in the hour.&rdquo; Philip looked at his  watch. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  left Tlatonac at four yesterday. We will reach Acauhtzin at twelve to-day.  Three hundred miles in twenty hours. That is not bad for slow steaming. Had I  kept her at full speed, she would have done it in fifteen!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim,  who had his glass up, gave an exclamation of surprise. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it, Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  war-ships are lying in the harbour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought as much,&rdquo; replied Philip, calmly; &ldquo;we will have to run the blockade.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim  pointed upward to the Union Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they fire on that,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;Xuarez is not the clever man I take him to  be. What do you say, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo;  repeated Jack, who was looking ahead with clenched fists, &ldquo;that one of those  three ships is <i>The Pizarro</i>, and that Dolores is on board.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV<br>
    Acauhtzin</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Here,  where mingle rocks and sands,<br>
    Phantom-like the city stands,<br>
    Looming vague and ghostly pale,<br>
    Through the dawning&rsquo;s misty veil.<br>
    Day and night, and night and day,<br>
    At the foot of ramparts grey;<br>
    Just a stone-throw up the shore<br>
    Ever-hungry surges roar,<br>
    As they would rejoice to tear<br>
    From her heights that city fair,<br>
    Where, engirt by forests green,<br>
    Proud she sits, a laurelled queen;<br>
    Dim the mighty fabric gleams,<br>
    As thought-built in magic dreams,<br>
  &lsquo;Tis some palace city hoary,<br>
    Famed in song for golden glory,<br>
    Which, at dawn, will fade away,<br>
    In the traitor light of day.</p>
  <p>The  city of Acauhtzin was not unlike the capital in appearance, though it differed  from Tlatonac in being built on a projecting point of land, instead of on a  hill. On either side were mountains, partially enclosing a deep basin, wherein  the war-ships were anchored, and on a tongue of rock jutting into the centre of  this pool the city was built. The walls white and glistening, arose sheer from  the rocky cliffs and above them only a few steeples and towers could be seen.  The walls encompassing the tongue of rock formed a kind of citadel, and then ran  along the inshore for some distance on each side, terminating in well-defended  forts. At the back of the city arose a high mountain, clothed with green  forests, from amidst which a mighty peak of snow shot up grandly into the blue  sky. </p>
  <p>Philip  saw all this when the yacht was some distance away, and at once pronounced his  opinion of the place. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like Valetta,&rdquo; he said, handing the glass to Jack. &ldquo;The city is built, on a  tongue of land, the walls rise in the same precipitous fashion, and there are  harbours on either side. Were it not for that mighty peak, and the mountains to  right and left, it would be the Valetta of the old world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>On  the flag-tower of the principal fort floated the banner of the insurgent  leader, the same in all respects as that of the Republic, save that the colour  was red instead of yellow. The Harlequin Opal was so interwoven with the  history and superstitions of the Cholacacans that Xuarez could not afford to  dispense with so powerful a symbol, and on the crimson ground of the flag  gleamed the representation of the stone, shooting its myriad rays. At the  entrance of the harbour were anchored two heavily armed war-ships, which Don  Rafael recognised as <i>The Cortes</i> and <i>The Columbus</i>. His own vessel, <i>The Pizarro</i>, lay further in to the shore, almost across the gate which  pierced the wall of the great fort, and gave admission to the city. </p>
  <p>With  the Union Jack flying at her masthead <i>The Bohemian</i> steamed boldly into  the harbour between the threatening bulk of the two men-of-war. Through their  glasses, those on board the yacht could see there was much excitement at her  unexpected appearance both on the ships and on shore. A crowd of people poured  out of the gate like a swarm of bees, as <i>The Bohemian</i>, slowing down her  engines, swung gracefully to anchor beside <i>The Pizarro</i>. Just as she  cleared the war-ships at the entrance, a puff of smoke broke from the black  sides of <i>The Cortes</i>, whereat Tim uttered an exclamation of rage. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  insulting the flag they are!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Blank cartridge,&rdquo; replied Philip, shrewdly; &ldquo;they are saluting the Union Jack.  Don Hypolito evidently wants to stand well with England. See, they are dipping  their flags.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  three war-ships lowered their pennants for a moment, in salutation to the  English flag, and then ran them up again to the masthead. Philip had by this  time brought <i>The Bohemian</i> directly under the guns of the forts; so that,  in any event, she would be safe. The forts could not depress their guns  sufficiently to damage her, and the war-ships would not dare to fire lest they  should injure the ramparts of the town. </p>
  <p>Making  everything safe by this artful man&oelig;uvre Philip, with the sanction of Don  Alonzo, hauled down the Union Jack, to hoist the Republican banner. At first  the forts thought the English ship was responding to their salute, and several  guns thundered a welcome to the stranger, while the crowd on the shore cheered  lustily. All these greetings, however, were changed to cries of anger when the  yellow banner of Tlatonac flew up to the masthead of <i>The Bohemian</i>. Without  doubt, had the yacht been outside, the war-ships would have opened fire on this  audacious vessel, to make her pay for such insolence; but Philip, being safe  under the walls of the fort, could fly the flag with impunity. </p>
  <p>The  crowd on the beach and wharf roared with rage, as they saw the hated ensign,  and recognised the fact that by this audacious piece of strategy a band of  their enemies had gained admission into the very heart of their harbour. Had  those on shore been able to get on board <i>The Bohemian</i> it would have gone  ill with Philip and his friends; but, fortunately, the yacht had cast anchor  some distance away, by the side of <i>The Pizarro</i>. The crew of the war-ship  lined the side of their vessel to look at the daring intruder, and seeing this,  Don Rafael, suppressing all outward signs of rage, swore fluently to himself as  he recognised the renegades. </p>
  <p>In  a remarkably short space of time, a boat with the rebel flag hanging over its  stern pulled out from the shore, and in a few minutes came alongside <i>The  Bohemian</i>. A ladder was thrown over at once, and there stepped on deck Don  Jos&eacute; de Tejada, accompanied by a few officers. He recognised Don Alonzo and his  friends at once, for they had been intimates of his before the outbreak of this  fratricidal war. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Rafael! Don Alonzo,&rdquo; said Tejada, in astonishment. &ldquo;What is the meaning of  this, Se&ntilde;ores? and how have you the hardihood to display the flag of Tlatonac  under the guns of Acauhtzin?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  the Intendante, with these gentlemen, have come hither on a mission to Don  Hypolito Xuarez from the Junta of Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you would make peace. The Junta fears the result of an appeal to arms.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo,  no!&rdquo; cried Garibay, clapping his hand to his sword. &ldquo;The Junta fears nothing;  much less the rebel Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware,  Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Tejada, as several of his officers muttered angrily; &ldquo;I cannot  protect you, if thus you speak of our honoured President.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;President!&rdquo;  cried Rafael, in a rage. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the President of Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Francisco Gomez is President?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the will of the aristocrats,&rdquo; said Don Jos&eacute; fiercely; &ldquo;but Don Hypolito Xuarez  is President by the will of the people.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough  of this,&rdquo; exclaimed the Intendante, waving his hand; &ldquo;we are here under a flag  of truce. Even you, Se&ntilde;or, must respect that. We will deliver our message to  Xuarez, and depart unharmed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as Don Hypolito wills it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  pardon, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; interposed Philip, taking off his yachting cap; &ldquo;this is an  English vessel, and as such you dare not seize her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  recognise no vessel as English under those colours,&rdquo; said Tejada, fiercely,  pointing to the opal banner. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  I will endeavour to remove your prejudice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  another moment Philip had given orders to Benker, and the Union Jack was flying  at the other masthead. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must respect our neutrality now, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Jos&eacute; bit his lip, and turning to one of his officers, gave an order. The  soldier bowed, dropped over the side of the yacht, and went ashore in the boat. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have sent to tell Don Hypolito that an embassy has come from Tlatonac,&rdquo; said  Tejada, addressing the Intendante with marked coldness; &ldquo;in ten or fifteen  minutes you shall know his decision.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must receive us, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt; but the question is, will he let you depart?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the law of nations, which recognises the white flag, he must let us go as we  came, unharmed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you not sailed under the English ensign, you would not have got into the  harbour so easily. This boat would be now sunk by the guns of <i>The Cortes</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought as much,&rdquo; said Philip, easily; &ldquo;therefore I flew a flag which even you  had to respect.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  may I ask, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; sneered Don Jos&eacute;, with elaborate politeness, &ldquo;under which  flag you sail? the English, the Opal, or the White?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under  the white,&rdquo; replied Garibay, promptly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  Then lower those two banners, and run up the white flag.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see you hanged first!&rdquo; retorted Philip, bluntly. &ldquo;This is an English vessel,  and I defy you to touch it or the flag.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tejada  blushed red with rage, for he knew that Xuarez, anxious to stand well in his  quarrel with the great nations of Europe, would not dare to insult the Union  Jack. In fact, seeing that the deputation had arrived in an English vessel,  Tejada was well assured in his own mind that it would be received and sent away  with the utmost courtesy, let their message from the Junta be galling as it  might be. Xuarez was no barbarian, and in any case would have treated a flag of  truce with honour, but the presence of these English gentlemen, of this English  ship, put the matter beyond all doubt. </p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances, Tejada was unable to reply to Sir Philip; but suppressing  his wrath with a great effort, bowed politely and turned away. As he did so,  Don Rafael sprang forward, as also did Jack, both eager to learn if Dolores was  in the town. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will speak, amigo,&rdquo; said Rafael, hurriedly to Jack. &ldquo;I know Don Jos&eacute;, as my  private friend, though public enemy; he will answer me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  servant, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; remarked Tejada, stiffly, finding himself face to face with  Don Rafael. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  said the young man, taking off his sombrero with ceremonious politeness, &ldquo;we  are enemies because we follow different leaders; but I implore you, by the  friendship which once existed between us, to answer a question I would ask.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,  Se&ntilde;or! You were ever welcome at my table, in time of peace. As you say, we are  now enemies; but God forbid that this unhappy war should banish all courtesies  between gentlemen. What question do you wish to put, Se&ntilde;or? It shall be  answered.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my cousin&mdash;is Do&ntilde;a Dolores at Acauhtzin?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tejada  started, and seemed much surprised. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando, she is not here. Why ask me such a strange question?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  here!&rdquo; cried Jack, who also knew Tejada well; &ldquo;but she must be here, Se&ntilde;or  Tejada; she has been carried off from Tlatonac, taken on board yonder vessel,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing  to <i>The Pizarro</i>&mdash;&rdquo;and is now in Acauhtzin with Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear to you, Se&ntilde;or Duval, that you wrong us. You wrong Don Hypolito,&rdquo; replied  Don Jos&eacute;, earnestly. &ldquo;I am aware that our leader loves Do&ntilde;a Dolores, and  desires to marry her, but he would not carry her off so basely. No, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  continued Tejada, proudly; &ldquo;we are men of honour, we do not make war on women.  When Don Hypolito conquers, he will ask for the honour of Do&ntilde;a Dolores&rsquo; hand in  due form. She is not here, I swear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Heavens!&rdquo; cried Jack, in despair. &ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; said Rafael, eagerly, &ldquo;I know you to be a man of honour. I do not doubt  your word; but I feel sure that my cousin is here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not say that you know, or are deceiving me,&rdquo; went on Rafael, rapidly. &ldquo;But  look you, Don Jos&eacute;. There is a zambo called Pepe, who acted as a spy for your  party at Tlatonac. The other night he decoyed my cousin from the cathedral on  board <i>The Pizarro</i>. A fisherman saw Pepe rowing to the war-ship, with a  female in his boat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  That is so,&rdquo; interrupted Tejada, bluntly; &ldquo;but the woman was a poblana&mdash;one  Marina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marina!&rdquo;  cried Duval, savagely. &ldquo;Then I have been tricked. We have all been wrong! Do&ntilde;a  Dolores must be with the Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust, Se&ntilde;or, your fears are groundless; but if Do&ntilde;a Dolores is with the  Indians, she will be quite safe. They reverence her as the guardian of the  Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Don Hypolito know anything about the Indians?&rdquo; asked Rafael, hurriedly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  question, Se&ntilde;or, I am not at liberty to answer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Rafael  cast one swift and penetrating glance at the impassive face of the old man, and  turned away with a suppressed oath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrai!&rdquo;  he muttered, fiercely, to Philip, who stood by, a silent spectator. &ldquo;I believe  Xuarez is in league with the Indians, and has made them carry her off. If she  is not here, she is at that hidden temple; but, in either case, Don Hypolito is  mixed up with the case.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my humble opinion, she is at Acauhtzin,&rdquo; said Philip, quietly. &ldquo;Don Jos&eacute; does  not know all the black dealings of Xuarez&rsquo;s heart. Cheer up, my dear Jack, we  will soon see Don Hypolito, and wring the truth from him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  muttered something indistinctly, and turned away, whereon Philip, taking him  kindly by the arm, led him down to the saloon, with the intention of giving him  such consolation as he was able. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she is here, Xuarez must know,&rdquo; said Philip, earnestly; &ldquo;and if he knows, he  will not be able to deceive me. I can read most faces, and it will be strange  indeed if Don Hypolito&rsquo;s is the first to baffle me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Jos&eacute; denies everything.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  because Don Jos&eacute; knows nothing. That old man is a pompous old ass, like the  Intendante. Many things could take place under his nose without his being any the  wiser. Drink this glass of wine, my dear lad, and keep up your spirits. We will  find Dolores yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Duval  was so overcome by the loss of Dolores that he submitted to Philip&rsquo;s orders  like a child, and obediently drank the wine poured out for him. In most  emergencies, Jack would have been ready to act at once with a cool head, and  iron nerve; but Dolores was very dear to him, and her loss had rendered him  useless for the moment&mdash;in other words, the shock had paralysed his will. </p>
  <p>After  Philip had succeeded in putting some heart into the poor fellow, he insisted on  his coming on deck, and they ascended thereto just in time to see the return of  the officer sent by Tejada to Don Hypolito. The messenger walked straight up to  Don Jos&eacute;, and gave the reply of Xuarez, on hearing which, Tejada turned towards  the waiting Intendante. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  Excellency Don Hypolito Xuarez will see you at his palace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Alonzo almost choked with rage at hearing these terms applied to a rebel like  Xuarez, but managed to bow with tolerably good grace. He moved towards the side  of the yacht, and scrambled down into the boat in a somewhat ungraceful fashion  for an ambassador. Colonel Garibay, Don Rafael, and the Englishmen followed,  together with Tejada and his staff. </p>
  <p>Tim,  who had been fraternising with the rebels, showed his note-book to Jack, filled  with shorthand notes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got no end of information,&rdquo; he said gleefully; &ldquo;and when I get back to  Tlatonac, it goes to the <i>Morning Planet</i> straight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if we ever do get back,&rdquo; said Jack, gloomily. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course we will, you pessimist; and, what&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;ll take back Do&ntilde;a Dolores  with us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think she is here, then, after all?&rdquo; asked Duval, with reviving hope. </p>
  <p>Tim  winked in a vulgar fashion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  word in your ear, Jack,&rdquo; he said, jerking his head in the direction of the  pompous Tejada. &ldquo;That old man&rsquo;s a liar. The pretty colleen is here, and Don  Jos&eacute; knows it? but she&rsquo;s not with Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  where do you think she is?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Rafael&rsquo;s sweetheart, no less; the old man&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Carmencita?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  hit it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  would have questioned Tim further, so as to learn his grounds for such a  belief, but just then the boat touched the stone steps of the wharf. The  embassy stepped ashore, and waited till the soldiers of Tlatonac arrived. Don  Alonzo, with a due regard for the dignity of the Republic, refused to move  until his bodyguard came on shore. In a few minutes, the soldiers landed, under  the command of Captain Velez, and thus escorted, the ambassador of the Republic  moved slowly forward, beneath the mighty arch which led into the heart of the  rebel capital. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  got in, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; whispered Rafael to Philip with sudden doubt; &ldquo;but I hope we  shall be able to get out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  pointed back to the Union Jack, which could be seen in the distance at the  yacht&rsquo;s masthead. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  that flag is there I have no fear, Don Rafael.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV<br>
    Don Hypolito Xuarez</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">A  visionary? Wherefore not? All men<br>
    Who change the world are dreamers in their youth.<br>
    Thought comes before fulfilment!&mdash;in the earth,<br>
    The hidden seedling hints the future flower!<br>
    So is it with this man! For years his brain<br>
    Hath dallied with a thousand fantasies,<br>
    Which had no being save within himself.<br>
    But now his dreams take shape!&mdash;with purpose firm,<br>
    He aids their due fulfilment, till therefrom<br>
    New heavens and earth are formed, and ancient things<br>
    Crashing to ruin, as foundations serve<br>
    Whereon to build earth&rsquo;s future destinies.</p>
  <p>There  was no doubt that Don Hypolito laid due stress on ceremonial observances as  necessary to consolidate his pretensions. On the ground that Gomez had broken  the constitutional rules by which he held his position, Xuarez proclaimed  himself saviour and President of the Cholacacan Republic. Not being in  possession of Tlatonac, he constituted Acauhtzin his capital for the time  being, and there assumed all the airs of a ruler. He called himself by the  title of President, his personal staff and intimate friends constituted a kind  of revolutionary Junta, and the building in which this illegal assemblage met for  conference was dignified with the name of the Palacio Nacional. In all respects  the machinery of the lawful Government was copied at Acauhtzin, and that town  was regarded by the Opposidores as the true capital of the country until such  time as Xuarez should enforce his pretensions by marching in triumph into the  head city of the Republic. As in the Middle Ages two Popes ruled&mdash;the one at  Rome, the other at Avignon&mdash;so the allegiance of Cholacaca was claimed by two  Presidents: Gomez at Tlatonac, Xuarez at Acauhtzin. </p>
  <p>The  extraordinary man who avowed himself the saviour of his country possessed in a  marked degree that power of dominating all with whom he came in contact by the  personal charm of his manner. This d&aelig;monic influence is a peculiar  characteristic of all great men, without which they could not hope to  accomplish their missions. Napoleon changed the map of Europe, Mahomet created  a religion, C&aelig;sar consolidated the Roman Empire, Luther tore half the civilised  world from the grip of ecclesiastical Rome. These great events sprang in the  first instance from the strong personality of the men who accomplished them,  hence the performance of what appear to be miracles. Don Hypolito Xuarez, son  of a Spanish adventurer and an Indian woman, possessed this d&aelig;monic influence,  and gifted with such power, arose from obscurity to the full glory of supreme  power. Nowhere was his authority more noticeable than in Acauhtzin. Years  before a political adventurer, he had been accepted by the people of that town  as their deputy to the Junta. Acauhtzin, always jealous of the superiority of  Tlatonac, was desirous that the seat of Government should be transferred  thither from the city of the opal. This ambition was fostered by the crafty  Xuarez, who saw therein a safe way of gaining the love of the northern capital.  After he had accused Gomez in the Junta of breaking the rules of the  constitution, he came northward to claim the protection of his constituents, a  protection which was freely accorded to one who had their interests so much at  heart. </p>
  <p>Cunning  Don Hypolito saw his position and how he could better it. Casting all his  fortunes on one bold stroke, he assembled the townspeople in the great plaza,  and harangued them with all his marvellous powers of oratory. Gomez had tampered  with the sacred constitution of Cholacaca. Gomez was therefore unworthy to  occupy the Presidential chair. One man alone could save the country, that man  was himself. Let them throw in their fortunes with his, and resort to arms to enforce  his elevation to the supreme power. Then he would transfer the seat of  Government from Tlatonac to Acauhtzin, and the northern port would become the  greatest city in Central America. Dazzled by this vision, the townspeople  elected Don Hypolito President with enthusiasm, and vowed to stand by him to  the end. That end they never for a moment doubted would be victory over the  established Government, and the transference of the seat of power from Tlatonac  to Acauhtzin. They firmly believed in Don Hypolito as the man of the future,  and when, by a skilful stroke of diplomacy, he secured the support of the  Regimiento de Huitzilopochtli and of the fleet, his triumph was complete. He  who could do so much could do more! The admiring townsfolk swore by the  brilliant adventurer, and when the message carried by Don Alonzo arrived at the  northern capital, the crafty Mestizo was the idol of the populace. The ironical  part of the whole affair was that he had no intention of fulfiling any promises  made to his trusting constituents. </p>
  <p>Jack,  owing to his long residence in Tlatonac, was already acquainted with Xuarez,  but both Tim and Philip were exceedingly curious to behold this man, of whom  they had heard so much, and who seemed to hold the destinies of the Republic in  the hollow of his hand. In the Great hall of the Palacio Nacional (so called)  they beheld him for the first time, waiting to receive the emissaries of the  Government. Surrounded by a brilliant throng of officers, he alone was plainly  dressed, no uniform, no gaudy tints, no decorations, yet his personality raised  him high above those by whom he was encircled. The supporters of Xuarez were  mediocrites; Xuarez himself was a great man. </p>
  <p>The  revolutionary leader was small of stature, ungraceful in appearance; his legs  were short, his body was long, so that he rather waddled than walked. At first  sight this ungainly figure, this ungraceful gait, was apt to bring a smile to  the lips of the onlooker, but that smile faded before the grand countenance  surmounting the misshapen frame. It was as though the head of a Greek statue  had been, by mistake, joined on to the body of a Polynesian idol; the first was  so noble, the latter so grotesque. A Roman head, such as tradition ascribes to  the C&aelig;sars, a Napoleonic face, calm, powerful, terrible as the impassive  countenance of the Sphinx. Broad forehead, prominent nose, large eyes, full of  fire and determination; no beard or moustache to hide the contour of the  cheeks, the strong curve of the mouth, a skin of marble whiteness, and the  whole surmounted by masses of waving hair, dark as the eyes beneath. Such faces  are seen on the coins of the C&aelig;sars, on the painted walls of Egyptian tombs, on  the carven walls of Assyrian palaces. They belong alone to kings, to heroes, to  conquerors. Nature marks her great men thus. When such faces of terrible calm  appear at intervals of centuries, mankind trembles, they recognise the scourges  of God, destined to whelm the world in waves of blood. Philip came to see  Xuarez&mdash;he looked, and lo! Napoleon. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  struggle is unequal,&rdquo; he whispered to Jack, as Don Alonzo unrolled his papers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Duval, in the same tone. &ldquo;His force is too weak to stand against the  power of the Junta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  smiled scornfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can the Junta do against that face?&rdquo; he said, contemptuously. &ldquo;There stands the  greatest man in Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n  him,&rdquo; muttered the engineer, fiercely, &ldquo;he has carried off Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence,  boys,&rdquo; growled Tim, in a voice of subdued thunder, &ldquo;the Don&rsquo;s speaking.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  Intendante was not a particularly brave man, and hardly liked the position in  which he now found himself. His mission had appeared to be great and grand and  glorious at Tlatonac! but now it assumed quite a different complexion. To utter  threats against the rebel Xuarez, when in the society of friends, was one  thing; to order the followers of the revolutionary President to give him up to  punishment, in the middle of his army, was another. Don Alonzo Cebrian hummed  and hawed, and cleared his throat, to get down a nasty lump which impeded his  speech. Don Hypolito saw his confusion, but said nothing, he did not even  smile, but sat serenely in his chair, impenetrable as the Sphinx. At last the  Intendante screwed up his courage and delivered the decree of the  Junta&mdash;sufficiently badly, it is true&mdash;still, he delivered it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the legally qualified representative of the Junta of Cholacaca, in congress  assembled, I hereby order those in arms against the Republic to surrender to  the Government, and to deliver up for punishment the body of the rebel, Hypolito  Xuarez, for&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  did not finish his sentence. A low murmur of rage arose from the supporters of  the rebel leader, and, half-drawing their swords, they looked towards Xuarez  for authority to cut down the daring man who had thus insulted him in the midst  of his army. Don Alonzo turned pale at the sight of the half-bared weapons, and  shrank back among his friends; but Xuarez, leaning his chin on his hand, stared  steadily before him and waited. Seeing this impassive demeanour, which he was  not clever enough to know was more dangerous than an outburst of rage, Don  Alonzo regained his spirits. A more unfitted diplomatist than Cebrian could  scarcely have been chosen. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  need not speak at any great length,&rdquo; he said, rapidly. &ldquo;The orders of his  Excellency Francisco Gomez are that the town of Acauhtzin surrender to the  Government, deliver up the rebel Xuarez for punishment, and submit to the  clemency of the Junta. If this is done at once, the Junta will be lenient; if  not, the opal standard will be unfurled, and all the inhabitants of Acauhtzin  will be treated as rebels. This is the decree of Don Francisco Gomez on the  part of the Junta of Cholacaca, delivered by myself the Intendante of  Xicotencatl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then,  Cebrian, having delivered his message sufficiently badly, rolled up his papers  with the air of a man who has done his duty, and waited the reply of the rebel  leader. All those on the side of Xuarez frowned heavily, but made no  demonstration of wrath at the insolence of the message. They waited to hear Don  Hypolito speak. The Mestizo arose to his feet, and addressed himself, not to  the emissaries of the Republic, but to his own supporters. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;  he said, in a singularly mellow and powerful voice, &ldquo;you hear the decree of the  so-called Junta of Cholacaca. Lest you should mistake the purport of the  message delivered by Don Alonzo Cebrian, I will repeat it shortly. You are to  lay down your arms, surrender my body to the Junta, and trust to the tender  mercies of your rivals of Tlatonac for judgment. These are the conditions,  which, if not accepted, will bring on us the thunderbolts of war from a  Government who have not a navy, and scarce an army. Your answer?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Hitherto  he had spoken in a low tone, clear and distinct, but distinguished by no  oratorical fire. At the last words, however, his voice rang through the hall  like thunder, and he repeated them with emphasis. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  answer, Se&ntilde;ores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! no! Viva Xuarez! Viva el gefe! Abaja, Gomez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito listened to those fierce responses with a smile of pleasure on his  usually immobile face, and when the clamour died away, arose slowly to his  feet. Facing the messengers of the Republic, he addressed them sharply,  laconically. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  hear, Se&ntilde;ores. Go!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  refuse!&rdquo; said Don Alonzo, scarcely able to believe his ears. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse to surrender myself to your tyrants. The people of Acauhtzin refuse to  lay down their arms. Between myself and the illegal Junta now sitting at  Tlatonac, there is no friendship, no trust, no faith. They proclaim me a rebel!  I, Hypolito Xuarez, proclaim war!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  flung up his hand with a fiery gesture, and as he did so a hundred swords  flashed from their scabbards. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;War!&rdquo;  cried those in the hall. &ldquo;War! Viva Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Alonzo tore the message of the Republic in twain, and cast the pieces at the  foot of the dais whereon Xuarez was seated. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  be it!&rdquo; he cried, turning his back, &ldquo;War!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo;  said Xuarez, in a voice of thunder. &ldquo;You came, Se&ntilde;ores, under the protection of  the English flag. You go with the opal banner flying at your masthead. Such a  precaution was useless. I am not a barbarian to fire on a flag of truce; but  you&mdash;you, Se&ntilde;ores, are cowards to thus distrust an honourable foe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Before  the Intendante could speak, Philip sprang forward, and faced the speaker. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fault, Se&ntilde;or, if fault it be, is mine. The vessel in which we came is English,  and, therefore, flies the English flag. In the port, I hoisted the opal banner,  to show that these gentlemen were on board, and had come on a mission from the  Junta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  excellent explanation!&rdquo; sneered Hypolito, frowning; &ldquo;but untrue!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Untrue,  I say! You thought I would fire on your ship! You looked on me as a barbaric  foe! You mistrusted me!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who would not?&rdquo; said Jack&rsquo;s deep voice savagely, &ldquo;who would not mistrust one  who makes war on women?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand you, Se&ntilde;or Duval,&rdquo; said Xuarez, who knew the young engineer  quite well. &ldquo;Explain!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Dolores, the niece of Don Miguel Maraquando, has been kidnapped from Tlatonac!  I accuse you of carrying her off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  deny it, Se&ntilde;or! It is false,&rdquo; cried the rebel leader, a flush reddening the  marble whiteness of his face. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores is not in Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may not be here, Se&ntilde;or, but you know where she is!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not, Se&ntilde;or! You have no proof of what you say.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pepe,  the zambo, a spy in your pay, carried off a woman from Tlatonac,&rdquo; cried Rafael,  stepping forward. &ldquo;That woman was my cousin, Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Xuarez  started, and spoke rapidly to one of his officers, who thereupon left the room. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you know much, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he resumed, scornfully; &ldquo;but you are wrong; the zambo  was my spy&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  repeat he was my spy in Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Xuarez, coolly; &ldquo;and he left the city  with a plan of your fortifications.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  todos Santos,&rdquo; roared Garibay, fiercely, clapping his hand on his sword. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  on whom you like, Se&ntilde;or Commandante! I have no reason to hide this from you or  from the Junta, else would I have kept silent. I know when to hold my tongue,  Se&ntilde;ores; I know when to speak! I speak now! Go back and tell your President  that I have a full plan of Tlatonac in my possession, and that I will use it to  take your city, and level its walls to the ground.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can do so!&rdquo; said Garibay, tauntingly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I can do so. As you say,&rdquo; replied Xuarez, suddenly recognising that this  controversy was unworthy of his rank; &ldquo;we need say no more on that subject. Ha!&rdquo;  he added, as the officers, with a man and a woman, entered the hall, &ldquo;here is  Pepe! and here, Se&ntilde;ores, is the woman he carried off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  woman threw back her rebozo. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marina!&rdquo;  cried Jack, in despair. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Don Hypolito, serenely, &ldquo;I am not the base one you think me  to be.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; muttered Tim, under his breath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this, Se&ntilde;ores, is outside the question. You came to me with a message from the  Junta. I have answered that message. Go! Go, and carry back to Tlatonac my  defiance and that of Acauhtzin. Sail away under your opal flag, caballeros, and  I promise you my guns will respect your vessel. Adios. Go!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  pointed imperiously down the hall to where the great doors stood wide open,  and, headed by Don Alonzo, the deputation retired. Rafael was biting his lips  with rage, and Garibay was swearing under his breath. The exit was scarcely  dignified or worthy of the greatness of the Republic. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never felt so mean in my life,&rdquo; whispered Philip to Tim. &ldquo;What a beast the man  is!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you said he was a great man!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he is. But even great men are human. Xuarez is not perfect; but I believe he is  honourable as regards rules of warfare. We can leave the harbour in safety.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that, my boy,&rdquo; said Tim, significantly; &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s a liar!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  said Jack, overhearing this; &ldquo;do you think that Dolores&mdash;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that he knows where she is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll stay here till he gives her up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  stay here a long time, then. She is not in Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  where is she?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more nor I know.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were marching down the street on their way to the sea-gate, surrounded by their  own soldiers and a troop of the Regimiento de Huitzilopochtli. Around this  living barrier raged the populace, who had heard of the message sent by the  Republic, demanding the surrender of Xuarez, and were mad with anger. To give  up the idol of their hearts&mdash;the man on whom the glorious future of Acauhtzin  depended! It was an insult! If they could have got at the emissaries, they  would have torn them to pieces; but, fortunately, the line of soldiers  prevented this. Don Alonzo was pale with terror, but Rafael and Garibay swore  loudly at the rebel crowd. The three Englishmen smiled scornfully and marched  serenely along, not heeding the savage howling of the mob, which recognised  them as foreigners. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Abajo  los Americanos! Mueran los Yankies!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  would have rather a hard time out there,&rdquo; said Philip, as Tim, his huge frame  shaking with anger, ranged alongside of him. &ldquo;Keep together boys. Where&rsquo;s Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behind,  with Don Rafael. Don&rsquo;t trouble, Philip; Jack Duval has his six-shooter on him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I hope I am not a coward,&rdquo; said the baronet, serenely, as a clod of earth hit  him on the shoulder; &ldquo;but I will be glad when we are safe on board <i>The  Bohemian</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  will I. This is like Donnybrook Fair. But we&rsquo;re nearly outside the town. Glory  be to the saints!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>As  they approached the gate, the fury of the mob increased, and it took all the  strength of the soldiers, tramping shoulder to shoulder, to prevent them  breaking through and falling on the emissaries of the Junta. At the gate,  however, a soldier stumbled and fell, whereon, through the gap thus formed, a  torrent of men rushed, shouting wildly. The escort fought bravely, and the  rebel soldiers did their best to save the ambassadors. It would be a disgrace  to Acauhtzin to let the mob have their will. </p>
  <p>Inch  by inch they fought their way down to the sea-shore, surrounded by the howling  multitude. Philip knocked down a man who tried to snatch his watch-chain, and  Tim, head and shoulders above the torrent of humanity, whacked every head he  saw heartily with his heavy stick. &ldquo;When you see a head, hit it.&rdquo; That was Tim&rsquo;s  rule of warfare. He picked it up at Donnybrook Fair, and applied it practically  in his present predicament. </p>
  <p>At  the water&rsquo;s edge they were hurried into several boats, and amid a shower of  stones and mud, managed to get on board the yacht. As soon as all were on deck,  Benker, without waiting for instructions, started the boat. Philip stood at the  side of the ship and shook his fist at the shore. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  scoundrels!&rdquo; he raged, fiercely. &ldquo;You dishonourable wretches.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Xuarez is a great man,&rdquo; scoffed Tim, wiping the blood from his face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  retorted Philip, viciously, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not responsible for this mob.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  we return,&rdquo; swore Rafael, who stood near him, &ldquo;we will level those walls with  the sand.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time the yacht had passed out of the harbour, and was steaming between the  two war-ships. Don Alonzo began to recover his courage. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  to the Holy Virgin, we are all safe, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he said, in a trembling voice. &ldquo;The  Junta will bitterly resent this insult shown to the Intendante of Xicotencatl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  looked around with an alarmed expression of countenance. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;  cried Tim, in a stentorian voice. </p>
  <p>There  was no answer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Juan was with me,&rdquo; said Rafael, quickly, &ldquo;but I lost him from my side outside  the gate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must be down below,&rdquo; said Philip, greatly disturbed, and went off to the cabin.  In a few moments he reappeared. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not there. My God! Can he be lost?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  yacht was searched thoroughly, but no trace of Jack Duval could be found.  Philip wanted to put back and rescue his friend, who had been evidently left  ashore. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; cried Don Alonzo, in alarm; &ldquo;it is dangerous.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not care. Do you think I am going to leave my dear friend to be torn to  pieces by these savages?&rdquo; raged Philip, stamping his foot. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  soldiers will protect him,&rdquo; said Garibay, who was terribly upset at the  discovery of their loss. He was very fond of Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  they protect us?&rdquo; said Tim, who was quite beside himself with grief and rage. &ldquo;Turn  her head back, Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Rafael, Tim, and the baronet were all in favour of doing this, but Don Alonzo  and Garibay said it would be madness. By this time they were beyond the range  of the fort guns, and in safety; but notwithstanding the remonstrances of the terrified  Intendante, Philip altered the course of the boat, and started back to the  harbour. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will save Jack, if I die for it,&rdquo; he said, fiercely. </p>
  <p>Just  as <i>The Bohemian</i> approached the warships, a puff of smoke burst from the  sides of both, and two balls ricochetted across the waves. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  blank cartridge this time,&rdquo; muttered Tim, grimly, &ldquo;The dirty cowards, to fire  on an unarmed boat. And the forts!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>One!  two! three! four! A perfect cannonade thundered from the forts, and one of the  spars of the boat was carried away. The warships repeated their fire, and,  against his will, Philip was forced to stop the engines. It was no use running  into a hornet&rsquo;s nest. Another quarter of a mile, nay less, and <i>The Bohemian</i> would be smashed to pieces. The engines were reversed, and Philip shook his  fist wildly at the town. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  Dolores! then Jack! Oh, cursed, cursed town!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI<br>

  <p class="poem">I  this side! You that side!&mdash;a woman between us,<br>

  What madman refuse you!&mdash;then lose life and woman.</p>
  <p>Jack  recovered his senses in complete darkness. He put his hand to his head and  heard the clank of a fetter, felt the cold iron clasp his wrist. He moved his  legs, more chains, and the unexpected discovery that he was lying on straw. Not  a ray of light anywhere to be seen. On all sides darkness, the darkness of  Egypt. Rolling heavily to one side with a groan of pain forced from him by his  aching head, he felt the cold chill of a stone floor. Straw, chains, stones,  darkness! What did it all mean? He tried to think, but his head was confused,  stunned as with a blow. It was a blow! For at the back of his cranium he felt a  wound, his fingers were moist with his own blood. </p>
  <p>Slowly,  slowly, his scattered senses came back to him, and he strove to recall all that  had taken place since he had left the Palacio Nacional. Yes! he had gone down  the street with the rest of his friends. Rafael had walked by his side, Philip  and Tim had marched on in front. Then the howling mob on all sides dashing  itself against the lines of soldiers. A dragoon had fallen by the sea-gate just  as they were on the verge of safety&mdash;the mob rushed in through the gap&mdash;then he  remembered fighting desperately&mdash;a blow on the head&mdash;a cowardly blow delivered  from behind, and he remembered no more. Remembrance ceased with that blow, it  revived again here in darkness, with him lying on a straw bed chained like a prisoner.  A prisoner! Jack saw his position in a moment&mdash;he was in prison, at the mercy of  his rival, of the lover of Dolores, of Don Hypolito Xuarez, rebel and traitor. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Heaven,&rdquo; moaned Jack, as the horrors of his situation slowly dawned on his  confused brain, &ldquo;this must all have been designed by that scoundrel, Xuarez.  His promises that we should go unscathed were all lies. Philip! Tim! poor  Rafael! Where are they now? Perhaps in this accursed prison.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was so dark that he was afraid to move lest he should fall into danger. At  length he put out his hand cautiously, and, kneeling forward, felt all round  his bed. The straw was simply thrown on the floor in a heap, and on three sides  he found nothing but the pavement, on the fourth the massive stones of the  wall. Unexpectedly his hand touched a crock of water, and drawing this towards  him, he found it full, much to his delight, as, owing to his wound, he was  consumed with a burning thirst. After taking a good draught, he sat back on his  straw to think of what he should do next. </p>
  <p>Jack  was always cool in time of danger. The obstacles which would have appalled  other men only sharpened his wits, and as his brain was now clearer, he set  himself to work to think over the situation. Before doing this, however, he  soaked his handkerchief in the little water remaining at the bottom of the  crock, and bound it round his head. The cool cloth somewhat assuaged the  throbbing of his wound and thus quieted his heated brain. </p>
  <p>On  leaving Tlatonac, Jack and his friends had doffed their fine uniforms as likely  to compromise them in the eyes of Xuarez, and reassumed their European garb. He  was, therefore, dressed in a Norfolk jacket, with trousers of rough blue serge,  these latter being tucked into high riding-boots of untanned leather. The pith  helmet he had worn had evidently been knocked off in the struggle at the  sea-gate, as his head was bare; but, on feeling his pockets, he found  everything else was safe. Money, knife, keys, they were all there; but his  revolver was gone, a loss which he much regretted. </p>
  <p>The  first thing he did was to remove his fetters, which he managed with some  difficulty and the assistance of his knife. Luckily they were only of light  steel, and had evidently been put on more through the malignity of Xuarez than  because they prevented his escape. Indeed, it was a useless precaution, for,  even now that they were removed, he knew not where he was, and in which  direction to turn for egress. With his knife he managed to bend back the links  of one chain so that it parted, leaving the steel ring still on the wrist; but,  with considerable pain to his hand, he managed to slip it through the other. As  regards the rings round his ankles, Jack was unusually powerful, and, in spite  of his wound, with the strength of despair, managed to wrench the locks of the  chains asunder. The steel chains were old and badly made, else he would not  have freed himself so easily; but as it was, after half-an-hour&rsquo;s hard work, he  managed to get rid of the chains, and stood up with no manacles on him, save  the steel ring on his left wrist, with a few links dangling therefrom. </p>
  <p>Free  so far, he next placed his head against the rough damp stones of the wall, and  cautiously moved round his cell. A few steps from his bed brought him against another  wall, at right angles to the former. Following this, he soon arrived at the  other side of the prison, and felt his way along the opposite wall. Towards the  end of this, he stumbled over a flight of squat, stone steps, projecting into  the prison, and by careful touching, managed to ascertain that those led up to  a low door of wood, clasped with iron. Beyond, a short space, and another wall,  at right angles, and so back to his straw bed, on which he resumed his seat. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen  by twenty,&rdquo; muttered Jack, taking another drink of water, &ldquo;and steps leading  down from the door. Damp walls too. I guess this cage is in the basement of one  of the forts, or below the Palacio Nacional. That cursed Xuarez! One of his men  stunned me in that fight with a foul blow, and they then clapped me in here. I  wonder what he intends to do with me. He knows I love Dolores, and am his  rival; so I expect he&rsquo;ll make things pretty hot for me, if he can. Well, at all  events, my life is safe, for what with Philip and Tim to stand by me, he dare  not kill me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then  a sudden dread entered his mind regarding Philip and the war correspondent. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they should be killed in that row, or clapped in prison also! No, I don&rsquo;t  believe that. Putting Philip out of the question, Xuarez is too cunning to hurt  a war correspondent of a great English paper. He wants to stand well with the  world in this struggle, and would not dare to risk the outcry of anything  happening to Tim. I expect they all got back safely to the yacht. Xuarez could  afford to let them go with his defiance to Tlatonac. He only wanted me because  I am his rival in the affections of Dolores. The question is, has he got her in  his power also? He says &lsquo;no,&rsquo; but the man&rsquo;s a liar, whom it is impossible to  believe. Hang this wound.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was burning with heat, and taking off the bandage, he dipped it into the dregs  of water remaining. Then he bound it over the wound again, and took out his  watch, which luckily had not been stolen, as it was safely stowed inside his  Norfolk jacket. With his fingers, he delicately felt the hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six  o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; he said, somewhat startled; &ldquo;and we left the palace at three. I&rsquo;ve  been three hours in this cursed hole. It must be still light, or, rather,  twilight; so, as it is here as dark as pitch, this cell must be built far down.  Hang them! do they intend to starve me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  felt vainly for the traditional loaf of bread, which always accompanies the  pitcher of water in prisons, but, to his dismay, could find none. This pointed  to one of two things. Either Xuarez intended to starve him to death, or would  visit him shortly with a meal. He would not dare to do the former, as Jack,  feeling sure his friends had escaped, knew the outcry of these against the  rebel leader would be great, did he carry his hatred so far; and as to the  latter, the young man hopefully waited, in the hope that his gaoler would soon  arrive. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t come himself, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jack, throwing himself down on his straw; &ldquo;some  soldiers will come and escort me to the upper world. Hang it! if the man isn&rsquo;t  a thorough blackguard, he&rsquo;ll let me have a meal and a doctor. My head is aching  like, to split. Even a candle would be acceptable in this infernal gloom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Clearly  there was nothing for it but to wait till some one entered the cell. Jack was  too wise to waste his time in kicking at the door, or exhaust his strength in  shouting for help. He was in the power of Xuarez, and it depended on future  events as to how matters would turn out. Of one thing Jack felt confident, and  that was that even if Philip and the others reached the yacht in safety they  could do nothing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess Xuarez brought the guns to bear on <i>The Bohemian</i>, and ordered  Philip to clear out. He could do nothing against that order, so I expect the  boat is by this time on her way back to Tlatonac with the news of my capture or  death. I&rsquo;ll have to wait here until the Junta captures the town, and Lord only  knows when that will be. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much if I only knew of the  whereabouts of Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Thus  talking to himself, in order to keep up his spirits, this unfortunate young man  sat for some considerable time, waiting with philosophic resignation the turn  of events. By means of his watch, he calculated that it was close on eight o&rsquo;clock  before he was disturbed. Then he heard the sound of a bolt slipping out of its  socket, the door of his cell opened, and a man appeared. A man draped in a long  black cloak, flung Spanish fashion over his left shoulder, and wearing a  broad-leaved sombrero which effectually concealed his features. He carried a  lantern which illuminated the cell with a sufficiently feeble light, but it was  comforting to Jack, after the intense darkness of the previous hours, and  enabled him to see whom was his visitor. </p>
  <p>The  stranger closed the door of the cell, descended the steps, and advanced towards  Jack, swinging the lantern to and fro so as to flash the light into every  corner of the small room. That squat figure, that ungraceful walk; Jack  recognised him at once. Notwithstanding the sombrero, the long cloak, the  silence observed by the man, his prisoner at once saluted him by name. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  this is how you keep your prisoners, Don Hypolito Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Xuarez  started at being thus recognised so speedily, but restraining his speech,  flashed the lantern up and down Jack&rsquo;s tall figure as he leaned against the  wall, and started again. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!  You are free! The chains&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  there, Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  rebel leader looked first at the broken chains afterwards at Jack, and seemed  to regard his prisoner as a kind of Samson. He had a profound respect for  physical strength, for physical beauty; and the splendid frame of the young  Englishman, in conjunction with this evidence of his muscles, inspired Don  Hypolito with great admiration. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno,  Se&ntilde;or Duval!&rdquo; he said, in the frank tone of a man who cherishes no animosity, &ldquo;you  are a difficult person to deal with. You have broken your chains! Had I not  arrived thus opportunely, you might by this time have broken out of prison.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not impossible, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Jack, coolly. &ldquo;You may be certain I would not  have sat down much longer doing nothing. But now&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are thinking of making use of my presence here to facilitate your escape. Is it  not so, mi amigo? If you are wise, do not try. You may knock me down&mdash;I am but a  dwarf beside you! You may steal these keys, this lantern; but you know not the  palace, you know not the guards, and, above all, even if you did get free, you  could not escape from Acauhtzin. No, mi amigo! Here you are! here you stay,  unless you agree to my conditions.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Conditions!&rdquo;  echoed Jack, scornfully. &ldquo;I think I can guess what those conditions are, Se&ntilde;or  Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Then I can save my breath,&rdquo; replied Don Hypolito, setting down the lantern. &ldquo;If  you know the conditions of your release, you also know whether to accept them  or not! Speak plainly, mi amigo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito,&rdquo; observed Jack, not answering this question directly, &ldquo;I do not know  whether to regard you as a knave or a fool. You must be the former, else you  had not betrayed me and my friends. You are the latter, or you would not ask me  to agree to certain conditions which you know are quite impossible&mdash;with me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have the great merit, Se&ntilde;or Duval, of candour. I admire it as a virtue, but it  can be carried too far. I do not like being called knave or fool, as I deserve  neither name.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that so? Good! I say you are both! However, I am open to argument; so let me  hear your side of the question.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito laughed quietly, and eyed his rival with increased respect. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you were on my side, Don Juan. A man such as you would be invaluable to  me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thank you for your good opinion, Se&ntilde;or; but I am not on your side, neither am I  likely to be. I support the established Government of Cholacaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a&mdash;but no,&rdquo; said Xuarez, checking himself with a sardonic smile; &ldquo;we have no  time to discuss politics. All are against me now, but when I am seated in the  presidential chair, the world will be in my favour. To-day, Se&ntilde;or, I am an  adventurer. To-morrow I will be a conqueror. Success is everything in the eyes of  the world. However, we need not talk of these things which do not interest you.  I notice you have not yet asked after your friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I, Don Hypolito?&rdquo; replied Jack, determined to show no signs of anxiety  in the presence of this man. &ldquo;I know that my friends are safe, and are at  present on their way to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, but how did you guess this much, Don Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what I know of your character.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, Se&ntilde;or, no one knows my character,&rdquo; said Xuarez, quietly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  your real character, perhaps, but the character by which you choose to be known  to the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  nonchalance of the young Englishman somewhat puzzled Xuarez. Here was a man  talking quietly with one whom he had every reason to hate and dread. Wounded as  he was, incarcerated in a gloomy cell; in doubt as to the safety of his  friends, the whereabouts of his sweetheart&mdash;Jack had yet sufficient pluck to  conceal his real feelings, and play a part which entirely deceived even so  acute an observer of human nature as Don Hypolito. He saw that Jack was  purposely holding himself back instead of giving way to his righteous  indignation, but while admiring the self-restraint of the young man, he was  doubtful as to the meaning of such diplomatic conduct. </p>
  <p>Experience  had taught Don Hypolito that the only way to fathom the feelings of others was  to make them talk freely, listen attentively, and draw conclusions from chance  observations. This method he now applied to Jack, and asked him to proceed in a  grave tone of voice, all the time keeping his ears open to find out the  underlying meaning of this impassive demeanour. He discovered nothing, because  there was nothing to discover. Jack spoke truthfully and bluntly, giving voice  to his real feelings, and Xuarez, accustomed to double dealing, to double  meaning, was for once in his life utterly at fault. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have started this war, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Jack with painful candour, &ldquo;entirely for  your own ends. The excuse you make is that Gomez has broken the constitution of  Cholacaca. This is false, as you know well. However, it is a good excuse upon  which to work out your aims. In this war you wish the civilised world to be on  your side&mdash;to look upon you as a great man, fitted to be the saviour of  Cholacaca from a tyrannical Government. To this end you dare not act violently  towards any representative nation of the civilised world. England is a  representative nation, and you to-day saluted her flag. You respected the  ambassadors from the Junta because they were accompanied by Englishmen, because  they came here on an English ship. One of those men whom you thus respected is  the war correspondent of a London paper, and you wished him to write home to  his journal narrating the courtesy of Don Hypolito Xuarez, and thus interesting  our nation&rsquo;s feelings in your favour. The attack made by the mob was, I firmly  believe, made without your sanction. You wished the embassy to depart in  safety, and they so departed. One man, however, you desired to detain, because  he was your rival in the affections of a woman. That man is myself! So you made  use of the riot to have me knocked down in the fight, and taken here to prison.  Now that you think I am worn out with wounds, thirst, and imprisonment, you  come to offer me my liberty on two conditions. First, that I surrender all  right to the hand of Do&ntilde;a Dolores. Second, that I leave Cholacaca for ever.  These, Se&ntilde;or Xuarez, are your motives in acting as you have done, dictated, as  I said before, not, perhaps, by your real character, but by the noble character  in which you wish to appear to the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito listened to this long speech with rapt attention, and could not help  admiring the way in which the young man had fathomed his motives. When Jack  ended, he raised his head and proceeded to lie&mdash;uselessly, as it afterwards  proved&mdash;still he lied. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a great measure, what you say is correct, Don Juan. I do wish to stand well  with the nations, of Europe, because I believe my cause to be a just one. Gomez  was elected President by the aristocrats, not by the people. I believe in  democracy. He governs so as to throw the whole power of the state into the  hands of those who would take away the liberties of the people, won so  gloriously by Zuloaga. You say I have begun this war from a personal ambition.  That may be so. I wish to be Dictator&mdash;Supreme Dictator of the Republic, and to  raise her to her rightful position as a power in the world. These, Se&ntilde;or, are  political and personal questions. They need not be discussed. What you say  about the embassy is true. Had the boat of Se&ntilde;or Felipe entered the harbour  under the opal flag, I would have ordered the fort guns to sink her for such  audacity. She however carried the English ensign. I respected that ensign; I  received the deputation; I heard the insolent demand of the Junta, and gave my  answer. They were free to depart without hindrance from me. The outbreak of the  mob was solely due to the message sent. I did not create the riot. I did not  make use of the tumult to get you into my power. But when in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e you were  stunned, my soldiers carried you off to the Palacio Nacional. I saw an  opportunity of gaining my ends by thus having you in my power, and so put you  in this prison. Now I come to make my terms. Accept them, and you are free.  Refuse, and a terrible fate will befall you!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  remain in prison here, I suppose?&rdquo; said Jack, contemptuously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  worse!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  would you kill me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not harm a hair of your head. What your fate will be I refuse to tell you;  but if you are a wise man you will accept my offer of freedom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  accept your conditions also. The conditions being those I have stated?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely!  You have rare penetration, Don Juan! My conditions are as you have guessed.  Give up Do&ntilde;a Dolores! leave Cholacaca, and you are free.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  refuse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  well, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Xuarez, coldly. &ldquo;I am not a man to threaten in vain. Your  fate will be a terrible one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite believe you capable of any enormity, Don Hypolito,&rdquo; retorted Jack, with a  curling lip; &ldquo;but why waste any more time over the matter? I refuse!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  what grounds?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  what grounds?&rdquo; reiterated Jack, in a haughty tone. &ldquo;Simply that it does not  suit my convenience either to give up Do&ntilde;a Dolores or to leave Cholacaca at  your bidding.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Xuarez  was nettled at Jack&rsquo;s elaborately insulting manner; but he did not lose his  temper. He was too clever a man to do that. With a sudden change of front, he  took a hint from card-players, and tried to force Jack&rsquo;s hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  love Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not a question for you to ask.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, Se&ntilde;or; I also love Do&ntilde;a Dolores, therefore I am interested in your reply.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; said Jack, facing his questioner sharply; &ldquo;then you shall have it. I do  love Do&ntilde;a Dolores; and, what is more, she returns that love. One person only  will she marry, and that person is myself, John Duval!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will never marry her!&rdquo; exclaimed Xuarez, vehemently. &ldquo;She is mine!&mdash;mine! Before  a month is gone, she becomes my wife!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sneered Jack, with a world of meaning in his tone, &ldquo;I knew you lied when you  said she was not in Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrai!&rdquo;  cried Don Hypolito, who was beginning to lose his temper; &ldquo;I did not lie. She  is not in Acauhtzin. She is&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;  asked Duval, impetuously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a place you will never discover, Se&ntilde;or. Not that it matters much, for, in any  case, you will not marry her. No! You are reserved for a worse fate!&mdash;a fate  which will bitterly punish you for daring to be my rival.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not a child, to be frightened of big words,&rdquo; said Jack, scornfully, though  his heart quailed at the deadly menace of the Mestizo&rsquo;s tones. &ldquo;My friends know  I am in Acauhtzin. They will come back for me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have already tried to do so,&rdquo; retorted Xuarez, triumphantly. &ldquo;When they left  the harbour, I suppose they discovered you were left behind. The boat returned;  but a few shot from the forts, and the war-ships made her retreat, and when I  last saw her she was steaming full speed for Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?  I knew as much. To bring back an army to level Acauhtzin to the ground. To  capture you! to rescue me!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one can rescue you!&rdquo; replied Xuarez, in a sombre tone. &ldquo;Your only chance of  escape is to give up Do&ntilde;a Dolores!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  you! to you!&rdquo; cried Jack, fiercely. &ldquo;You who love her not for herself, but  because she is the guardian of the opal stone! Ah, yes, Se&ntilde;or Xuarez! I know  well what you design. You wish to marry Dolores&mdash;to secure the opal stone, to  gain over the Indians to your cause. All ambition; there is no love. I tell  you, Se&ntilde;or, such a thing can never be. Dolores would sooner die than give  herself up to a villain like yourself. You will never possess Dolores&mdash;you will  never be master of the Chalchuih Tlatonac! Turn your ambitions to other things,  Don Hypolito. Dolores is not for you!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito sprang to his feet with a cry of rage. Hitherto he had restrained  himself in a most admirable manner; but now the insulting speeches of his  prisoner proved too much for even his well-trained temper. A torrent of passion  swept away all his reserve, and he burst out into a furious speech. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores <i>is</i> for me! She will be mine in another week or so. She is the guardian  of the opal, and that also will be mine. When I am possessed of the devil  stone, the Indians will flock round my standard. I have the fleet, I have an  army, I will have the Indians, too, my allies, guided by the devil stone. That,  also, will be mine, and Dolores with it. I will become Dictator of Cholacaca. I  will raise her to a pinnacle of power. She will rule the South&mdash;nay, the North  also. Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, they will all be mine. In the  North, the United States; in the South, the Empire of the Opal, with myself as  Ruler. It is a grand&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dream!&rdquo;  interrupted Jack, faintly, for the pain of his wound was telling on his frame. &ldquo;It  is a dream! a dream!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is no dream! Or, if a dream, it will soon turn out a reality. And you&mdash;you  low-born Englishman, would dare to bar my way to this fame. Lie there, Se&ntilde;or,  and wait my commands. You will die, and by a death which will break even your  spirit. You will die and be forgotten, while I, Hypolito Xuarez, will reconstruct  on this continent the Empire of Montezuma!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  spoke to deaf ears, for, overcome by fatigue and pain, Duval had fainted.  Xuarez bent over him, and held the lantern to his face. It was deadly pale, and  the eyes were closed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want him to die,&rdquo; muttered the remorseless Mestizo, going towards the  door. &ldquo;I shall send a doctor to look after his wound. He shall be made whole  again, but only to perish in tortures. Not for you, Don Juan, is Dolores; not  for you the opal, but death and dishonour. You fall! I rise! My star quenches  yours in its burning splendour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  another moment he had quitted the prison, leaving his rival stretched out in  the darkness, to all appearances lifeless and lost. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII<br>
    In Shadowland</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Weary  body, aching brain,<br>
    Tortured mind, and heavy soul,<br>
    Fourfold being, one existence!<br>
    Life with troublous insistence,<br>
    To ye brings but constant dole,<br>
    Ceaseless weeping, endless pain;<br>
    Yet is all this sorrow vain<br>
    When the waves of slumber roll<br>
    Over body, over soul.<br>
    In such slumber should ye list, hence<br>
    Flies the spirit to attain<br>
    That far land of dreams and stories,<br>
    Misty realms of airy glories,<br>
    Where the body hath no being,<br>
    Nor the eyes an earthly seeing<br>
    And the mind makes no resistance<br>
    To events which overleap<br>
    Nature&rsquo;s laws, which bind existence;<br>
    From our sphere the spirit fleeing<br>
    Dwells but in the realm of sleep.</p>
  <p>After  that extraordinary interview with Don Hypolito in the prison, Jack ceased to  take any interest in earthly matters, and went for a space into shadow-land. He  was not dead, but delirious. As a captive balloon is anchored to earth, so Jack&rsquo;s  soul had flown into the realms of dream, yet was held to his body by a small  amount of life. </p>
  <p>Yet  curiously enough he retained a dull impression of earthly events. All things  actually done to his body coloured his dreams and decided his visions. As the  fancies of the sleepers are determined by external actions, so as through a  veil the wounded man faintly perceived the every-day life going on around his  inert body. Through the chain extending from body to soul which held the latter  captive to earth passed the thrills hinting at corporeal-existence, and these  dominating his spirituality whirled him hither and thither, according as they  happened. We in health feel in slumber the power of the unseen world guiding  our every action; this man, in sickness dwelt, spiritually speaking, in the  world of shadows, whereof we have no knowledge, and therefrom felt rather than  saw the happening of earthly events which coloured his ghostly being. </p>
  <p>Oh  those dreams, those visions apocalyptical, what agonies, what ecstacies, what  feelings did they not beget? Now of earth, now of heaven, frequently of hell.  Years afterwards, Jack remembering portions of these fantasies, would shudder  and turn pale at the mere thought of having endured them. Wild as the visions  of Ezekiel, gorgeous as the Arabian Nights, hideous as De Quincey&rsquo;s dreamings,  delicate and spiritual as the songs of Aeriel, those chimeras, at once terrible  and fascinating, racked his spiritual being with the pangs of pleasure and  pain. As thus:&mdash; </p>
  <p>&hellip;  Darkness! the infinite darkness of chaos, before the light-creating word was  spoken by the Deity. Ages and ages and ages of gloom, of horror, of thick  opacity. No light, no glimmer, no glow to break this all-pervading blackness.  No earth beneath, no sky above, nothing but clinging gloom on all sides. So  chill, so freezing&mdash;surely hell were not more terrible&hellip;. </p>
  <p>Ha!  a burst of light penetrating the gloom. The word is spoken, the light is here&hellip;.  Day divides itself from night &hellip; from the womb of the darkness springs the faint  radiance of dawn. Then the sun, the glorious sun, rises like a god to conquer  the foul fiends of shadow. See how his arrows fly, golden and swift, from his  never-empty bow &hellip; east, west, north, south &hellip; and the glory of light spreads  over all creation&hellip;. I am borne along on the wings of a mighty wind blown from  the gates of the dawn &hellip; faster and faster and faster&hellip;. I swim through the  crystalline air&hellip;. I poise myself like a bird in the opaline glories of a  whirling sphere&hellip;. In the heart of the rainbow &hellip; still no earth &hellip; but air and  the coruscation of infinite colours&mdash;red and yellow and green and blue&hellip;. They  swirl in circles, they shoot on all sides from a spot of brilliance as the  spokes of a wheel&hellip;. They range themselves in lines of ever-changing hues &hellip; and  now I am blown resistlessly onward by that mighty wind&hellip;. </p>
  <p>The  sea! gloom once more! I can see nothing but darkness, yet penetrated by faint  gleams of light&hellip;. The wash of many waves break on my ears&hellip;. Overhead a sky  veiled in clouds, beneath the black breast of ocean, heaving restlessly in  white lines of foam&hellip;. I smell the salt brine of the ocean&hellip;. The keen wind  lashes my face as with a whip&hellip;. Ho! yeo, ho!&hellip; the sailors are at work&hellip;. Hark!  the throb of a heart. Beat! beat! beat! beat! It is the beating of the  propeller blades now striking the water &hellip; I am in the engine-room &hellip; the pistons  slide silently in and out of the cylinders&hellip;. Now the giant cranks rise and fall  with monotonous motion &hellip; and yon gleaming steel shaft, revolving rapidly, turns  the screw in the dark waters without &hellip; the hiss of escaping steam &hellip; the  whirling of wheels &hellip; the sudden burst of red flame from the furnace &hellip; I am  carried across the ocean &hellip; whither? </p>
  <p>Earth!  at last the land&hellip;. Mother of all things, I salute thee &hellip; this bleak beach on  which dash the waves &hellip; the soft odour of the wind sways the trees on yonder  promontory&hellip;. I hear the measured dip of oars &hellip; the grating of the boat&rsquo;s keel  on the stones&hellip;. Ha! I am in the hands of demons &hellip; their eyes glare as they lift  me from boat to litter&hellip;. The curtains are dropped, and I feel the swing and  sway of the litter being carried up steep heights&hellip;. </p>
  <p>This  is a primeval forest &hellip; green as the sea &hellip; scarcely so restless &hellip; the warm wind  stirs the giant branches &hellip; what crowded hues &hellip; and lo! the flash of brilliant  flowers &hellip; the odour of spices&hellip;. Brilliant birds flit from branch to branch like  flying gems&hellip;. I hear the singing of choirs invisible &hellip; the birds!&hellip; Yes, birds  only&hellip;. Garlands of flowers trail from the trees &hellip; beneath their shadow the  grass is crowded with blossoms &hellip; wherever I step a flower springs to being &hellip;  those pools of still water blue as turquoise &hellip; the Indian conjurer!&hellip; I see him  hiding amid the frondage &hellip; look!&hellip; the saurian!&hellip; Oh, the frightful monster&hellip;.  Preadamite!&hellip; begotten in chaos slime&hellip;. Trees! trees! trees without end&hellip;. The  earth is one vast forest, and I alone wander therein&hellip;. </p>
  <p>Snow!&hellip;  a vast expanse of snow &hellip; for miles and leagues&hellip;. No! it is salt lying in thin  flakes on the brown earth &hellip; the surface glitters in the moonlight as if it were  ice&hellip;. Far and wide whirl thin white pillars of salt in the grip of the wind&hellip;.  Lot&rsquo;s wife! Ha! Ha! Nay, no woman do I see, but salt on all hands &hellip; like snow &hellip;  and moon freezing crystals&hellip;. </p>
  <p>The  forest again &hellip; more trees &hellip; birds &hellip; odours&hellip;. Hark! a song &hellip; &lsquo;tis the  dancing-girls who sing &hellip; I heard them call &hellip; I see them shake their anklets of  gold &hellip; the cymbals crash &hellip; the trinkets shine. Can you not hear the roll of the  serpent-skin drums?&hellip; </p>
  <p>Oh,  this interminable avenue of stone gods &hellip; on either side the faces of solemn  sphinxes&hellip;. I am in Egypt &hellip; I go up to offer sacrifice to the god Thoth &hellip; lines  of sphinxes &hellip; statues of kings with their hands placed on their knees &hellip; then  this great flight of steps&hellip;. Up, and up and up&hellip;. Are we going to heaven?&hellip; I  will bow down to my God&hellip;. Horror! Huitzilopochtli&hellip;. This is not my God&hellip;. I  sacrifice to Thoth&hellip;. To Isis&hellip;. Ah, you would make of me the victim&hellip;. Oh, foul  priest, knife in hand &hellip; the stone of the sacrifice &hellip; you raise the obsidian  knife &hellip; Again the chant of the priests &hellip; the light clash of the dancing-girls&rsquo;  anklets &hellip; drums &hellip; cymbals and death&hellip;. </p>
  <p>I  am in the tomb &hellip; yes; fold my hands on my breast, for I have done with life &hellip;  straight and white I lie, with cerements swathing my form &hellip; this is a king&rsquo;s  tomb &hellip; these walls are painted with many colours &hellip; yonder are gods and kings  and heroes walking in long files &hellip; here they sacrifice to their god &hellip; there  they lead captive trains of prisoners&hellip;. A splendid tomb, but the roof crushes  me down &hellip; oh, Heaven! can those pillars, those caryatides support the cyclopean  architecture?&hellip; It will fall and crush me, like Samson&hellip;. Yes, I thirst! I am  dead, but I thirst&hellip;. Dives in hell &hellip; give me&hellip;. </p>
  <p>&hellip;  What! a woman&rsquo;s face?&hellip; I have seen that face before &hellip; those dark eyes, that  smiling mouth &hellip; it is thou! Dolores! Oh, my heart&rsquo;s best love, I again find  you,&mdash;in the tomb?&hellip; we have done with life &hellip; then we were divided; but Death,  more merciful, has joined us again&hellip;. Place your cool white hand on my brow &hellip; it  burns &hellip; it burns&hellip;. No, no! do not leave me &hellip; oh, I see you fade in the darkness  like a vision &hellip; and this phantom which rises between us?&hellip; Oh, Xuarez! liar!  thief! murderer!&hellip; thus do I slay thee!&hellip; So weak; so weary; I know nothing &hellip; where  am I?&hellip; what am I?&hellip; whither have my visions fled?&hellip; I am dead! not in hell, nor  heaven &hellip; but where? I know not &hellip; I am dead &hellip; you, Dolores &hellip; you, Xuarez &hellip; you  all, dreams&hellip;. I lie here dead and still &hellip; in my ear the chant of a slave&hellip;.  Could I only turn my head &hellip; ah! the slave rises &hellip; he bends over me&hellip;. Cocom!&hellip; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or, it is Cocom,&rdquo; said a well-known voice, as a gentle hand skilfully  adjusted the bandages. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom!&rdquo;  repeated Jack, in a weak voice. &ldquo;Am I dead? Do I dream? Am I dead?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or Juan. You were nearly dead, and for days you have dreamed of many things.  Now you are better, and will live.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  on earth?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Don Juan. Still do you live, thanks be to the gods. Teoyamiqui has not yet  brought you to her kingdom. Now, lie you still, Se&ntilde;or. So! Drink this, and  speak not; you are so weak.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  raised his head from the pillow, and greedily drank the contents of the cup  held to his lips by Cocom. Then he closed his eyes, and fell into a refreshing  sleep, while the old Indian sat quietly by the side of the couch, muttering  some strange old song of a forgotten civilisation. Now and then a form would  glide into the room and look at Jack sleeping in the bed, so still, so  deathlike. Sometimes a man, more often a woman, and ever beside the couch sat  the stolid Cocom, watching the face of his patient with intense interest. </p>
  <p>How  long he slept thus Jack did not know, but when he woke from a refreshing  slumber all his delirium had departed. He felt weak, truly, but clear-headed  and calm in his mind. Opening his eyes, he listened vaguely to the murmuring  song of his attendant, and thought over the events which had preceded his  illness. The entry into Acauhtzin; the dismissal of the deputation at the  Palacio Nacional; the fight at the sea-gate; the interview in prison with Don  Hypolito; and then utter blankness. He remembered fainting in the cell at  Acauhtzin, and now he had wakened&mdash;where? With an effort he raised his head and  looked round him. </p>
  <p>In  his delirium he had thought he was in a tomb, and truly the room wherein he now  found himself was not unlike one of those strange Egyptian sepulchres, houses  of the dead, wherein the highest art of that sombre civilisation was displayed.  This low roof, formed of Titanic masses of stone; these heavy walls, gaudy with  mural paintings, representing gods, kings, heroes strange sacrifices, and  mystical ceremonies; all were redolent of the land of the Nile. Through a  narrow slit in the wall filtered a pale light; skins of jaguar and puma  carpeted the stone floor; rich coverlets of featherwork lay over the couch, and  the entrance was draped with gaudy tapestries, dyed with confused tints,  hinting at barbaric art. Jack, for the moment, thought he was indeed in Egypt,  when, suddenly, at the side of the room he saw the hideous image of  Huitzilopochtli, and heard the monotonous chant of his Watcher. Then, his true  situation came vividly to his mind; this was a room in some Indian dwelling,  yonder was the fierce god of the Aztecs, and by his bedside knelt Cocom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  am I?&rdquo; asked the young man, raising himself on his elbow, and looking at the  Indian with a puzzled expression of countenance. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  good hands, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; was the evasive answer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes! I know that. But am I still in Acauhtzin?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You are many miles from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I was there last night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  shook his head, and, producing a cigarette, lighted it carefully, blew some  smoke through his nostrils, and looked steadily at Jack with his melancholy  eyes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were there five days ago, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  the Se&ntilde;or forgets that he has been ill. For five days he has been in the land  of everlasting darkness. Cocom has watched many hours by this couch and  listened to the crying of the Se&ntilde;or. You have seen visions and heard voices,  Don Juan. On the borders of Teoyamiqui&rsquo;s land have you been, yet not within her  kingdom. But Cocom knows many things, and by his art has cheated the goddess of  one Americano. You are out of danger now, Se&ntilde;or, and I, Cocom, have cured you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mucha  gracias!&rdquo; murmured Jack, patting the Indian on the shoulder with a weak hand; &ldquo;but  tell me where I am now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  does your memory fail, Don Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  passed his hand across his brow. The confusion of his brain had departed. His  senses were clear now, and he could recall everything up to a certain point. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember the embassy from Tlatonac to Acauhtzin&mdash;the fight at the sea-gate.  There I was struck down, and recovered my senses in prison. With Don Hypolito I  held a long conversation, and, I suppose, fainted with his voice still in my  ears. I wake here at a place you tell me is far from Acauhtzin, and find you by  my side&mdash;you, Cocom, whom I supposed to be at Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  Don Juan,&rdquo; said Cocom, with great deliberation. &ldquo;I will tell you many things  that have taken place since your soul was in the realm of shadows. When you  became insensible at Acauhtzin, a doctor was sent to attend to you by Don  Hypolito. That doctor did what he could for you, but thought you would die as  your soul was not within your body. Wildly did you cry, Don Juan, and many  strange things did you say. Then, by the order of Don Hypolito, you were  carried away on board a war-ship down the coast. At a certain point your body  was taken ashore in a boat, and there delivered to certain people, who expected  your coming. Having been placed on a litter, you were carried through the  forest, across the salt desert, and again through the forest till you were  placed on that bed. For two days have you tossed and turned, and cried, and  fought. But now you are well, Don Juan&mdash;you will live; thanks be to the gods.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  listened to all this as in a dream. The explanation fitted in with those vague  visions which had haunted his delirious brain. The darkness&mdash;that was the cell  at Acauhtzin; the light came when he was carried on board the war-ship. Then  the sea-vision, the landing on the coast&mdash;that mirage of a tropical forest&mdash;the  snowy plains of salt, and the climbing of many steps up to an antique temple. A  sudden thrill shot through his enfeebled frame as he recalled the vision of the  sacrifice, he recollected Cocom&rsquo;s last words referring to the gods, he glanced  terrified at the frightful image of Huitzilopochtli, and turning slowly towards  the Indian, repeated his often-asked question, the answer to which he already  guessed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this place?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  arose to his feet, drew himself up to his full height, and pointed majestically  towards the idol. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  temple of Huitzilopochtli! The shrine of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo;  cried Jack, in despair, as he recognised his position. &ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  saw his peril at a glance. The threats of Don Hypolito regarding a frightful  death were not mere words. With devilish ingenuity he had secured the death of  his rival, with no possible chance of the truth becoming known. Jack saw that  Xuarez had preserved his life, had delivered him to the Indians, to the end  that he might be offered up on the altar of the war-god, as a sacrifice to the  opal. No wonder his usually brave heart quailed at the prospect of such  horrors. Captive to remorseless savages, in the heart of an impenetrable  forest, there was no chance of a rescue by his friends. He was weak, unarmed,  unfriended, in the power of a fanatic race; there was no help for it&mdash;he must  die. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom,&rdquo;  whispered Jack, clutching the Indian&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;why have I been brought here&mdash;why  did Don Hypolito deliver me to the Indians? Is it for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  dry lips refused to form the horrible word; but Cocom, without the least  emotion, supplied it. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  sacrifice! Yes, Don Juan; you are to be offered to the god.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible!  When?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  three weeks. At the termination of the great cycle.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jack, with a shudder. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  time,&rdquo; explained Cocom, with stolid apathy, &ldquo;is divided into cycles of  fifty-two years. This have we received from our Aztec ancestors. At the end of  a cycle the sun will die out in the heavens, and the earth end, if the new fire  is not lighted on the altars of the gods. When the last day of the cycle comes,  you, Don Juan, will be bound on the stone of sacrifice, your heart will be  taken out as an offering to the great gods, and on your breast will the new  fire be lighted. Then will the sun rise again, and a new cycle begin for the  earth. The gods will be appeased, and mankind will be saved.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  had read of this terrible superstition in the fascinating pages of Prescott,  but he never expected that he would one day take an active part in such a  ceremony. With the hope of despair he endeavoured to evade his doom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the body of a white man will not please the gods. Why not sacrifice as your  ancestors did, on the Hill of the Star?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hitherto,  Se&ntilde;or, that has been done. Now, however, the gods have spoken through the opal,  and it is willed that a white man alone can avert the end of time. A white man  must be sacrificed, and you are chosen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  shuddered, and hid his face in his hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,  Se&ntilde;or, you are not afraid!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo;  echoed Jack, uncovering his face, with a frown. &ldquo;No, Cocom; an Englishman is  never afraid of death. But to come in such a form as this&mdash;oh, horrible!  horrible!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  could not understand this alarm. Like all Indians, he regarded death with  stoical resignation, and would have been perfectly willing himself to have been  offered on the altar of sacrifice, seeing such a death would admit him at once  into the Paradise of the sun. But he was very old, and therefore useless. The  gods demanded a man, handsome, young, in the flower of his age, and therefore  was it certain that Jack would be acceptable to the bloodthirsty Huitzilopochtli. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Don Hypolito know this when he delivered me to your friends?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was for that purpose he delivered you, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  fiend! devil!&rdquo; cried Jack, trying to rise in his bed. &ldquo;I wish I had my fingers  round his throat!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie  quiet, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Cocom, forcing him back. &ldquo;You will make yourself ill again.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I not, seeing I am only reserved for this frightful death?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as it may be, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; observed Cocom, significantly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Duval, with sudden hope. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  replied the old man, laying his finger on his lips, and glancing apprehensively  around. &ldquo;In this temple the very walls have ears.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can save me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps.  I know not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  bent over Jack on the pretence of arranging the bed-clothes, and brought his  lips close to the young man&rsquo;s ear. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  not a word, Se&ntilde;or. If the priests suspect me, you are lost. I come hither as my  fathers came before me, but I worship not the devil-stone. I am a true  Catholic, Se&ntilde;or. The priests wanted a victim, and asked me to betray to them  Don Pedro, when he was with me beyond the walls. Then I refused, and said I  could not do so. The end of the cycle approaches, and the priests were alarmed,  so they sent to Don Hypolito, and promised to make all the Indians help him in  his war, if he procured them a white man for a victim to the gods. Don Hypolito  promised, and two days ago sent you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fiends!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  I am a medicine-man, placed here by the priests to cure you; but they think I  wish to see you sacrificed. I do not. I will save you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Cocom, I thank you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you mad, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; whispered the Indian, thrusting him hurriedly back; &ldquo;eyes may  be on us now. The walls of this room are pierced with secret eye-places.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  recognised the wisdom of this reasoning, and sank back on his couch. It was  just as well he did so, for at that very moment the drapery of the door was  swept aside, and a man entered the room. </p>
  <p>He  was a majestic-looking personage, much taller than the average Indian. Indeed,  he was as huge as Tim himself, but not so bulky. He wore a long white robe,  falling to his feet, over this a mantle of gaudy leather-work. On his head was  set a fresh chaplet of flowers, on his breast burned the red glimmer of a small  opal. Advancing into the middle of the room, he swung a small incense-burner  before Jack, throwing therein some odoriferous gum, which made a thick,  perfumed smoke. After this, he cast some flowers on the couch, and muttered a  few words with uplifted hands, finally ending the ceremony by falling on his  knees. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo; asked Jack of Cocom, who stood reverently on one side,  observing all this mummery. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Se&ntilde;or! He adores you as a god.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Devil  take him and his worship,&rdquo; muttered Jack, crossly, in English. Then the priest  spoke in the Indian tongue, and Cocom translated his speech to Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my lord better in health?&rdquo; asked the priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  him I am; but I don&rsquo;t care about being preserved for sacrifice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  not so, Don Juan,&rdquo; said Cocom, in Spanish, with a look of alarm; &ldquo;you are not  supposed to know anything of that. I told you on the peril of my life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  tell him whatever lies you please!&rdquo; said Duval, viciously, and, rolling over,  turned his back on the priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bad sign!&rdquo; murmured the priest, looking anxiously at Cocom. &ldquo;Is my lord  angered?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;  replied Cocom, in the Indian tongue; &ldquo;my lord is much improved in health, oh,  Ixtlilxochitl; but as with all who are ill at ease, he is fretful and wanting  in courtesy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true,&rdquo; replied Ixtlilxochitl, reverently. &ldquo;The sick are ever foolish. See  that thou make him strong, Cocom, for the gods accept naught but blooming  health.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my sacred lord; he will be cured in two days from now. Cocom knows of magic  herbs whereby the favourite of Huitzilopochtli can be made whole. Let  Ixtlilxochitl be content, my lord will be pure and strong for the sacrifice.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is well,&rdquo; said the priest, rising from his knees. &ldquo;I will leave my lord to his  sleep; but will he not vouchsafe one glance at his servant?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Instructed  by Cocom, Jack was forced to turn round and smile at the priest, who knelt down  to receive this mark of favour. Then he adored Jack with more incense and  flowers, after which he withdrew with reverent genuflections. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  old fiend!&rdquo; muttered Jack, when the drapery had again veiled the door. &ldquo;I  should like to have sent a boot at his head.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  my lord Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrai!  why should I? That devil-monkey does not understand Spanish.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or. Still, it is wiser to risk nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are quite right, Cocom. I place myself entirely in your hands. Save me, and I  promise you I shall not forget you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  will save you, for the sake of Don Miguel,&rdquo; said the old man, proudly; &ldquo;and for  the sake of the lady Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores!&rdquo;  repeated Jack, eagerly. &ldquo;Do you know where she is?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing at present,&rdquo; replied Cocom, with a meaning glance. &ldquo;Possess your  soul in patience, Don Juan; all will yet be well. Don Hypolito desires to kill  you, and wed Do&ntilde;a Dolores. He shall do neither. Santissima Virgen, I swear it.  Be silent! No words, my lord. Rest now, and sleep. You will need all your  strength.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the sacrifice?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Se&ntilde;or, for escape!&rdquo; </p>

    The Shrine Of The Opal</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Lord  of the humming-bird&rsquo;s foot!<br>
    Behold thy worshippers rising and falling in adoration before thee, as<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rise and fall the restless waves of  the far-reaching ocean.<br>
    These thousands gathered from the ends of the earth, are thine, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine only.<br>
    We see thine image bedecked with jewels, shine like the sun at his<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rising<br>
    Before thee, the stone, whereon the favoured one yields up his life for<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy glory.<br>
    Smoking hearts dost thou love, the savour of blood, the carnage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of battle.<br>
    For thou art god of war, death alone is the way to thy favour.<br>
    Spins before thee that precious stone by which thou tellest thy wishes,<br>
    That shining, precious stone, which now burns red as the blood of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine altars,<br>
    Crimson it gleams, hinting war! War is the fate of the future!<br>
    Oh, mighty one! Lord of the humming-bird&rsquo;s foot! We pray thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give order,<br>
    That the red war light melt soon to the azure of peace,<br>
    Then will fresh victims be thine, and happiness ours,<br>
    Shout, ye people! ask peace from the lord of the humming-bird&rsquo;s foot.</p>
  <p>In  two days, Jack was comparatively well, and able to move about without much  trouble. This almost miraculous cure was effected by Cocom through the medium  of some medicinal herbs, the curative powers of which were known to him alone.  Out of these he made two decoctions, one for internal, the other for external  application. With the latter he bathed the wound on Jack&rsquo;s head, and made him  drink quantities of the former every two hours. The effect was wonderfully  rapid, and Jack soon found himself gaining strength. In the hands of a European  doctor, he would probably have been laid up for weeks; but the rude medicine of  the Indian set him on his legs in no time. The wound on his head gave him no  trouble, and healed with great quickness; a fact which Jack put down as much to  his healthy blood, and simple living, as to Cocom&rsquo;s physicing. </p>
  <p>With  renewed health and strength came a stronger desire to escape from the horrible  fate which waited him in a few weeks. When he went out, however, and explored  the strange city, in the centre of which stood the shrine of the opal, Jack saw  plainly that it would be madness to attempt flight without the assistance of  Cocom. The Indians apparently knew this, for, treated by them more as a guest  than a prisoner, he was permitted to wander freely round the neighbourhood.  Still, did he venture too far in the direction of the belt of timber  surrounding the city, he was always followed by two or more native guards;  these, when he once more returned to the city, quietly left him. From this  espionage he plainly saw that his roaming was restricted, but not in such a  measure as to cause him any unpleasant feeling. </p>
  <p>As  regards the behaviour of the Indians, Jack had nothing to complain of. Indeed,  they could scarcely have been more deferential. Regarded as a kind of deity,  his appearance was the signal for the most slavish adulation. The Indians, of  whom there were a goodly number in the vicinity, threw themselves on their  faces before him, as he walked abroad, attended by Cocom. If he seated himself,  they strewed flowers at his feet, and swung censers, fragrant with copal, until  he was almost hidden by white wreaths of perfumed smoke. This popularity was  not unpleasant; but, as Jack knew it was but a prelude to the sacrificial  stone, he was anything but gratified at thus being continually reminded of the  dangerous position in which he stood. </p>
  <p>On  recovering his health, Jack found Cocom much more reticent than when he was  acting as doctor. Several times had he been on the point of making some  important communication, but always stopped short and refused to speak further.  Jack supposed this caution was on account of the priests, who, despite the  deference of their demeanour, kept a close watch on his actions, and on those  of Cocom. The high priest, Ixtlilxochitl, was a mild-looking old man, who  treated Jack in a most courteous manner, and frequently expressed his pleasure  that the white lord had so soon recovered his health. Such inquiries would have  been much more acceptable had not the recipient known that they were but the  outcome of Ixtlilxochitl&rsquo;s desire that he should be in good condition for the  sacrifice. It was no pleasant thing for Duval to know that these courtesies  came from an old gentleman who was anxiously looking forward to taking his  life. </p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances, Jack did not wonder that Cocom was cautious, and though  for the moment the attitude of the old Indian appeared anything but friendly,  Jack quite relied on him to aid his escape. He was anxious to escape from this  buried city, where he was threatened with so terrible a fate; he was longing to  return to Tlatonac for the purpose of reassuring his friends, who he knew would  be terribly put out by his disappearance at Acauhtzin; and, above all, he was  anxious to be free so as to search for Dolores. </p>
  <p>In  Jack&rsquo;s opinion she was at Acauhtzin, as a man so vile as Don Hypolito could no  longer be believed. If she was not in the power of the rebel leader, she would  have been with the Indians. Yet here was Jack in the very heart of this  aboriginal civilisation, in the stronghold of the opal, yet he neither saw her  nor heard anything of her. He questioned Cocom, but that wily old man replied  that he knew nothing, and as Don Hypolito had admitted that he knew where she  was, Jack felt sure that the poor girl was held a prisoner by the Mestizo at Acauhtzin.  He was therefore anxious to escape, and get back to Tlatonac, for the purpose  of urging on the war with all possible speed, so that the northern capital  should be invested within a reasonable time, and Dolores rescued from her  terrible position. Consequently, escape was his one aim; but he saw plainly  that without assistance it would be impossible to leave this city of the opal,  buried as it was in the savage solitudes of primeval forests. </p>
  <p>That  this famous opal shrine was in Cholacaca he knew perfectly well, but as he had  been brought hither in an unconscious state, he was quite at a loss to lay his  finger on the precise locality. Cholacaca, east to west, was two hundred miles  from mountains to sea, so the city of the opal could not be situated out of  this radius. It might be fifty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty miles from the  sea, and Jack, knowing by his pocket-compass in which direction to go,  calculated that if he marched due east he could not fail to reach the coast.  Once there, and he could soon pick up a canoe or some light boat, in which he  could get in due time to Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>But  to start for the coast without knowing the geography of the country was sheer  madness, and Jack stamped his foot with rage as he thought of the miles of  trackless forest which lay between him and freedom. To push one&rsquo;s way through a  virgin forest is difficult in any case, but to make the attempt without arms,  companions, food, and guides was quite an impossibility. That there was some  secret way to the coast was plain, as the Indians came hither to this shrine  from Tlatonac; but that way was known only to the priests. Within a certain  distance, every new-comer was blinded with a bandage, and this was taken off in  the square, before the principal teocalli. The worshippers were conducted into  the forests with the same precautions; so, unless he could bribe a priest to  show him the secret way, Jack foresaw absolutely no chance of gaining his  freedom. </p>
  <p>It  was a buried city, but not a ruined city, for here the aboriginal civilisation  flourished greatly, as it had done before the coming of the Spaniards, to  Anahuac. Situated in a hollow cup, on all sides arose verdant forests of bright  green, clothing the base of great mountains, which showed their serrated peaks  above the vegetation. On three sides the city was shut in by these giant  barriers, but towards the west opened a rugged ca&ntilde;on, through which flowed a  noisy stream. A road ran along the west side of this freak of nature, cut out  of the solid rock, so narrow as to allow only three men to walk abreast. Above  and below were the cliffs, thousands of feet in height and depth. No foe could  enter the city by that pass, which led into the great mountains of the interior  continent; but no foe would wish to enter, for this city was holy ground, the  Mecca of the aborigines, and had preserved its inviolability from an invasion  for centuries. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was built by the Toltecs, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Cocom, who acted as Jack&rsquo;s cicerone. &ldquo;Ages  ago, you must know, this race came hither from the North. It was they who built  the great cities of Yucatan in the dark past. Uxmal, Ak&eacute;, Chichen-Itza. They  reared them all. A glorious race were my ancestors, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are not a descendant of the Toltecs, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or, I am a Maya. My ancestors ruled at Mayapan. See,&rdquo; added the Indian,  plucking a yellow flower sprouting out from a crevice close at hand, &ldquo;this is  the plant Cocom&mdash;my name, Se&ntilde;or, and that of the great kings who ruled Yucatan.  The Mayas also built great cities, but Toltecs or Mayas, Don Juan, what does it  matter? I am a poor Indian crushed under the heel of the white man.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say the Toltecs built this city also?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,  Don Juan. They came and they went; no one knows whither they went. We are born,  Se&ntilde;or, but we know not from whence we come. We die, but we know not whither we  go. So with the Toltecs. They came, they went, and we know nothing more. But  they left their cities behind them, Se&ntilde;or, to show how great they were. In  their wanderings&mdash;I speak from the traditions of the priests&mdash;in their  wanderings, Se&ntilde;or, they came to this place, through yonder ca&ntilde;on&mdash;up the gorge,  I think, for then there was no river, no road. Here they lost their leader, and  built this city to commemorate his greatness. It is so called after him&mdash;Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that was his name, no doubt.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quien  sabe! No; I do not know what his name was. Totatzine is a Nahua word, meaning &lsquo;Our  Great Father.&rsquo; He was their father and leader, so they called this place  Totatzine. It is a monument to his memory.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a holy city!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  ages, Se&ntilde;or, it has been sacred,&rdquo; replied Cocom, seriously. &ldquo;Here it was that  the god Tezcatlipoca had his shrine, but when the guardians of the opal stone  fled hither, the worship of the Chalchuih Tlatonac became the great religion  here. Now the soul of the universe is forgotten, and Huitzilopochtli alone is  adored with his devil-stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the soul of the universe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tezcatlipoca!  It is strange, Se&ntilde;or, that the name of this god means &lsquo;the shining mirror,&rsquo;  while the Chalchuih Tlatonac means &lsquo;the shining precious stone,&rsquo; so you see the  religion has changed but little.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not adore the old gods, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  Indian looked fearfully around, as though he deemed his answer, though  delivered in Spanish, would be overheard and understood by some lurking priest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or Juan,&rdquo; he whispered at length. &ldquo;I believe the opal can prophesy because  it is inhabited by devils, as we are told by the good Padre, but I worship the  Holy One and His virgin mother. I am a Catholic, Se&ntilde;or, but once I was an  adorer of Huitzilopochtli, and it is hard to break away, Se&ntilde;or, from the habits  of youth. I came then&mdash;I come now, and though I am looked upon as one devoted to  the old gods, yet do I follow the faith of the good Padre!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad of that, Cocom. Otherwise you would not help me to escape.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True.  The Holy Virgin has you in her care, Don Juan. I am, assuredly, the only  Catholic here in this city of the devil-stone, and I am your friend. You will I  aid to escape.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  my lord. Behold, Ixtlilxochitli is at hand.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  suave priest passed them slowly, and bent his head with abject deference as  Jack looked at him. He made as though he would have stopped, but Duval waved  his hand to intimate that he did not wish to be disturbed. Ixtlilxochitli made  a second genuflection, and resumed his way. It was wonderful to see how these  bloodthirsty idolators obeyed the slightest wish of their proposed victim. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  thinks we are plotting,&rdquo; hinted Jack, looking after the old man with anything  but an amiable expression. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He trusts me too much. Besides, he would not care if he did guess we were  plotting, Se&ntilde;or, thinking, as he does, that I know not the secret way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you do know it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  looked around and saw nobody. Then he turned towards Jack, and nodded  significantly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or, I do know it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  And when&mdash;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  time, Don Juan. We have already spoken too long. Let us resume our examination  of the sacred city. It is not wise to be incautious. Folly is loud of speech,  but Wisdom is silent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  acquiesced in this view of the matter, and they walked on. He was greatly  interested in all he saw around him, as it is not given to everyone to view a  great aboriginal civilisation in its full glory. But for the horrible fear he  had of failing to escape, and thus run the risk of being sacrificed to the  war-god, he would have been quite fascinated by this extraordinary place.  Always a bit of an arch&aelig;ologist, he viewed with enthusiasm these giant palaces,  these massive temples&mdash;works of a great race, still as fresh under the blue  tropic sky of to-day as when they were first reared in the dim past. When  Europe was a land of savages, this city was built; it rose in its splendour  while Greece was in her glory and Rome was not. Back, many ages back before  Christ; before David, perchance before Abraham, these superb edifices rested  majestically in this smiling valley. Still were they inhabited, still were they  the home of a race, of a religion&mdash;the seat of a barbaric civilisation, the  oracle of a faith, as they had been in their pristine glory. The empire of  Montezuma had fallen in Mexico, the Incas were now but a name in Peru, gone  were the Toltecs, scattered the Mayas, yet the buried city of Totatzine, safe  in the midst of primeval forests, endured still, and would endure until that  fatal day, which would surely come, when the aboriginal race would silently  retreat before the conquering forces of civilisation. Here was the last  stronghold of the old gods, driven from the table-lands of Anahuac; here smoked  anew those altars overturned by the Conquistadores; here shrieked the victim on  the terrible stone of sacrifice; and here was the shrine of the famous Opal,  the Chalchuih Tlatonac, the very mention of which thrilled the hearts of all  far and wide with superstitious dread. </p>
  <p>The  sacred city was admirably situated for all purposes. Nothing could be more  beautiful than this majestic work of man, set like a jewel within the green  circle of the forest-clad mountains. Its health was assured by its being  fortunately placed in the genial climate of the Tierra Templada. A vast wall  built across the huge rift of the ca&ntilde;on protected it from foes in the west, and  the peaks, the impenetrable forests, formed a barrier against the outside world  on all other sides. Its inviolability depended upon its remaining hidden in the  shadow of the forests; and in this isolated valley none would guess the secret  of its existence. It was veritably a buried city, secluded from the prying gaze  of mankind, and was probably the only one of its kind in the world. Beautiful,  healthy, well defended, closely hidden, this strange town was the pride of the  barbaric tribes of Central America&mdash;their Mecca, their Jerusalem; the altar of  their ancient faith, the city of the shining precious stone. This was the true  city of the opal, and not Tlatonac, for here in the central shrine flashed the  great gem on the altar of the war-god. The paths of all savage men converged to  this place, and from here welled forth the influence of the old gods which  frustrated the efforts of the Padres to Christianise the tribes of Central  America. </p>
  <p>Down  the eastern peaks fell a mighty torrent, which swept irresistibly across the  flat plain, and emerged from the valley through the ca&ntilde;on on the west. On  either side of this stream was the city built, and three bridges of massive  stone connected the one town with the other. That on the right bank of the  stream was the city of the priests, while to the left lay the city of commerce,  of dwellings, of daily life. In the sacerdotal town a large square surrounded  the vast mound whereon was built the teocalli of the Chalchuih Tlatonac, and  from this square streets radiated&mdash;to the stream, to the mountains, to the wall,  like the spokes of a vast wheel. A similar square, with radiating streets,  formed the plan of the other town, save that the palace of the Cacique occupied  the place of the teocalli. Both towns were crowded with Indians, but the  sacerdotal portion was principally filled with pilgrims, come to worship at the  shrine of the opal, while the settled population lived on the other side of the  stream. There were large caravansaries round the teocalli, for the  accommodation of the visitors who came from all parts of Central America; and  Totatzine derived its wealth, its splendour, its very existence, from the  constant crowds pouring in through the secret way to worship the old gods. The  entrance to that way was supposed to be in the shrine itself, but none knew the  exact place save the priests of Huitzilopochtli, and these jealously preserved  the secret on which depended their power. </p>
  <p>Accompanied  by the faithful Cocom, who, notwithstanding his advanced age, could bear a  great deal of fatigue, Jack explored the two cities, meeting everywhere with  the greatest deference from the populace. Unpleasant as was his position, he  almost forgot his peril, in contemplating the wonderful buildings around him.  The architecture of the houses was similar to that of ancient Egypt. Long  ranges of squat pillars, decorated with vivid hues, mural paintings, religious  and warlike in character, massive walls of reddish stone, sloping inward as  they gained height, colossal flights of steps leading up to cyclopean  door-ways, and everywhere the grotesque images of the Aztec gods. </p>
  <p>From  the flat roofs of the houses arose truncated towers, carved rudely with all the  hideous forms of an obscure mythology. From these one could see the vast  expanse of the city, the interminable lines of the terraces falling one below  the other to the narrow streets, the great squares crowded with people,  dominated by teocalli, by palace, and far off the sombre length of the wall  stretching across the ca&ntilde;on, while beyond this barrier the winding cliffs of  the gulch shut out all view of the world beyond. All was vague, awesome, terrible;  the city wore a menacing aspect, even in the cheerful sunlight, and the  confused murmur rising upward from the streets, seemed like the lamentations of  countless victims, the moaning of countless generations, tortured, terrified,  blinded by the blood-stained deities of Anahuac. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the Se&ntilde;or so pleases, we will go to the teocalli,&rdquo; said Cocom, after they had  quite exhausted the commercial portion of the city, &ldquo;and there behold the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to see it, above all things,&rdquo; replied Jack, remembering his first  glimpse of the gem; &ldquo;but I thought the priests would not let me enter the  temple.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can go anywhere, Don Juan. Remember, in the eyes of the priests, of the people,  you are a deity.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  poor deity, seeing I am but preserved for that cursed altar. Where will they  kill me, Cocom&mdash;that is, if they get the chance?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the sacrificial stone in front of the teocalli. Your heart will be taken out,  and then, when the sacred fire is kindled, your body will be hurled down the  steps of the pyramid.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very pleasant little programme,&rdquo; said Duval, grimly; &ldquo;it is a pity it should  not be carried out; but as I propose to run away I guess it will be Hamlet with  the Dane left out. Bueno, Cocom! let us view the shambles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  Indian assented, and, having crossed over the bridge, they walked up the  straight, narrow street which led to the central square. Such people as they  passed immediately prostrated themselves on the ground, and in some cases  suffered Jack to walk over them. The young engineer felt inclined to kick them  so enraged did he feel at being thus perpetually reminded of his probable fate;  but as such conduct would scarcely be politic, he managed, though with  difficulty, to restrain himself. </p>
  <p>Soon  they emerged from the street between two colossal carved idols of appalling  ugliness, and the square lay open before them. Like a vast mountain arose the  huge mound with five successive stages, and up to the truncated summit, from  the base, stretched a broad flight of sixty steps. Wide and shallow was this  staircase, with huge stone masks scowling on each step. These d&aelig;monic  countenances were crowned with twisted serpents, and had protruding tongues  symbolical of life and light. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  like pantomime ogres,&rdquo; thought the irreverent Jack, contemplating these  horrors. &ldquo;I say, Cocom,&rdquo; he said in Spanish, &ldquo;what are these heads meant to  represent?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are god stars throwing their light over the earth, Se&ntilde;or. The projecting  tongues represent them doing so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  I never should have thought putting out one&rsquo;s tongue meant such a lot. Come,  Cocom, let us ascend the steps.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Don Juan!&rdquo; said Cocom, in a low voice, as Jack put his foot on the  lower step, &ldquo;I have a reason for taking you up here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see the opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and to see something else. Connected with your escape, Se&ntilde;or. We can talk  freely in the teocalli; for now it is noon, and no priest is in the temple.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  We will have it all to ourselves. But I wonder at them leaving the opal  unguarded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!  It is quite safe, Don Juan! No one would steal the opal. Even if anyone did he  could not get out of the town, and if he did get out of the town he would be  killed before he reached the coast.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see! Superstition is a greater safeguard than bolts or bars.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise  me, Se&ntilde;or, you will not cry out at that which I am going to show you,&rdquo; said the  Indian, disregarding Jack&rsquo;s remark. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you are going to show me, but I promise you I&rsquo;ll keep silent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno,  Se&ntilde;or Juan! Let us go!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  ascended the steps slowly, followed by Jack, who was much puzzled to know the  reason of this warning. Cocom, however, had proved himself to be a true friend,  so Duval trusted him implicitly, and was quite satisfied that the Indian did  not speak without cause. Up those interminable steps they went, till Jack  thought they would never reach the summit, and, being still weak from illness,  had to pause three or four times during the ascent. At last they arrived at the  top, and Cocom, making Jack sit down to rest himself, went into the temple.  During the absence of the old man, his patient amused himself in examining the  teocalli, and admiring the splendid view outspread before him. </p>
  <p>Far  below he could see the dual city like a map, intersected by the stream which  cut it clean in two. The streets, running at right angles, made it look like a  chess-board, and on both sides of the river were the great gaps of the squares.  The surrounding green of the forests, the grey worn peaks sharply defined  against the blue sky, the reddish-coloured city in the hollow, all made up an  inexpressibly beautiful picture. He could see the figures of men, women, and  animals moving like ants through the squares, bright-coloured dots of crawling  life. To his ear came the hoarse roar of the river dashing on its rocky bed,  the confused hum of voices, the faint cries of merchants, the thin songs of  women seated on the distant flat roofs. Hither ascended the mingled murmur, as  though the busy city exhaled a huge sigh of sorrow and fear in the ear of their  god, whose burdens were so heavy upon them. </p>
  <p>Then  he turned to view the teocalli, which he found not unworthy of his regard.  Indeed, the whole pyramid aroused his admiration. This vast mound of earth,  faced with a coating of adobe and covered with silvery cement, was a feat of  engineering which at the first sight appeared somewhat startling, seeing it was  the work of a barbaric race. Jack was a civil engineer, and learned in  mechanics; but it puzzled him to think how this great mass had been built up.  What armies of men must have been employed in its construction! What  architectural skill was needed! How completely were the four sides covered with  the smooth cement! This mound, a mere mole-hill compared with the great  artificial hills of Quemada, Cholula, or Palanque, was as marvellous a work of  man as the pyramids of Egypt, and as mysterious. </p>
  <p>The  teocalli itself was a structure of red stone, consisting of two truncated  towers, joined together by a flat-roofed building, in the centre of which was a  wide low doorway, the sides of which inclined inward till they nearly touched  at the lintel. The whole of this fa&ccedil;ade was elaborately carved with convoluted  serpents, mastodon heads, and frequently bizarre emblems intermingled with  representations of the moon and stars. Birds, fishes, bows, arrows, and blazing  suns were also carved with wonderful skill out of this dull-hued stone, and  directly over the door itself flamed a painted opal, darting rays of divers  hues. As all these arabesques were gaudily coloured, the effect may be  imagined, and Jack&rsquo;s eyes ached as this grotesque confusion of crude tints  blazed in the strong sunlight. In front of the teocalli, to the left, was a  large serpent-skin drum, used for summoning the devotees of the god; but Jack  did not look so much at this as at an object which he viewed with horrified  repugnance. This was a huge block of jasper, slanting and polished, on which  many unhappy beings had been slain, on which he himself was destined to suffer.  Only by a strong effort did he keep his eyes for a moment on this couch of  death, and then averted them with a shudder. </p>
  <p>Rising  from his seat, he walked towards the door of the temple, and was met at the  entrance by Cocom. The Indian threw a glance down the staircase, to see that no  one was ascending, and then stood on one side to let Jack pass into the shrine. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can enter now, Se&ntilde;or, and speak with safety.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was some time before Jack&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the gloom, for the shrine  was only lighted from the door. In this vast apartment twilight prevailed, and  showed but dimly the flash of jewels, the glitter of gold and silver. The sides  were encrusted with stucco, carved with figures of Aztec deities, which formed  the court to the terrible war-god. Teoyamiqui, the goddess of death, was there,  with her skirt of platted snakes; Teotl, the supreme deity of Anahuac;  Tlacatecolotl, his enemy, the spirit of evil; Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, Centeotl,  and many other gods of that terrible hierarchy. Masks formed of turquoise  stones hung on the walls, here and there were small altars, on which burned  scented gums, and, at the end of the hall, under a canopy of richly carved and  gilded wood, sat the terrible one, the war-god Huitzilopochtli. </p>
  <p>His  image was scarcely human, but seemed to be simply a block of wood distorted  into hideous shapes. In one hand he grasped a bow, in the other a sheaf of  arrows, delicate humming-bird feathers adorned his left foot, and his waist was  encircled by a serpent formed of precious stones, emeralds, turquoises, pearls,  all glittering dimly in the pale twilight. Behind the god spread a sheet of  solid gold, carved with the attributes of his deity, and in front of him  appeared a grotesquely carved altar, on which rested a red object. Jack,  holding his nose, for the stench of the slaughterhouse was terrible, advanced  to see what it was. He started back, with an exclamation of horror. It was a  bleeding human heart! </p>
  <p>As  he started back, a blue flare seemed to strike across his eyes. He looked up,  and, lo! The Harlequin Opal. Depending from the roof by a gold thread, the  great jewel twisted slowly round in front of the altar, the height of a man  from the ground. With every revolution the colours changed, like those of a  chameleon. Now would radiate a bright green flame, then a blue ray would flash  like a streak of lightning through the gloom; at times the whole stone shone  yellow as the sun, and oftentimes a fierce tongue of red would dart from its  breast. All these changes were caused by the constant twirling of the cord by  which it was suspended, and even in the half light the splendid gem scattered  its tints on all sides with the utmost brilliance. </p>
  <p>Fascinated  by the magnificent jewel, Jack stepped forward to examine it closely; but, just  as he laid his finger on it, he heard a voice&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was a woman&rsquo;s voice. He turned in alarm, and saw a woman standing near the  doorway. The light fell full on her face, and Jack rushed forward, with a loud  cry of joy, to clasp her in his arms. </p>
  <p>It  was Do&ntilde;a Dolores! </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX<br>
    An Unexpected Meeting</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Time  is fond of strange surprises,<br>
  Ne&rsquo;er  we know what is before us;<br>
  Acting  as stern Fate advises,<br>
  Time  is fond of strange surprises.<br>
  Empires  fall, a nation rises,<br>
  Those  who hated, now adore us.<br>
  Time  is fond of strange surprises,<br>
  Ne&rsquo;er  we know what is before us.</p>
  <p>It  was Dolores! The lost Dolores, for whom he had sought so long, so vainly. She  lay on his breast, sobbing as though her heart would break, and Jack was so  overcome with emotion that he could not speak. Cocom, with true delicacy, had  withdrawn, and they were alone in the temple. For some moments they could  neither speak nor move, but remained locked in one another&rsquo;s arms, silently,  passionately, grateful for the meeting. Behind them, the slowly revolving opal  flashed out a thin streak of blue. It was an omen of peace, of love. </p>
  <p>Jack,  as was natural, first recovered himself, and did all in his power to quieten  the hysterical emotion of Dolores. The poor girl looked ill and haggard, as  well she might, seeing how much she had suffered during the last fortnight.  Torn from her home, from her friends, her kindred, her lover, entombed in the  sepulchre of a vast forest, with no hope of ever being released, she had  abandoned herself to despair. The unexpected appearance of Jack was too much  for her overstrained nerves, and she utterly broke down. Duval placed her on a  stone near the doorway of the shrine, and, kneeling at her feet, strove to calm  her agitation. He was having but ill success, when Cocom appeared in the  doorway, and seeing at a glance what was the matter with the girl, at once  produced one of those mysterious medicines he constantly carried about with  him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  the Se&ntilde;orita drink of this,&rdquo; he said, thrusting a small bottle into Jack&rsquo;s  hand. &ldquo;Cocom will watch at the staircase that none ascend. But be speedy,  Se&ntilde;or. Ixtlilxochitli remains not long away from the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>When  the Indian withdrew, Jack forced Dolores to take some of the drink prescribed.  The effect was magical, for in a few minutes her sobs ceased, she became  composed, and her eyes brightened with joy as she looked at her lover. Jack was  still in his serge shooting-suit, high boots and all; while Dolores, in amber  skirt, lace mantilla, and dainty shoes, looked as though she were arrayed for a  ball. The Indians had evidently treated her with great tenderness, and save for  her haggard looks, she looked little different from what she did at Tlatonac.  In their European dresses, they were out of keeping in that savage house of  worship. A strange scene, truly. The blood-stained deity, the fantastic figures  of the gods, the twirling opal, flashing sparks of light, and at the door these  most unhappy lovers, oblivious to all save themselves. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querido!&rdquo;  sighed Dolores, looking fondly in Jack&rsquo;s face; &ldquo;how like an angel do you appear  to me. I thought never to see you again; but now you are here, and I am happy.  Tell of the dear ones, Juanito, of Eulalia and Rafael. How does my dear uncle,  my aunt?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not seen them for over a week, cara,&rdquo; replied Jack, kissing her; &ldquo;they  were much disturbed at your disappearance. We all thought that you had been  carried off to Acauhtzin, and with Don Felipe and your brother I went up there  to demand you from the base one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all of this, mi amigo,&rdquo; said Dolores, quickly. &ldquo;Ah! do not look so astonished.  Cocom is our friend; Cocom told me all. Of Marina departing with Pepe in <i>The  Pizarro</i>, of your journey to Acauhtzin, and how you were betrayed to the  priests by Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know my story, Dolores, but I do not know yours. Tell me how it was that you  were carried off. I at first suspected the Indians, but afterwards deemed Pepe  had taken you to Xuarez. I suspected him wrongly, it seems.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Juan!&rdquo; cried the girl, her eyes flashing with anger; &ldquo;all this misery was  contrived by Don Hypolito. He told Ixtlilxochitli that&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  interrupted Jack, in astonishment; &ldquo;does Xuarez know the priest? Has he been  here? Is he a worshipper of that devil stone?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to that I am not certain, but he has been here frequently, and held long  conversations with Ixtlilxochitli. Don Hypolito, you know, says he is a  Mestizo. It is false; he is a pure Indian. His parents dwelt here as  worshippers of the old gods, and it was in Totatzine that he was born.  Afterwards, when he became a man, he grew weary of this buried city, and went  forth to seek his fortune. He prospered, as you know, and now says he has  Spanish blood in his veins, to gain favour with my own people. But his heart is  Indian; he is a friend of Ixtlilxochitli; he comes here frequently. I said,  querido, that I was not certain that he worshipped the devil stone. I am wrong;  I think he does. Through him does that opal counsel war; and you were delivered  to the priests to be the victim of the cycle.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in return for this handsome gift of my life, what does Don Hypolito get?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not guess? Ixtlilxochitli, anxious to see the Ruler of Cholacaca one who is  a believer in the old gods, has promised to make the Indians fight for him. He  can do this by means of the opal&rsquo;s prophecies. The priest thinks that if Don  Hypolito becomes President, he will restore the worship of Huitzilopochtli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not. Yet Ixtlilxochitli, who is a clever man, is completely deceived by Don  Hypolito, and believes that this will be so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I see how Xuarez came to the sacred city,&rdquo; said Jack, reflectively; &ldquo;but you  say it was he who carried you off?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  means of the Indians, yes. Listen, Juanito. The last time Don Hypolito was  here, he told Ixtlilxochitli that he desired to marry me; also, that if I were  not carried off from Tlatonac, and placed for safety in the opal shrine, that I  would probably marry you. As you can guess, it would never do to let the  guardian of the opal marry a white man, so, as desired by Don Hypolito, I was  decoyed from Tlatonac, and carried to this frightful place.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  were you decoyed?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  means of your friend, Don Pedro.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Pedro!&rdquo; cried Jack, in surprise. &ldquo;Why, what had he to do with your kidnapping?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had nothing actually to do with it. But his name was used in this way. Listen,  mi cara; it is the strangest of tales.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  nodded and settled himself to listen, whereon Do&ntilde;a Dolores began her story at  once, as every moment was precious. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you left me on that day, Juanito, I went to the cathedral, in order to pray for  you, and to obtain from Padre Ignatius the holy relic for your protection. With  Marina did I kneel before the shrine of the Virgin, and waited for the Padre,  but he did not appear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,  he was in the cathedral all the time waiting for you in the sacristy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is strange,&rdquo; observed Dolores, in some perplexity, &ldquo;for I grew weary of  waiting, and sent Marina to seek Padre Ignatius in the sacristy. As she did not  return, I presumed that she could not find him, and had perhaps gone to look  for him in his own church.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  went neither to sacristy nor to church,&rdquo; explained Jack, hastily; &ldquo;she saw Pepe  at the door of the cathedral, as she went to seek the good Father, and departed  with the zambo. Then she was afraid of being punished by you, and did not  return to the Casa Maraquando until late, when we found you were missing. I  expect it was fear that made her run off to Acauhtzin with Pepe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  probably; yes, Juan, it was as you say. She did not go for the Padre, and he,  waiting in the sacristy, expected me to meet him there. I, on my part, thinking  Marina would return every moment, remained before the shrine. Then I felt a  hand touch my shoulder, and turned round expecting to see Marina. It was a  dwarf Indian, called T&rsquo;ho, who gave me a message from&mdash;as I thought&mdash;Cocom and  Don Pedro.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it was not Cocom who betrayed you, Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed. But through the craft of Ixtlilxochitli, his name was made use of as a  decoy. This Indian, T&rsquo;ho, did not speak, but gave me an object message.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  What is that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you not know, Juanito? and yet you have dwelt so long in Cholacaca. An object  message is one the meaning of which is read by certain things delivered. For  instance, querido, in this case, T&rsquo;ho gave me a yellow flower and several objects  cut in bark, including an arrow, a pair of spectacles, and a round coloured  red. Now can you understand?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  yellow flower meant Cocom! Is that not so? He told me to-day his name was from  such a flower.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is right&mdash;the spectacles?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Dolores! The spectacles! Oh, I know; Peter wears spectacles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, mi amigo,&rdquo; replied Dolores, smiling at his discovery, &ldquo;and the arrow was  a hint to be swift&mdash;the rough piece of bark, coloured scarlet, showed that some  one was wounded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Dolores,&rdquo; interposed Duval, hastily; &ldquo;I can read the message now. It  came presumably from Cocom, and read, &lsquo;Come quickly, Don Pedro is wounded.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Dolores  clapped her hands. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima  Madre! You have guessed rightly. That was the message. At once I obeyed it, for  I thought poor Don Pedro might be dying.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was kind of you, Dolores, but terribly rash.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not think it would be far away from the gates, and suspected no evil.  Besides, I had been kind to T&rsquo;ho, and did not dream he would betray me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  he did?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  base criminal, he did. I followed him from the church just as the sun was  setting. He led me through the streets out of the town by the Puerta de la  Culebra. No one recognised me, as I veiled my face in my mantilla. T&rsquo;ho guided  me past the chapel of Padre Ignatius to the open country&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  rash of you!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack, reproachfully, &ldquo;how terribly rash!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was rash, Juanito! But do not be angry, querido. I did it for the sake of  Don Pedro, whom I thought was wounded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  and what happened after that?&rdquo; said Duval, kissing her, to show he was not  cross. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  replied Dolores, tapping her mouth with her closed fan; &ldquo;I hardly remember! I  was asking T&rsquo;ho where lay the poor Se&ntilde;or Americano, when a cloth was flung over  my head, and I was borne swiftly away. With the shock, I suppose I must have  fainted, for on recovering my senses I found myself in an open boat going up  the coast. I tried to cry out, but was so weak that I could make no sound. Only  Indians were in the boat, and one of them held a cup of wine to my lips. It  was, I think, drugged, as I then lost all consciousness, and awoke to find  myself in Totatzine!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  all this was planned by Don Hypolito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and executed by Ixtlilxochitli. I have been kindly treated since I have been  here, and have a house yonder, across the square, all to myself, with  attendants. The high priest told me I had been carried off so that no harm  might happen to me, as guardian of the opal, during the war. He also informed  me that it was the desire of the god that I should wed with Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  his impudence,&rdquo; muttered Jack, in his native tongue. &ldquo;And what did you reply,  Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said I would never wed with the traitor Xuarez; that my heart was given to  another, to Don Juan, the Americano. Ixtlilxochitli was terribly angry when he  heard this, and swore that never would the guardian of the opal be permitted to  wed a white man. &lsquo;But I have no fear,&rsquo; said this base one, &lsquo;for Don Hypolito,  the true worshipper of the sacred opal, will aid us to secure this evil  Americano, and sacrifice him to the gods.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Don Hypolito succeeded,&rdquo; said Jack, with a shudder. &ldquo;The wretch! he had made up  his mind to seize me from the moment I set foot in Acauhtzin. Oh, if I can only  escape, how dearly will I make him pay for all this treachery.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment Cocom darted in at the door. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  the priest, Ixtlilxochitli, is climbing the steps. Hide yourself, lady. You  must not be seen with my lord.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; asked Jack, as they arose to their feet. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask, after what I have told you?&rdquo; whispered Dolores, hurriedly. &ldquo;The priest  knows I love you, and if we were seen together you would be detained in prison  until the day of the sacrifice. Not even your character of a god could save you  from that. Cocom contrived our meeting here, and the priests suspect nothing.  Trust to Cocom! He will tell you our plans of escape. Adios! I must hide!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  will I see you again, angelito?&rdquo; said Jack, kissing her hurriedly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow  night, in the secret way. Adios!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  ran rapidly towards the shrine, and vanished behind the image of the war-god,  while Jack followed Cocom out on to the vast platform of the pyramid. Midway on  the steps they saw the old high priest, painfully climbing upward. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he not find Do&ntilde;a Dolores in there, Cocom, and thus guess we have met?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or. He but comes to see that the sacred fire burns. That the opal yet spins  before the god. If the fire should go out, or the opal stand still, great  calamities would befall the city. Only does the opal pause when it prophesies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is it managed?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!  Se&ntilde;or, I know not. But come, let us go down. Ixtlilxochitli will just look at  the fire, and then descend, after which the Do&ntilde;a Dolores can come down and regain  her palace without being seen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the shrine thus frequently left alone?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or. Save at festivals, it is deserted. But a priest climbs to the temple  every five hours, to see that the sacred fire burns. But see, Ixtlilxochitli is  near us. Be cautious, my lord.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>When  Jack paused on his downward way, the priest coming up at once knelt on the  steps to show his reverence. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  the old fool to get up,&rdquo; said Jack, angrily, being weary of such mummery. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lord bids you rise, Ixtlilxochitli!&rdquo; translated Cocom, more politely. </p>
  <p>The  priest arose, with his hands folded across his breast, and, with downcast eyes,  addressed Cocom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  my lord seen the holy shrine, and the thrice sacred Chalchuih Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  my lord has been graciously pleased to look at these things.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is well! My lord should know well the sacred shrine, so that on the great day  he be prepared to act his part, as saviour of the city, with dignity.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deuce  take your dignity!&rdquo; cried Jack, in a rage when this polite speech was  translated. &ldquo;I say Cocom, cannot we knock this old reprobate down the steps; he  wouldn&rsquo;t get up again in a hurry.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  nay, Se&ntilde;or! such a course would not be wise,&rdquo; replied Cocom, hastily thinking  that Jack was about to carry his threat into execution. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  says my lord?&rdquo; asked Ixtlilxochitli blandly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he will not keep you longer from the sacred offices of the god.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is well! See that my lord has all things, Cocom. The city is his, and we are  his, for on his sacrifice to the holy gods does the existence of Totatzine  depend.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  did not deem it politic to translate this speech to Jack, fearing lest the  young man should thereupon carry out his threat, and kick the old priest down  the steps. Already he was so exasperated at being perpetually reminded of his  awful position, that it would take but little more to make him kill this bland,  servile priest&mdash;to punish at least one of his enemies before he was slain  himself. Many men would have been paralysed by the thought of the sacrificial  stone, but peril only the more firmly braced Jack&rsquo;s nerves, and relying, as he  did, on Cocom&rsquo;s help, and his own energy, he was determined to escape from  Totatzine in some way or another. The meeting with Dolores had inspired him  with fresh energies; and, after leaving Ixtlilxochitli climbing the steps, he  hurried Cocom to the palace where he was living, with the idea of hearing what  plan of escape the Indian had conceived. </p>
  <p>Now  that Duval had seen Dolores, the reserve hitherto maintained by Cocom entirely  vanished, and he professed himself eager to explain his designs. With  instinctive caution, however, he refused to converse in the lower room, where  Jack habitually slept fearing lest they should be overheard. It is true they  constantly spoke the Spanish tongue, of which the priestly spies were woefully  ignorant; but Ixtlilxochitli was quite crafty enough to employ a coast Indian  as an eavesdropper; therefore it was wise to put any such possibility of  betrayal beyond all doubt. With this intent, they ascended to the flat roof of  the palace; but, even here, Cocom felt doubtful of being absolutely safe. In  the end, they climbed the mirador, the sole tower of the palace, where it was  quite impossible that they could be either seen or heard from below. Crouching  on his hunkers below the low wall of the tower platform, Cocom gravely took out  some cigarettes, wrapped in maize-husks, and presented them to Jack, who was  lying full-length against the opposite parapet. In a few minutes they were  smoking, and talking earnestly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  priests, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Cocom, wrapping his zarape round his thin shoulders, &ldquo;the  priests say that the entrance to the secret way is in the shrine itself on the  summit of yonder teocalli. That is a lie!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  where is it, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  bridges are there over the stream, Don Juan. The largest and oldest bridge is  that central one, which leads straight to the square of the sacrifice. Se&ntilde;or,  below that bridge is the secret way!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know, Cocom? Were you not blindfolded when you were brought here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or; but I smelt water. The priests blind the eyes, and close the ears, so  that the way be not seen, nor the voice of the torrent heard; but I, Se&ntilde;or,  have come by the hidden way many times. It is there. I examined it secretly one  night at the peril of my life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you found out you were correct?&rdquo; said Jack, anxiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely,  Se&ntilde;or. Under the bridge the torrent has worn a deep channel; at the very bottom  the path runs eastward, and is concealed by a stone wall made to look like the natural  cliff of the stream. You go up that path which leads to the foot of the  waterfall, then along a passage which leads upward to the thickest part of the  forest. Leaving this passage, you ascend steps, which lead to a narrow gorge,  cut in the top of the mountain&mdash;deep, very deep, Se&ntilde;or, is the pass; no one can  see the city therefrom. In the centre of the pass is a circular space, whence  ten passages, cut from the solid rock, lead everywhere. Go by eight of these  passages, and you fall over cliffs, for the path ends abruptly. They are  death-traps. Of the other two passages, one leads to the sacred city, the other  to the forests beyond the mountains. In this circular place do the priests  blindfold the worshippers. Those who go out can reach that place, those who  come in the same; but, unless guided, they would go astray into the  death-traps. Therefore are they blindfolded by the priests, and led forward in  safety.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a horrible idea,&rdquo; said Duval, shuddering; &ldquo;but how am I to know the right  passage?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a carving of the opal, throwing rays, cut at the entrance of the passage.  That is the right one. Go through that, and you come on to a broad platform on  the other side of the mountain. Steps lead down from thence to the valley into  a broad way built of old by the Toltecs. This road ends suddenly in a  wilderness of trees. Then you guide yourself to the coast by red marks on the  trunks of trees&mdash;the opal, painted crimson, is the sign. Follow those, and you  come to the sea-shore.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  far is it from here to the sea-shore?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty  miles, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty  miles!&rdquo; groaned Jack, in dismay. &ldquo;However can Dolores manage to do that? and  then the perils from incoming Indians!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  Se&ntilde;or. Oftentimes the priests send forth penitents who have on them a vow of  silence. I will procure dresses for my lord and Do&ntilde;a Dolores. You shall be  disguised as Indians under the vow of silence. Should you meet anyone, make a  sign thus, and they will permit you to pass without question. As to the length  of the way, I will give you provisions, and you must travel to the coast as  best you can. It will take many days, but what of that? You will be free.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  we are pursued?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or; I have a plan. Beyond the great wall of the west is the narrow path of  the ca&ntilde;on. When you and Do&ntilde;a Dolores depart, I will take your clothes through  the gate, which is always open, and strew some of them on the narrow path. I  will let fall some blood of an animal down the side of the cliff. Below rushes  the torrent, white and fearful. When the priests find out you are gone they  will not search the secret way, not thinking that it is known to anyone but  themselves. No, Don Juan, they will go beyond the wall, to the narrow path, and  there they will find your clothes, and those of Do&ntilde;a Dolores. They will then  think that you have fallen into the torrent, and so all search will cease.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a capital idea, Cocom! Your ingenuity is wonderful. But when myself and Do&ntilde;a  Dolores come to the coast, what shall we do?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  there, Se&ntilde;or, in a cave I will describe to you, until I come. I will have to  remain behind so as to avert suspicion. Yes; I will tear my hair when you have  gone, and say that you have fled by the way of the ca&ntilde;on; the priests will  search, and think you have fallen into the torrent. The next day, they will  thrust me from the sacred city for having not guarded you well. I will then  come down to the coast, to the cave. Once there, Se&ntilde;or, and we shall soon  contrive some plan to get back to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the priests might kill you, Cocom!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  no fear of that, Se&ntilde;or; I am old, my sacrifice would not be acceptable to the  gods. And again, Se&ntilde;or, I have secrets of herbs known only to myself, which the  priests fain would learn. Should they threaten my life, I will tell them my  secrets and go free.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can never return to Totatzine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  matter,&rdquo; replied Cocom, indifferently. &ldquo;I am very old. Soon I will die. When I  get again to Tlatonac I will worship the Virgin, and die in my corner. Who will  care? The old have no friends!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have a friend in me, Cocom,&rdquo; said Jack, shaking the hand of the old  Indian. &ldquo;I promise you that neither myself nor Do&ntilde;a Dolores will forget this  service. By the way, when do we make this attempt?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow  night, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  But why to-morrow night?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  dawn, Se&ntilde;or, to-morrow, there will be a sacrifice to the god, and a man will  die. The priests will ask you be present so as to sanctify the ceremony.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  kind of rehearsal, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jack, grimly. &ldquo;Go on, Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards  there will be a great festival. All day it will continue, till sunset. It may  be,&rdquo; continued Cocom, artfully, &ldquo;that the priests and the people will drink  much; if so, it will be the better for us. In any case, Don Juan, all will be  weary, and sleep well at sunset. Then I will disguise you and Do&ntilde;a Dolores as  Indians, and lead you to the secret way. By dawn you will be far down beyond  the mountains. Travel all night, Se&ntilde;or, so as to reach the central forests  before dawn. For it may be that the priests will look from the platform down  the road of the Toltecs, and there see you far off. But this, I think, will not  be. The whole city will sleep heavily, exhausted by the festival, and when they  waken, you, Se&ntilde;or, will have escaped.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  grant this scheme may succeed!&rdquo; said Duval, rising to his feet. &ldquo;I can never  thank you sufficiently for this, Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  You are the friend of Don Miguel, who saved my life. Be happy, Se&ntilde;or; I will  not fail to rescue you from the stone of Huitzilopochtli. And now, Se&ntilde;or Juan,  we must go down, else will the priests be suspicious of these long talks  between us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is only one thing I would like to do before I leave Totatzine,&rdquo; remarked Duval,  as they went down to his room. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  to break the neck of Ixtlilxochitli by throwing him down those steps.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  laughed softly. It was a rare thing for this melancholy Indian to do, but he  did not love Ixtlilxochitli, and the idea amused him greatly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  said Duval, tapping his friend on the back, &ldquo;let us go and take the eleven. We  must drink success to our scheme in a flask of aguardiente.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter XX<br>
    An Indian Festival</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">The  sacred drums of serpents&rsquo; skins<br>
  Send forth their muffled roar afar;<br>
  Before the shrine the opal spins,<br>
  A changing star!<br>
  That flashes rays of rainbow light<br>
  From out its breast of cloudy white,<br>
  Rebuking sins<br>
  Which mar!</p>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  see the maidens forward bound,<br>
  To swing and sway in dances wild,<br>
  Loose locks with fragrant chaplets crowned,<br>
  Their glances mild!<br>
  Exchanged for looks, whose frantic fires<br>
  The sacred god himself inspires,<br>
  Who thrice hath frowned,<br>
  And smiled.</p>
  <p class="poem">The  victim! see the victim pure!<br>
  Approaches to the stone to die;<br>
  But for a space his pangs endure,<br>
  And then on high<br>
  His soul mounts upward to the sun,<br>
  For ever with that orb to run,<br>
  Of pleasure sure<br>
  For aye.</p>
  <p>That  evening, Jack received an invitation from Ixtlilxochitli to be present at dawn  next morning on the summit of the teocalli, to take part in a religious  ceremony of peculiar solemnity. The god Huitzilopochtli was to be asked if it  was his will that the Indian tribes should array their ranks in battle on the  side of Don Hypolito Xuarez? Through the opal was the answer to be given. If it  gleamed red the god desired war, if blue there was to be peace in the land.  Seeing the bloodthirsty character of the deity, and the secret understanding  between his high priest and Xuarez, there was but little doubt in the mind of  Jack as to what the answer would be. Still, as he was anxious to know how the  prophecies were given, and not averse to seeing a unique religious ceremony, he  accepted the invitation of Ixtlilxochitli with avidity. </p>
  <p>For  many days, messages had been sent far and wide, calling on the Indians to  repair to the sacred city, and assist at the festival. The town was filled to  overflowing, and all the caravansaries in the square of the sacrifice were  crowded. Owing to the depth of the valley, the ceremony could not take place  precisely at dawn, as it was some time before the sun rose above the peaks of  the surrounding mountains. His presence was indispensable to the ceremony, as  the heart of the victim had to be held up by the officiating priest for the  benediction of his rays. Jack rather shrank from witnessing this horrible rite,  particularly as, unless he succeeded in effecting his escape, he would probably  be forced to take part in the same function; but curiosity triumphed over  repugnance, and he looked forward eagerly to beholding this extraordinary  spectacle. </p>
  <p>In  the grey light of dawn he was awakened by the thunder of the serpent-skin drums,  which for some hours roared continuously. Springing out of bed, he hastily put  on his clothes, and had just finished dressing when Cocom entered the room. The  old Indian was arrayed in white cotton garments, with a chaplet of flowers on  his grey locks. He had another wreath, of red blossoms, which he held out for  Jack&rsquo;s acceptance&mdash;an offer which that young man promptly refused. Red was the  emblem of a dedicated victim, and Jack, knowing this, objected to being thus  distinguished. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrajo!  No, mi amigo,&rdquo; he said, vigorously, &ldquo;I am not going to be decked out as a  victim yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ixtlilxochitli  will be angry, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  can be as angry as the devil, for all I care. I don&rsquo;t intend taking any part in  this infernal idol worship. Don&rsquo;t they look on me as a god, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lord; you are supposed to be the visible representative of Tezcatlipoca, the  soul of the universe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Well, the soul of the universe is going to have his own way. What is the use of  being Tez&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name, if you can&rsquo;t do as you please? Besides, I wear  European clothes, and wreaths don&rsquo;t go with this rig-out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you please, Don Juan. Still, it is not wise to anger the priests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take the risk, Cocom. By the way, I trust Do&ntilde;a Dolores will not be present at  this butchery to-day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or! She intends to sleep many hours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  girl, she needs rest, seeing we shall be walking all night. I will rest this  afternoon myself, Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be wise, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have everything prepared?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  Se&ntilde;or. You will find nothing wanting.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Now let us go to the teocalli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  immense area of the square of sacrifice was densely packed with Indians, mostly  men, as the ceremonies of the war-god were pre-eminently of a masculine  character. A few women were to be seen; but, as a rule, they preferred the  gentler worship of Tezcatlipoca, and left the fierce adoration of  Huitzilopochtli to the rulers and warriors. These pilgrims were one and all  arrayed in white-cotton robes similar to that of Cocom, and, like him, bore  wreaths of flowers on their locks. Many of the most opulent were draped in  mantles of gorgeous feather work, and adorned their persons with collars,  earrings, girdles, and bracelets of gold set with rough gems. The summit of the  teocalli was unoccupied, as the priests in their sable vestments were waiting  for the victim at the foot of the great staircase. A constant thunder of drums,  and shrilling of discordant trumpets, added to the wild character of the scene. </p>
  <p>Jack  had no sooner made his appearance than the multitude, recognising the sacred  victim of the cycle, parted to let him pass through. An immense wave of  movement swept across this sea of white garments, and all flung themselves on  their faces, not even daring to look at the august presence of the incarnate  deity. Attended by Cocom, Jack passed up the avenue, opened by religious awe in  this living mass, and ultimately gained the steps of the teocalli. Here they  saw Ixtlilxochitli, who waved his hand to intimate that they had better ascend  the staircase, which they did, without further remark. </p>
  <p>Seated  on the parapet surrounding the platform of the pyramid, Jack looked down on the  throng of people whose dark faces were turned upwards to the shrine of the  opal, and shuddered involuntarily, as he thought of the fanaticism which had  drawn this concourse together. Devoutly did he pray that Cocom&rsquo;s scheme might  be successful, as it was terrible to think that in the presence of such savages  he should be slaughtered by those wild-looking priests. </p>
  <p>The  morning was slightly chilly, as the valley was yet in the shadow; but, beyond  the rim of the mountains, Jack could see the rays of the rising sun shooting up  in the roseate sky. He trembled and held his breath as a single trumpet  bellowed below, and leaning over the parapet, saw that the procession of  priests were now escorting the victim up the stair-case. Cocom manifested no  emotion, he was but half civilised, after all, and the horror of the coming  deed did not strike him as particularly awful. Men must die sometime, was Cocom&rsquo;s  philosophic view of the matter, and as well might death take place on the  sacrificial stone as in any other way. Jack felt his flesh creep at the idea of  what he would soon behold; but Cocom, with folded arms, stood like a statue of  bronze, silent, indifferent, unmoved. </p>
  <p>Up  the staircase climbed that ghastly procession. The victim, a handsome young  Indian, tall and slender, seemed indifferent to his fate, and bore his part in  the ceremony with becoming dignity. As he ascended the height, one by one he  threw away his ornaments and rich robes. His chaplet of flowers, his bracelets,  earrings, girdles, his mantle of feather work, his cotton robe of white, they  were all strewed on the steps like wreckage, and when he arrived at the summit  of the teocalli, he was completely naked. With his splendid muscular  development, his immobile face, his absolute repose, standing nude by the  jasper stone of sacrifice, he looked like a magnificent bronze statue, and Jack  could not but admire the stoical resignation with which he met his death.  Ixtlilxochitli vanished through the open door of the shrine, and the sable-clad  priests, looking like demons in their religious frenzy, held up their arms to  the east. A wild, barbaric chant flowed from their mouths, weird and  ear-piercing, rising and falling like the waves of the sea. They chanted long  lines of invocation to the sun, and were answered by a confused roar from the  multitude below. So fierce, so savage was the music, that Jack shuddered and  closed his eyes with horror. The victim made no sign. </p>
  <p>Then  the high priest, clad in scarlet robes, and holding a knife of itzli in his  hand, came forth from the presence of the god, and made a sign to the  officiating priests. The rim of the sun was just seen above the heights when  five priests darted forward, and, seizing the impassive victim, flung him on  the altar stone. An appealing cry to Huitzilopochtli arose from the  worshippers, the drums rolled, the trumpets bellowed, and Ixtlilxochitli  rapidly opening the breast of the young man, tore out his heart. The multitude  prostrated themselves humbly, an immense sigh exhaled upward from a thousand  breasts, and after holding the bleeding heart to the sun, now full in sight,  the high-priest flung it at the feet of the idol. Jack felt sick with horror at  the consummation of this tragedy, and closed his eyes for a moment. When he  opened them again, the dead body of the victim was rolling down the steps of  the teocalli, to plunge into the sea of white boiling in the square. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo;  he muttered to Cocom; &ldquo;these priests are devils.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; replied the Indian in a low voice; &ldquo;be cautious. Now they consult the  opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Wiping  the perspiration from his forehead, Duval, leaning on the arm of Cocom, entered  the shrine which was crowded with priests. They all made way for him  respectfully, and, as the great drum outside commenced to roll out its thunder,  knelt in the presence of the deity. Even Cocom bowed before the god, and Jack  was the only one standing. A small fire of coals burned on the altar, and  thereon Ixtlilxochitli flung priceless gums, storax, copal, and odorous resins.  A rich perfume spread through the temple, and a thick cloud of white smoke  rolled upward, veiling the hideous face of the war-god, hiding the now rapidly  revolving opal. A chant arose, sad and melancholy as the sweeping of the wind  through trees, supplicating and sorrowful&mdash;an appeal to the terrible deity who  had been thus propitiated with blood, with the heart of a man. </p>
  <p>A  thin shaft of sunlight entering the temple through some unseen opening, smote  the great gem with fierce fire, causing it to glitter with blinding splendour.  Every eye was fixed on the opal, which continued spinning incessantly, darting  its rays of red and blue, and yellow, and green. Jack, at a glance, saw how the  miracle was done. The priests cunningly twisted the gold string attached to the  roof, and as it slowly unwound itself the great gem revolved. Whether they left  the colour it was to show when still, to chance, Jack did not know, but they  must have had some trick to make it pause when they chose, for he felt certain  the red side of the stone would ultimately reveal itself. In the semi-darkness  he kept his gaze on the jewel, twirling in the yellow glare, and heard, as in a  dream, the roar of the throng far below waiting the announcement of the god&rsquo;s  will. The teocalli was as an island in the midst of a sea, and against its huge  base these living waves beat without intermission. </p>
  <p>At  first the opal spun rapidly, throwing out sparks of coloured fire, then it  gradually slowed down as the string unwound itself. Slower and slower it  twisted, sparkling a ray of emerald green, a dazzling shaft of blue, or a glory  of golden haze. At last the motion was hardly perceptible, and the worshippers  held their breaths in reverential awe. It moved slightly, it paused, it began  to revolve slowly backward, and then, with a slow oscillation, hung motionless  from the roof. From out its white breast shot a fierce glare of violent  crimson. The will of the god was war! </p>
  <p>Amid  a dead silence Ixtlilxochitli stalked forth to the verge of the staircase, now  wearing only his black garments, and held up his scarlet mantle as a sign that  the opal was red. A frantic shout of delight roared upward to the sky, and the  multitude below broke into a frenzy of joy. The religious ceremonies were at an  end, the festival had commenced. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  el amor de Dios, let me go back to my room,&rdquo; whispered Jack, in the ear of  Cocom. &ldquo;If I stay here, I will assuredly smash that idol and kick old  Ixtlilxochitli down the steps.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Unwilling  to risk such a scandal, Cocom hurried his charge out of the temple at once.  Ixtlilxochitli came forward as Jack departed, evidently expecting to be  congratulated on a successful performance, but the young engineer, with a  gesture of repugnance, turned his back on the old villain, and sprang down the  steps of the teocalli. The high-priest looked grave. This dissatisfaction of  the visible deity was a bad omen. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  place is a hell upon earth,&rdquo; cried Jack, throwing himself down on his couch. &ldquo;How  many victims do they sacrifice to that infernal deity, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  old man counted on his fingers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  about one hundred in the year, more or less.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  terrible!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Don Juan, more were offered up in the old days. It is said by the priests that  at the dedication of the great Teocalli in Mexico seventy thousand victims were  offered to Huitzilopochtli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Butchery!  I tell you what, Cocom, if I get safely back, and this war is concluded in  favour of the Junta, I will get Don Francisco Gomez to send an army to stop  this sort of thing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  smiled scornfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Se&ntilde;or; no army could reach the city of Totatzine. It is hidden, and the secret  way is but narrow, as you shall see. Besides, Don Juan, I would not aid an army  to come hither. The city is sacred.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you do not believe in this devil-worship?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or. Still, it was the religion of my fathers. I do not wish it destroyed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  saw that his proposition was distasteful to the old Indian, so did not make  further remark, fearful of raising anger in Cocom&rsquo;s breast. If this one friend  refused to assist them, neither himself nor Dolores could hope to escape.  Therefore Jack was wise and held his peace. Shortly afterwards he intimated his  desire to sleep in order to prepare for the fatigue of the midnight journey, so  Cocom left him, and departed to make all arrangements for the escape. </p>
  <p>All  day long the festival continued. Even through the massive walls of his room  Jack could hear the shrieks and yells of the worshippers as they maddened  themselves with pulque and aguardiente. Once he had the curiosity to ascend to  the flat roof and look down on the square. It was filled with a mass of  frenzied human beings, who danced and sang, and bellowed wildly. Some cut  themselves with knives, others climbing up to the summit of the teocalli flung  themselves headlong down the staircase. Great fires were lighted in the square,  and rings of Indians, men and women, danced round them, singing frantically.  Everywhere the priests, long-haired, sable-robed, inciting worshippers to fresh  frenzies, constantly the wild piping of barbaric music, the rumbling of drums.  It was a horrible sight, this madness of the multitude, and after a glance or  so Jack descended to his bedroom to think over the future. </p>
  <p>He  was anxious to regain Tlatonac and see his friends once more. Philip and Peter,  and Tim, would be grieving for his loss; but they, no doubt, thought that he  was at Acauhtzin and not pent up in this city of devildom. Jack knew well that  Philip would never have turned <i>The Bohemian&rsquo;s</i> nose south unless he had  been compelled to do so. Against the heavy guns of ships and forts the bravest  man could do nothing, and the yacht had been forced to retreat. Doubtless  Philip had steamed direct to Tlatonac, and insisted on an army being sent to  Acauhtzin to release his friend and Dolores. But this could not be; as Jack  felt sure there were no transports to take the soldiers northward by sea, and  the inland route was impossible. </p>
  <p>How  had the war gone? Had the torpederas arrived? or had Don Hypolito sent the  war-ships filled with soldiers southward to attack Janjalla, and from thence  forced his way overland to the capital? The campaign would probably be  conducted as theorised by Don Rafael. Xuarez would first capture Janjalla,  march his troops northward across the plains to effect a conjunction with the  Indians before the walls of Tlatonac, and then bring his war-ships up to the  capital. In this way the city would be assaulted on both sides: bombarded by  the war-ships, and stormed by the regular troops of the Opposidores and the  Indian tribes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must escape,&rdquo; thought Duval, as he restlessly tossed and turned on his couch. &ldquo;This  last order of the Opal will send an Indian army to the walls of Tlatonac. I  know all or most of the plans of Xuarez and when I tell them to Don Francisco  he may be able to thwart them. It is now two weeks since I was taken by that  infernal Don Hypolito, and we cannot regain Tlatonac for at least another five  or six days, if, indeed then. Three weeks is a long time, and many events may  have happened. I hope those fellows are all right. Once I get back, we shall  manage to baffle Xuarez in some way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>These  thoughts were not conducive to slumber, but during the afternoon he managed to  obtain a few hours of sleep. The herbal medicines of Cocom had completely  restored him to health, and he now felt strong enough to undergo the hardships  of the journey to the coast. Dolores, however, was delicate, and Jack dreaded  to think how she would suffer. Still, it was a case of life or death, so it was  best to make the attempt. Anything was better than the certainty of a horrible  death for one, constant imprisonment for the other. At whatever cost, they must  escape. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a case of Pike&rsquo;s Peak, or bust,&rdquo; said Jack recalling the favourite expression  of an American comrade. &ldquo;I hope to the Lord we won&rsquo;t bust, this trip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Towards  sunset Cocom came to wake him for the great attempt. He brought a very  gratifying report as to the state of the population, who were all either drunk  or worn out with religious frenzy. The priests were scarcely better, and in  three hours not a soul in the sacred city would be capable of observation or  movement. It is true that in the commercial half of the town across the  torrent, many people might be on the alert; but fortunately the entrance to the  secret way was on the sacerdotal side of the bridge, so that the two lovers  could escape unseen. Jack was delighted to hear that things promised so well,  and proceeded under the supervision of Cocom to disguise himself as an Indian. </p>
  <p>It  was not a particularly agreeable task, for he had to strip to the buff, and  sponge himself from head to foot with a liquid so as to darken his skin. He was  also forced to sacrifice his moustache, as the Central American Indians have no  hair on their faces. Jack sorely rebelled against this demand, but recognising  that there was no help for it, he shaved himself clean as directed, stained his  face, dyed his hair, and at length stood out a very athletic young Indian.  Being thus physically perfect, he assumed sandals of hide, short white cotton  drawers, a loose cotton shirt, an ample scarlet woollen mantle, and a crown of  peacock&rsquo;s feathers. Cocom also adorned him with a plentitude of bracelets and  jingling ornaments. Thus arrayed, Jack was supposed to be a penitent under a  vow of silence, travelling to the coast with his sister. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope, Cocom, there won&rsquo;t be any rain,&rdquo; he said, as he followed the Indian out  of the room; &ldquo;it might wash the dye off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  fear! no rain,&rdquo; replied the Indian, confidently; &ldquo;the staining will hold,  Se&ntilde;or. Now, not a word! It is dangerous.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>So  long had the perfecting of the disguise taken that it was now considerably  after eight o&rsquo;clock, and the moon was shining brilliantly in the sky. Guided by  the old man, Jack stepped lightly across the square, which was cumbered with  human bodies in all kinds of positions. Some sleeping heavily from exhaustion,  others from intoxication, the whole of the immense area looked like a  battle-field strewn with dead men. In the midst arose the huge mound of the  teocalli, menacing, formidable. Not a sound broke the stillness, save the sigh  of some sleeper, or the restless turning of another. Under the clear sky lay  the field of the dead, and as Jack stepped gently across the prostrate bodies  he could not help shuddering. </p>
  <p>Remembering  Cocom&rsquo;s caution, however, he uttered no sound, but followed the Indian towards  the bridge. Here, in the shadow of the wall, they found Dolores stained as was her  lover, and fantastically tricked out in savage finery. When she saw Jack&rsquo;s tall  form with the nodding plumes on his head, she could not restrain an exclamation  of surprise, but in another moment was clasped in his arms. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peace,  dear one,&rdquo; whispered Jack, fondly kissing her; &ldquo;keep your heart brave. We must  not wait a moment. Alas! querida, I feel doubtful that you will bear the  fatigues of the mountains.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear  not, Juanito!&rdquo; she answered, hastily drying her tears; &ldquo;the Virgin will sustain  and protect us in the wilderness. With thee by my side, I have no fear.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom,  impatient of this delay, made a clucking noise with his tongue, so they at once  sprang towards him. He guided them a little distance past the bridge towards  the left, and paused before a high wall, pierced by a dozen or more gateways,  with massive doors, grotesquely carved. By some trick, known only to himself,  the old man opened the valves of one door, and motioned them to enter. On doing  so, they found themselves in an immense oblong court-yard, decorated round the  walls with nothing but huge statues of the god Huitzilopochtli. Cocom had  closed the outside door, and standing in the open court, the fugitives could  see no mode of ingress or egress. The moon shining brightly made all things as  clear as day, and all around, at intervals of a yard, arose the mighty images,  between which was but smooth wall. It was a trap out of which no one could hope  to emerge. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  worshippers, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; explained Cocom, in a low voice, &ldquo;are admitted into this  court from the secret way on the right. When the court is full, their bandages  are removed, and no one can tell how he entered, or how he can go out. This  confuses all, and then the bandages are replaced, and they are thrust out of  those many doors on to the street, and guided to the great square. When they  see, they behold but the great teocalli, and cannot tell the way by which they  came. Neither can the dwellers in Totatzine, for none are admitted to this  court.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the secret way?&rdquo; asked Jack, anxiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  behind one of those statues, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Both  Jack and Dolores looked blankly at the long line of hideous images against the  opposite wall. One statue was as like the other as two peas, and it was  absolutely impossible to tell which one concealed the entrance. Jack turned to  Cocom, and shook his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  my life depended on it, I could not tell.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Se&ntilde;or, your life does depend on it,&rdquo; said Cocom, grimly, enjoying his little  joke. &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  walked slowly forward, and to all appearance chose a statue at random. Touching  a spring in the protuberant stomach of the idol, the massive image swung  outward, revealing a dark passage. The two lovers ran forward, but were stopped  by Cocom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  passage, Se&ntilde;or, ends with a precipice,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis; &ldquo;if you went  down there, you would fall into the torrent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  misleading way,&rdquo; said Duval, shrinking back with a shudder at the horrible  imagination of the idea. &ldquo;Are there others?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,  and this, and this,&rdquo; replied Cocom, causing several statues to swing out of  their places. &ldquo;All passages you see, Don Juan; all snares for the unwary. Let  me put the images back again. So! Now, Se&ntilde;or, observe. This image of  Huitzilopochtli has a representation of the opal in its forehead. That is the  mark of the way throughout. See!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  statue swung round, and Cocom, stepping boldly into the yawning cavity  disclosed, beckoned to them to follow. With the terrified Dolores on his arm,  Jack did so, and they found themselves at the top of a flight of damp-looking  steps. Once inside, and Cocom, pressing the spring, restored the image to its  proper position; then, taking Jack&rsquo;s hand, led him down the staircase. Clasping  Dolores tightly, he cautiously descended into the pitchy gloom. They seemed to  be proceeding into the bowels of the earth. Down, and down, and still down,  until the hoarse roar of the torrent struck their ears, and emerging into a  darkness little less dense than that in the passage, they found themselves on a  rocky ledge, below the huge structure of the bridge, almost on a level with the  water. At their feet swirled and foamed the flood, raging over sharp-pointed  rocks. To the right, a path led upward in a gentle slope; to the left, a  similar path descended. Cocom pointed to this latter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  trap, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, grimly, &ldquo;ending in the ca&ntilde;on. Take that path, and you  would die. Follow this one to the right, and it will lead you to the great  platform beyond the mountains. From thence you can descend by the great way,  and when in the forest, track your path by the scarlet sign of the opal. Always  the opal, Se&ntilde;or. Go nowhere but where that sign points.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will remember,&rdquo; replied Jack, confidently. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  this wallet, Se&ntilde;or. It contains food for some days, and cacao leaves, and  strong drink. It will last until you reach the cave whereof I told you. Wait  there for me, and I will come shortly. Remember always the rule of silence&mdash;that  you are both penitents&mdash;the sign thus&mdash;lip and forehead. Now go, Se&ntilde;or. I depart  to scatter your clothes on the narrow way, and spread a false report of your  death in the torrent, while escaping. In four days, Se&ntilde;or, expect me at the  cave. Adios, lady of the precious stone, and you, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  sprang backward into the darkness up the stair, and left the lovers standing in  that gloomy inferno, with the torrent roaring below, the huge masonry of the  bridge high above, and, to the right, that perilous way which they must tread  to reach safety. Duval expected Dolores to give way at thus finding herself in  such danger, but, to his surprise, she was brave, and gay, and strong. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  querido,&rdquo; she said, cheerfully, &ldquo;let us go at once. We must reach the forests  before dawn, if possible.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will exhaust you terribly, angelito!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably.  Still, I must keep up, if only for your sake! Come, querido! let us depart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  moved simultaneously towards the right. </p>
  <p>Oh,  that interminable passage, long and narrow and always ascending. They thought  it would never end; but at length it terminated at the foot of the waterfall.  Down from a great height thundered great masses of water, smashing to foam in  the basin below. The spray, rising fine and mist-like, was damp on their faces.  They could not hear themselves speak, owing to the roar. Jack grasped the hand  of Dolores to give her courage, and turned off abruptly to the right where they  entered a passage cut out of the solid rock. Still gently sloping upward, the  path lead them out into a vast clearing, girdled on all sides by great trees.  The moon shone bright as day; and across the grass ran an indistinct track.  Following this, they found a great flight of steps leading upward under the  boughs of mighty trees&mdash;pine, and oak, and hemlock, throwing their giant  branches across, and almost shutting out the moonlight sky. The staircase was  crumbled and old, but wonderfully built of great blocks of stone. Jack could  not restrain his admiration at this Titanic work. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did they do it?&rdquo; he said to Dolores, as they painfully climbed up the superb  stair; &ldquo;they must have known a lot about engineering, those Toltecs. To swing  these blocks into their places must have taken derricks and complicated  machinery. A wonderful work; a wonderful race. How Philip would enjoy this!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think Se&ntilde;or Felipe would rather be where he is&mdash;in Tlatonac,&rdquo; replied Dolores,  wearily. &ldquo;I would I were in the Casa Maraquando.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer  up, my heart! We will be there in a few days. Will I carry you, cara?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios,  no! You are already laden!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are as light as a feather.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Juanito. You would not find that after carrying me for an hour or so. No; I am  still able to walk. I am stronger than you think.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  steadily climbed up the staircase, and at length entered the narrow gorge  described by Cocom. Here Jack made the girl sit down and drink some wine, which  did her so much good that in a few minutes she declared herself ready to resume  the journey. Thus fortified, they entered the gorge, and, cautiously following  its windings, at length emerged suddenly into a circular space. So unexpectedly  did they enter that, as passages opened out in all directions, they could not  tell by which way they had come. This pit&mdash;for it was little else, hewn out of  the rock&mdash;was fifty or sixty feet in depth, and must have represented years of  toil. On all sides, innumerable passages darted out like rays, and it was this  thought that caused Jack to exclaim&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like the opal, Dolores. This space is the stone, those passages the rays; so  it serves a double purpose&mdash;to mislead the runaway, and yet be a symbol of the  Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Fortune  favoured the fugitives, for the moon, directly overhead, sent down her full  glory into the pit. Had they arrived later, they would probably have had to  wait till dawn, as the blackness would have been too intense to permit them to  find the true outlet. But the moonlight, by happy chance, was so strong that,  after carefully examining the sides of several entrances, Jack at length hit on  the sign. A huge crimson blot, with scarlet rays, blazed on a passage to the  right. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  we are, Dolores,&rdquo; cried Duval, joyfully, &ldquo;this is the right way; but we must be  careful, and not risk a snare; one can never tell what these infernal Indians  are up to.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  great caution they entered the tunnel indicated by the sign, and feeling every  step before them, for the whole place was intensely dark, moved onward at a  snail&rsquo;s pace. The tunnel wound hither and thither, until they felt quite  bewildered. For a time the passage was level, but after a series of turnings it  began to slope gently downwards, and so continued to the entrance. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope to Heaven there are no branch tunnels,&rdquo; said Jack, anxiously, &ldquo;we could  easily go off the main track in this gloom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure there are no side tunnels,&rdquo; replied Dolores, decisively; &ldquo;even the  priests could not find their way through this place otherwise than with one  way. If there were other tunnels, they would lose themselves, and that they  would not care to risk.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us move on. At all events, the tunnel is getting straighter,&rdquo; remarked  Jack, hopefully. &ldquo;I wish Cocom had given us a torch.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that yonder?&rdquo; cried Dolores, pressing his arm. &ldquo;A gleam of light.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  It is the exit. Come, Dolores, and say no word, lest, when we emerge on to the  platform, there should be Indians waiting there. Remember our vow of silence.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Encouraged  by this sign of deliverance, they hurried rapidly forward, quite certain that  the ground was safe, and in a few minutes stepped out of the tunnel&rsquo;s mouth on  to a mighty platform, half way down the mountain. Jack cast a swift glance to  right and left, but the area of masonry was quite bare. They were the only  human beings thereon. He turned to speak to Dolores, and found her staring  motionless at the magnificent scene before her. </p>
  <p>The  platform, Jack guessed, was fully a quarter of a mile in length, and enormously  wide. It had first been hewn out of the living rock, and then faced with  masonry, flagged with stones. Here was adopted the same device for misleading  strangers as had been done in the court of the gods, at the entrance from  Totatzine. The whole face of the cliff, at the back of the terrace, was  perforated with tunnels, and now that they had moved to the verge of the  platform neither of them could tell which tunnel they had come out of. Saving  one, all those passages led to death and destruction. Only one was safe, and  that the tunnel distinguished by the opal sign. No one, ignorant of that sign,  could have escaped death. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wonder Totatzine remains hidden,&rdquo; said Jack, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The whole of  that path is a mass of danger and snares. Now, however, we shall have a clearer  way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Turning  towards the east, they beheld a vast stair-case sloping downward to a broad  road, at the sides of which were giant images of the gods. In the pale  moonlight they looked like demons, so frightful were their aspects. In long  lines, like pillars, they stretched away eastward, into the forests, ending in  dim obscurity. On either side, dense foliage; away in the distance, a sea of  green trees. There was nothing but trackless woods and this great road, piercing  into the emerald profundity like a wedge. Behind, arose tall red cliffs,  crowned with ancient trees, tunnelled with black cavities. From thence spread  out the platform with its huge blocks of stone, its walls covered with  hieroglyphics, statues of fierce gods, and vast piles of truncated towers.  Below, the forests, the roadway, the staircase. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a terrible place, Dolores,&rdquo; said Jack, drawing a long breath. &ldquo;It is like the  abode of demons. Come! it is now after midnight, and the moon will soon be setting.  While we have the light, let us try to reach the end of yonder avenue.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Juan,&rdquo; replied Dolores, drawing forth something from her bosom. &ldquo;While  Cocom was with you, I went up to the shrine of Huitzilopochtli and took  in&mdash;this.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Between  her fingers, in the pale moonlight, it flashed faintly with weak sparks of many  coloured fire. Jack bounded forward. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Harlequin Opal!&rdquo; he exclaimed, delighted. &ldquo;You have taken the Harlequin Opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>Chapter XXI<br>
    The Fugitives</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">The  sun goes down, the twilight wanes,<br>
    With reddened spurs and hanging reins,<br>
    We urge our steeds across the plains.<br>
    For you and I are flying far,<br>
    From those who would our loving mar,<br>
    And prison you with bolt and bar.<br>
    Sigh not, dear one, look not so white,<br>
    My castle stands on yonder height,<br>
    We&rsquo;ll reach it e&rsquo;er the morning&rsquo;s light<br>
    The future&rsquo;s joy this night is born,<br>
    I wed thee in the early morn,<br>
    And laugh my rivals twain to scorn.</p>
  <p>It  was fifty miles from Totatzine to the coast. Dolores being a woman, and weak,  Jack, owing to illness, not being quite so strong as usual, they found it  difficult to do more on an average than two miles an hour. To make up for slow  walking they stretched out their pedestrianism to twelve hours between dawn and  eve, thus reaching the sea-shore in two days. They arrived at the cave spoken  of by Cocom, which was a harbour of refuge to them in their sore distress,  completely worn out, body and soul and garments. Still they felt a certain  amount of comfort in three consolations: First, they had escaped from Totatzine  with their lives. Secondly, the wallet was not yet exhausted of meat and drink,  so that they were in no danger of starvation. Thirdly, Cocom, always supposing  he would hoodwink the priests as to his share in their escape, would arrive  within twelve hours or thereabouts. Thus fortified with food and hope, they  stayed thankfully in the cave and waited the arrival of the old Indian. </p>
  <p>As  to the journey from platform to cave, that had been a horrible dream, a  nightmare of hardship, of weariness, of many pangs. Starting from the terrace  shortly after midnight, they had traversed the avenue in three hours. It was  five miles in length, and proceeding at the rate of two miles every sixty  minutes, it can be easily seen that they could gain the shelter of the forest  long before dawn. The great road ended abruptly amid a confused heap of ruins,  forest trees, tangled undergrowth. Doubtless, in the old time it had continued  even to the coast, but time and the Indians had obliterated all traces of its  magnificence five miles down. The former did this because it is his invariable  custom to so treat all human works, which set themselves up as enduring for  ever; the latter played havoc with the relics of their ancestors&rsquo; magnificence,  so as to hide the city of Totatzine from the eyes of the white destroyers, who  had trodden out of existence those same ancestors. Nature had also done her  share in the work of destruction, and sent a wave of green trees across the  straight line of cause-way. Therefore, the road which began so proudly at the  foot of the great staircase ended suddenly, after five miles, in the tangled  wilderness. </p>
  <p>The  journey from Totatzine to this point had been long and arduous. The moon had  set behind the hills so that it was now dark, and to explore an unknown forest  in such gloom would have been foolish, therefore Jack insisted that they should  take some rest. In the midst of an old palace he constructed a bed for Dolores  with the aid of his and her own cloak, and after seeing her safely bestowed  therein, lay down at the entrance so as to act as a sleeping sentinel if such a  thing be possible. Nothing particular occurred, however, and when they awoke  the sun was already high in the heavens. Then they made a frugal breakfast and  resumed their journey. </p>
  <p>The  way being no longer clearly defined, their progress was necessarily slow from  this point. To the right, on the trunk of a tree, appeared the sign of a  scarlet opal as before pictured on the rocks, so to the right they went, and at  once, even at these few steps from the causeway, found themselves in the heart  of a wild, tropical forest. There was something terrible to these two civilised  beings about the primeval savagery of this vegetation and exuberant foliage.  Dense, tangled, almost impenetrable, it reminded Jack of the wood grown by  fairy power round the palace of the sleeping beauty. That forest, however was  to keep lovers out; this, alas! served to keep these lovers in. It lay between  them and the coast, quite thirty-five miles of wild growth, and at times Dolores  almost despaired of breaking through the barrier. Not so Jack, he was hopeful  of ultimate success being strengthened in his faith by the constant appearance  of the opal sign. </p>
  <p>On  every side of them rose giant trees of hoary age, their trunks seemingly  supporting the verdant roof above-head. At times, so dense were the leaves that  sky and sun and kindly light were shut out entirely, and they moved through a  translucent twilight of tremulous green. From trunks and boughs depended lianas  like ropes binding the forest giants together, or, dropping to the ground,  formed a ladder up which climbed the most exquisite flowers. Splendid  tree-ferns drooped their gigantic fronds on high, springing thickly from tall  pillars, rough, brown, and hairy. Below, the ground was thick with brilliant  blossoms, which seized every chance offered by rock, liana, and trunk to climb  upward to that light excluded by the sea of foliage overhead. </p>
  <p>At  every step the forest changed its appearance, as though it were an enchanted  wood. Here, all was savagery and gloom; step forward, and lo! a wide and sunny  glade. One moment, and they were surrounded by moss-covered rocks; the next,  and a noble avenue of palms opened a vista before them. Pools of water sparkled  here and there; babbling brooks winding capriciously in and out in wayward  circles; at times, the sudden gleam of a waterfall, threading downwards in  white streaks from a giant rock; and again, the miasma of a swamp, black and  evil-looking, in whose waters rolled the trunks of fallen trees. Everywhere  flowers bursting into bloom; everywhere new leaves swelling into being;  everywhere the exuberant life of a tropic climate. The atmosphere was warm and  damp, a clammy air permeated the woods, and the whole place was one vast  hothouse, where fecundation went on unceasingly. Throughout, a rich perfume  pervaded the air, heavy, sickly, and languorous. </p>
  <p>Fortunately,  Jack&rsquo;s sight had been rendered keen by his profession, else it would have been  difficult to have discerned the sign, on trunk of tree, or mossy rock. Scarlet  is a noticeable colour, and had the opal sign been the only red hue in the  forest, there would have been no difficulty in the matter. But everywhere  scarlet flowers made fire of the intense emerald of foliage and grass. Dazzling  masses of crimson verbena glared fiercely in the dim gloom, vermilion blossoms  burned like lamps in the dense brushwood, wreaths of ruddy leaves made streaks  like veins overhead, and the ground blazed with the pinks and carmines and  purples of an infinite variety of blossoms. It was difficult to pick out the  red-opal sign amid this constant repetition of the same tints; but Jack, by  careful observation, managed to do so, being guided at times by a well-defined  path. Indeed, often he was tempted to ignore the sign, and go only by the path;  but, as numerous branches led off from the omphalos of the great road, he was  afraid of going astray, so kept his reckoning by the opal alone. </p>
  <p>For  two days they travelled through this zone of verdure, and at length, by the  salt smell in the air, became aware that they were nearing the ocean. At times  they met Indians, gaudily dressed, with painted faces, and deadly looking  weapons; but these, on observing the scarlet mantles of the pair, and receiving  the sign on lips and forehead, stepped aside to let them pass. They recognised  that these travellers were proceeding eastward by the will of the god, under  the vow of silence. Superstition, stronger than greed or cruelty, protected  them from the savages of the wilderness. </p>
  <p>The  journey was not dull, in spite of their anxiety and dread of being followed. On  every side the forest was full of life, and Dolores was delighted to see the  constant flashing of humming-birds, green, red and yellow glories, which darted  through the still air like flying gems. Once they saw the yellow hide of a  jaguar, black spotted, sleek, and terrible. Jack had nothing but a knife, given  to him by Cocom, and regretted that he had not his revolver with him. A knife  was but a poor weapon to do battle with such a terrible foe. To their relief,  however, the animal only eyed them for a few minutes in startled surprise, and  then slunk away among the undergrowth. Other perils from wild animals they had  none. </p>
  <p>Sometimes  the whole air would be alive with butterflies. Purple, yellow spotted, azure  striped, they fluttered everywhere. One would have thought the flowers were  alive, and flew from stem to stem. Peter, as Jack thought, would have been in  his element. This forest was the true paradise of butterflies. But they had no  time to admire all this skill and fecundity of Nature. Resolutely following the  opal sign, they pushed onward through the forest. They saw on all sides the  puzzle monkey trees, with their sharp spikes; omb&ugrave; trees, whose shade is so  dense; aloes, whose branches spread outward like the seven-stemmed candlestick  of the Revelation; palms, mangoes, wild fig trees; cactus, burning with fleshy  scarlet blossoms, and shallow lagunas, swampy pools of water, filled with  sedges and rushes and slimy weeds. </p>
  <p>The  din was constant. Monkeys swung themselves from bough to bough overhead,  chattered without ceasing; parrots, gay plumaged, harsh voiced, shrieked  discordantly in their ears; the roaring of jaguars and pumas sounded faint in  the distance, like muffled thunder; and ever rasped the stridulation of  restless grasshoppers, unseen but noisy. </p>
  <p>Such  a wealth of invention, such overpowering luxuriance, wore out the senses,  wearied the soul. Both Jack and Dolores were glad when the sharp, salt smell of  the sea struck knife-like through the enervating atmosphere. They had been  travelling since dawn, and now, at noon, on the third day of their departure  from Totatzine, they beheld the great waste of waters, flashing like a mirror  in the sun. Jack should have greeted it as did the Hellens of Epaminondas, with  a joyful cry of &ldquo;Thalatta! Thalatta!&rdquo; but he had forgotten his Greek, and was  too weary to feel poetic. </p>
  <p>At  this stage of their journey, they met with many Indians, who here landed in  order to proceed to the shrine of the opal. Dolores was much afraid of their  secret being discovered, and even Jack was somewhat doubtful of the efficacy of  the vow of silence; but, in this case, as in others, fanaticism proved their  safeguard, for they passed unharmed, even unspoken to, through the mass of  savages. On arriving at the verge of the sea, Jack at once sought out the cave  described by Cocom; and, leading Dolores thereto, for a short space of time,  they were in safety. </p>
  <p>From  this point, as Jack had learned in Totatzine, the city of Tlatonac was distant  about twenty miles down the coast, and as there were plenty of canoes drawn up  on the beach, it would have been easy for them to have proceeded at once on  their journey. Gratitude to Cocom, however, prevented this, and they remained  that night in the cave in order to await his arrival. The hiding-place was a  natural cavern of wide extent, and, after making Dolores as comfortable as he  could, Jack retired to the entrance, and kept guard, lest they should be  surprised by some wandering savage. </p>
  <p>Throughout  this perilous journey, nothing could exceed the tenderness and chivalry with  which Duval behaved towards Dolores. He was tireless in his efforts to spare  her all fatigues, in keeping up her spirits, in guarding her from all the  annoyances consequent on travelling ill-provided through a dense forest.  Dolores said nothing at the time, but took silent note of all this courtesy,  and over and over again breathed a thankful prayer that the man whom she loved  had proved himself so noble in the hour of danger. It was a disagreeable  position to a girl brought up as she had been in strict observance of  etiquette; but Jack came triumphantly through the ordeal, and gained rather  than lost in her eyes by the nobility of his character, by the rare delicacy of  his behaviour. </p>
  <p>The  only thing that Duval feared was that the loss of the opal might cause the  priests to mistrust Cocom&rsquo;s story, and send out word far and wide that the  sacred gem had been torn from the temple. It was true that they had gained a  twelve hours&rsquo; start, but, owing to the delicacy of Dolores&rsquo; constitution, they  had travelled very slowly to the coast, and at any moment messengers with news  of the theft might arrive on the scene. In such an event, all the Indians on  the coast would be examined as to whether a man and woman had passed seaward in  company. Owing to their clothes being scattered in the gorge, the priests  (supposing they did not trust these signs of death) would know they were  disguised as Indians, therefore the dresses would avail them but little.  Neither would the vow of silence be of much use, as in this crisis they would  be questioned as to whom they were, to what tribe did they belong, and as  neither of them could speak a word of Indian, the situation would become serious.  The only hope, therefore, that they had of safety was of the arrival of Cocom  without delay. If he arrived next morning, all would be well, if not, Jack  discussed the advisability of taking a canoe, and proceeding at once to  Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>At  dawn next morning they were both eating a hurried meal in the cave, and talking  over the advisability of making a retreat while it was yet time. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as they find out the opal is missing, the whole country will rise in arms,&rdquo;  said Jack, emphatically; &ldquo;and every Indian will be questioned closely, both  within and without the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the news won&rsquo;t reach the coast for some time, Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  question very much if it has not reached the coast now,&rdquo; replied Jack, a trifle  drily. &ldquo;From the end of that road are many other paths to the coast, so swift  messengers might have passed us in that way. Let us hope, however, that this is  not the case, and that Cocom will be the first to bring the news that the opal  is lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  will guess that I have taken the opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doubtless;  and the question is whether he will permit you to take it to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why not, Juanito? I am the guardian of the opal. It is mine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querida,  you are wrong. It is the property of Huitzilopochtli. You are only its  guardian&mdash;a mere honorary position that does not entail possession of the stone.  Its proper place, according to the Indian&rsquo;s superstition, is in the shrine of  Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Cocom is a Christian. He will not care about my taking it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  I am not so sure of that, Dolores. Cocom, by his own profession, was brought up  an idolater, and old habits cling. It is true that he was converted by the good  Padre, and I have no doubt his Catholicism is very fair&mdash;for an Indian. But if  he does not worship the war-god, he at least believes in the prophetic  quotations of the Opal; and, thus believing, may resent it being taken from the  shrine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will say nothing about it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Useless,  angelito! Cocom knows that no other person than ourselves would dare to steal  the Chalchuih Tlatonac. I was with him all the time, so he will know it cannot  be me. Naturally enough, he will think it is you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  therefore betray us?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not think he will do that. After all his trouble, it would be foolish of  him to now play the traitor, for then his concurrence in our escape would  become known, and get him into bad odour with the priests. But it is possible  that he might insist on your leaving the opal behind, to be sent back to  Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Dolores, decisively; &ldquo;I will rather throw it into the sea. Now that the  gem is away from the shrine, those horrid priests may stop sacrificing men to  the idol. Besides,&rdquo; she added, na&iuml;vely &ldquo;it is mine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that is an all-sufficient reason,&rdquo; replied Duval, smiling. &ldquo;Like all women,  querida, you are fond of gems, and do not like to part with this one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very beautiful,&rdquo; sighed Dolores, taking the stone from her breast. &ldquo;See how  it glitters, Juanito. Ah! what is that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  long, shrill whistle sounded outside the cave. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom!&rdquo;  cried Jack, starting to his feet. &ldquo;Hide the opal for the present, Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was indeed Cocom who entered. Cocom looking much older than usual, and quite  worn out with his long journey from Totatzine. He saluted them gravely, and  wrapping himself in his zarape crouched on the floor of the cave, with his eyes  intently fixed on them both. The expression of his face was as usual, and Jack  was quite unable to decide whether he approved of or resented the rape of the  shining precious stone. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look tired, Cocom,&rdquo; said Jack, passing him a flask of aguardiente. &ldquo;Take a  drink of this. It will do you good.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  old man greedily seized the flask, and drained it to the bottom. As it was more  than half full Jack fully expected to see him fall helplessly intoxicated on  the floor. But Cocom&rsquo;s head was seasoned to strong drink, and it only made him  look younger, as though the aguardiente were a draught from the fountain of  Youth. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you it, Se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; he asked, fixing his beady eyes on Dolores. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Dolores, off her guard. &ldquo;That is, I&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said Cocom, nodding his head. &ldquo;You have the opal. I am content.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  drew a long breath of relief. Cocom&rsquo;s sympathy with the idolatry of his youth  was not evidently strong enough to stir him into protest against the gem being  stolen. Or perhaps he deemed that Dolores had more right to it than  Huitzilopochtli. At all events, he did not seem ill-pleased that she was now in  possession of the celebrated stone. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say the priests, Cocom?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are in despair, Se&ntilde;or, over the loss of the sacred stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they know who has taken it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  pointed one copper-coloured finger at Dolores. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  knew that the Chalchuih Tlatonac is with the guardian; but they think that the  guardian and you, Se&ntilde;or, are at the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on&mdash;in the bed of the  torrent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  your ruse was successful?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or! I strewed the clothes on the narrow path, and in the dawn awoke the town  with my cries. Ixtlilxochitli, with his priests, came to inquire the trouble. I  told them that you, Se&ntilde;or, had escaped. They, not guessing you had gone by the  secret way, thought you had fled alone by the ca&ntilde;on. The narrow way was  examined, your clothes were found, the blood on the cliffs, the clothes of Do&ntilde;a  Dolores. Then they knew she had fled with you, and deemed both had fallen in  the darkness over the cliff into the torrent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Chalchuih Tlatonac?&rdquo; asked Dolores, breathlessly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  discovered that loss on returning to the teocalli for the morning sacrifice.  All the priests were in despair, and Ixtlilxochitli, knowing you had taken the  sacred gem, Se&ntilde;or, burnt a lock of your hair to&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  lock of my hair!&rdquo; interrupted Jack, in surprise; &ldquo;how did they get that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of your hair was cut off when you were ill, and preserved in the temple.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why did they burn it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  by doing so, they devote your soul to Tlacatecolotl, the evil one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the Aztec devil,&rdquo; replied Duval, carelessly. &ldquo;Much good that will do them. I  should have thought it wiser for them to look for the stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are looking for it, Se&ntilde;or, and for your body&mdash;in the bed of the torrent.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid they will be disappointed with the result of their search. So they think  we are dead?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or. You are safe from pursuit; but I am not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  withdrew his left arm from the fold of his zarape. The hand was cut off, and  nothing remained but the stump of the wrist, seared with hot-iron. A hideous  object. Dolores cried out, and hid her face in her hands with a shudder. Jack at  once understood why Cocom had acquiesced so calmly in the theft of the opal. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; said the old man, shaking the mutilated wrist at Jack, with a look of  hatred; &ldquo;this was my punishment for suffering you to escape. My hand was cut  off before Huitzilopochtli, and burned with red-hot iron. Then I was shut up in  prison, to wait till the god&rsquo;s will was known.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor Cocom!&rdquo; cried Jack, much distressed, &ldquo;how you have suffered for aiding us.  Thank Heaven you have escaped!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or. Ixtlilxochitli did not think I could leave the city; but in the night I  got out of the window of my prison, and followed you down the secret way. With  all my strength I followed, but I feel sure that the hounds of the priests are  on my track.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  as Ixtlilxochitli knows you are not aware of the secret way, he&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  interrupted Cocom, vehemently, &ldquo;he must know it now. After the discovery of the  ca&ntilde;on, guards were placed there. I have left the city. One other way only could  I have gone&mdash;the secret way. Believe me, Se&ntilde;or, the Indians are not far behind.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  cried Dolores, in terror, &ldquo;we will be discovered!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so, Se&ntilde;orita! On my way hither, I met a friend coming from Tlatonac to the  shrine. He told me that the boat of the Americano had gone some days since to  Acauhtzin, to demand the release of Don Juan. She returns to-day, and will pass  this point at noon. There is a canoe below, Se&ntilde;or! Let us depart in that canoe,  and meet the steamer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  sprang to his feet, with a shout, at this prospect of deliverance. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip&rsquo;s  yacht,&rdquo; he cried, joyfully; &ldquo;good! We will do as you say, at once, Cocom, and  cut across the line of her passage. She will be sure to pick us up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  now, Se&ntilde;or! At noon!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  went to the entrance of the cave, and looked at the altitude of the sun. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wants two hours to noon. In one hour we will start.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  replied Cocom, stolidly, &ldquo;let us hope the hounds of Ixtlilxochitli will not  find us. Once we see the boat of the Se&ntilde;or Americano, and we are safe, if not&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Cocom  shook his head to intimate he had grave doubts of what would be their fate in  such an event, and took another drink of aguardiente. Jack knew that in  returning Philip would keep the yacht close to the shore, in order to avoid the  war-ships of Xuarez, which generally kept a long way to seaward. He, therefore,  took up his station at the mouth of the cave, and watched the northern horizon  for the first trail of smoke from the yacht&rsquo;s funnel. </p>
  <p>As  in most tropical countries, towards the middle of the day all sounds of life  ceased, and Nature took her siesta. In the hush, the three people in the cave  heard far away a wild cry. Cocom sprang to his feet, and hurried to the  entrance to lay his hand on Jack&rsquo;s arm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ixtlilxochitli&rsquo;s  hounds! Let us get away at once. Quick, Se&ntilde;or! We will start now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  be safe,&rdquo; cried Jack, excitedly, pointing towards the horizon; &ldquo;yonder is the  yacht!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was a speck on the horizon, but they had no time to look at it. The cries of  the Indians sounded nearer and nearer. Guided by Cocom, they left the cave and  rushed down a steep road to the beach. Hastily selecting a large canoe, Cocom  sprang in. Jack lifted Dolores over the gunwale, and stepping in himself,  pushed quickly off. Just as they got her afloat, a crowd of Indians burst out of  the woods, and made for the beach. With keen eyes they had distinguished Cocom  as the fugitive whom they were after, and fearful of losing their prey, poured  down in a tumultuous mass. A shower of arrows fell around them, but luckily did  no damage, save one which grazed Jack&rsquo;s cheek. In another moment, they were in  deep water, paddling quickly from the shore. </p>
  <p>The  Indians at once seized the remaining boats, of which there were about a dozen,  and hurriedly embarked. Impelled by powerful arms, these boats shot out after  the fugitives with great rapidity. Jack turned his head to look for the yacht.  She was steaming southward with great speed. With the strength of despair, Jack  paddled, and so did Dolores. Cocom was but little use with his mutilated hand,  but stood up in the bow cursing their pursuers fluently in the Indian tongue. </p>
  <p>From  the start, they had gained considerably on their pursuers, and fortunately an  accident happened, by which three of the canoes, coming into collision, were  overturned. The screams and cries of those struggling in the water caused their  comrades to pause, and during a few minutes Jack succeeded in placing a longer  distance between himself and his pursuers. <i>The Bohemian</i> was so near that  he could see the Union Jack flying at her masthead, the foam swirling from her  bows. </p>
  <p>With  wild yells to encourage one another, the remaining canoes started again; but,  their folly in keeping close together in a mass, impeded their own speed. A  good distance stretched between the pursuers and pursued. Cocom stood swearing  fluently, Dolores prayed loudly in Spanish, but Jack, with teeth set hard,  paddled as though the devil were after him. To lose all when within sight of  safety, it would be too terrible; and as he forced the boat along, he kept glancing  over his shoulder to look at the course of the yacht. She was standing closer  in to shore, and the canoe would cut across her trail in ten minutes or  thereabouts. </p>
  <p>Those  on board had evidently seen a boat was being chased by the Indians, for the  sound of a gun broke on their ears. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  yelled Jack, joyfully. &ldquo;Philip sees us. Come on, you cursed wretches, I&rsquo;ll  escape you yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Dolores  flung down her paddle with a cry. She was completely worn out, and could do no  more. Jack did what he could, but the Indians rapidly gained on them. A second  gun announced that the yacht was close at hand. So were the Indians now within  bow shot. Already some were fitting the arrows to the strings. An idea struck  Jack which promised to be their salvation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores,  the opal! the opal! Hold it up. They dare not fire then.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  caught his meaning at once, and as the nearest boat drew on, sprang to her feet  and held up the great gem. It flashed and sparkled in the sun, and a cry of  wonder burst from the lips of their pursuers. The foremost warriors dropped  their bows. They recognised the Chalchuih Tlatonac, and superstition, stronger  than anything else in their natures, paralysed their arms. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  the boat!&rdquo; cried Cocom, joyfully. </p>
  <p>Jack  turned his head. <i>The Bohemian</i> was less, much less, than a quarter of a  mile away. Seeing this, the Indians, while forebearing to shoot, made redoubled  efforts to catch them before the yacht came up, and thus recover the sacred  gem. One boat came within two lengths, when Jack, thinking to dodge and gain  time, turned his light craft off to the right. In another two minutes a ball  ricochetted across the waves and smashed the foremost boat to pieces. Awestruck  at this unexpected event, the others stopped paddling, and in a few minutes the  canoe was safe under the bows of the yacht. Philip, Peter, and Rafael were  looking over the side at the&mdash;as they thought&mdash;Indians. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip!  Philip!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!  God! It&rsquo;s Jack!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores!  Take Dolores on board first,&rdquo; murmured Jack; then, overcome by all he had passed  through, fell back in a faint. </p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baron  Munchausen!&rdquo; said Philip, addressing Jack, with mock solemnity, &ldquo;this story of  thine passeth the comprehension of man. &lsquo;Tis a most rare history, and, were I  the Commander of the Faithful, I would have it written in letters of gold on  purple parchment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was some hours after their rescue by Philip, and <i>The Bohemian</i> was just  entering the harbour of Tlatonac. Dolores was sound asleep in Peter&rsquo;s cabin;  and Jack, now transformed to a civilised being, by washing and clothing, was  seated in the state-room, narrating his adventures to an attentive audience of  three. As for Cocom, he was squatting on the floor with a cigarette in his  mouth, grunting approval of Jack&rsquo;s story&mdash;which he told in Spanish, for the  benefit of Rafael, and modestly receiving the encomiums lavished on him by the  listeners. Philip and Don Rafael frequently interrupted him with exclamations  of surprise; but Peter, less skilful in understanding the Castilian tongue, had  to keep his attention fixed on every word that fell from Jack&rsquo;s lips. Under the  tutorship of Do&ntilde;a Serafina, the little doctor had made wonderful progress, and  now understood the Spanish language fairly well. It was at the conclusion of  this most extraordinary story that Philip addressed Jack as &ldquo;Baron Munchausen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  todos Santos!&rdquo; exclaimed Rafael, admiringly, following Philip&rsquo;s example, &ldquo;it is  wonderful. Mi amigo! I can never thank you sufficiently for all you have done  for my cousin. But, perchance,&rdquo; added the young captain, with a twinkle in his  eye, &ldquo;Dolores has already thanked you herself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores  will thank me when we arrive at Tlatonac,&rdquo; retorted Jack, sipping his wine. &ldquo;Our  circumstances were too perilous, Rafael, to admit of fine compliments.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Miguel will be pleased!&rdquo; remarked Peter, in fair Spanish. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will be more than pleased, Don Pedro,&rdquo; cried Rafael, seizing Jack&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;My  friend, for this you have done, I feel sure my father will grant you the desire  of your heart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!  Let Dolores marry an Americano?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why not, Se&ntilde;or? You have saved her life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly!  But Cocom saved mine, Rafael!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  that Cocom shall pass the rest of his days in peace and comfort,&rdquo; said Philip,  looking gratefully at the Indian. </p>
  <p>Cocom  shook his head with mournful composure. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  days of Cocom are numbered, Se&ntilde;ores. The Do&ntilde;a Dolores showed the opal to the  hounds of Ixtlilxochitli. By that they knew that the victim of the cycle, that  the guardian of the Chalchuih Tlatonac still live, and have stolen the sacred  stone. Cocom aided them to discover the secret way, and Ixtlilxochitli will  never forgive that betrayal. I am lost, Se&ntilde;ores. I shall die.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Es  verdad!&rdquo; exclaimed Rafael, earnestly, &ldquo;doubtless the Indians of Totatzine will  try and kill you, Cocom. But in Tlatonac, under the protection of the opal  flag, you are safe!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando! I shall die,&rdquo; repeated Cocom, stolidly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  you!&rdquo; interposed Jack, patting the old man on the head. &ldquo;I shall look after  you, my friend. You saved my life; I shall save yours. A fair exchange! Hark! a  gun!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is from the fort,&rdquo; said Philip, hastily rising, &ldquo;we are now in the harbour.  Come on deck, Jack. We shall be on shore in another twenty minutes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  at once went up, and Jack took off his hat with a reverential expression, when  he saw the silvery walls of Tlatonac once more glisten over the blue waters. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God, who has preserved us through many perils!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;  said Philip&rsquo;s deep voice, behind him &ldquo;Oh, Jack,&rdquo; he added, placing his hand on  his friend&rsquo;s shoulder, with deep emotion, &ldquo;if you only knew what agonies we  have undergone, thinking of your fate. When we found you were missing, I wished  to go back, at any risk, and headed the yacht for the harbour of Acauhtzin. But  that cursed Xuarez turned his guns on us, and, as <i>The Bohemian</i> would  have been smashed to pieces, we were forced to retreat. What a cur I felt then.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could not help it,&rdquo; said Jack, patting Philip&rsquo;s back, kindly. &ldquo;In an attempt to  rescue me, you would only have lost your own lives.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did what I could, Jack. At once I came back to Tlatonac, and implored Don  Francisco to send an army to Acauhtzin to your rescue. But it was impossible&mdash;the  torpederas had not arrived, and there were only some merchant-ships to take men  north-ward. Defended, as Acauhtzin was, by the war-ships, such an attempt would  have been foolhardy. We were forced to remain inactive at Tlatonac, not knowing  if you were dead or alive.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then the war broke out?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I told you; Don Hypolito, with his war-ship, is now besieging Janjalla. Tim,  Garibay, General Gigedo, and half the army, are there defending it. Tim wanted  to remain and search for you; but I insisted on his going, and told him I would  take <i>The Bohemian</i> up to Acauhtzin, under the Union Jack, to make  inquiries.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was lucky you did that,&rdquo; said Jack, with a grim smile, &ldquo;or those Indians would  have killed or recaptured us for sure.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  did not know it was you,&rdquo; interposed Peter, who had been listening,&mdash;they were  conversing in English. &ldquo;I saw you first, and thought it was only a canoe of  Indians being chased by others. Philip thought he would help the supposed  Indians, and fired those guns.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter  nearly fainted when we saw who the Indians were,&rdquo; laughed Philip, slipping his  arm within that of Jack&rsquo;s. &ldquo;However, &lsquo;all&rsquo;s well that ends well;&rsquo; and here you  are, safe and sound with Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  with the opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I never thought you would have got that stone, Jack. Your luck holds, old  fellow. The possession of the opal will give confidence to Tlatonac. Will it  not, Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say you, Se&ntilde;or Felipe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! Its possession will inspire confidence.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  a certainty, mi amigo. Our men will fight like devils, now they know the  fortune of the Chalchuih Tlatonac is on the side of the Junta. In the same way,  Don Hypolito&rsquo;s soldiers will lose heart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  they lose the war, that is all I care about. I would like to see that fiend of  a Xuarez punished,&rdquo; said Jack, savagely. &ldquo;By the way, Philip, I suppose you got  no satisfaction at Acauhtzin this trip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the forts opened fire, and would not let me enter the harbour. Luckily, the  war-ships were all south, as I knew, or we would have been smashed up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  war-ships are bombarding Janjalla, you told me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  we hope, however, that it will hold out till the torpederas go south.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  they arrived?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yonder.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  pointed to the left, and there, under the walls of the fort, lay two long black  objects, with stumpy black funnels. More than this, a large ship of some two  thousand five hundred tons was anchored close at hand. Jack was astonished to  see the change in the port since he had last beheld Tlatonac. Then it was quiet  and peaceful-looking, now, what with ships and the two torpedo-boats, black  wasps of the ocean, as they were, lying under the walls, the walls themselves  spotted with the muzzles of heavy guns, the glitter of arms and uniforms  outside the sea-gate, and the blaring of distant trumpets, the roll of drums,  the aspect was of the most warlike character. He glanced at the  spiteful-looking torpedo-boats, and turning towards Philip, mutely demanded an  explanation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see Cholacaca is in the thick of it,&rdquo; said the baronet, gaily. &ldquo;You have been  away close on three weeks, and during that time neither Don Hypolito nor the  Junta have been idle. The former has sent his troops and war-ships to Janjalla,  and the latter is busy fixing up the torpederas to have a fight with <i>The  Pizarro</i> and her consorts down south.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that ship?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>The  Iturbide</i>. She is a Cuban mail steamer requisitioned by the Junta, and  turned into an armed cruiser for this war. With her and the torpederas, Don  Hypolito&rsquo;s fleet won&rsquo;t have such a pleasant time as they think.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  Don Rafael command <i>The Iturbide?</i>&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  mi amigo!&rdquo; cried Rafael, overhearing this question. &ldquo;Not I. Yonder torpedo-boat  is under my charge, and in that, Don Juan, you must come with me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  do you go south?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  day after to-morrow. At the same time regiments march by land to Gigedo, at  Janjalla. Oh, the game has begun, Juan, and the opal burns red!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will now burn whatever colour we like,&rdquo; retorted Jack, shrugging his shoulders.  &ldquo;I saw the way those priests managed the trick. It was&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  can tell us all that in the patio of Casa Maraquando,&rdquo; interrupted Philip,  hastily. &ldquo;See, the anchor is down, so we had better go ashore at once, and  relieve the minds of Don Miguel and the ladies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  is already over the side,&rdquo; said Peter, pointing to a small canoe skimming the  waves. &ldquo;You will receive an ovation on your way through the city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greatness  is thrust upon me,&rdquo; laughed Jack, who was wonderfully lighthearted now that  they were safe, &ldquo;Where is Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  coming on deck.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  girl still wore her Indian dress, as Philip, being a bachelor, had no feminine  gear on board. She had, however, washed the paint from her face, and looked  wonderfully bright and charming in her savage toilette. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pocahontas!&rdquo;  said Philip, in Jack&rsquo;s ear, as she approached. &ldquo;Lucky man. I would I were  Captain John Smith.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Eulalia?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can tell you about Eulalia,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Grench, a trifle maliciously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  do nothing of the sort, Peter,&rdquo; said Philip, sharply. &ldquo;I will tell Jack all about  it myself. You stick to your beetles and Do&ntilde;a Serafina.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a  Serafina!&rdquo; cried Dolores, overhearing the name. &ldquo;Oh, Se&ntilde;or Felipe, how I do  wish to see my dear aunt.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a few minutes, Se&ntilde;orita. See, the boat is waiting. We will all go on shore at  once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  seems to be a row on shore,&rdquo; remarked Jack, as they climbed down the side of  the yacht. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  exclaimed Rafael, laughing. &ldquo;Cocom has told them all. The news is passing from  mouth to mouth. Soon it will be all over the city. Harken to the cries, mis  amigos.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vive  el Americano! El opalo! Dios lo pague, Do&ntilde;a Dolores!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  shout for one, a shout for all,&rdquo; observed Jack, philosophically. &ldquo;They should  also shout, &lsquo;God reward Cocom!&rsquo; for without Him we would not be here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were welcomed on shore by a frantic crowd. The Cholacacans have all the  vivacity and impulsiveness of southern nature. Nothing do they love so much as  a public demonstration; therefore, on this occasion they gave full rein to  their enthusiasm. In their eyes, Jack was a hero, Dolores a heroine, and,  accordingly, they were almost stunned with vociferous applause. The fact that  the opal, that sacred gem, so inextricably interwoven with the traditions of  the Republic, was now in the city itself, wrought them up to a pitch of frenzy.  With the Chalchuih Tlatonac in their midst, they could not fail to conquer the  rebels; it was the palladium of the Republic, the genius of Tlatonac, and by it  would they be enabled to overwhelm their enemies. The superstitious belief they  had in the jewel was almost terrible. It glittered on the banners of Cholacaca,  it coloured the whole patriotic feelings of the inhabitants. The opal meant  victory to its possessors, and, lo! they held it safely in the capital. </p>
  <p>Up  to the sea-gate the lovers passed, surrounded by their friends. On either side  the vast crowd heaved like a great sea. Constant cries saluted Jack, Dolores,  the opal; and to show the public that Cocom had spoken truly, Duval whispered a  few words to his companion. In a moment she had drawn forth the gem from her  breast, and held it up in full sight of the populace. The tumult sank to a dead  stillness, as if by magic, and everyone drew a deep breath of awe and  admiration as the splendid jewel flashed its lightnings in the sun. A crimson  beam flared forth, owing to the position in which it was held by Dolores. It  burned in her fingers like a red-hot coal. The crowd, in their superstition,  took it as a sign from heaven, and burst out into frenzied cries. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guerra!  Guerra! El opalo! Guerra! Abajo los rebeledes!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then  some excited person began chanting the national song of the opal. In a moment  the mob caught at the idea, and the great body of sound thundered to the sky. </p>
  <p class="poem">Kneel  at the shrine while the future discerning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See  how the crimson ray strengthens and glows;<br>
  Red  as the sunset the opal is burning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Red  is prophetic of death to our foes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel like a victorious general,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling at all this enthusiasm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pity Tim isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; remarked Peter, whose usually meek eyes were flashing  like stars behind his spectacles; &ldquo;he does so like a row.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  be having plenty where he is,&rdquo; said Philip, grimly; &ldquo;but look at that fellow  going to do the Raleigh business with his zarape.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time they had passed into the Calle Otumba, and a frantic young Spaniard,  rushing forward, flung his cloak on the ground for Dolores to walk across. The  idea pleased the people, and in a few moments the whole way up to the Casa  Maraquando was spread with zarapes. Then flowers were flung before them in profusion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  primrose path of dalliance,&rdquo; quoth Philip, laughing. &ldquo;I hope these excited  people won&rsquo;t throw their bodies next for us to walk over. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Do&ntilde;a  Dolores. You have your guard of honour to protect you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Indeed,  this frenzied demonstration rather scared the girl. All the colour faded out of  her face, and slipping the opal into her bosom, she shrank terrified against  her lover. Jack took her arm within his own and his touch gave her more  confidence; but what with the singing, shouting, cloak-flinging, flower  throwing, and what not, they both felt quite worn out, and were not at all  sorry to at length arrive at the door of the Casa Maraquando. </p>
  <p>The  news of their arrival had preceded them, as a matter of course, and Don Miguel,  with outstretched arms, was waiting in the gateway to receive them. Dolores,  with a cry of delight, flung herself on the breast of her uncle, who at once  carried her into the patio. Then the rest of the party followed, and the doors  were shut against the mob, which still remained in the street, terribly  excited. After a time, the tumult quietened down like a sea after a storm, and  the throng streamed into the Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres to organise a  demonstration to the honour and glory of the Chalchuih Tlatonac and its  guardian. </p>
  <p>In  the patio, Dolores was received with noisy demonstrations by Do&ntilde;a Serafina, and  with joyful tears by Eulalia. It was some time, however, before Don Miguel  could part from his niece, for he held her to his breast, calling upon all the  saints to shower blessings on her head. Never had the stately Spaniard been so  moved, and when he delivered his niece over to the tender embraces of Serafina  and Eulalia, he turned towards Jack, with tears in his eyes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Juan,&rdquo; he said, in a voice of emotion, grasping the young man&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I can  never repay you for what you have done. From this moment you may command the  services, and the lives of myself and those dear to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  could say no more, but, with a wave of his hand, walked to the other end of the  court to conceal his emotion. Jack was scarcely less moved, and as for Dolores,  she was being overwhelmed by her cousin and aunt. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  one,&rdquo; chattered the old lady, noisily; &ldquo;now that thou art safe, I vow twenty  candles to the Virgin, who has thus watched over thee, and to San Juan, who is  the patron saint of your preserver.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  also!&rdquo; cried Eulalia, who had in some mysterious way become possessed of the  history. &ldquo;I vow a jewel to San Felipe, for it was his namesake who preserved  them from the Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  and Philip were much gratified by these marks of attention; but Peter, being  left out in the cold, was inclined to be cross. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  might vow a candle or so to San Pedro,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;seeing the whole Church  of Rome is under his care.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Offer  him some beetles, Peter,&rdquo; said Jack, in the little doctor&rsquo;s ear; but the  suggestion was not received favourably by the entomologist. </p>
  <p>Having  wept and cried over Dolores to their hearts&rsquo; content, the ladies proceeded to  lead her away to resume her own dress; but before doing so, both aunt and niece  flung themselves on Jack&rsquo;s neck, and embraced him with fervour. Duval did not  mind a kiss from Eulalia, but he objected to the aunt. Nevertheless, as he had  to take the bitter with the sweet, he passively submitted to be made much of. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caro,  Se&ntilde;or! You are an angel from heaven,&rdquo; cried Serafina, with fervour. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  valiant as the Cid,&rdquo; said Eulalia, kissing Jack&rsquo;s bronzed cheek. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will pray for you to the saints.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  face shall be in my soul!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  last remark came from Eulalia, whereat Philip winced. Seeing this, Jack brought  the duet to a speedy end. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am your servant, Se&ntilde;oritas! What I have done is nothing, and thanks are rather  due to Cocom than to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  without you, Don Juan, Cocom could not have saved Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  without the boat of Se&ntilde;or Felipe,&rdquo; added Eulalia, glancing at the baronet, &ldquo;none  of the three would be here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  made a polite gesture of dissent, though in his heart he was glad that Eulalia  inclined so kindly towards him. Then Jack kissed the hands of the ladies in a  most gallant fashion, and they, after removing Dolores once more from the arms  of Don Miguel, whither she had flown, led her out of the patio. This being  done, while waiting for the evening meal, Don Miguel demanded from Jack an  account of his adventures, a request which was at once seconded by Philip,  Rafael, and Peter, who protested that they could listen to a dozen repetitions  of his hairbreadth escapes. Thus adjured, Jack, with as much suppression of himself  as possible, narrated the events which had taken place from the earliest period  of his capture by Xuarez down to the present time when he was rescued by  Philip. Frequently the story was interrupted by ejaculations from his auditors,  and by the time the story was finished they were all furious with Don Hypolito,  particularly Se&ntilde;or Maraquando. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  think, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he cried, indignantly, &ldquo;that I have touched the hand of that  man. Carambo! To give up a white man to the cursed altar of Huitzilopochtli. It  is infamous! It is unheard of!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you forget, Se&ntilde;or, he is a pure-blooded Indian.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ever thought so,&rdquo; said Rafael, sagely. &ldquo;There were many ways about Xuarez, my  father, that were not those of a Spaniard.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indian  or no Indian,&rdquo; growled Philip, clenching his fist, &ldquo;if I get within striking  distance of the scoundrel, I won&rsquo;t leave a whole bone in his body.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  will I,&rdquo; said the meek Peter, fiercely, &ldquo;fancy him wanting to lay Jack out on a  jasper stone like a corpse on a dissecting-table.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet, you Chamber of Horrors,&rdquo; said the baronet, angrily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mention such  a thing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is one great good gained out of much evil,&rdquo; observed Don Miguel, reflectively; &ldquo;the  possession of the opal strengthens us greatly against Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo; asked Philip, curiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  this priest, Ixtlilxochitli, will not be able to manage the Indians for him  without the stone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid, Se&ntilde;or, the mischief is done,&rdquo; said Jack, gravely, &ldquo;the opal declared  war, and now the Indians will join Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity we can&rsquo;t get up a counter prophecy, and make the opal declare peace,&rdquo;  remarked Philip, quietly; &ldquo;then the Indians would take no part in the war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancy that is impossible,&rdquo; said Miguel, shaking his head. &ldquo;I would it could be  so. If the Indians would only keep quiet, Xuarez would find great difficulty in  accomplishing his plans. Should Janjalla fall, and Xuarez concentrate his own  men and the Indians before Tlatonac, it will be hard to beat them back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janjalla  will not fall,&rdquo; cried Rafael, in a fiery tone; &ldquo;there are brave men defending  it. They will hold out till reinforced. The regiments march southward  to-morrow, the torpederas and <i>The Iturbide</i> go the next day; and between  the two we shall conquer these rebels.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will try, at all events, my son,&rdquo; said Maraquando, smiling at the young man&rsquo;s  enthusiasm; &ldquo;but, meanwhile, it is best to look on both sides of the question.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  the opal stone in Tlatonac, we cannot fail,&rdquo; declared Jack. &ldquo;You have seen it,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. Dolores was too agitated to show it to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is my cousin,&rdquo; said Rafael, rising to his feet. &ldquo;She brings the opal with her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Before  he finished the sentence, Dolores, now arrayed in her European dress, entered  the patio, followed by Do&ntilde;a Serafina and Eulalia uttering cries of admiration.  In her hand she carried the Harlequin Opal, which glittered faintly in the dim  light. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,  uncle!&rdquo; cried Dolores, placing the gem in Maraquando&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I give you the  luck of Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  this is the famous stone?&rdquo; said Miguel, gazing at the wonderful play of  colours, &ldquo;I do not wonder it is held sacred. So beautiful a jewel I have never  yet beheld.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando, I disagree with you,&rdquo; observed Jack, in a nervous voice; &ldquo;there  is a jewel still more beautiful in my eyes&mdash;Dolores!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel started and stared in amazement at the young couple, who were now  standing hand in hand before him. He could not understand the meaning of either  the attitude or speech. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  brother,&rdquo; whispered Serafina, seizing the situation with feminine quickness, &ldquo;it  is love!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Jack, firmly, &ldquo;it is love. I have worshipped your niece these many months,  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando, but I dared not to tell you of that love, seeing I was an  Englishman, a heretic. Now, however, if I have done anything to deserve your  gratitude, I ask you, in the presence of my friends, to give your consent to  the marriage of Dolores and myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel was silent for a few moments, and then turned slowly towards his niece. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you love Don Juan, Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  raised her head and looked not at her questioner, but at Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she replied simply, &ldquo;I have loved him this long time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  said Maraquando, with great dignity, &ldquo;it is true you are not of our race; but  during the time I have known you I have seen nothing in you but what I admire  and respect. In rescuing my niece from the Shrine of the Opal at Totatzine, you  have acted like a chivalrous gentleman. To your marriage I gladly give my  consent. Take Dolores as your wife, Se&ntilde;or, and with her this.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  held out for Jack&rsquo;s acceptance the Harlequin Opal. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIII"></a>Chapter XXIII<br>
    Away To The Front</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">One  kiss! &lsquo;tis our last one; the horses await,<br>
    And swift through the midnight I ride to my fate.<br>
  &lsquo;Tis life for thy lover, or death it may be,<br>
    But living or dying, my thought is for thee.<br>
    Who knows when my arms shall enfold thee again<br>
    The future hides ever its joy and its pain.<br>
    I leave thee for battle, my dear one, my bride,<br>
    And on, through the darkness, I ride, and I ride.<br>
    Light hand on the bridle, light heart in my breast,<br>
    A bunch of your ribbons flaunt gay on my crest.<br>
    I go not in sorrow, but hasten with glee,<br>
    To fight for my country, my honour, and thee.<br>
    Soon wilt thou in triumph behold me, my sweet,<br>
    Return with my laurels to cast at thy feet.<br>
    I dream of a future with thee by my side,<br>
    As on, through the darkness, I ride, and I ride.</p>
  <p>Jack&rsquo;s  position was now similar to that of Tantalus. Love was within his reach, yet he  dared not to grasp it, for on the next day he was to depart with Don Rafael for  Janjalla, in the torpedera <i>Montezuma</i>. Peter had also been invited to  visit the seat of war, and although a man of peace, decided to go, as he was  anxious about Tim. That redoubtable warrior was at Janjalla, with General  Gigedo, busily engaged in wiring sensational accounts of the siege to <i>The  Morning Planet</i>. Tim was particularly anxious that Janjalla should not fall  into the hands of Don Hypolito, as it was the spot whence started the  telegraph-wires for the south. If Xuarez captured the town, the forces of the Junta  would be driven back to Tlatonac, and as likely as not the wires would be cut  by the rebels, therefore Tim would be unable to transmit news to England. As it  was, he made good use of his time, and took full possession of the  telegraph-office in Janjalla. </p>
  <p>As  to Philip, he decided to march by land with the Regimiento de los Caballeros,  of which corps he was now an officer. Colonel Garibay, the commander of the  regiment, was already at Janjalla, having been sent there by President Gomez on  a special message to General Gigedo. The regiment was, therefore, under the  command of Captain Velez, who was a great admirer of Philip, and made much of  him. Altogether reinforcements amounting to close on a thousand men were now on  their way south, to assist General Gigedo in holding Janjalla, and the  torpederas, in company with the armed cruiser <i>Iturbide</i>, were to proceed  there by sea, in order to destroy, if possible, the three ships of the enemy  now bombarding the town. </p>
  <p>There  was no doubt that the war had begun badly for the Junta, but this was the fault  of President Gomez. A more obstinate man never existed, and having made up his  mind that Xuarez would attack Tlatonac without delay, he had foolishly  withdrawn the garrison from Janjalla, Puebla de los Naranjos, Chichimec, and  other towns, for the protection of the capital. It was in vain that Don Miguel,  warned by his son, represented that it was more than probable Xuarez would  attack Janjalla first, in order to concentrate his troops in the south, and so  march them across the plains to Tlatonac. The President refused to take this  view of the matter, and by the withdrawal of the garrisons, left the whole of  Southern Cholacaca in an unprotected condition. </p>
  <p>The  effect of this policy was most disastrous. Warned by his spies that but a  feeble defence could be offered by Janjalla, Don Hypolito sent southward,  without delay, transports filled with troops, and a convoy of the three  war-ships. He hoped to capture and garrison Janjalla with his own men before  the Junta became aware of his design, and thus secure an important town as the  basis of his operations. At Acauhtzin he was hemmed in by mountains, unable to  march his troops overland to the capital; but in the south, between Janjalla  and Tlatonac were vast alluvial plains, over which he could lead his army. It  was his intention to effect a conjunction with the Forest Indians before the  walls of the Opal City, and having ordered his war-ships to bombard it by sea,  thus attack the capital on two sides at once. Between two fires, he deemed that  the city would speedily yield. </p>
  <p>Becoming  aware that the war-ships had gone south, Don Francisco speedily saw how  foolishly he had acted, and ordered five hundred men to at once proceed to  Janjalla, to defend it against the rebels. He sent back the troops to garrison  the inland towns, and thus hoped to stretch a barrier between the rebels and  the capital. The whole danger lay in the south, for as yet the Indians were  quiet, and no rising was apprehended on their part, though Jack was doubtful as  to the advisability of trusting to appearances. He quite believed that the  campaign would be conducted by Xuarez, as had been prophesied by Don Rafael,  and could not help deploring that such an incompetent man as Gomez was at the  head of affairs. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he would only leave things alone, and not interfere,&rdquo; he said to Philip, on the  eve of departure. &ldquo;His generals know more about warfare than he does. The man&rsquo;s  an ass.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  with you there,&rdquo; replied Philip, heartily; &ldquo;he has made a muddle of things already.  Who but an ass would send only five hundred men to Janjalla, when it is about  to be bombarded by three men-of-war, and attacked by two thousand rebel troops?  Even this reinforcement is not strong enough. Sending his troops southward in  these dribblets will end in their being cut to pieces. I would not be surprised  if even now Xuarez was in possession of Janjalla, and, with such a basis for  operations, he will make it hot for the Republic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think ought to have been done?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was speaking to Colonel Garibay, and we both came to the same conclusion. Don  Francisco ought to have taken the warning of Rafael, and concentrated most of  the troops at Janjalla. The capital is well defended by its forts, and can look  after itself. Janjalla, on the other hand, is in no fit state of defence to  resist the heavy guns of three ships pounding at its walls. As I take it, the  great aim should be to prevent Don Hypolito from getting a footing in the south  by capturing Janjalla. Then he would have nothing but the sea and Acauhtzin for  a field of operations. In the north, owing to the mountains, he can do nothing,  and now we have the torpederas, he cannot have it all his own way at sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  and supposing he captures Janjalla?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  shrugged his shoulders. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  result is plain enough. Instead of mountains between this and Tlatonac, he has  nothing but plains on which he can man&oelig;uvre his troops. He will either capture  the intervening towns or seduce them to his cause. Then he will arrive at  Tlatonac, and while he is besieging it from the inland, his fleet will bombard  it from the sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if the torpederas don&rsquo;t sink his ships.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! I am talking of the campaign from Don Hypolito&rsquo;s point of view. But one  thing is certain. If he captures Janjalla, this war may be prolonged for  months. Think of the ruin that will mean to the country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  spoke truly. Hitherto Cholacaca had enjoyed immunity from the horrors of war.  From the year 1840, when under the leadership of Zuloaga, the Republic had thrown  off the yoke of Spain, there had been peace for a period of forty-five years.  Those fratricidal wars which constantly convulsed the communities of South  America were not to be found in the history of Cholacaca. The Republic kept  well within her borders, was at peace with her neighbours, and under the rule  of wise rulers, devoted herself to improving her material condition. </p>
  <p>It  was true that a greater part of the country consisted of wild forests filled  with unconquered Indians, but the Cholacacans had always been able to keep  these savages at bay. The coast-line of the north, the immense alluvial plains  of the south, were thoroughly civilised, and covered with thriving towns. The  two secondary capitals, Janjalla in the south, Acauhtzin in the north, looked  up to and respected their powerful sister city, Tlatonac, who held her seat in  the central portion of the sea-board. Yet it must be admitted that they bore a  grudge against her, as nearly all the commerce of the country poured into her  walls, from thence to be distributed over the civilised world. Why should  Tlatonac be the capital when they were each equally suited for the post? They  had rich countries behind them, they exported goods far and wide, they had  their municipal institutions, their walls, ramparts, palaces, and magnificent  churches. Why, therefore, should they be forced to send their ships to the port  of Tlatonac, there to pay toll and custom duties? The Junta had constituted  Tlatonac the starting-point of all vessels, and according to law, ships from  the north and south were forced, both in going and coming, to report themselves  at the capital. By this means Tlatonac dominated her sister cities, and held  them firmly under her thumb. </p>
  <p>The  reason that Tlatonac was chosen to be the capital by Zuloaga was very plain. It  was situated in the centre of the coast-line, and thus commanded equally the  north and the south. It had been the shrine of the opal, and the traditions of  that stone closely interwoven with the history of the country. Greatest reason  of all, the harbour was the finest in Cholacaca. Moreover, roads from most of  the inland towns diverged to the capital, thus rendering communication easy;  while Janjalla, environed by swamps, and Acauhtzin girdled by forests, were  more or less shut off from the heart of the country. When inland traders could  transport their goods to Tlatonac at half the cost they could take them to  either of the other two towns, it was not likely, from a commercial point of  view, that they would ever forsake the capital. Under the circumstances, it can  well be seen that Gomez had good reason to doubt the fidelity of Janjalla. The  northern town had, through jealousy of Tlatonac, sided with the rebels, and it  was just possible that the southern city might follow suit. The only thing in  favour of Janjalla remaining faithful was that while both towns were jealous of  the capital, they were equally jealous of one another. The populace of Janjalla  knew well that if Xuarez conquered that he would transfer the seat of  Government to Acauhtzin out of gratitude for its help, and would certainly not  assist a cause calculated to elevate a rival city. </p>
  <p>The  Republic was very wealthy. She exported tobacco, coffee, cacao, cotton, rice,  maize, and cattle. Her plains were covered with grain, her mountains were rich  in ores, and her population extremely industrious. With the exception of the  area covered by the forests, the whole country was cultivated, and now the  formation of a railway through the forests, up to Acauhtzin promised the opening  up of the northern lands. Already fifty miles of railway had pierced the  enormous belt of timber lying between Acauhtzin and the capital. From the main  line, branches were to extend to the different towns, so as to connect them  with the seat of Government. Unfortunately, all this promise of prosperity was  now interrupted by the war. </p>
  <p>There  was no doubt that Don Hypolito was a source of infinite trouble to the country.  This Indian coming from the sacred city of Totatzine, was now revenging himself  on the descendants of the Conquistadores, for their treatment of his ancestors.  He had no genuine cause for dissatisfaction, as at the time when he raised the  standard of revolt, the country was thoroughly prosperous. The wealth gained by  the exports of the Republic was used by her Presidents to open up the interior  of the continent, and to supply Tlatonac with all the refinements of  civilisation. The army was well drilled, well clothed, well armed. The walls of  the city were built on the most approved system of engineering science, the  principal squares were lighted by electricity, millions had been expended on  drainage, in the formation of interior roads, in the construction of the  proposed railway to Acauhtzin. The Republic had even formed the nucleus of a  navy, and had already three war-ships in hand, and two torpederas coming, when  the war broke out. </p>
  <p>Now  the war-ships had revolted to Xuarez, the northern capital was bound to his  cause, and this ambitious Indian, assuming the name and race of a Spaniard, had  plunged the country into what promised to be a disastrous war. The effect was  ruinous. Business was at a standstill, exports were stopped, the capital was  declared in a state of siege, and the whole country resounded with the tramp of  armies, the clash of arms, the thunder of cannon. Industry was paralysed, and  many of the country-people crowding to the capital, rendered food dear. To  avoid the horrors of famine and ruin which threatened the Republic, it was  absolutely necessary that Xuarez should be crushed at once. </p>
  <p>President  Gomez was no warrior certainly, but he was a judicious ruler&mdash;in time of peace.  He saw at once the terrible calamities likely to ensue should the war be  prolonged, and already regretted his folly in not taking the advice of Don  Miguel. So far as was possible, he repaired his mistakes. A thousand men were  sent to the relief of Janjalla by land, and <i>The Iturbide</i>, in company  with the torpederas, left for the seat of war by sea. If the reinforcements  could succour Janjalla in time, if the torpederas could sink the rebel ships,  then there would be some hope of the war being brought to a speedy conclusion.  But as it was, the whole danger lay in the probability of Don Hypolito  capturing Janjalla, from whence he could threaten the capital and intervening  towns. </p>
  <p>Jack  was very anxious that Philip should come with him in <i>The Montezuma</i>, but  the baronet was obstinately set on going with his regiment. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be in Janjalla before you, Jack; for between you and the town lie the  war-ships, while we have but to march across those easy plains in safety.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if the Indians don&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense;  there is no chance of that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so certain, Philip. Don Hypolito has his spies, as you know; and when he  hears that reinforcements are advancing southward, he will probably send word  to Ixtlilxochitli to have them intercepted. As you know, the plains are fringed  to the west by the forests, so the Indians could break out from thence, and  perhaps exterminate the troops.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  exterminate a thousand soldiers, armed with rifles? Impossible!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it does seem impossible. However, as you won&rsquo;t come with me, go as you please.  We shall meet at Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I shall see you from the walls being chased, by <i>The Pizarro</i> and <i>The  Cortes</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were talking in the patio of the Casa Maraquando, and Philip was tricked out in  all the bravery of his uniform. He looked remarkably handsome and Eulalia  sighed as she thought he was about to leave her. All coquetry had been laid  aside, and she had confessed that she was deeply in love with the Americano.  Philip fully returned her affection, and intended, on returning from Janjalla,  to ask Don Miguel to permit them to be married on the same day as Jack and  Dolores. Turning away from Jack, he caught sight of Eulalia&rsquo;s pensive face, and  heard her plaintive little sigh. In an instant he was by her side. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querida,&rdquo;  he whispered tenderly, &ldquo;you must not be sad. I go forth to bring home laurels  to lay at your feet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather you were at my feet, Felipe,&rdquo; sobbed Eulalia. &ldquo;This horrid war! I  am sure you will be killed, and then I shall die. Oh yes, mi alma, I shall  assuredly die.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were standing in a secluded corner of the patio. Neither Don Miguel or Serafina  were in sight, so Philip, taking advantage of the situation, kissed Eulalia  once, twice, thrice. It was true Jack and Dolores were not far off, but they  were too busy with each other to take much notice. Eulalia sobbed on Philip&rsquo;s  breast, vowed she would die if he left her, told him to march forth and be a  hero at once, commanded him to remain at Tlatonac, ordered him to depart for  Janjalla, and thus contradicting herself every moment, smiled and wept in  turns. Finally, she produced a little gold cross. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is for thee, my own one,&rdquo; she whispered slipping it into his hand. &ldquo;It has been  blessed by Padre Ignatius. Nought can hurt thee while the sacred thing is on  thy heart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  kissed the cross, kissed Eulalia, and swore he would never part with it  throughout the campaign. In the middle of their tender leave-taking, a trumpet  pealed forth in the Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres. It was the signal for  departure. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go! Farewell, my dear one. Watch from the azotea, and let your face be the  last thing I behold in Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adios,  mi alma,&rdquo; murmured Eulalia, and embraced him fondly, after which, Philip,  turning hastily away, shook hands with Jack, and kissed the hands of Dolores  and Serafina, the latter of whom had just entered the patio. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adieu,  dear ladies. Good-bye, Jack. Take care of yourself, and don&rsquo;t be carried off to  any more Indian cities. We meet at Philippi. Adios!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>With  a wave of his hand he was gone, and Jack escorted the ladies to the azotea to  watch the regiments departing. The Plaza was crowded with soldiers and women,  the latter taking tearful leave of those marching to the front. President  Gomez, attended by a brilliant staff, among whom Jack saw Don Miguel and his  son, made a speech full of fire and patriotism, which caused the utmost  enthusiasm. Then the banners of the different regiments were unfurled, the  bands began to play the March of Zuloaga, and the soldiers began to file out of  the square by the Calle Otumba. </p>
  <p>Regiment  after regiment marched past, through streets wreathed with flowers, amid tears,  cheers, and wavings of handkerchiefs. The house-tops were crowded with ladies  looking down on the troops. They made a gallant show as they tramped along with  waving plumes and glittering arms. The cavalry soldiers came first, and those  on the azotea of the Casa Maraquando saw Sir Philip riding by the side of  Captain Velez, at the head of the Regimiento de los Caballeros. The banners  streamed in the air, the horses champed their bits, and proudly pawed the  earth, and, one vast rainbow of hues, this splendid body of men moved majestically  past. Philip was riding with his drawn sword sloping over his shoulder, and as  he passed the Casa Maraquando, looked up, and saluted the ladies. Eulalia  hastily snatching a bunch of jasmine from her breast, let it drop when he was  directly underneath. The baronet dexterously caught it, and pressing a kiss on  the blossoms, fastened them in his jacket. In another minute or so, he  disappeared round the corner of the street on the way to the Puerta de la  Culebra, from whence the troops marched southward to Janjalla. </p>
  <p>After  the disappearance of Philip, Eulalia took no further interest in the  proceedings of the day, and retired to her room, followed by Dolores, who  strove to console her. Jack not caring for the sole companionship of Do&ntilde;a  Serafina, excused himself on the plea that he wanted to ride after the troops  and give Philip a message to Tim. Do&ntilde;a Serafina graciously permitted him to  depart, and he dashed out of the house, flung himself on his horse, which was  waiting at the door, and was about to ride towards the Puerta de la Culebra  when Don Rafael came riding at full speed out of the Plaza! The young man  seemed much excited, and in his headlong rush knocked down two or three people,  so crowded was the street. Never heeding their cries, he raced past Jack,  waving his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To <i>The Montezuma</i>, mi amigo! News of the war-ships.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Anxious  to know what fresh event had taken place, and fearful that Janjalla had fallen,  Jack spurred his horse after Rafael, and at a break-neck speed they clattered  down the street to the sea-gate scattering the crowd in every direction. </p>
  <p>Outside  the sea-gate, Rafael headed to the left, where the torpedera <i>Montezuma</i> was lying, and jumping off his horse, threw the reins to a peon, and called a  boat. Jack followed his example, and in a few moments they were pulling for the  torpedo-vessel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo  mi amigo!&rdquo; said Jack, breathlessly, &ldquo;you ride like the devil. What is the  matter now?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  Excellency has just received news that two of the war-ships have returned to  Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Have they given up the siege?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  They are acting as convoy to the transports. Xuarez is sending more troops  south, and, knowing that our torpederas are not ready, thinks that <i>The  Pizarro</i>, single-handed, is sufficient to blockade Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he has landed his other troops?&rdquo; said Jack, as they sprang on board <i>The  Montezuma</i>. &ldquo;The ship guns have evidently silenced the forts, and permitted  the rebels to get on shore.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely!  But what matter? Reinforcements are now on their way by land, and we, my  friend, will start to-morrow by sea to smash up <i>The Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  the torpederas be ready?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  must be ready!&rdquo; cried Rafael, stamping his foot. &ldquo;We may never get such another  chance. If we can only sink <i>The Pizarro</i>, it will dishearten the troops of  Xuarez now besieging Janjalla, and they can be easily defeated.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we can manage that, it will be a sad blow to Don Hypolito!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  so I should think,&rdquo; replied Rafael, laughing gaily. &ldquo;He will come south with  more troops, and find Janjalla occupied by us, and his way barred by two  torpederas and <i>The Iturbide</i>. Then <i>The Pizarro&rsquo;s</i> loss won&rsquo;t please  him. Carajo! no.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  But you forget <i>The Pizarro</i> has search-lights, torpedo-netting&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the last, mi amigo!&rdquo; interrupted Rafael quickly. &ldquo;I told you before, the  netting was left behind in Tlatonac when the war-ships left for Acauhtzin. As  to the search-lights, she can keep them on <i>The Iturbide</i> or on the other  torpedera. Then, my friend, <i>The Montezuma</i> will make things unpleasant  for her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a mere chance, Rafael!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quien  sabe!&rdquo; retorted the young man, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;all warfare is mere  chance. Come and look over the boat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>As  the fittings of the torpederas were somewhat complicated, engineers had been  sent out from England in charge, and these, being paid heavily by the Junta,  remained to man&oelig;uvre the boats. Among them Jack discovered a Scotchman, from  Aberdeen, with whom he struck up a friendship. This gentleman, whose clan was  Mackenzie, showed them all over the boat, and spoke in terms of great affection  of the Whitehead torpedoes. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  mon!&rdquo; he observed to Jack, as they surveyed those triumphs of modern warfare, &ldquo;jouist  gie her a shove, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll smash the hail boatie to bits&mdash;into sma&rsquo; bits.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is if the ship you propose to smash doesn&rsquo;t bring her heavy guns to bear on  this boat.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hoots!  hoots! mon. <i>The Montyzumy</i> can gang her ain gait. Nineteen knots an hour!  Ma certie, it wud tack a braw gun to catch the likes o&rsquo; her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>When  they returned on deck from their inspection of the ship, a note was brought to  Rafael, from Captain Pedraza, of <i>The Iturbide</i>, requesting his presence  on board. They dropped into a boat, and were speedily clambering up the giant  sides of the cruiser. Being conducted to the state-room, they found Captain Pedraza,  surrounded by his officers, reading a message from the President. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ola  mis amigos!&rdquo; cried the captain, gaily, &ldquo;you are just in time. Se&ntilde;or Juan, I am  your servant. Don Rafael, we leave Tlatonac for Janjalla to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  in the afternoon?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo.  So as to reach Janjalla at night. <i>The Pizarro</i> is lying there in the  harbour, and, under cover of darkness, we may be able to sink her either with  our guns or by means of torpedoes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  the torpederas be ready?&rdquo; asked Jack, for the second time. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be certain of that,&rdquo; said Rafael, significantly. &ldquo;I will guarantee that <i>The  Montezuma</i> will be able to start at the appointed time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I can say the same of <i>The Zuloaga</i>,&rdquo; observed a slim man, in whom Jack  recognised the commander of the other torpedo-boat. &ldquo;I think, Se&ntilde;or, it can be  looked on as certain that all three can depart.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>After  this a babel of talk ensued concerning the chances of surprising <i>The Pizarro</i>.  Some proposed one place, some another, and amid all the excitement, Jack,  growing weary of the arguing, slipped out of the saloon, and went ashore, so as  to have as much time as possible with Dolores before departure. </p>
  <p>He  strolled along the sea-shore, and met Cocom just outside the sea-gate. The old  man saluted him gravely&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  he said, mysteriously approaching Jack; &ldquo;beware of Ixtlilxochitli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Cocom?&rdquo; asked Duval, rather startled. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Indians, Se&ntilde;or, are now on the war-path&mdash;to the south,&rdquo; added Cocom,  significantly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Heaven!&rdquo; ejaculated the young man, horror-struck. &ldquo;They intend to surprise the  reinforcements.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so, Se&ntilde;or. But I, Cocom, have sent runners after them to warn the Se&ntilde;ors.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Cocom, you are the safeguard of Cholacaca!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I, Se&ntilde;or; but the Chalchuih Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I haven&rsquo;t much belief in that.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Juan!&rdquo; said Cocom, significantly; &ldquo;the Indians obeyed the stone implicitly&mdash;it  is sacred. What it speaks they do. Red is burned and war was proclaimed. But,  Se&ntilde;or, if it flamed blue, then would the Indians be at peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Before  Jack could say a word, Cocom mysteriously slipped away, leaving the young man  sorely puzzled as to his meaning. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  confounded opal,&rdquo; he said, as he resumed his way towards the Casa Maraquando, &ldquo;it  meets one at every turn. They say opals are unlucky, and certainly the  Chalchuih Tlatonac has not brought much luck to us as yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIV"></a>Chapter XXIV<br>
    A Naval Engagement&mdash;New Style</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">&ldquo;Wot!  fightin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the sailor man to me<br>
    (He was wooden-legged and close on eighty-three).<br>
  &ldquo;Why, bless &lsquo;ee, sir, who knows what fightin&rsquo; are,<br>
    When iron pots is classed as men-of-war,<br>
    And kittles sail the sea without a spar?<br>
    Such wessels were not seen at Trafalgar.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Old Nelson!&rdquo; said the sailor man to me<br>
    (He was lying like a hatter, I could see).<br>
  &ldquo;I was with him when the Frenchies&rsquo; line we broke,<br>
    With our wooden ships and sailors&rsquo; hearts of oak,<br>
    And the great three-decker&rsquo;s cannon&rsquo;s voice awoke,<br>
    Every minute as they thundered thro&rsquo; the smoke.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, blow it!&rdquo; said the sailor man to me<br>
    (His language, I admit, was rather free),<br>
  &ldquo;Now you sends a black torpedo, and it seeks<br>
    To hit a wessel sideways&mdash;then she leaks,<br>
    And sinks while every sailor prays and shrieks,<br>
    Wot fightin&rsquo;&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s murder! yah! the sneaks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  leaving Cocom, Jack at once went to Don Miguel and informed him of the Indian  rising. Maraquando thought but little of the affair, as it was unlikely unarmed  savages would dare to attack a force of one thousand soldiers. Besides, the  journey to Janjalla was through a civilised and cultivated country, and an  Indian raid was improbable. Nevertheless, at Jack&rsquo;s urgent request, he spoke to  President Gomez about the matter, and though his Excellency took the same view  as did Maraquando, yet he sent on messengers to overtake the reinforcements and  inform them of their possible danger. </p>
  <p>The  next day at three o&rsquo;clock the vessels were to leave for Janjalla, but when the  hour came it was found that the torpederas were far from ready. It is true <i>The  Iturbide</i> was in a state of efficiency, and could have left Tlatonac at the  appointed time, but the complicated engines of <i>The Montezuma</i> and <i>The  Zuloaga</i> were somewhat out of gear. Though the engineers worked day and  night to get everything in order, yet it was not until three days had elapsed  that the squadron was ready to start. This delay made Rafael feel very uneasy  lest the consorts of <i>The Pizarro</i> should return south before they could  sink her by the torpedoes. He reckoned out the matter with Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios,  mi amigo! Three days have gone since <i>The Cortes</i> and <i>The Columbus</i> passed Tlatonac with the transports to the north. It is three hundred miles to  Acauhtzin, and those boats steam at the rate of twelve knots an hour&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  interrupted Jack, significantly; &ldquo;but the transports do not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so, Juan. Let us reckon accordingly. Steaming at the rate of twelve knots,  the war-ships would probably reach Acauhtzin in twenty-five hours. Allowing for  the slowness of the transports say thirty hours. In twenty-four hours they will  be able to take in troops, provisions, horses and guns. That makes fifty-four  hours. Steaming south to Tlatonac thirty hours. Eighty-four hours. To Janjalla  from here it is a hundred miles&mdash;say twelve hours. In all ninety-six hours.  Divide by twenty-four, that is exactly four days.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  that rate, the rebel ships cannot possibly reach Janjalla before to-morrow  midnight. When do we leave here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Rafael, glancing at his watch. &ldquo;The torpederas can knock  out eighteen knots, but the full speed of <i>The Iturbide</i> is fifteen. We  will reckon at that, so by leaving here at three can reach Janjalla long before  midnight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  We shall have a clear twenty-four hours in which to sink <i>The Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo;  contradicted Rafael, captiously, &ldquo;we must attack in the darkness. The less risk  the better.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see that it makes much difference,&rdquo; retorted Jack, grimly, &ldquo;if <i>The  Pizarro</i> can fight two torpedo boats and an armed cruiser she is a mighty  clever ship. I look upon <i>The Pizarro</i> as lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I, Juan,&rdquo; replied Rafael, with a sad expression flitting across his face, &ldquo;she  was my ship, you know. I am sorry that it falls to my lot to sink her.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she will surrender.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  while she is commanded by De Galvez. He was my first lieutenant, and is as  obstinate as the devil. Dios! There is noon. We have not much time in which to  make our adieux. Go up and see Dolores, mi amigo, but return by two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  gladly took advantage of the permission and had a long interview with Dolores,  who wept bitterly at the idea of parting with him again. She was already  low-spirited, through having comforted Eulalia, and now that her own lover was  going away broke down entirely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise  me you will take the greatest care of yourself, querido.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dearest, I will ask Rafael to wrap me in cotton wool. But, indeed, cara, you  need not fear. I will be as safe on board <i>The Montezuma</i> as in Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you will be gone many days.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week at the most. If we succeed in sinking <i>The Pizarro</i> we will steam  north to meet the other war-ships, and try our luck with them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will pray for you, Juanito, and I will look after the beetles of Don Pedro.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  burst out laughing at the incongruity of such coupling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  Don Pedro asked you to look after that rubbish!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Juanito! I am to take the very greatest care. They are precious.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the doctor&rsquo;s eyes they are more precious than the opal. By the way, where is  Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has said farewell, and departed with my uncle. Would I could come down to the  boat, querido. But I dare not.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never knew such particular people as the Tlatonacians,&rdquo; muttered Jack, somewhat  vexed. &ldquo;Well, angelito, we must say good-bye here.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take the opal for good fortune, Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?  Take the opal? My dear Dolores, I would be frightened out of my life at  carrying such a treasure with me. No! No! You keep the opal with yourself, and  yourself in Tlatonac. Then will the good fortune of the city be assured. But I  will take this ring.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turquoise!  rubies! pearls!&rdquo; said Dolores, drawing it off her finger. &ldquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s,  querido. Now it is yours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand thousand thanks, alma de mi alma!&rdquo; replied Jack, slipping it on his  little finger, &ldquo;it will remind me ever of you. Rubies for your lips, pearls for  your teeth, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  and what for turquoise?&rdquo; said Dolores, seeing he was rather nonplussed, &ldquo;for my  eyes?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  those are black! Well, we will say turquoise for peace. The blue ray of the  opal means peace. And now, good-bye, my dearest&mdash;my own one!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adios,  Juanito. My soul! My heart!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack,  not trusting himself to speak further, kissed her passionately, and hastily  left the house. Fortunately, he met no one, much to his gratification, as he  was too agitated to say a word. He went to his house, and put all his  necessaries together, then, in company with Peter, went on board <i>The  Montezuma</i>. </p>
  <p>At  three o&rsquo;clock the forts saluted the squadron, and <i>The Iturbide</i>, followed  by the torpederas, stood out to sea. The crowd on the beach watched the vessels  until they were mere specks on the horizon, and then retreated within the  walls, with loudly expressed hopes that they would return with the rebel ship  in tow. The Tlatonacians expected much more than they were ever likely to  obtain. </p>
  <p>The  three vessels stood out about ten miles from the coast, and steamed southward  at no great speed, as Pedraza did not wish to fetch Janjalla until darkness had  set in. As two warships and the transports had gone to Acauhtzin, it was  probable that <i>The Pizarro</i> would be the only vessel left in the harbour,  and vigilant watch would be kept on board, lest the torpederas should come on  her unawares. The rebel commander knew perfectly well that the torpederas had  arrived, and would soon be in chase of his ships; but he did not expect that  they would be able to attack while the other war-ships were away. Still, it was  probable <i>The Pizarro</i> would make good use of her search-lights, and  Pedraza, wishing to come to close quarters unexpectedly, had to exercise the  greatest care as they drew near the harbour. </p>
  <p>Towards  nine o&rsquo;clock they were off the coast of Janjalla, and intense excitement  prevailed on board all three vessels. The plan of attack had been settled at a  general counsel on board <i>The Iturbide</i> before they left Tlatonac, and it  was arranged as follows. <i>The Iturbide</i> was to steam silently into the  harbour of Janjalla, followed by the torpederas, and come to close quarters  with <i>The Pizarro</i>, if possible. Should she be discovered by the  search-light of the latter, she was then to steam boldly ahead, and concentrate  the attention of the rebels on herself. <i>The Pizarro</i>, thus being busy  with the cruiser, would not notice the torpederas, which could then steal  silently within five hundred yards, and launch a Whitehead or so. The result  would be obvious. </p>
  <p>The  torpederas, with twin screws and powerful engines, man&oelig;uvred with wonderful  rapidity, darting here and there in the darkness like black sharks. Both were  armed with Hotchkiss guns and four Whitehead torpedo-tubes, while their strong  search-lights protected them against the unexpected approach of an enemy.  Painted a dark colour to escape notice, they could steal silently within  striking distance of a vessel, and sink her with one of their deadly  explosives. The only chance of safety for <i>The Pizarro</i> lay in her  sighting them at a considerable distance, and keeping them at bay with her  heavy guns; but as she would be fully taken up with <i>The Iturbide</i>, this  would be difficult for her to do. Worst of all, she had no defence against the  rapid darting torpederas, as the nets had been left behind in Tlatonac, when  she deserted to the rebel Xuarez. </p>
  <p>As  to the cruiser, she was a handsome vessel, with a spar deck, and filled with  bow chasers and Gatling guns. She carried a crew of ninety men including  officers, and also two hundred soldiers, who had embarked at Tlatonac to be  landed, if possible, at Janjalla. Fifteen knots was her usual speed; but, if  necessary, she could stand to seventeen. This was the fleet of the Junta, and  now man&oelig;uvred ten miles from the town of Janjalla, waiting the signal to pounce  down on the unsuspecting <i>Pizarro</i>. </p>
  <p>Fortunately  the night was cloudy and dark. At intervals the moon, emerging from behind  heavy clouds, cast a pale light over the scene. It was far down in the west,  and would soon drop behind the low-lying shore, so Pedraza, who wanted complete  darkness for his project, waited until her disappearance before he gave the  signal to steam into the harbour. All lights were extinguished on the vessel,  so as to avoid attracting the attention of the enemy, but, if necessary, the  search-lights could blaze forth in an instant. The torpederas were to attack  the warship, one on the port, the other on the starboard side. It was now close  upon midnight, and as the moon showed but half her orb above the shore, all  waited the signal in breathless silence. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is to be done if we sink <i>The Pizarro</i>?&rdquo; asked Jack, as he stood by  Rafael, watching for the signal from <i>The Iturbide</i>. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quien  sabe!&rdquo; replied Maraquando, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;I expect we will wait in  the harbour till daylight, and then see if we can land our troops.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  won&rsquo;t be much chance of that, my Comandante,&rdquo; said Duval, drily; &ldquo;between us  and Janjalla two thousand rebel troops lie encamped. We cannot break through  that barrier.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget, mi amigo, there are close on a thousand troops of the Junta in the  town. By this time the reinforcements must have reached their destination, so  that will make two thousand. If they attack the rebels from Janjalla, and we  land our two hundred men under cover of <i>The Iturbide&rsquo;s</i> guns, who knows  but what we may not be able to crush these scoundrels before their warships and  transports arrive from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Always presuming that the reinforcements have arrived safely. I fear the  Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!  Surely a thousand well-armed soldiers are a match for a horde of naked savages.  The reinforcements are safe in Janjalla by now. I am sure of it. Believe me,  Don Juan, we shall exterminate the rebels.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  we shall have to exterminate <i>The Pizarro</i>, and&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo;  interrupted Rafael joyfully, &ldquo;the signal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A rocket  shot up from <i>The Iturbide</i> and scattered its fires in the dark air. The  moon had entirely disappeared, and an intense gloom prevailed over land and  sea. </p>
  <p>Hardly  had the rocket&rsquo;s trail of fire disappeared when <i>The Iturbide&rsquo;s</i> screw  began to spin and followed by the torpederas she moved cautiously towards the  harbour at half speed. At the end of an hour all three vessels were within  sight of the town. Through the gloom sparkled the lights of Janjalla, and  between them and the incoming vessels lay the huge bulk of <i>The Pizarro</i>,  the glare of her search-lights shooting up into the dark like two gigantic  swords of pale flame. </p>
  <p><i>The  Iturbide</i> was leading by three hundred  yards, and crept cautiously forward so as to pounce on her prey unawares.  Whether the noise of her screw reached the ears of those on board <i>The  Pizarro</i>, or that they marked her coming through the darkness, it is  impossible to say, but just as she steamed within eight hundred yards, the  search-lights swept round like the spokes of a wheel and in a moment their  glare revealed her whereabouts. In the radiance she stood out like a phantom  ship, and seeing that he was discovered, Pedraza cracking on all steam, swept  past <i>The Pizarro</i> in a wide circle. </p>
  <p>A  heavy fire was at once opened by the rebels and they doubtless deemed that this  foe was not alone, for keeping one light on the cruiser, they swept the sea  with the other in search of her possible companions. Those on board <i>The  Iturbide</i> could hear the yell of mingled rage and terror, as the light  struck the low bulk of <i>The Zuloaga</i> darting through the water, evil  looking and venomous. A broadside was poured on the torpedera, now left  unprotected by <i>The Iturbide</i> which was circling to the left in the inner  part of the bay. Owing to the dexterity of <i>The Zuloaga&rsquo;s</i> man&oelig;uvring,  none of the heavy guns could hit her. She skimmed the grey waves at full speed  like a swallow, and the search light of <i>The Pizarro</i> was much put to in  following her. It was like a dancer in the theatre followed by the lime light.  One moment the torpedera would be swallowed up in the gloom, the next moment  the darting ray of the electric light would stab through the darkness and pick  her out. The other ray followed <i>The Iturbide</i>, which kept steaming slowly  backwards and forwards on the port side, firing her Armstrongs whenever she got  a fair chance. </p>
  <p><i>The  Zuloaga</i> sent off a bow torpedo, but  it passed harmlessly under the stern of <i>The Pizarro</i> without doing any  damage. Nevertheless, the crew of the rebel ship seemed much alarmed, as well  they might be, seeing that a single torpedo striking them amidships would sink  their iron ship in a few minutes. Foolishly enough, it never occurred to De  Galevez to sweep the starboard with his lights, and he was quite unaware that a  second torpedo-vessel was stealing up in the darkness. </p>
  <p>Indeed,  what with following <i>The Iturbide</i> and <i>The Zuloaga</i> with his  search-lights, De Galevez had enough to do, and kept the torpedo boat at bay  with his heavy guns. Occasionally a shot from <i>The Iturbide</i> would pass  through the rigging of the rebel ship, but no damage was done, and De Galevez&rsquo;s  great desire was to keep at a distance the wasp-like torpedo which circled  round rapidly, everywhere trying to plant its sting. </p>
  <p>While  this drama was taking place on the port side, <i>The Montezuma</i>, on seeing <i>The  Iturbide</i> was discovered, moved up on the starboard at a distance of four  hundred yards. When abreast of <i>The Pizarro</i> she slowed down her engines  and crept up within pistol range. Had it not been for the incessant firing of  the guns, those on board <i>The Pizarro</i> would surely have become aware of  their danger. As it was, they thought themselves safe while they kept <i>The  Zuloaga</i> at a distance. A tremendous broadside was directed at that  torpedera and at <i>The Iturbide</i>. It was her last discharge, for the next  moment she was struck amidships by a torpedo from <i>The Montezuma</i>. </p>
  <p>There  was a cry of frenzied fear, and the search lights flashed round to starboard  only to see <i>The Montezuma</i> slipping back into the gloom. Three minutes  afterwards <i>The Pizarro</i> sank. </p>
  <p>The  vessels of the Junta at once flashed their electric rays on the spot, and where  a moment before had been a magnificent vessel, now saw nothing but a wide  expanse of cold black sea dotted with drowning men. Boats were lowered by <i>The  Iturbide</i> and a few soldiers and sailors were rescued, but so suddenly had <i>The  Pizarro</i> gone down that, with the exception of half a dozen survivors, the  whole crew, officers, and soldiers, in all three hundred men, were drowned. </p>
  <p>It  would be impossible to describe the joy on board the loyalist ships at this  successful termination of the contest. Rafael and Jack went on board <i>The  Iturbide</i> to receive the congratulations of Pedraza for their success, and  the officers of <i>The Zuloaga</i> also hastened to participate in the general  joy. The large state-room of the cruiser was one mass of excited men, drinking  champagne, and wildly embracing one another. This victory would surely damp the  enthusiasm of the rebels, and raise that of the loyalists to fever pitch. Don  Hypolito had now but two ships of war, and these could not surely stand before  the valour of <i>The Iturbide</i>, with her two torpedo-vessels. The <i>vivas</i> were deafening, and Rafael, as commander of the boat which had sunk <i>The  Pizarro</i>, was nearly stifled by the embraces of his brother officers. </p>
  <p>As  soon as the excitement had somewhat subsided, all went on deck, and <i>The  Iturbide</i> stood in to the shore with the idea of seeing how matters stood in  the rebel camp. Flying the Opal flag, lest the forts should open fire on one of  their own vessels, the cruiser turned her lights on to the beach, and saw that  it was lined with the rebel forces, all under arms. The noise of the firing and  the flashing of the lights had attracted the attention of those on shore, and  fearing that an attack was contemplated by the enemy, those rebels encamped in  front of Janjalla were now on the alert. No one could understand the reason of  this sea-fight, as it seemed quite impossible that the torpederas could have  arrived from Tlatonac in so short a period. The general in command of the  troops of Xuarez did not know what to think, and had to wait till dawn before  he could make up his mind what course to pursue. </p>
  <p>As  the lights of <i>The Iturbide</i> struck the distant town, a long line of  walls, surmounted by a crowd, leaped out of the darkness. The search-lights  from the forts were flashed on to the ships, and those in Janjalla recognising  the Opal flag, cheered vociferously. They saw three boats, each flying the  ensign of Tlatonac, and no <i>Pizarro</i>. Then they guessed what had occurred,  and were glad accordingly. The rebel soldiers on the beach stamped and swore  with rage as they saw their loss, but being without boats could do nothing save  parade under arms till dawn, so as to be prepared against a possible attack by  the victorious loyalists. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  cried Captain Pedraza, who had his night glass up. &ldquo;There is one good thing,  mis amigos, the Opal flag still flies over the town, so as yet it holds out.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is next to be done, Comandante?&rdquo; asked Jack, who was standing near with Rafael. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must wait till dawn, Se&ntilde;or Americano, and then find out if the reinforcements  have arrived at Janjalla. Afterwards we will steam back to Tlatonac, and if  possible meet the <i>Cortes</i> and <i>Columbus</i> coming back. In any event,  we must go to Tlatonac to report this victory to the Junta.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  you land these two hundred troops?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caranto!  Why not?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the camp of the enemy lies between the town and ourselves. Two hundred men  cannot do much against two thousand.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  Se&ntilde;or. If it is impossible, we will not attempt it. But at dawn, I will signal  to General Gigedo to make a sally from the gates down to the shore; our men  will land, and effect a conjunction, and so with small loss they ought to get  into the town. Especially under cover of our guns, and those of the forts.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see what use that will be, Pedraza,&rdquo; interrupted Rafael, bluntly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caro,  Se&ntilde;or! His Excellency ordered this to be done, so it must be done.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  a useless task, I think,&rdquo; said Jack, dryly. &ldquo;However, I am not sorry, as I wish  to get into the town myself. But you, Se&ntilde;or Comandante, what will you do?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till these troops are safe with Gigedo, and also ascertain if the  reinforcements have arrived. Then I shall sail north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t wait for the warships and transports?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo!  what use? We shall find those on our way to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>After  this conversation, Rafael and Jack returned on board <i>The Montezuma</i>, the  former slightly gloomy in spite of the victory so unexpectedly achieved. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caro,  Juan!&rdquo; he said, reflectively; &ldquo;if we lose this war, it will be through Don  Francisco Gomez. He is a good politician, but a bad general. What use is there  to sacrifice two hundred men to-morrow?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  rather like the Charge of the Light Brigade, certainly,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a  smile; &ldquo;as foolhardy and as brave.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that, mi amigo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Whereupon  Jack related the glorious charge to Rafael, and thereby stirred up the  excitable Spaniard to fiery enthusiasm. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what men are the English,&rdquo; he cried, stamping his foot. &ldquo;It is a story worthy  of the Cid. But this to-morrow, my friend&mdash;it is rare! it is brave! and, like  your story, there is no good to be gained.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Gomez wants to frighten the rebels by showing them how dauntless are his men.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  That is not wise. The sinking of <i>The Pizarro</i> will frighten them without  risking two hundred lives. However, as it is ordered, it must be done. But you,  Don Juan! Will you go?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  mi amigo. I wish to see the Se&ntilde;or Correspondent and Felipe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you will be killed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is as it may be. But no, Rafael. I did not escape the perils of Totatzine to  fall in a skirmish before the walls of Janjalla. But see, mi amigo, it is  nearly dawn, let us snatch a few hours&rsquo; sleep.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  replied Rafael, leading the way to his cabin; &ldquo;but first we must call our  friends together, and toast our victory once more.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was done accordingly. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXV"></a>Chapter XXV<br>
    Without The Walls</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Walls  of stone like mountains rise,<br>
  Grey against the morning skies;<br>
  Still the royal banner flies,<br>
  Watched with hate by rebels&rsquo; eyes.<br>
  And around the ramparts grey,<br>
  In the mists an army lies.</p>
  <p class="poem">Set  in battle&rsquo;s wild array,<br>
  At the dawning of the day,<br>
  Traitors to their sovereign they,<br>
  Who would loyal subjects slay.<br>
  Hold this city as a slave,<br>
  Under democratic sway.</p>
  <p class="poem">Cannons  thunder, banners wave,<br>
  As come on the foemen brave,<br>
&lsquo;Neath these walls to find a grave;<br>
  Yet this city shall we save,<br>
  Never let it be the prize<br>
  Of the coward, fool, and knave.</p>
  <p>Shortly  after dawn, Jack went on deck, to have a thorough examination of the coast-line.  The situation of Janjalla was peculiar. To the right a shallow river meandered  seaward through low-lying, swampy ground, discharging itself sluggishly by  several mouths. A desolate plain stretched for leagues on the left to the base  of distant mountains, and between swamp and plain the city appeared built on a  rocky height. Directly in front of the walls the sandy ground fell rapidly  towards the sea, on the extreme verge of which was a compact mass of huts  forming a kind of sea-port. The wharf shot out suddenly from this miniature  town. It lay along the hollow of the beach, and above it, in the near distance,  rose the grey walls of Janjalla from the rocky cliffs. Above these, the domes  of churches, the towers of houses, and, highest of all, the expanse of bluish  sky grey with the chill mists of morning. </p>
  <p>In  the beach hollow, the army of Xuarez was encamped, partly in the houses, partly  in the tents which whitely dotted the desolate shore. Owing to the rapid fall  of the ground from the ramparts, the invaders were quite safe from the cannon  of the forts. These could defend the town against the attack of ships, but were  unable to be depressed sufficiently to command the spot where the rebels were  encamped, thus, in the very jaws of danger, lay the besiegers in comparative  safety. Jack, surveying all this through a telescope, was astonished to see  that the engineers who had constructed the defences had been so foolish as to  leave this debatable ground between rampart and sea. Perhaps they deemed that the  cannon would not permit ships to approach near enough for the disembarking of  hostile troops, but they seemed to have forgotten that the heavy guns of a  man-of-war could silence the forts. This, perhaps, had not been done, as the  cannon on the ramparts still defended the city; but there was no doubt in Jack&rsquo;s  mind that Don Hypolito had landed his troops under cover of a heavy fire from  his three ships directed at the forts. Once encamped on shore, and the  besiegers could bid defiance to the lines of cannon, whose balls passed  harmlessly over their heads. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ola,  Se&ntilde;or Juan,&rdquo; said Rafael&rsquo;s gay voice behind him, &ldquo;you are up early.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning, mi amigo,&rdquo; replied Jack, turning with a smile. &ldquo;I have been up at  least half an hour, examining the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  place forsaken of God, is it not? Dios! to think that some fools would have  this to be the capital of Cholacaca. Swamps there, sandy plains yonder. Holy  Mary! how can it compare with Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the first time I have been so far south, and I don&rsquo;t think much of either  country or town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the situation is good for defence.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that, Rafael. It is true that the city is built on a rocky  height, and well defended by swamp and desert; but look how safely enemies can  lie under the walls.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  what would you, Juan? The muzzles of the guns cannot be depressed sufficiently  to sweep the beach.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why didn&rsquo;t the engineers build two forts right and left, in order to command  the intervening ground?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  And thus knock each other to pieces.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True.  Well, then, have one fort. See, mi amigo. On the right, that wide swamp is a  sufficient protection against the approach of an enemy; but had I constructed  the defences of the town, I would have run an arm of forts between the desert  and that sea-fort. Thus a double line of cannon would have commanded the beach,  and even if an enemy did succeed in landing in face of the fire of the town  forts, they could not have encamped there as they have done.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true, Juan,&rdquo; replied Rafael, who now had the telescope to his eye. &ldquo;But it  is now too late to deplore the lack of defences. The rebels have landed, and  are safely bestowed within stone-throw of the city. Look at the number of them,  and all on the alert. Santissima! they won&rsquo;t feel very happy this morning, now  that they see <i>The Pizarro</i> is lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;  said Jack, taking no notice of this last remark, &ldquo;surely Pedraza does not  intend to land two hundred men directly in front of the town?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is foolish, I admit,&rdquo; answered Rafael, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;but what with  a sally of our troops from the town, and the guns of our boats playing on the  beach, it may be managed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it. Two hundred men may land under cover of our fire; but, believe me,  Rafael, fifty will not break through that living barrier and enter the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  grant that. As I said last night, it is a useless waste of life, and his  Excellency must have surely forgotten the situation of Janjalla when he gave  such a rash command. But what else can be done, save obey his order?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Obey  it, by all means, but not in the way commanded.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  was sweeping the shore right and left with the telescope, and did not reply for  a few minutes. At length he spoke, indicating the several points he mentioned,  with his hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold,  mi amigo,&rdquo; he said, pointing towards the desert, &ldquo;to land there would be  foolish, as the enemy could march along to defend that point while the boats  pulled in. The same with the central position. It is madness to land in the  teeth of two thousand men. But look to the right. Why not land the troops up  the coast, and let the swamp lie between them and the enemy?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  replied Rafael, seizing the idea at once. &ldquo;But how do you propose to enter the  city?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that I can&rsquo;t say, not knowing the geography of the place.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a map below. Come with me, Juan, and we will invent some plan, then go on  board <i>The Iturbide</i> to interview Pedraza. I am with you in trying to  prevent this sacrifice of two hundred men by landing them in the jaws of danger.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  went down to the cabin, and Rafael, after hunting about for a few minutes,  found a map of the southern portion of Cholacaca. He spread it out on the  table, and they began to examine it at once. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;  said Jack, drawing his finger along the paper; &ldquo;here is Janjalla, here the  swamp and river, beyond is a kind of rolling prairie. If we land the troops  here, we can march them parallel to the river, into the interior country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so, mi amigo! But, you see, the river is ever between the troops and the  city. If the enemy see our men marching on this side, they can march on the  other, and so keep our men from entering the city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if Pedraza signals to the forts. You forget that the rebels are only safe so  long as they keep in the hollow of the beach. If they march up on the right,  they expose themselves to a heavy fire. Consequently, the forts can keep them  in check, and our troops, marching along on the right bank of the stream, can  surely find some ford by which to cross, and then gain the inland gate of  Janjalla by a detour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Como,  no!&rdquo; exclaimed Rafael, in a lively tone rolling up the map. &ldquo;It is not at all a  bad idea. Let us board <i>The Iturbide</i>, and explain your plan to the  Comandante.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  commands the expedition?&rdquo; asked Jack, as he hastily snatched up a brace of  revolvers and a heavy cloak. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Sebastian de Ahumada. He is a great friend of mine. In fact,&rdquo; added Rafael,  laughing, &ldquo;he is a cousin of Do&ntilde;a Carmencita de Tajada.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  poor Rafael, your suit does not progress much in that quarter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  with Don Jos&eacute;, perhaps; but I am content to wait till the war is ended, so far  as my angel is concerned. She will be true to me, as I to her. By the way, mi  amigo, know you that Don Jos&eacute; is now Governor of Acauhtzin, in the absence of  Don Hypolito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I did not know it. Is Don Hypolito yonder?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  now. He was on board <i>The Cortes</i>, and has gone back to Acauhtzin, but  will doubtless come south again, to personally conduct the war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to get a shot at him,&rdquo; said Jack, grimly; &ldquo;the brute. I shall never  forgive him for his treachery. Well, who knows?&mdash; </p>
  <p>Perhaps  a recruit<br>
    May chance to shoot<br>
    Great General Bonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say you?&rdquo; asked Rafael, puzzled at those lines, which were recited in English. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  nothing. A something to relieve my feelings. Is that boat never going to be  ready?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is ready now,&rdquo; said the young man, gaily; &ldquo;in with you, mi amigo! Row to <i>The  Iturbide</i> Benito! So&mdash;give way, men!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  oars dipped into the water as the sun arose in the east, and the boat shot away  from <i>The Montezuma</i> over a flood of gold. Rafael was in great spirits,  and chatted gaily all the time; but Jack, thinking of the peril of the proposed  expedition, was graver. Besides, he was anxious about the safety of Philip and  Tim. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way,&rdquo; said Rafael, suddenly, &ldquo;Don Pedro did not return with us last night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Pedraza asked him to sleep on board <i>The Iturbide</i>. See, there he is,  looking over the bulwarks. I can tell him by the flash of the sun on his  spectacles!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  How strange! Will Don Pedro go with you into the town?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; replied Jack, decisively; &ldquo;it is too risky! Take him back with you to  Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly!  My aunt would never forgive me if harm came to Don Pedro.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Rafael  laughed heartily at the idea, for this undutiful nephew was much amused at the  flirtation between Peter and Serafina. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will marry him, Juan! I am sure of it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we will have four weddings when the war is over, Rafael.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  weddings. Por todos santos! What mean you?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myself  and Dolores. Yourself and Do&ntilde;a Carmencita. Pedro and your aunt, and Se&ntilde;or  Felipe and Do&ntilde;a Eulalia!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  mi amigo!&rdquo; cried Rafael, in a lively tone, &ldquo;does my sister favour that  cavalier? Dios! what says my father?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does not know anything yet. But as he has consented to receive one heretic into  his family, he can surely stretch a point, and receive two.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Como,  no! But it may be! Who knows? Ah! Here we are at <i>The Iturbide</i>. Come,  Juan!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  climbed up the side of the cruiser, and were received by Captain Pedraza and  Peter. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Buenos  dias de Dios &aacute; ustedes, Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Pedraza, greeting them heartily. &ldquo;I am  glad to see you both, as I wish to land these troops at once. Se&ntilde;or Pedro  desires to go also.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense, Peter,&rdquo; said Jack, in English, turning to his friend; &ldquo;it is too  dangerous. You stay on board, and go back to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not!&rdquo; returned the doctor, indignantly; &ldquo;you are going, so why should not  I? Besides, I wish to see Tim, and to be certain that Philip has arrived safely.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want you killed, Peter,&rdquo; protested Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be killed any more than you will be, Jack. It&rsquo;s not a bit of use your  talking, I&rsquo;m going with you. I have my medicine-chest with me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, obstinacy! Have it your own way,&rdquo; replied Duval, touched by this proof of  Peter&rsquo;s friendship; &ldquo;but Tim will pitch at me for bringing you into danger.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim  will be glad enough to have a doctor at hand. Why, Jack, I should have been at  Totatzine to cure you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  was good at a pinch.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  quack!&rdquo; muttered Peter, scornfully. He could not forgive Cocom having cured  Jack so rapidly. It was a case of professional jealousy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Duval,&rdquo; said Pedraza, approaching Jack, &ldquo;Don Rafael tells me you and he have  hit on a plan to land the troops without danger.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  signified that they had some such idea in their heads, and in company with  Pedraza, they went below to look at the map. Don Sebastian followed them, and  after a long discussion, the Comandante decided to accept the suggestion. <i>The  Iturbide</i> raised her anchor, and steamed a short distance up the coast, so  as to land the troops beyond the swamp. Signals having been made to the  torpederas, they remained in their former position, before the town. </p>
  <p>When  the rebels saw <i>The Iturbide</i> moving northward, they shouted with joy,  thinking that she was about to leave the harbour; but their delight was turned  into rage as they saw boat after boat drop from her sides, and, laden with  troops, make for the shore. Numbers ran along the beach, to the verge of the  swamp, but here their progress was stayed, as it was impossible for them to  cross the quagmire. They could only remain quiet, and gesticulate with anger,  though many fired their guns, and two cannon were brought along the shore in  the hope of doing some damage. </p>
  <p>As  yet they were safe, from the forts being too much in the hollow; but when  Pedraza saw the cannon brought up, he opened fire with his Armstrongs, and  signalled to the torpederas. These steamed abreast of the swamp at once, and  did considerable damage with their rapid-firing Hotchkiss guns. Under cover of  this cannonade, the whole of the troops were duly landed, in admirable order,  with the utmost celerity, and then Jack, Peter, and Don Sebastian prepared to  go on shore. Pedraza gave De Ahumada sealed orders for Gigedo from the  President, and Rafael occupied himself in saying farewell to his English  friends. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have your revolvers, mis amigos?&rdquo; he said anxiously; &ldquo;and swords? Good! Cloaks?  Ah, that is well. Have, also, these flasks of aguardiente; you will need  sustenance. The march to the inland-gate may be a long one. Adios.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Adios,&rdquo;  replied Jack, dropping over the side. &ldquo;Give my love to Dolores, when you return  to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not fail. And, Don Pedro, have you any message?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si,  Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Peter, in his hesitating Spanish. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Dolores. Escarabajos.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beetles!&rdquo;  echoed Rafael, in great astonishment. &ldquo;What does he mean by beetles?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  curiosity was not gratified, for already the boat was making rapidly for the  shore, and Jack, standing up in the stern, was waving his adieux to all on  board. </p>
  <p>By  this time the sun was far above the horizon, and already the heat was becoming  unpleasantly great. Don Sebastian at once formed his men into marching order,  and the little company proceeded along the bank of the river, towards the  interior of the country. Before them spread a kind of rolling downs, with  undulating hills, sparsely covered with vegetation. Here and there patches of  yellow sand streaked with fine white dust. On one side stretched the  illimitable plains, and on the other the ground marshy and treacherous, sank  imperceptibly into the bed of the slow-flowing river. Beyond this, an interval  of firm land for some considerable distance, and then the rocky shelf on which  Janjalla was built. In front the stream meandered in an erratic manner inland;  away in the extreme distance appeared the dim line of forest, above which arose  the snowy cone of Xicotencatl. Over all arched the cloudless blue sky, with the  sun flaming hotly in the east. </p>
  <p>The  rebels had been considerably cut up by the incessant firing of the ships, and  had wisely fallen back into their camp. When, however, they saw the loyalists  moving inland, along the bank of the stream, a troop of cavalry, some hundreds  strong, galloped towards the swamp to intercept them, if possible. The cruiser  and the torpederas were still in their former position, and as the cavalry  turned the fatal corner, to make for the inner country, they opened a heavy  cannonade. Considerable damage was inflicted particularly by the Hotchkiss  guns, and numbers of riders were soon struggling on the ground with their  wounded horses. In a few minutes, however, the troop, nothing dismayed, escaped  beyond the line of fire, and galloped parallel with the loyalists, between  swamp and walls. </p>
  <p>This  defile proved to be a perfect death-trap. For those within the town, having  observed the landing of the reinforcements, and the chase by the enemy, opened  fire from the forts, and shattered the compact mass of horses and men as they  steadily galloped along. At length, however, they had to cease their fire, as  the rebels artfully kept abreast of the loyalists, and at times the balls swept  across the swamp, and played havoc with the soldiers of Don Sebastian. The only  thing to be done, therefore, was to let the cavalry go free, and trust to a  hand-to-hand combat when on the sandy plains at the back of the town. </p>
  <p>Both  the ships and the forts, however, were determined that no more of the enemy  should join in the pursuit, for a heavy cannonade was kept up as another troop  tried to follow, and effectually held them back. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said Don Sebastian, when he saw this. &ldquo;We have but to deal with those abreast  of us; no more can follow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cavalry  against infantry, mi amigo! It is unequal, particularly if we try to cross the  river.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  those in the town will come to our assistance,&rdquo; suggested Peter, who was  trudging along manfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is probable,&rdquo; replied De Ahumada, when this remark was translated into good  Spanish by Jack. &ldquo;See, we are now nearly at the end of the town. Yonder is the  land-gate. If we remain here, assistance may come, and while the cavalry are  defending themselves against our friends, we may be able to cross the river.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that is if the cavalry don&rsquo;t get reinforced by their own men coming round the  other side of the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  exclaimed Don Sebastian, grimly, &ldquo;reinforcements certainly can come that way,  but they will be forced to make a wide detour in order to keep out of range of  the fort-guns. By the time they come up we may be inside the walls.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fervently trust so, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Duval, who, though no coward, did not  relish the idea of engaging two hundred infantry with double the number of  cavalry. </p>
  <p>The  city was enclosed by walls of a considerable height, was shaped in a triangular  fashion, the base being towards the ocean, and the land-gate at the acute angle  inland. They had now walked some distance past the gate on the other side of  the river, and a wide sheet of water rolled between them and their enemies. On  all sides spread the sandy plain, and the walls of the city rose suddenly from  the flat surface in a most unexpected fashion. On the left bank halted the  cavalry of the enemy, prepared to dispute their crossing, and Don Sebastian was  sorely puzzled as to what was the best course to pursue. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is madness to cross in the face of that, Don Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if we don&rsquo;t cross at once they will be reinforced from the other side, and then  it will be worse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look,  Jack, look!&rdquo; cried Peter at this moment, &ldquo;the gates are open!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Just  as he spoke a body of cavalry debouched from the city, and came rapidly towards  the rebels. They at once turned to meet this new danger, and thus their  attention was drawn off the infantry, upon seeing which Don Sebastian waited a  few minutes until the opposing forces clashed together, and then gave the order  to cross the river. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  we strip?&rdquo; asked Peter, ruefully, looking at the three hundred yards of water  before him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strip!  no, man!&rdquo; said Jack, laughing, &ldquo;unless you want to enter Janjalla naked. You  can swim. At least you could at Bedford.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I can swim,&rdquo; said Peter, testily; &ldquo;but I hate getting my clothes wet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hang your clothes! The river is slow-flowing, so it is easy to get across. See!  the advance files are in already. In with you!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter  did not need any second admonition, but waded into the water beside Jack and  Don Sebastian. The cavalry, which otherwise would have shot them down as they  swam across, were fully occupied with the loyalist regiment from Janjalla.  Already in the extreme distance dark masses might be seen rapidly moving along.  They were the reinforcements for the rebels making a detour on the other side  of the city. There was not a moment to be lost. </p>
  <p>In  a remarkably short space of time the whole of the infantry had crossed, and  were now standing high and dry on the other bank. Not even giving them time to  shake the water from their clothes, Don Sebastian made them kneel and open fire  on the rebels in the rear. Fortunately each man had piled his musket and  ammunition on his head while swimming, so their arms were in excellent  condition, and their cartridges unwetted. A fusillade burst from the line, and  wrought considerable damage in the ranks of the enemy. Taken thus between two fires,  the rebels found themselves in exceedingly hot water, but trusting that their  comrades would soon reach them, turned and tried to ride down the infantry. The  soldiers immediately sprung to their feet and scattered widely, firing into the  troop whenever they got a chance. </p>
  <p>Fresh  troops of loyalist cavalry poured out of the gates and made for the scene of  action. What with being pretty nearly equally matched with the cavalry, and  exposed to the galling fire of the infantry, the rebels began to lose heart,  and, breaking into disorderly masses, spread over the plain. The gates of the  city were distant a quarter of a mile, and seeing that the reinforcements of  the enemy were close at hand, Don Sebastian shouted to his men to close up and  make for the shelter of the walls. Seeing this the rebel reinforcements,  darting between the moving loyalists and the gates, tried to cut them off, but  were met in their turn by the mounted troops from Janjalla. The plain was  strewn with dead and dying, and the incessant cracking of rifles, the yells of  the combatants, and the thick clouds of pungent smoke added to the horrors of  the skirmish. </p>
  <p>A  huge trooper rode straight at Peter, and rolled him in the dust, but Jack being  close at hand shot the horse with his revolver, and pulled his friend out of  harm&rsquo;s way. By this time they were near the gates, and Peter being somewhat  stunned by his knock-down, was dragged along rapidly by Jack, who wanted to get  him into shelter as speedily as possible. </p>
  <p>It  was now dangerous for the infantry to fire, as friend and foe were blended in  an inextricable mass; so, forming line as speedily as possible, they ran for  the gate, and at length reached it in safety. Seeing that they were now out of  danger, the cavalry of Janjalla began to retreat towards the portal. To the  left of the town, great masses of reinforcements were moving up, and it would  have been madness to have opposed them with the small force of loyalists  outside. The cavalry galloped back, and as by this time the infantry had fled inside  the walls, the gates were closed at once. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!  Jack! Peter!&rdquo; cried a well-known voice, as Tim, grimy with gunpowder and smoke,  plunged down the street towards the gate. &ldquo;Are you safe?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  safe. But why the deuce are these men coming back? Why don&rsquo;t they pour out and  exterminate those devils?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  yelled Tim, throwing up his arms in surprise. &ldquo;Why they can&rsquo;t be spared. There&rsquo;s  but seven hundred men here!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven  hundred!&rdquo; cried Jack, seized with a sudden qualm of fear. &ldquo;But the reinforcements&mdash;the  thousand men?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reinforcements have arrived, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip!&rdquo;  said Tim, in alarm. &ldquo;Was he with the reinforcements? God be gracious to me. Not  a man has arrived. When did they leave Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  days ago.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  days! One hundred miles!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  three friends, amid the tumult around them, with the enemy thundering at the  gate, looked at one another in silent dread. Then Jack took off his sombrero. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Philip!&rdquo; he said, solemnly. &ldquo;I was afraid of those Indians. Oh, my poor friend!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXVI"></a>Chapter XXVI<br>
    Within The Walls</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Circle  of stone,<br>
  Circle of steel,<br>
  Loyalists true,<br>
  Pent up in battle belts twain;<br>
  Yet we, alone,<br>
  Doubly feel,<br>
  That with our few,<br>
  We shall a victory gain.</p>
  <p class="poem">Climb  up our foes,<br>
  Over the wall,<br>
  Deep bit the swords,<br>
  Fiercely the cannon spout fire;<br>
  Yet &lsquo;neath our blows,<br>
  Downward they fall,<br>
  Traitorous hordes,<br>
  In torment and blood to expire.</p>
  <p>Tim  at once took his friends to his quarters, and made them comfortable, but  scarcely had they finished a hurried meal, when an aide-de-camp arrived from  General Gigedo requiring their presence without delay. As Peter had received a  nasty blow on the head during the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>,  Jack insisted that he should remain behind and rest himself. Peter feebly  remonstrated against this arrangement, as he wanted to accompany his friends,  but in the end was forced to yield to their insistence. Then Duval buckled on  his sword, slipped his revolvers into his belt, and went off with Tim to report  himself at head-quarters. </p>
  <p>Both  of them were terribly alarmed about Philip. In the first burst of emotion Jack  had deemed his friend dead; but, on looking at the matter calmly, it seemed  probable that he would yet turn up well and unhurt. It was impossible that  Indians, in whatever number, could utterly exterminate a body of disciplined  troops amounting to a thousand men. Tim&rsquo;s opinion was that if they had been  attacked and overpowered by strategy, they had fled to the nearest town for  shelter. As he had marched overland with Colonel Garibay from Tlatonac, he knew  the country better than did Jack, and proceeded to defend his theory of the  reinforcements&rsquo; safety, by describing the position of the towns. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a hundred miles or more as the crow flies from Tlatonac to this God-forsaken  place. Within that limit are four towns, no less&mdash;one every twenty miles. When  we marched south two weeks ago, we first went to Chichimec, then to Puebla de  los Naranjos, which last one is midway. Hermanita is next, and then after  dropping in at Centeotl, we came on to Janjalla!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  if the Indians surprised them by night they might have surrounded and  exterminated the whole lot. To my mind nothing is so dangerous as a despised  enemy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried Tim, with great contempt, &ldquo;d&rsquo;you mean to tell me that a lot of naked  savages could manage that. By my soul, &lsquo;tis impossible!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  my dear fellow, the Indians are out in thousands. Cocom told me so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  may be out in millions,&rdquo; retorted Tim, emphatically. &ldquo;I tell you, Jack, they  couldn&rsquo;t have killed all these men. A good number of them must have escaped to  the nearest town, and, I&rsquo;ll lay my soul on it, that among those who got away is  Philip. He wasn&rsquo;t born to be murdered by a lot of howling savages.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us hope so,&rdquo; replied Jack, who was beginning to take this comfortable view  of things himself; &ldquo;but, tell me, Tim, when the reinforcements didn&rsquo;t arrive,  why did you not wire to Tlatonac?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begad!  I couldn&rsquo;t. The rebels cut the telegraph wires some days since. The last  message was that you and Do&ntilde;a Dolores had come back safely. Ah, my boy,&rdquo; cried  Tim, slapping Jack on the shoulder, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I sing &lsquo;Glory Hallelujah,&rsquo; when I  heard that same. But, I knew you&rsquo;d turn up again all safe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know it myself!&rdquo; replied Jack, grimly &ldquo;it was touch and go, I can tell  you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dioul!  You must tell me all about it. But hold your noise, Jack, and don&rsquo;t be  lamenting for Philip. If you returned, so will he.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fervently hope so,&rdquo; said Jack, gloomily; &ldquo;but I own that I feel doubtful. Are  the wires cut on both sides of the town?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  glory be to the saints. I can still telegraph to England by the wires going  south, but I expect them to be cut every minute, so I&rsquo;m hard at work sending  all the news I can.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see the fight last night?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I not! Whow, my boy! I guessed what was up, but till the dawn we weren&rsquo;t quite  sure of the trouble. Begad! <i>The Pizarro&rsquo;s</i> gone anyhow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But the other warships and transports are due to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we&rsquo;ll have another fight,&rdquo; said Tim, coolly; &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t I wishing I was on board a  torpedera! There&rsquo;s a heap to talk about, Jack; how you escaped from that  infernal Xuarez, and how you sank <i>The Pizarro</i>. I want to wire about that  same right away.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;First  I must see what the General desires. Oh, here is Garibay. A thousand greetings,  Colonel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Se&ntilde;or Juan! Ah, mi amigo, how pleased I am to see you safe once more. I deemed  you were dead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  He is a merry corpse, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Tim, turning his head. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the General?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within  yonder house of the Jefe Politico. You also, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal, does he desire  to see.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at the service of Se&ntilde;or Gigedo. Know you, Comandante, what he desires to  speak of?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is that you will convey the glorious news of our naval victory to your gran&rsquo;diario.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  That will be done within an hour. I but waited to find out all particulars from  Don Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I can tell you everything,&rdquo; said Jack cheerfully, &ldquo;I was on board <i>The  Montezuma</i> with Don Rafael, and it was her torpedo which sank <i>The Pizarro</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Viva  los Torpederas,&rdquo; shouted Garibay, who was greatly excited over this unexpected  victory. </p>
  <p>The  cry was taken up by a chattering group of officers lounging in from off the  General&rsquo;s headquarters, and Jack being recognized was at once surrounded by  them. They were mostly young fellows, who were weary of being pent up within  the walls of a suburban town, and saw in this sinking of <i>The Pizarro</i>, a  chance of coming face to face with the enemy. It was all cries of Viva! Bueno!  Gracias a Dios! as Duval passed through their midst, and many would fain have  detained him, to learn particulars of the combat; but Jack was anxious to hear  Gigedo&rsquo;s views concerning the non-arrival of the reinforcements, so entered the  mansion at once. Colonel Garibay conducted them both without delay to the  General&rsquo;s apartments. Gigedo, cigarette in mouth, was poring over a large map  of the country, evidently tracing the line of march from Tlatonac, but on  seeing Duval, he sprang up and advanced to salute him, with a pleased smile. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand congratulations, Se&ntilde;or, on your escape from the hands of Xuarez,&rdquo; he  said, warmly; &ldquo;and still more on your gallant conduct of last night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  as to that, General, I was but an onlooker,&rdquo; replied Duval, modestly. &ldquo;The  credit of sinking <i>The Pizarro</i> rests with Don Rafael Maraquando. Have you  heard the particulars?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly  Se&ntilde;or, Don Sebastian de Ahumada has left me but this moment. He informed me of  the affair, and also delivered the instructions from His Excellency. I find  here,&rdquo; added Gigedo, striking a pile of papers with his open hand, &ldquo;that over a  thousand men left Tlatonac for the front, four days ago.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so, General. My friend, Se&ntilde;or Felipe, was with them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have not arrived, Don Juan. The troops of Xuarez cannot have intercepted them  and I am at a loss to understand this delay. Can you explain?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  said Jack after a pause, &ldquo;before I left Tlatonac there were rumours of an  Indian rising. While a prisoner at Totatzine I saw myself the tribes, incited  to war by Ixtlilxochitli, the High Priest of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that cursed opal!&rdquo; cried Garibay, fiercely; &ldquo;it is the cause of great trouble.  Would that it could be taken from the Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rest  content, Se&ntilde;or Garibay; it <i>is</i> taken from the Indians. Do&ntilde;a Dolores took  it from the shrine, and it is now in Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  exclaimed the General and Garibay, simultaneously, while Tim was scarcely less  astonished. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally  enough the Indians wish to recover this sacred gem, Se&ntilde;or, therefore the rising  has taken place sooner than was expected. I fear, gentlemen, that the Indians  have surprised and massacred our poor friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima  Madre! a thousand men?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Indian forces amount to three times that number,&rdquo; said Jack, quickly. &ldquo;It is  true that His Excellency, at my request, sent messengers after the  reinforcements to warn them of a possible attack. Yet it is not unlikely that  these messengers may have been intercepted by the Indians. They might have  fallen on the reinforcements without warning, and then&mdash;Se&ntilde;or, three thousand  against one thousand&mdash;an unexpected attack. Alas! it is a terrible risk.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  troops may have retreated to one of the towns,&rdquo; said Gigedo, taking the same  view of the case as had Tim. &ldquo;This I would know if the telegraph wires had not  been cut. But as it is we can but wait.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  meantime,&rdquo; remarked Garibay, dryly &ldquo;Xuarez will land some troops&mdash;already two  thousand lie before the town&mdash;we have hard work, even behind our walls to keep  them back. Now we have scarcely five hundred here capable of defending the  town. Many are dead and wounded&mdash;fever and dysentery prevail greatly. If Xuarez  lands more troops and makes an immediate attack Janjalla must fall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  cannot land more troops while <i>The Iturbide</i> and the torpederas guard the  harbour.&rdquo; said Gigedo in a tone of some displeasure; &ldquo;and even if these two  thousand again assault the walls we can hold out until reinforcements arrive.  His Excellency tells me that two thousand men are to follow in ten days.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;  cried Tim, as Garibay was about to reply; &ldquo;a gun!&mdash;another. Se&ntilde;ores, the  warships are at it again. With your permission, General.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  hastily left the room and went off to the walls where he was soon afterwards  joined by Jack, who had been hurriedly dismissed by the General. They looked  seaward, and saw the performance of a most extraordinary drama. </p>
  <p>It  was now about three o&rsquo;clock, and the ocean like a sheet of glass stretched in  an inclined plane upward to the distant horizon. Owing to the elevation of the  city walls they looked down, as from the heights of an amphitheatre. The  ramparts were crowded with spectators, townsfolk and soldiers. Immediately  below was the beach, the rebel camp&mdash;then the long pier shooting out into the  blue, and beyond the flashing expanse of the sea. <i>The Iturbide</i> was lying  a quarter of a mile from the shore with her two torpederas, one on each side of  her. The cruiser had swung round, and was firing her guns at a slowly  approaching warship. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>The  Columbus</i>!&rdquo; cried Jack, when his eyes fell upon this vessel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  for you, John,&rdquo; said Tim, handing him the glass. &ldquo;She has come south by  herself. I thought you told me the transports were not due here till midnight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more they are. I expect Xuarez, learning through his spies of our departure  from Tlatonac has sent <i>The Columbus</i> on ahead to join forces with <i>The  Pizarro</i>. With two warships he hopes to keep our lot at bay till the  transports with the <i>Cortes</i> are safe in the harbour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sinking of <i>The Pizarro</i> will rather upset his plans. <i>The Columbus</i> dare not attack two torpederas and a cruiser, single-handed.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my soul! that seems exactly what she intends to do, Tim.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  low murmur of surprise arose from the crowd on the ramparts, who were eagerly  watching the warships. It seemed as though <i>The Columbus</i> was bent on her  own destruction, for she came steaming straight ahead for the three ships of  the Junta, insolently flying the red flag of Xuarez. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce does she mean,&rdquo; cried Tim, in perplexity. &ldquo;Surely she can&rsquo;t mistake <i>The  Iturbide</i> for her consort.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she intends to desert,&rdquo; suggested Jack. </p>
  <p><i>The  Columbus</i> was now more within range,  and though hitherto she had been silent under the fire of <i>The Iturbide</i>,  she now began to speak in her turn, and a white line of smoke ran along her  black sides as the balls came singing over the water. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much deserting about that,&rdquo; said Tim, grimly; &ldquo;no! the rebels have some scheme  in their heads.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time Pedraza was thoroughly enraged at the insolence of this one ship  attacking him single-handed, and signalled at once to the torpederas. The  captain of <i>The Columbus</i> saw that the signals ordered the boats to &ldquo;up  anchor,&rdquo; and acted accordingly. In a surprisingly short space of time the rebel  ship had swung round, and with full steam ahead was standing out to sea. The  ships of the Junta were taken by surprise at their man&oelig;uvre, and it was fully a  question of an hour before they started in pursuit. Tim shut his glass with a  click. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack,  I see it all. <i>The Columbus</i> wants to get our boats out of the harbour so  as to let <i>The Cortes</i> and the transports slip in together.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  a risky game, Tim. She&rsquo;ll be overhauled and sunk by the torpederas in no time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  while she can keep them off with her heavy guns! What speed have the  torpederas?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eighteen  to nineteen knots.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And <i>The Columbus</i>?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Rafael says her ordinary speed is fifteen but in case of need she can crack up  steam to eighteen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  that gives the torpederas one knot to the good. But she can outsteam <i>The  Iturbide</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes; sixteen is <i>her</i> limit!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I tell you what! <i>The Columbus</i>, as I said, has come here as a decoy&mdash;she  knows the cruiser can&rsquo;t touch her speed, and she hopes to keep the torpederas  at a safe distance with her heavy guns. She&rsquo;s off in a bee line straight out,  and the other boats are after her. Then she&rsquo;ll dodge them and steam back here  to find <i>The Cortes</i> and the transports all safe in harbour.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you are right, Tim.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I&rsquo;m right. Look at the way she&rsquo;s smoking through the water.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  put the glass to his eyes and saw <i>The Columbus</i> was travelling at top  speed towards the open sea. After her scampered the two torpedo boats like  hounds on her trail. Further behind <i>The Iturbide</i> with the black smoke  vomiting from her funnels was putting her soul into the chase. Pedraza was  evidently determined to follow up one victory by another, and over eager to  sink or capture the crack ironclad of the rebels, forgot all about the incoming  transports. Thus, in half an hour the four ships were mere specks on the  horizon, and the harbour of Janjalla was left open for the arrival of Xuarez  and fresh troops. </p>
  <p>The  crowd of people on the ramparts were too excited at the stirring spectacle of  the chase to think of such a thing, and yelled themselves hoarse in cheering  for Pedraza. Below on the beach the rebels, who had evidently understood the  man&oelig;uvres of <i>The Columbus</i>, were cheering vigorously for Don Hypolito. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  you dogs,&rdquo; cried Jack, shaking his fists at them; &ldquo;soon shall you sing another  tune.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  all the saints so shall we,&rdquo; said Tim, wisely: &ldquo;unless the forts keep off the  transports we&rsquo;ll have another two thousand troops down there this night, and  then&mdash;it&rsquo;s wigs on the green there will be.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you, Tim&mdash;unless the reinforcements arrive.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  then, four thousand attacking a town can do a powerful lot, and when the  reinforcements arrive we&rsquo;ll only have one thousand five hundred to put against  them. However, let us not despair,&rdquo; added Tim, philosophically. &ldquo;Come with me,  Don Juan, and we&rsquo;ll look over the town. Then we&rsquo;ll go and see if there is any  sign of the new troops.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  assented, and descending from the ramparts they made their way through the town  to the house where Tim had his quarters. The streets were filled with soldiers,  who mostly looked smart, and well fitted for their work. Here and there were  wounded men, and a few sick with malarian fever from the adjacent swamp, but on  the whole it was wonderful how healthy was the town. Twice had the rebels  assaulted the walls and twice been beaten back, not without considerable loss  of men on the side of the loyalists. Fortunately, provisions were plentiful,  and it was the cool season, therefore the troops of the Junta were in  comparatively good condition. Despite their small numbers, they were so  heartened by the sinking of <i>The Pizarro</i>, that it was plain they would  fight like fiends to hold Janjalla until aid arrived from the capital. </p>
  <p>The  townspeople took the fact of being besieged in the most contented manner, and  hardly interrupted their daily occupations. In the streets the tortilleras were  crying their wares, the water-carriers proclaiming the fact that they sold &ldquo;aqua  limpia,&rdquo; and, but for the unusual number of soldiers, it would have been quite  impossible to see that the city was in the very jaws of danger. At times a  woman wrapped in the rebozo would pass along the street, but as a rule they  kept within doors, and showed themselves but rarely. In the plazas men were  being drilled, and many of the houses were used as hospitals for the sick and  wounded. </p>
  <p>Tim  and Jack made their way through the crowded streets, and duly arrived at the  former&rsquo;s quarters, where they found Peter eagerly expecting them. He was weary  of being by himself, and when he heard they were going to the land-gate to seek  news of the reinforcements, insisted on accompanying them. After taking a drink  of aguardiente, of which they stood much in need, owing to the exhaustion  caused by excitement, the three friends set off at once to see if they could  hear anything about the expected troops. </p>
  <p>Don  Sebastian was fraternising with the captain in command of the cavalry, as his  own troops had been sent forward to the sea ramparts. The mounted regiments  were stationed at this end of the town as they were more useful in sallies than  were the infantry. This was proved by the way in which they had succoured the  soldiers from <i>The Iturbide</i>, as only horse-men could have kept the rebel  troops at bay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  signs yet, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Don Sebastian, politely; &ldquo;but half an hour ago the  general sent out two Indian scouts with instructions to inquire at Centeotl for  our men.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is twenty miles away.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but these Indians travel fast. Before midnight we shall hear news of our  troops&mdash;that is if they get as far south as Centeotl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  before midnight Xuarez will have landed his new regiments,&rdquo; said Tim, turning  away. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no help for it, I suppose. Come, Jack and Peter, &lsquo;tis no  use waiting here. We must wait till these scouts return.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  meanwhile, Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  with me to the telegraph-office. I&rsquo;m going to send an account of the sea-fight  to my paper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure the wires are not cut to the southward?&rdquo; said Peter, as they trudged  along to the office. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  weren&rsquo;t this morning anyhow. Why should they cut them? All they want to do is  to intercept communication with the capital. They don&rsquo;t care two straws what  goes to England.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Xuarez  does. He told me so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  but, you see, Xuarez is not here at present, and has forgotten to give orders  to cut them. When he arrives again, he&rsquo;ll do it, maybe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  seeing that he wishes the world to look on him as a noble patriot, he certainly  won&rsquo;t care about your wiring plain truths about him to the old country. He&rsquo;ll  either cut the wires or bring a war correspondent on his own hook.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  rival!&rdquo; cried Tim, indignantly. &ldquo;If I thought so, I&rsquo;d shoulder a musket myself,  and go out to shoot the dirty villain. Here&rsquo;s the P.O., my boys! Peter! hold  your noise. Jack&rsquo;s going to give me a history of the fight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know as much about it as Jack does,&rdquo; said Peter, in an injured tone, as they  entered the office. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll let you put in a word here and there,&rdquo; replied his friend, in a kind tone.  &ldquo;Why, Peter, I&rsquo;d do anything to please you. Didn&rsquo;t I think you were knocked out  of time, entirely. Manuel, are the wires right?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the operator, a dark alert-looking man; &ldquo;all safe to Truxillo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Then they will be safe to England. Truxillo is in Honduras, and is as right as  the Bank. Come, Jack, begin at once!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were over two hours at this business as, what with Jack&rsquo;s roundabout  descriptions and Peter&rsquo;s interruptions, it took some time for Tim to get the  story ship-shape. Then Manuel was constantly wiring the intelligence, as  transmitted to him by Tim, who took full advantage of the licence given by his  editor to send extensive telegrams. It was close on six o&rsquo;clock when he  finished, and he was just stretching himself with a yawn after his long spell  of sitting, when outside a murmur began. It rapidly swelled into a roar and the  three friends rushed out of the office to learn what new event had taken place.  The telegraph-office was situated in the street which ran straight to the  land-gate, and down this street they saw advancing a dense body of men. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vivas  los soldatos! Viva el Republico!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  roared Tim, wildly, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis the reinforcements!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  Philip!&rdquo; cried Jack, pushing his way through the crowd. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  wounded!&rdquo; said Peter, noticing with a true professional eye that Cassim&rsquo;s left  arm hung useless by his side. </p>
  <p>The  Janjalla Band, stationed in the Plaza, burst out into the patriotic strains of  the &ldquo;Opal Fandango,&rdquo; the crowd yelled and cheered, the soldiers tramped  steadily down the street; and Tim, to the imminent danger of his life, flung  himself almost under the feet of Philip&rsquo;s horse. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip,  my dear boy! Here we are.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim!  Jack! Thank God!&rdquo; cried Philip, and urging his horse a little way to the side,  jumped down from the saddle. </p>
  <p>Tim  gripped one hand, Jack the other, and Peter patted the baronet on the back.  Philip looked worn and haggard, and winced as Tim seized his left hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you wounded?&rdquo; cried Tim, letting it go. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but not badly! An Indian arrow through the fleshy part of the arm.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  exclaimed Jack, anxiously, &ldquo;then Cocom was right. You have been attacked by  Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  days ago! They surprised our camp by night, and came in in overwhelming force.  Velez was unable to rally his men, and we were forced to retreat to Centeotl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how many men have you brought, Philip?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six  hundred!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  one thousand started from Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Jack, sadly; &ldquo;four hundred killed.  Thank God, Philip, you at least are safe.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXVII"></a>Chapter XXVII<br>
    The Fall Of Janjalla</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">They  mount the ramparts, and they man the walls,<br>
  Resolved to keep the climbing foe at bay,<br>
  The hot-mouthed cannon hurl a thousand balls,<br>
  A thousand swords flash forth to wound and slay.<br>
  Down in the fosse the planted ladder falls,<br>
  And smoke sulphurous spreads its veil of grey;<br>
  Like incense from an altar up it rolls,<br>
  To tell the war-god that a thousand souls<br>
  Are to his honour sacrificed this day.</p>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  Mars! Oh, red Bellona! he or she,<br>
  Though fallen your shrines, we bend yet &lsquo;neath your yoke;<br>
  Born later than the Greeks, we seem to be<br>
  Not much more civilised than were those folk,<br>
  Instead of spears, and shields, and cutlery,<br>
  Revolvers, rifles, guns, spit fire and smoke.<br>
  For ye, blood-thirsty pair, we yet retain<br>
  Our ancient love, and hence on battle plain<br>
  With myriad victims we your names invoke.</p>
  <p>The  siege of Janjalla lasted five days, and during that period the town was  completely invested by the troops of Xuarez. As had been foreseen by him, the <i>Columbus</i>,  acting as a decoy, had drawn away the ships of the Junta from protecting the  harbour, and that same night Xuarez, under cover of darkness, landed four  thousand troops from his transports. By an inconceivable oversight on the part  of the engineers, the city walls were unprovided with search-lights and  electric apparatus, so Don Hypolito was enabled to land boat-load after  boat-load of men without hindrance. By dawn six thousand men were encamped on  the beach, under the very guns of the forts. </p>
  <p>Had  Xuarez attacked the capital, he would have been easily repulsed, for in  Tlatonac all the latest inventions for defence were to be found. Krupp&rsquo;s guns  pointed from the forts, powerful electric lights swept the harbour, and the bed  of the ocean in front of the sea-line was one vast mass of torpedoes. The  flower of the Cholacacan army were behind the walls, armed with the latest  invented rifles, and altogether a siege of the capital would have lasted  months. Don Hypolito, however, was too crafty to waste his time so fruitlessly,  and artfully attacked the Republic in her weakest part. </p>
  <p>Janjalla  was but ill defended by walls and cannon and but ill garrisoned with capable  men. By throwing on the devoted town an overwhelming mass of troops he could  hope to capture it within a few days. Then making it his head-quarters, could  gradually advance along the plain towards the capital, eating up a town at  every twenty miles. He was already master of Acauhtzin in the north, and if he  could only reduce Janjalla and the four inland towns, he would be in complete  command of the whole inner country. Then, besieging Tlatonac by land and sea,  he could starve the capital into surrender. </p>
  <p>Promptness  was Xuarez&rsquo; great characteristic, and so rapidly had he accomplished the transference  of active operations from north to south that he had completely taken the Junta  by surprise. It was a fatal mistake on the part of the Governmental party in  leaving such an incapable man as Gomez at the head of affairs. If, relying on  the strength of the capital to protect herself, he had sent all his available  soldiers to garrison Janjalla and defeat the rebels before they could get a  footing in the south, he would have probably crushed the rebellion in the bud.  Victorious in the lower part of the country, he could have then reduced  Acauhtzin at his leisure, and thus ended the war within a few weeks. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately,  Gomez lost his head at the critical period, and proved himself quite unable to  cope with the masterly activity of the rebel leader. First of all, he committed  the mistake of not concentrating his troops at Janjalla, and then sent a few  hundreds of men down at a time. General Gigedo therefore found himself shut up  in Janjalla with scarcely a thousand troops, few guns, and insufficient ammunition.  The telegraph-wires having been cut, he was unable to communicate promptly with  the capital, and being in urgent need of reinforcements, was in absolute  despair as to what would occur in the near future. It was true that Gomez had  promised another thousand men in ten days; but, even if they arrived earlier,  it would be too late, as with the small garrison at his disposal, it was  impossible that he could hold out against a force of six thousand for any  lengthened period. </p>
  <p>He  would have sent messengers to Tlatonac for aid, but the troops of Don Hypolito  completely encircled the city, and it was worse than useless to try and break  through that girdle of steel. He held a council of war, but no decision could  be arrived at, save that Janjalla should hold out, if possible, until  reinforcements arrived from the capital. Day after day Gigedo and his staff  swept the ocean with their glasses, looking for the torpederas and the cruiser.  None of them appeared, and it could only be conjectured that they had captured <i>The  Columbus</i>, and taken her at once to Tlatonac, in the harbour of which they  were now doubtless lying. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the garrison fought with desperate valour, and with great difficulty managed to  keep the rebels at bay, but it could be easily seen that such a state of things  could not last. On the fourth day preparations were made by Xuarez for a final  assault, and everyone instinctively guessed that the end had come. <i>The  Cortes</i> was lying with the transports out of range of the fort-guns, and, by  means of their glasses, those shut up in the town could see that the warship  was making ready to bombard the city. </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito had come south again, with his new troops, and could be now seen  riding about the camp with a brilliant staff, seeing that all things were ready  for the assault. Jack, who, in company with Philip, was leaning over the  ramparts, noted the audacious rebel, and remarked on his presence before the  walls of Janjalla. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  goes the brain of the rebellion,&rdquo; he said touching Philip on the shoulder. &ldquo;If  he could only be disposed of, the war would be over.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. But Xuarez knows his own value too well, and will therefore keep out of  danger. He has evidently made up his mind to finish the siege to-day.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  help comes, I think he will succeed,&rdquo; replied Jack, gloomily. &ldquo;I cannot  conceive what the President or Maraquando can be thinking about to thus neglect  Janjalla. If this town falls into the hands of Xuarez, as it must do, unless a  miracle takes place, Don Francisco will find the war longer than he expects.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gomez  is a fool,&rdquo; said Philip, stamping his foot. &ldquo;What the deuce is the use of  keeping all the army in the capital? There must be ten thousand soldiers shut  up in Tlatonac, and his Excellency evidently intends to keep them there till  Xuarez and his victorious troops arrive before the walls.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely the Indians are before the walls now, and are waiting for Xuarez to join  them.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not improbable. Things don&rsquo;t look promising for the Junta, and all because they  let Gomez muddle the business. See, the rebels are marching up to the sea-gate.  It is now noon. Before sundown they will be within the walls, and masters of  the city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the garrison?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their  lives depend on the caprice of Xuarez,&rdquo; said Philip, after a pause. &ldquo;He may let  Gigedo march out with the remains of his troop, or massacre every one of us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t intend to be massacred,&rdquo; replied Jack, dryly; &ldquo;and, what is more, I don&rsquo;t  intend to be seen by Xuarez. He must know by this time, through his spies, that  I escaped from Totatzine, but he is probably ignorant that I am in Janjalla. I  must escape unseen, Philip, else he will send me back to be slaughtered by  Ixtlilxochitli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,  Jack, while Tim is at hand!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito,&rdquo; said Philip, sagely, &ldquo;wishes to stand well with the world. Tim is  the medium through which his actions are reported to the world. Were he to send  an Englishman to be offered up by savages to a barbaric deity, there would be  trouble with England. Xuarez can&rsquo;t afford to risk that, so he will let you go  free.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t do that in Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Acauhtzin, my friend, you were supposed by us to be killed in the riot. He  could do as he pleased with one, who, to the world was practically a  non-existing person. Here it is different. You are alive, you are with your  friends, one of whom is a correspondent of a great English journal. He dare not  seize you for his own ends in broad daylight. No, my dear Jack, while we are  beside you, Xuarez will think twice before repeating his treachery of  Acauhtzin. He will have to look for a new victim for Ixtlilxochitli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fervently hope and trust so,&rdquo; answered Jack, looking at his revolver to see  that it was loaded. &ldquo;And now I suppose we had better go to the Plaza. The  troops must be assembling just now. Hark! there goes the trumpet. Where is Tim?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the telegraph-office, with Peter, wiring news to his paper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Peter,&rdquo; said Duval, as they left the ramparts; &ldquo;he came here to collect  beetles, and finds himself plunged into an unpleasant war.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind. There&rsquo;s nothing like experience, Jack. Peter will recount his deeds of  valour, even unto the third generation. We will come out safe in the end. You  will marry Dolores, I Eulalia, and all will be gas and gaiters, <i>videlicet</i> Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip&rsquo;s  gaiety was infectious, and Jack burst out laughing at his last remark. They had  no time, however, for further conversation, as the trumpets were calling loudly  in the Plaza, and they hurried to that portion of the town to find the troops  rapidly falling in. General Gigedo made a speech to encourage his soldiers,  assuring them that he had communicated with Tlatonac, and that relief would  shortly come to the besieged town. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that true, or a lie?&rdquo; asked Jack of Don Sebastian, who stood beside him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  replied the Spaniard, smiling. &ldquo;This morning carrier pigeons were sent to his  Excellency with messages of our deplorable state. We shall certainly be  relieved in a few days.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  few days!&rdquo; echoed Philip, with a sneer. &ldquo;My dear Se&ntilde;or de Ahumada, a few hours  will see our troops evacuating Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we are forced to do that, Se&ntilde;or, we can fall back on Centeotl.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  with a few hundred men, and the Indians scouring the country?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are further north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  assure you they are not,&rdquo; replied Cassim, emphatically. &ldquo;We were attacked near  Centeotl, and by this time the savages are between that town and this. Se&ntilde;or de  Ahumada, I assure you that if we evacuate Janjalla, we shall fall into the  hands of the Indians.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  cried Don Sebastian, suddenly. &ldquo;<i>The Cortes</i> has started bombarding.&rdquo; Even  as he spoke a bomb burst in the air directly over the Plaza. At once Gigedo  gave the signal to the troops to march to the ramparts. In the distance they  could hear the fierce cries of the rebels as they marched out of camp, and a  tremour passed through the whole of the city as those within its walls  recognised the desperate state of affairs. Bomb after bomb exploded with  deafening noises, the troops manned the walls, the besiegers hurled themselves  against the sea-gate and planted ladders against the walls. The assault had  commenced. It was the beginning of the end. </p>
  <p>The  full force at the disposal of General Gigedo, excluding the sick and wounded,  amounted to some nine hundred men. He divided this into two portions: five  hundred held the sea-facing portion of the town, four hundred were stationed at  the inland gate. Xuarez attacked the two gates of the town simultaneously, and  trusted, in the event of entering at either portal, to be enabled to attack the  loyalists in the rear, and thus crush them between two armies. </p>
  <p>On  the ramparts it was not so difficult to keep the foe back as it was below. They  planted ladders, and these were hurled with their burden of climbing men into  the ditch below. An incessant fusillade of musketry crackled along the walls,  and the cannon with depressed muzzles hurled their balls with more or less  damaging effect into the dense throng massed on the beach below. The bombs from <i>The Cortes</i> did their deadly work skilfully, and the besiegers kept  themselves as widely apart as possible, so as to neutralise the effect of the  shells on compact masses. </p>
  <p>It  was outside the sea-gate, however, that the siege was pressed most hardly.  Xuarez had cannon planted at the gate, to break down, if possible, the huge  wooden valves, clamped with iron. Through the loop-holes low down in the walls  the besiegers fired incessantly, killing the rebel gunners as they strove to  discharge the cannon. Above the city hung a thick cloud of grey smoke, and at  intervals, through the misty veil, flared the red flame of a bomb bursting  overhead. The rattle of musketry, the booming of cannon, the cries of the  wounded, the shouts of besieged and besiegers, all made an infernal din  deafening to the ear. </p>
  <p>Tim  and Peter were at the land-gate in company with Captain Velez and Colonel  Garibay, while Jack and Philip fought side by side in repelling the attack from  the sea front. After an incessant cannonading lasting two hours, the rebels  managed to smash the gates down with their artillery, and rushed in only to  find themselves confronted by a dense mass of resolute soldiery. </p>
  <p>From  the sea-gate the street arose suddenly, and on the top of the incline Gigedo  had planted cannon which cut lanes in the throng of rebels pressing through the  gate. At last the battle resolved itself into a hand-to-hand fight in which the  loyalists strove to beat back the rebel forces from the gate. Xuarez saw this,  and signalled to <i>The Cortes</i> to stand in closer and drop her shells into  the centre of the besieged. At once the warship did as she was commanded, and  in a few moments bombs were creating fearful havoc in the ranks of the  loyalists. In answer, the guns of the forts speedily opened fire on the  warship, but did little damage, as the besiegers were too busily occupied in  repelling the foe as they swarmed up the walls, to take careful aim. </p>
  <p>What  with the dense crowd pressing from without, the loss of men caused by the  incessant bursting of the bombs in their midst, the loyalists began to fall  back, and, in spite of the most desperate resistance, were thrust beyond the  line of cannon at the top of the street. A horde of rebel soldiery rushed  inside the gate, and proceeded to scale the ramparts in order to aid their  comrades who were climbing the outer walls, and to silence the guns playing on <i>The  Cortes</i>. </p>
  <p>Skilfully  making use of all material he found to hand, Xuarez turned the cannon taken  from the loyalists on themselves. In the hurried retreat, they had been unable  to spike the guns, and now these, loaded and fired by the rebels, were mowing  them down in dozens. The soldiers on the ramparts were either killed or beaten  back, and the whole of the sea front of Janjalla was in complete possession of  Xuarez. One comfort had the loyalists, namely, that they were protected in the  rear by their men defending the land-gate. </p>
  <p>Shortly,  however, a roar of rage, and the cheers of the besiegers announced that the  town was captured on that side. The soldiers retreated towards the Plaza in the  centre of the town, and there found their comrades who had fallen back from the  sea-gate. Here there was this handful of men shut up in the square, surrounded  on all sides by the victorious rebels. They could not possibly hold out long  against the dense masses converging to that centre from all parts of the town,  and it could be easily seen that the siege was practically over. </p>
  <p>During  the fighting night had fallen, and now the battle was going on in the dim  twilight, rendered still darker by the heavily hanging clouds of smoke  enwrapping the town. Jack had received a nasty cut on the shoulder; but Philip  was unwounded, and in the general scrimmage they managed to keep well together.  When beaten back into the Plaza, they made for the telegraph-office, where they  hoped to find Tim and Peter. This was the rendezvous appointed by Tim in case  the battle went in favour of the rebels, as he wished to send a final message  to his paper before clearing out of the town. With a handful of men,  principally those belonging to their own regiment, Philip and Jack managed to  throw themselves into the telegraph-office, and shortly afterwards were joined  by Tim. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  Peter?&rdquo; asked Jack, as he saw the huge form of his friend dashing through the  door. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  behind, with Don Sebastian,&rdquo; gasped Tim, throwing himself into a chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all up, boys; the Opposidores are in full possession of the land-gate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the sea-gate also,&rdquo; said Philip, who was reloading his revolver. &ldquo;All our men  are in the Plaza, and can&rsquo;t hold out much longer. Whew! there&rsquo;s another bomb.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d  better get out of Janjalla, and make for Centeotl,&rdquo; cried Don Sebastian,  entering with his sword smashed in two; &ldquo;all is over!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gigedo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed!  Garibay is wounded, and taken prisoner!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Don Pedro?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  I am,&rdquo; cried Peter, darting into the room and closing the door. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a  regiment of rebels cutting their way through the crowd to take the  telegraph-office. Xuarez has particularly commanded it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow,  I&rsquo;ll have time to send another telegram, if I die for it,&rdquo; said Tim, who was  hastily scribbling notes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Manuel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Manuel  had vanished; so Tim, with a growl, sat down to work the instrument himself. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  those devils out, with your men,&rdquo; he said to Philip, who was barricading the  windows with Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one telegram, saying Janjalla has fallen, and  then we&rsquo;ll go off.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  the devil are we to get away?&rdquo; asked Philip, angrily. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily.  The cavalry barracks are behind here. We&rsquo;ll get round by the back way and seize  the horses, then cut our way out by the land-gate. Once across the river, and  we are safe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  did not wait for the conclusion of this speech, but, with a few men, dashed out  at the back of the house to see if the horses were still there. Jack would have  followed, but Peter stopped him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have my medicine-chest here. Let me bind up your shoulder.&rdquo; Jack was unwilling,  protesting he did not feel the wound. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh,  my dear boy, you are excited. You will feel it afterwards. If we are to ride to  Centeotl, you will need all the blood you have. Don Sebastian can hold the  telegraph-office.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Sebastian had posted his men at the windows, and was firing at the mass of  rebels, now trying to take the house by storm. All this time Tim was working  the instrument and wiring the news of the fall of the city to his editor.  Through the yells outside, the rattle of the musketry, and the curses of Don  Sebastian could be heard the incessant click, click, click of the  telegraph-instrument. </p>
  <p>A  bomb exploded on the roof of the house, and a few yards of plaster fell from  the ceiling. Peter had finished binding up Jack&rsquo;s wound, and now they were both  defending the windows and doors of the mansion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  two minutes the door will be down,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Do leave that d&mdash;d instrument,  Tim, and look for Philip.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go!&rdquo; said Peter, as Tim refused to leave his post. He turned to make for the  back way, when Philip came back with a radiant face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is a dozen horses just outside, all saddled and fresh as daisies! Come, Tim,  quick! Jack. De Ahumada.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  moment,&rdquo; said Tim, and went on with his clicking. </p>
  <p>Crash!  The door was down, and a number of fierce faces appeared at the door. The room  was full of smoke, and the rebels were firing freely through the windows.  Sebastian and his men threw themselves in front of those trying to face the  door, and Philip, seizing Tim by the shoulder, dragged him away from the  instrument. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim,  you cursed fool. Come along!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  a second!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  turned back to the instrument in spite of Philip&rsquo;s protest, but had just  clicked twice when Don Sebastian and his men were forced back and a crowd of  the enemy rushed into the room. Philip, Jack, and Peter had already disappeared  through the back, and Tim was left alone with Don Sebastian and the soldiers.  The rebels threw themselves forward with yells of delight, when Tim, catching  up a heavy table, flung it fair on the advancing mass, then bolted through the  back door, dragging Don Sebastian after him. Two of the soldiers followed, and  promptly closed the door when on the right side. At once the rebels commenced  to beat it down with the butts of their rifles, but the Irishman and his friend  had reached the back street. </p>
  <p>Here  they found their friends already mounted and waiting for them. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim.  De Ahumada! Mount at once!&rdquo; cried Philip, pointing to three horses waiting  under the shelter of the wall. &ldquo;Make for the land-gate, and straight for the  river.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  another moment they were clattering towards the lower part of the town, keeping  close together for safety. The street down which they were riding was quite  deserted, as the fighting was principally confined to the main thoroughfares of  the town. They could hear the brisk fire of musketry still kept up, the booming  of the cannon, and the bursting of the shells. Shrieks of women, and yells of  the victors broke incessantly through these noises, and the whole city was  draped in a thick veil of stinking smoke. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  those poor women!&rdquo; cried Philip, as he spurred his horse towards the gate. &ldquo;Now  they are in the clutches of those fiends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; muttered Dr. Grench, thankfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo;  said Tim, cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent the fall of the city to the paper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  hang your paper,&rdquo; said Jack, whose wound was making him fractious. &ldquo;Come along,  De Ahumada.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  How we have been beaten.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Suddenly  the street turned a sharp angle, and they found themselves before the gate.  Most of the attacking party had marched towards the centre of the town to  complete their victory, and only a few scattered soldiery were on guard. These  yelled loudly as they saw the small party dash towards the gate. The valves  were broken down; beyond was the country, and between this and safety was but a  score of men. </p>
  <p>Philip  drew his sword, spurred his horse to its full speed, and made for the gate,  cutting down a man who tried to stay him. Jack emptied two barrels of his  revolver, and killed one man, wounding another. The rebel soldiers fired  freely, and breaking Sebastian&rsquo;s arm, also tumbled one of his company off his  horse. Tim seizing Peter&rsquo;s bridle-rein, galloped wildly through the spare  crowd, cursing freely. </p>
  <p>In  their rush for the portal, they scattered them all. There were a few  musket-shots, a howl of rage from the disappointed rebels, and at top speed  they tore out of the gate, and made for the open country. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty  miles,&rdquo; cried Philip, settling himself in his saddle. &ldquo;We can do that easily.  Hurrah!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Provided  we don&rsquo;t fall into the hands of the Indians,&rdquo; said Jack, sagely. </p>
  <p>As  for Don Sebastian, he turned round and shook his fist at Janjalla. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXVIII"></a>Chapter XXVIII<br>
    The Flight To Tlatonac</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Boot  and saddle, away! away!<br>
  We must be far e&rsquo;er the breaking of day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard is down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foe&rsquo;s in the town,<br>
  Forbidding us longer to stay, to stay.</p>
  <p class="poem">Boot  and saddle! we ride! we ride!<br>
  Over the prairie land side by side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foemen behind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed swift as the wind,<br>
  And gain on us steadily, stride by stride.</p>
  <p class="poem">Boot  and saddle! so fast! so fast!<br>
  We ride till the river be crossed and past;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then over the plain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With loose-hanging rein,<br>
  And find ourselves safe in the town at last.</p>
  <p>Before  them spread the plains, flat and desolate-looking, covered with coarse grass,  and stretching towards the horizon in vague immensity. West-ward the faint  flush of sunset, delicately pale, lingered low down, but otherwise the sky was  coldly clear, darkly blue, thick sprinkled with chill-looking stars. To the  right the leaden-hued waters of the river moving sluggishly between low mud  banks, and on the left sandy wastes, alternating with hillocks and  convex-shaped mounds. All this desolation appearing ghostly under a veil of  mist exhaled whitely from the hot earth. </p>
  <p>Over  these monotonous plains galloped the six fugitives. Philip and Jack in the van,  Don Sebastian and his one soldier in the rear; between Tim, side by side with  Peter. For some time they urged on their horses in silence. Then a sudden flare  of crimson caused them to turn in their saddles. The low walls of Janjalla were  crowned with smoke, beneath which leaped tongues of flame, crimson and yellow.  A rapid, disjointed conversation ensued. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  brutes are burning the city!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will only be some drunken soldiers. Xuarez will soon put a stop to that. He  cannot afford to lose his city of refuge, after paying so much to gain it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must  we swim our horses across the river?&rdquo; called out Grench, unexpectedly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless the bridge is down. It was standing when we came this way a week ago.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  answered the question, and then cast an anxious look at the sky. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish the moon would rise,&rdquo; he said disconsolately; &ldquo;we need some light.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce would be the good of that when we&rsquo;re on the high-road. Hang it, the  moon would only show Xuarez how to follow us.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Que  dici?&rdquo; asked Don Sebastian, looking at Jack. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal thinks we might be pursued.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it, Don Juan. Xuarez will be too busy checking the excesses of his  soldiers. Besides, Se&ntilde;or, as we escaped in the confusion, it may be that we  will not be missed for some hours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Peter,  unaccustomed to riding, began to feel sore with this incessant galloping, and  raised his voice in protest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope we will be able to rest at Centeotl. When do we reach it?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  midnight, probably. Then we will rest till dawn, get fresh horses, and push on  to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope  we&rsquo;ll get there,&rdquo; muttered Jack, shaking his reins. &ldquo;But if the Indians&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deuce  take the Indians,&rdquo; retorted Philip, irritably. &ldquo;Come on Jack, and don&rsquo;t worry  so much.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Their  horses were fortunately quite fresh, having been mewed up in Janjalla without  exercise for some weeks. Stretching their necks, they clattered along at a  breakneck speed. The road was as hard as flint, and their iron-shod hoofs  struck out sparks from the loose stones. The riders, with their heads bent  against the wind whizzing past their ears, let the reins hang loosely, and  pressed on with blind trust along the highway leading to Centeotl. </p>
  <p>Here  and there they passed a flat-roofed house, deserted by its occupants, and  standing up lonely, a white splotch amid the vague gloom of its flat acreage.  Clumps of trees loomed suddenly against the clear sky, at times a ragged aloe  sprang spectral-like from the reddish soil, thorny thickets lay densely in the  hollows, tall spear-grass waved on the tops of undulating drifts of sand, and  at intervals an oasis of rank herbage would frame an oval pool thickly fringed  with reeds. </p>
  <p>The  road wound onward, turning now to right, now to left, dipping into hollows,  curving over eminences, stretching white and dusty towards the horizon like a  crooked winding river. On either side they could mark the moving forms of  animals, flying from the clatter of their horses&rsquo; hoofs, cattle, vicu&ntilde;as,  llamas, and flocks of sheep. The white peak of Xicotencatl arose suddenly like  a ghost from the shadows of forests lying heavily along the verge of earth  between plain and sky. A thin vapour lay white over the plain, and gathered  thickly along the banks of the river. The horses stretched their necks and  neighed loudly. They smelt the water of the stream. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bridge is down!&rdquo; cried Jack, drawing rein at the verge of the stream. &ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  Xuarez!&rdquo; added Philip, gravely. &ldquo;I suspect the latter. Indians are not  sufficiently civilised to destroy bridges.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the bridge impeded the current, and here the waters  boiled white amid the black ruins. Jagged posts stretched in black rows to the  other side of the stream, but there was no foothold left by which they could  cross dry-shod. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swim!&rdquo;  said Tim, briefly, and sent his steed down the bank. The others followed, and  in a few minutes the surface of the stream was dotted with black figures. The  river being sluggish, with little or no current, they found no difficulty in  crossing, and speedily gained the opposite bank. Climbing the slope on to the  flat land, they regained the line of road, and once more urged their horses to  full speed. </p>
  <p>The  moon arose, round and bright, making the whole scene cheerful with her kindly  light. The fugitives looked back, but could see no sign of pursuit. Even the  town had vanished. Behind, before, lay nothing but the immensity of the plains.  It was as though they were in the midst of a leaden-hued sea. The appearance of  the moon raised their spirits, and they redoubled their speed. Centeotl was now  comparatively near. The ground began to show signs of cultivation. Hedges of  cacti ran along the sides of the road, bearing fleshly looking flowers of tawny  gold. Right and left stretched gardens, environing country houses, and before  them arose a white line of wall. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Centeotl!&rdquo;  cried Don Sebastian, pushing forward. </p>
  <p>The  gates were closed owing to the fear of the townspeople lest the Indians should  make a night attack. De Ahumada galloped on ahead, and reined his horse  immediately under the walls. At intervals the sentinels called the one to the  other, &ldquo;Centinella alerte,&rdquo; to show that they were awake. The noise of the  approaching horses brought them to the walls. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quien  vive!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amigos!  From Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  red light of torches glared from the low battlements, and in a few minutes the  gates were opened. The officer in charge recognised Don Sebastian, and was much  depressed at learning Janjalla had fallen. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  It is Centeotl next that Xuarez will capture,&rdquo; he said, disconsolately, and  then led the fugitives to the house of the Jefe Politico. </p>
  <p>That  individual received them kindly, and gave them food and beds. He also promised  them horses for the next morning, to push on to Tlatonac, but feared lest they  should fall into the hands of the Indians, whom he believed were further north.  The telegraph-wires between Centeotl and Hermanita had been destroyed by the  savages. His town was now quite isolated in the plains. Only five hundred men  were within its walls, and he expected it would be shortly besieged and  captured by Don Hypolito, unless aid arrived from the capital. </p>
  <p>During  the night straggling parties of soldiers arrived from Janjalla for refuge. All  brought the same tale. Janjalla was nearly in ruins, as the rebels had fired  many houses, and the bombs and cannon had smashed others. Xuarez had kept all  his men in the town, and was doing his best to reduce them to order; but many  were beyond his control. There was no pursuit in any case. It was reported that  he would throw forward two regiments of cavalry next day, to attack Centeotl. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!&rdquo;  said the Jefe, in despair; &ldquo;we are lost, Se&ntilde;ores. When you arrive at Tlatonac,  tell his Excellency that I am faithful to the Junta, but that my town is too  weak to hold out against the rebels.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>De  Ahumada promised and shortly afterwards, thoroughly worn out, they all composed  themselves to sleep. It was impossible, however, to get much repose, as the  constant arrival of fugitives, the clattering of horses through the streets,  and the murmur of many voices, kept them awake. At dawn they were up at once,  mounted fresh horses, and rode away from the town in the direction of  Hermanita, twenty miles away. </p>
  <p>They  reached that town in two hours, and found the inhabitants in a state of terror.  The Indians had been threatening for the last week, and had been scouring the  country to the south. Now they had gone north, and, it was believed, with the  intention of making an attack on the Puebla de los Naranjos. Nor did the news  brought by Jack and his friends reassure them in any way. What with the Indians  in the north, and Xuarez threatening them in the south, there was no doubt that  Hermanita was in a terrible fix. As had Centeotl, they also implored Don  Sebastian to ask Gomez to send aid, lest they should fall victims to the rebels  or to the Indians. </p>
  <p>After  taking a hurried meal, the fugitives once more proceeded on their way to the  north. Towards noon they struck Puebla de los Naranjos, and found it a heap of  ruins. Undefended as were the other towns by stone walls, the town was  surrounded by orange groves, and had therefore been easily captured by the  Indians. A few terrified survivors crept about the ruins of their houses, the  streets were thick with dead bodies, and the whole place presented a scene of  unexampled desolation. Those folks who survived said that the Indians had  plundered the town two days previously, and had then departed with the  intention of taking Chichimec. As this city was only distant twenty miles from  the capital, the little party was quite appalled at the audacity of the  savages. It showed how little they cared for the power of the Republic. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Gomez had crushed this rebellion at once, all would have been well,&rdquo; said Jack,  as they rode from the smoking ruins of Puebla de los Naranjos; &ldquo;but now it  seems as though the Indians and Xuarez were going to have it all their own way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gomez  should have placed the command of affairs in the hands of a competent man, and  not meddled with them,&rdquo; replied Philip, impatiently. &ldquo;He keeps all his army in  the capital, and lets the country be laid waste. The end will be that all the  inland towns will join with Xuarez, and the capital will be besieged. With the  whole of Cholacaca against it, the capital must fall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  the Junta can capture or sink the two remaining warships of Xuarez,&rdquo; said Don  Sebastian, who was fearfully enraged at the destruction of the country. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  Then Xuarez won&rsquo;t be able to get more troops from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has got quite enough troops, as it is to make things unpleasant for the  capital,&rdquo; said Tim, in Spanish, for the benefit of Don Sebastian. &ldquo;Six thousand  at Janjalla&mdash;five thousand Indians. Quite enough to invest the town. The Junta  has but eight thousand troops in Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s a good number!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but what with his own troops and the savages, Xuarez has three thousand to the  good. Besides which, he is a capable general.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the Indians could only be detached from his cause, the rebellion might be  crushed,&rdquo; said Jack, ponderingly. &ldquo;It is the only way of saving the present  Government.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no chance of doing that,&rdquo; replied Tim, disconsolately. &ldquo;The Indians are mad  about the loss of the opal, and will fight like fiends to get it back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  they can be quietened by means of the opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  exclaimed Sebastian, turning in his saddle. &ldquo;What mean you, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have an idea,&rdquo; replied Jack, quietly. &ldquo;It was suggested to me by a remark of  Cocom&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this idea?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not tell you at present, lest I should fail to carry it out, and thus  disappoint your hopes. Wait till we reach Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we ever do get there,&rdquo; muttered Philip, savagely. &ldquo;Now we are half way to  Chichimec, gentlemen. There, according to report, the Indians are camped. I  vote we make a detour, and reach Tlatonac in some other way. Do you know of a  road, Don Sebastian?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or. I know not this country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do!&rdquo; cried Duval, suddenly. &ldquo;I have been all over this portion. That is a good  idea of yours, Philip! We must avoid the Indians. I know a road!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Take the lead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was fortunate, indeed, that Philip suggested such an idea, and that Jack&rsquo;s  knowledge of the country enabled them to carry it out, else they would  assuredly have fallen into the hands of the Indians. Making a detour towards  the coast, they managed to avoid Chichimec by some miles. They learned from a  peon, whom they met making his way to Tlatonac, that the town was entirely  invested by the savages, but that as yet, thanks to the strong walls, they had  been unable to effect an entrance. The Jefe Politico had sent this peon to the  capital with a request for immediate aid from Don Francisco. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  in God&rsquo;s name, can the President be thinking about?&rdquo; cried Jack, on hearing  this intelligence. &ldquo;He is simply playing into the hands of his enemies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things  certainly look bad for the Junta, owing to his negligence. Janjalla captured by  Xuarez. Puebla de los Naranjos ravaged, Chichimec invested. Perhaps, when the  whole country is in the hands of Don Hypolito, this very wise ruler will bestir  himself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till I have a conversation with Don Miguel!&rdquo; muttered Jack, striking the spurs  into his horse. &ldquo;We are outsiders, and cannot interfere with local politics;  but it makes me sick to see how Gomez is fooling away his chances. If I can  only rouse Don Miguel into making things hot for the President, I shall do so!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  house divided against itself&mdash;&rdquo; began Peter; but Tim cut him short. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue, Peter. Jack is quite right. Unless a good man is put at the head  of affairs, Don Hypolito will enter Tlatonac within the month. It&rsquo;s a mighty  black look-out for the Government. Don Francisco ought to be shunted at once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  peon ran alongside them, and kept up with their horses in the most wonderful  manner. It was noon when they left Puebla de los Naranjos, and it was now late  at night. In ten hours they had come nearly fifty miles. Their horses were  quite worn out, owing to the incessant galloping. Now they were within a mile  of the capital, and already, in the dim light, could see the line of walls  looming in the distance. They were glad it was dark, or, rather, comparatively  so, as it afforded them a certain amount of protection from wandering Indian  scouts. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  luck holds!&rdquo; said Philip, thankfully, as they rode towards the Puerta de la  Culebra. &ldquo;We have not seen a single savage since we left Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  it not been for your forethought, Philip, they would have had our scalps by  this time.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  thought, but your actions, Jack. It was lucky you knew the country.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  mutual admiration society, you are!&rdquo; cried Tim, whose spirits were wonderfully  light. &ldquo;How do you feel, Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Worn  out,&rdquo; replied the doctor, laconically. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith.  I&rsquo;m not astonished. I&rsquo;m bumped to death also. A hundred miles isn&rsquo;t bad for an  inferior rider like myself.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are a war correspondent,&rdquo; began Peter, fretfully, when his remarks were cut  short by an exclamation from Sebastian. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  the gates are open! Soldiers are coming out!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reinforcements  for Janjalla. I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rdquo; said Philip, grimly. &ldquo;They are a trifle late.  Come, gentlemen, let us see the officer in charge.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  urged their jaded horses towards the gate. At the sight of the little party,  the soldiers halted, and an officer rode to the front. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  whence come you, Se&ntilde;ores?&rdquo; he asked in surprise. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janjalla?  Why, we are just marching thither, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can spare yourself the trouble!&rdquo; replied Jack, grimly. &ldquo;Janjalla has fallen.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  news passed rapidly from mouth to mouth, and a cry of rage went up from the  throng. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo;  added Jack, quietly. &ldquo;Puebla de los Naranjos has been attacked and sacked by  the Indians!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Another  cry of rage. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;  concluded this bearer of bad news, &ldquo;Chichimec is now invested by six thousand  savages.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>A  low murmur of dismay ran through the lines. Calamity after calamity seemed to  be falling on the heads of the Government. Suddenly a man rode through the gate  at full speed, and pulling up his horse on its haunches, as he faced the party,  made the same inquiry as had the officer. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janjalla,&rdquo;  cried Don Miguel Maraquando. </p>
  <p>Jack  uttered the same reply. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janjalla  has fallen!&rdquo; </p>

    Round her rage the tempests which would sink her in waves of blood;<br>
    Only a skilful captain can pilot her into a safe haven.<br>
    You are not a skilful commander!<br>
    In fair weather you guided the ship in a meritorious fashion;<br>
    Now, when blow rebellious storms, you are not fit for the steering;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the danger renders you  helpless&mdash;a child were a better helmsman;<br>
    No longer can you hold the ship of Republican fortunes in her right<br>

    Captain! President! you are Captain&mdash;President no longer!<br>
    Depart! give way to one who can steer with clear head and keen eye.<br>
    Depart, incapable!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  one!&rdquo; cried Dolores, as Jack embraced her, in the patio. &ldquo;At last do I see you  once more. Santissima! how pale! What ragged clothes! and beards on all your  faces.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  Dolores, a siege is not conducive to luxury. But we will go to my house; bath,  shave, and dress. When we return, you will behold us as civilised beings.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wounded!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is nothing&mdash;a mere scratch. How delighted I am to see your dear face once more,  my Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  put out her hand timidly under the shelter of her fan, and touched Philip  gently on the hand. She was unable to do more, as Do&ntilde;a Serafina, severe, and  vigilant, was present. Their engagement had not yet been made public. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querido,&rdquo;  she murmured, looking at her lover tenderly. &ldquo;Constantly have I prayed for  thee.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  kissed her hand, and then that of Do&ntilde;a Serafina, to avert suspicion. The old  lady was voluble, and after the first greetings were over, burst forth into  speech with much dramatic gesture. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas,  se&ntilde;ores! How sad look you all. Don Pedro! Pobrecito! And the city is in the  hands of the rebels. Ay di mi! Ah, the evil ones! Yet, if they win on land,  they lose at sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it you say, Se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo; asked Tim, ever on the alert for news. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you not heard, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal? No; you have been away. Gracios &aacute; Dios! The  torpederas have captured <i>The Columbus</i>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;  cried Jack, delightedly; &ldquo;this is indeed good news! And Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rafael  is here,&rdquo; said that young man, hastily entering the court. &ldquo;Ah, my dear  friends, how delighted I am to behold you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  though we bring bad news?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  for I can tell you good. We followed <i>The Columbus</i>, and by threatening to  sink her with torpedoes, forced her to strike her flag. Now she is lying in the  harbour, with a crew of our own men. Her rebel sailors are all in prison.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about <i>The Iturbide</i>?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is there also, but in a crippled condition. One of her masts was shot away by <i>The  Columbus</i> before she surrendered.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do you do now?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sail  south to-morrow at dawn.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  said Jack, sadly, &ldquo;you will be too late to relieve Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; replied Rafael, hopefully; &ldquo;we shall capture or sink <i>The Cortes</i>,  and bring her back to Tlatonac with the transports. Then Don Hypolito will be  irrevocably cut off from Acauhtzin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  does not matter to him,&rdquo; interposed Philip, overhearing this remark; &ldquo;he has  most of his troops at Janjalla, and will simply hold the south instead of the  north.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events, Se&ntilde;or Felipe, we have crushed him by sea.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be a more difficult task to crush him by land, especially as Don Francisco  is so dilatory.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Francisco! Don Francisco!&rdquo; cried Rafael, stamping his foot with rage. &ldquo;He is  not fit to be President. Through him have we lost Janjalla. Even my father, who  was his firm supporter, has turned against him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say, Rafael?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you yet; but there will be a stormy meeting of the Junta to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are going to depose Don Francisco.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not improbable.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  trouble,&rdquo; said Tim, reflectively. &ldquo;There will be three Presidents shortly. Don  Francisco, Don Hypolito, and&mdash;Don Miguel!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more, mi amigo,&rdquo; said Rafael, doubtful even in his own house. &ldquo;It is dangerous  to speak like that&mdash;as yet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  added the last words significantly, and turned away. Jack was saying good night  to Dolores, as he was quite worn out, and wanted to get back to his own house  for a good night&rsquo;s rest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dolores,&rdquo;  he whispered, as he held her hand; &ldquo;you have yet the opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  surely.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you bear to part with it for the sake of the city?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can do with it as you please, Juanito. But, what mean these words?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a plan whereby I can detach the Indians from the cause of Don Hypolito,  and thus weaken his army. But the carrying out of the plan may entail the loss  of the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  it go, so that it save Tlatonac,&rdquo; replied Dolores, heroically, though,  woman-like, she loved the jewel. &ldquo;What is your plan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see Cocom about it first. Then I will tell you my secret; but now we must  go. Adios, querida.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>When  the four friends left the Casa Maraquando, they were surprised to find  themselves followed by Maraquando and his son. On reaching Jack&rsquo;s house, Don  Miguel begged the Englishman to give him a few moments&rsquo; conversation, and  explained how matters stood at Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>It  appeared that Maraquando&rsquo;s party were disgusted at the way in which the war was  being conducted by Don Francisco, and wanted him to resign the Presidential  chair. This Gomez was unwilling to do, and as he had yet many supporters, it  was doubtful if they could force him into such a course. Now, however, that the  news of the fall of Janjalla, the sack of Puebla de los Naranjos, and the  investment of Chichimec had arrived, Don Miguel thought that he would be able  to show plainly that the continuance of Don Francisco as President meant ruin  to the Government. </p>
  <p>The  next day there was to be a meeting of the Junta, and Maraquando, explaining his  designs to Jack, asked him for a full report of all that had taken place in the  south, so as to plainly prove the incapacity of the President in conducting the  war. The four friends thoroughly agreed with Maraquando&rsquo;s view of the matter,  and told him all that he wished to know, after which they retired to rest. Don  Miguel, on the contrary, went back with Rafael to his own house, and there  found a few members of his party waiting him, whom he informed of the  consequence of the terrible series of blunders made by Gomez. </p>
  <p>The  next day there was a stormy debate of the Junta in the Palacio Nacional. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  blame his Excellency for all that has taken place,&rdquo; cried Maraquando, at the  conclusion of a long and fiery speech. &ldquo;By his negligence and timidity he has  lost us our opportunity of crushing this rebellion in the bud. Had a few  thousand soldiers been sent to Janjalla at the outbreak of the war, that city  would not now be in the hands of the rebels. Nay, they would not have even  gained a footing in the south. But, by withdrawing the garrisons from that  seaport, from the inland towns, his Excellency had laid them open to capture,  and they had been captured. Janjalla is in the power of Xuarez; by this time,  for aught we know, Centeotl may have surrendered to his victorious army. Puebla  de los Naranjos has been sacked by the Indian tribes, who should have been  crushed at once. Now Chichimec is surrounded, and may fall at any time, yet no  aid has been sent to the relief of the citizens. All these terrible disasters  have been caused by the blundering of Don Francisco, by his incompetency. I  call on him to resign his command into more capable hands, else will we see the  foe at our gates, our city in ruins, and Cholacaca helpless, under the heel of  the tyrant Xuarez!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Francisco, bursting with indignation, replied, He had done his best! If he had  sent forward troops to Janjalla, they might have been defeated, and then the  capital would have fallen an easy prey to the rebels, through lack of garrison.  As it was, the city could hold out for months; the walls were strong, the  garrison were resolute, there was plenty of provisions. </p>
  <p>He  had held the army at Tlatonac to save the capital. Where, then, was the blunder  in that? By sea, the forces of the Republic had been victorious. <i>The Pizarro</i> had been sunk, <i>The Columbus</i> captured, and now the torpederas were on  their way to Janjalla harbour to force <i>The Cortes</i> to strike her flag. He  had succeeded by sea. He would succeed on land. When the army of Xuarez was  before the walls of Tlatonac the fate of the country could be decided in one  battle. He refused to resign his position as President. </p>
  <p>The  partisans of Maraquando, the supporters of Gomez, broke out into noisy  demonstrations, and the whole place was in an uproar. The one called upon Gomez  to resign, the other denounced Maraquando as a traitor. It seemed as though  neither would give in, as though the capital would be divided into two hostile  factions, when a solution of the difficulty was proposed by Padre Ignatius. </p>
  <p>Making  his appearance suddenly in the hall, the good priest first stilled the tumult  by holding up his crucifix, and then begged to lay before the Junta a  proposition which would suit all parties. It would never do, said the Padre, to  depose Don Francisco. The pretext for war, alleged by Xuarez, was that Gomez  ought to be deposed for breaking the Constitution of Cholacaca. They knew that  His Excellency had not done so; that he had loyally upheld the freedom and laws  of the Republic. If deposed by his own party, such a deposition would give  colour to Xuarez&rsquo;s assertion that he had right on his side, and perhaps  prejudice the inland towns in his favour. Better it would be to let Don  Francisco still remain President till the date of the expiration of his office,  four months hence, and in the meantime entrust the conduct of the war solely to  Don Miguel Maraquando. By this arrangement his Excellency would still continue  nominal head of Cholacaca, and the war could be conducted by Maraquando,  without the responsibility resting on the President. </p>
  <p>This  proposition, seeming to be the only possible solution of the problem, was  unanimously accepted by both parties. It is true that Gomez, who hated  Maraquando like poison, sorely grudged giving up the command of affairs to his  rival; but as he saw that the Junta wished it to be so, he was forced to yield.  Don Miguel was, therefore, elected General of the army of the Republic, and Don  Francisco was permitted to retain the civil rule. Then the meeting broke up,  and Maraquando went off to take measures for the immediate relief of Chichimec,  while Gomez, much mortified at the slight he had received, retired sullenly to  his palace. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, Tim?&rdquo; asked Jack, as they left the Palacio Nacional. &ldquo;You ought to  be pleased at witnessing such a stirring scene, instead of which you are like a  bear with a sick head.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  haven&rsquo;t I a cause?&rdquo; replied Tim, gruffly. &ldquo;Look at all this shindy going on,  and I can&rsquo;t send a telegram to my paper.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s it, is it? Well, then, ask Philip to lend you <i>The Bohemian</i>, and  go off to Truxillo at once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begad,  that isn&rsquo;t a bad idea anyhow,&rdquo; cried Tim, stopping suddenly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want  to leave Tlatonac just now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you may be pretty certain Philip won&rsquo;t go, nor I. Why not send Peter? Write out  your news here. Peter will take it, and old Benker will look after the yacht.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  far is it to Truxillo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  trifle over three hundred miles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Philip will lend me the yacht?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure he will. Let us ask him at once. He is flirting with Do&ntilde;a Eulalia in  Maraquando&rsquo;s patio.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim,  who had quite recovered his spirits at Jack&rsquo;s happy suggestion, started off at  once to the Casa Maraquando. There was no necessity, however, for them to go so  far, for they met their friend coming down the Calle Otumba. He hailed them at  once. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim!  Jack! come along to the Puerta de la Culebra. News from Chichimec.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you say?&rdquo; roared Tim, plunging towards the speaker. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom  came to the Casa Maraquando a few minutes ago, and told me that a messenger had  arrived from Chichimec. He is at the Puerta de la Culebra.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce!&rdquo; cried Jack, in alarm, as they hurried along towards the gate; &ldquo;perhaps  it&rsquo;s another request for relief.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  so, they will soon have it,&rdquo; said Tim, quickly. &ldquo;Don Miguel is going to send three  thousand men this day to finish off these savages.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is something like!&rdquo; said Philip, approvingly; &ldquo;there will be some chance  of relieving the city with that force. I am glad Don Miguel has matters now in  his own hands.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I. He&rsquo;ll end the war in no time. I say, Philip, lend me the yacht.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for? You are not going to Janjalla again?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I&rsquo;m going further south. That is, I&rsquo;m sending Peter with despatches.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  to?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Truxillo!  He can send off my telegrams from there. Lend me the yacht, Philip, and I&rsquo;ll  love you for ever more.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  take her, by all means; but I hope she won&rsquo;t be smashed up by the warships of  Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  only got one now,&rdquo; replied Tim, coolly; &ldquo;and she&rsquo;ll have her hands full looking  after the torpederas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forgot that! It&rsquo;s a good idea, Tim! Get all the news together you can, and  Peter shall go out with <i>The Bohemian</i> to-night, both of them in charge of  Benker.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Peter will go?&rdquo; said Jack, doubtfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he will,&rdquo; said Tim, promptly. &ldquo;The little man&rsquo;s of no use here. I&rsquo;ll  make him Queen&rsquo;s messenger for once in his life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;  cried Philip, at this moment, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s old Cocom making signs. Ola, Cocom!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  old Indian, who was hobbling on the other side of the street, came over to them  with an excited look on his usually immobile face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo,  Se&ntilde;ores! the news. The terrible news!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; cried the three Englishmen simultaneously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chichimec  has fallen!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  uttered an ejaculation of rage, and darted off to the gate, followed by Tim and  Philip. They found an excited throng of people talking wildly together. Don  Sebastian was just under the archway, with his glasses to his eyes, looking  towards the plains beyond. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the news true of Chichimec&rsquo;s fall?&rdquo; asked Jack pushing his way through the  crowd. </p>
  <p>Don  Sebastian turned slowly with a grave bow, and handed Jack the glasses. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  true, Se&ntilde;or. See! fugitives are arriving every moment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  clapped the glass to his eye, and saw that the plain was sprinkled with people  all making for the gate of Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you send out a regiment to protect them, De Ahumada?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is going now. Behold, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>About  five hundred men, well mounted, came trotting down the street, and began to  file through the archway out on to the plain. Jack stood on one side and  watched them go by in all their martial splendour. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did the Indians take the town, De Ahumada?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was surprised last night,&rdquo; replied Don Sebastian, sadly. &ldquo;I expect the  sentinels were worn out with constant watching. Dios! It is frightful. First  Puebla de los Naranjos, now Chichimec; Janjalla has already fallen, and  Tlatonac&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  fall,&rdquo; interrupted Jack, abruptly, as the last of the cavalry swept through the  gate. &ldquo;When things are at their worst, matters mend. Just now they are very  gloomy. To-morrow they may improve.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim  stayed behind to make inquiries about the fall of Chichimec for the use of his  paper, and Philip, in company with Jack, went off to look up Peter, and ask him  if he would consent to act as Tim&rsquo;s messenger to Truxillo. They could not find  him in their own house, and learned from a servant that he had gone in search  of them to the Casa Maraquando. At once they repaired thither, and had just  reached the door, when Peter, with a look of alarm on his face, rushed out of  the house, almost falling into their arms in his hurry. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip!  Jack! Have you heard?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, Peter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Francisco has shot himself! Don Miguel has just told me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Philip  made a gesture of horror, and Jack ran into the house to see Maraquando, and  learn the particulars of the case. </p>
  <p>It  was perfectly true. Unable to bear the disgrace of being deposed from the  active conduct of affairs, President Gomez had retired to his room, and shot  himself through the heart. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXX"></a>Chapter XXX<br>
    The Indian Raid</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Painted  braves came on the war-path,<br>
    Numerous as the leaves in summer,<br>
    Decked with feathers and with wampum,<br>
    All their faces fierce and fearless,<br>
    Streaked with colours like the sunset,<br>
    Rage was in their hearts of iron;<br>
    Spears grasped they, and bows and arrows,<br>
    And their horses, like the storm clouds,<br>
    Swiftly swept across the prairies,<br>
    Till the firm earth shook and trembled<br>
  &lsquo;Neath the thunder of their thousands.<br>
    Loud they sang the song of battle,<br>
    Sang the song of war and bloodshed;<br>
    While the nations, women-hearted,<br>
    Hid within their walled cities,<br>
    Like the rabbits in their burrows,<br>
    When they heard that chaunt triumphal.</p>
  <p>Certainly,  fate was dealing hardly with the Republic of Cholacaca. One blow followed  another, and it seemed as though the final catastrophe would be the triumphal  entry of Don Hypolito Xuarez into the capital. Janjalla was in his possession;  he now threatened Centeotl, and the two towns of Puebla de los Naranjos and  Chichimec had been destroyed by his savage allies. The unexpected death of Don  Francisco Gomez put the finishing touch to this series of calamities, and the  whole city was pervaded by a feeling of dismay. Disquieting rumours crept among  the people that Xuarez had captured Centeotl and Hermanita&mdash;that he was now on  his way to Tlatonac&mdash;that the death of President Gomez was due to his  machinations. These fabrications, gaining additions as they flew from mouth to  mouth, carried fear into the hearts of the citizens, and many were of the  opinion that nothing was left save surrender to the insolent conqueror. </p>
  <p>The  Junta met within an hour of the intelligence of Don Francisco&rsquo;s death, and  unanimously elected Don Miguel Maraquando as President of the Republic. Even  the party of the dead ruler supported this election, as they could not fail to  see that Maraquando would make an exceptionally vigorous and firm-handed  President. Though there was no doubt that Don Francisco had committed suicide  out of pique at being deposed from the active command of affairs, yet the Junta,  ignoring the manner of his death, and thinking only of his past services,  decreed the late President a state funeral. </p>
  <p>The  houses of the city were draped in black, the flags floated half-mast high, the  minute guns boomed at intervals from the forts, and, with all due formalities,  President Gomez was interred in the vaults of the Cathedral. When the ceremony  was at an end, a weight seemed to be lifted off the city. The bad fortune which  had persistently dogged the later months of Don Francisco&rsquo;s rule seemed to be  passing away, and, under the vigorous leadership of Maraquando, the capital  became wildly patriotic. One idea pervaded the minds of all&mdash;that the war was to  be ended at once, and that Xuarez was to be crushed by prompt and  well-conceived measures. </p>
  <p>After  the Indians had sacked Chichimec, it was naturally expected that they would  march southward and join Don Hypolito before Centeotl. Instead of this,  however, the savages began to threaten the capital, and daily bands of  well-horsed braves would scour the plains before the Puerta de la Culebra.  Sometimes the soldiers on guard, exasperated by this insolent defiance of the  principal city of Cholacaca, would dash out in small parties; but on such a  sally being made, the Indians always disappeared. The bulk of their army still  lay (as was ascertained by spies) at Chichimec, and it seemed as though these  scouting parties were anxious to draw the troops of the Junta from behind the  walls, so as to fall on them in the open plain. </p>
  <p>President  Maraquando was anxious to march his whole army south, and encounter Don  Hypolito in the neighbourhood of Centeotl. In order to do this, he would have  to overcome the hordes of savages which formed a living barrier between  Tlatonac and Chichimec. This entailed some risk. If beaten by the Indians, he  would have to fall back on the capital in a crippled condition, and thus give  Xuarez time to increase and discipline his army. Then, again, even if he did  succeed in conquering these bloodthirsty tribes, he would in all probability lose  many of his men, and be forced to encounter Don Hypolito&rsquo;s fresh soldiers with  jaded and diminished troops. </p>
  <p>At  one time he thought of waiting until the return of the torpederas from  Janjalla, and then embarking his troops on <i>The Iturbide</i>, proceed southward  to attack Xuarez in the rear. Even there the savages would have to be reckoned  with, and during his absence, and that of the greater portion of his troops,  would perhaps attack the capital. Besides, Maraquando did not wish to risk an  expedition to Janjalla unless <i>The Cortes</i> were either sunk or captured.  Altogether, he was in a state of much perplexity, and the only way by which he  could make a move was to detach the Indians from the cause of Xuarez. This task  was accomplished by Jack Duval in what seemed to be almost a miraculous  fashion. </p>
  <p>The  new President entertained a great opinion of Duval&rsquo;s abilities. He invariably  found him clear-headed and shrewd, capable of giving good advice, and  wonderfully prompt in coming to a decision in time of emergency. Therefore,  when, shortly after the death of Don Francisco, the young man called to see him  at the Casa Maraquando, with a view to lay a certain proposition before him  useful to the Republic, Don Miguel interviewed him at once, and gave him his  fullest attention. </p>
  <p>Some  time since, Peter, with Tim&rsquo;s notes, had started in <i>The Bohemian</i> for  Truxillo, and at the last moment Philip had decided to go with him. Jack  desired to confer with Maraquando about his proposed scheme, and to be on the  spot in order to carry it out. Tim was afraid to leave the capital lest he  should miss some stirring event likely to be of value to his paper; but Philip  had no special reason for remaining constantly at Tlatonac, unless for the sake  of Do&ntilde;a Eulalia. Dr. Grench did not object to go to Truxillo in <i>The Bohemian</i>,  but on observing that he would feel more at ease regarding the navigation of  the vessel if Philip commanded her, the baronet promptly decided to go. It was  a good thing for Peter that old Benker had not heard this reflection on his  seamanship, else he would have been much displeased. At all events, Peter, by  artfully putting the matter in this light, secured Philip for his companion,  and the yacht had departed the previous day for Honduras. She was expected back  in four days, and Philip determined on his return voyage to stand in close to  the shore of Janjalla, and assure himself of the result of the expedition  against <i>The Cortes</i>. </p>
  <p>Jack  made his appearance in the patio in the company of Cocom, whose presence he  required in the delicate proposal he had to make. He intended to appeal to the  superstitious side of the Indian character, and wanted Cocom to back up his  opinion so as to induce Don Miguel to give his consent to an experiment he  desired to attempt connected with the harlequin opal. Don Miguel was on the  azotea smoking endless cigarettes, and glancing over some papers relating to  the Civil Government. His secretary was present, but when Duval appeared, the  President sent him below with the documents, and received Jack and his factotum  alone. Jack took a seat by the President, and Cocom, rolling a cigarette,  squatted on the floor, wrapped in his zarape. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal?&rdquo; asked Don Miguel, solemnly, after the first  greetings had passed between them. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the Puerta de la Culebra,&rdquo; replied Jack, taking the cigar offered to him by the  old gentleman. &ldquo;I asked him to wait there, Se&ntilde;or, as in an hour or so the peon  sent by your Excellency to Chichimec is expected back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  But what news do you expect by the peon?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;News  that the Indians contemplate an advance on Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Por  todos Santos! Don Juan, such a thing cannot be. The Indians would not dare to  so insult the majesty of the Republic.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  privately thought the majesty of the Republic had been pretty well insulted  already, but wisely refrained from giving voice to such an opinion. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Indians, Excelencia!&rdquo; he said, smoothly, &ldquo;are, according to trustworthy  reports, six thousand strong, and thus think themselves a match for even the  capital of Cholacaca. They have reduced Puebla de los Naranjos to ashes, they  have sacked Chichimec without hindrance, and, excited by such victories, have  rashly determined to attack Tlatonac on their own account without waiting for  the arrival of Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really think they will dare to camp under our walls?&rdquo; asked Don Miguel,  still incredulous. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really do think so, Excelencia,&rdquo; replied Jack, frankly. &ldquo;If you think I am too  rash in pronouncing such an opinion, question our friend Cocom. He has already  rendered great services to you and to the Republic. Therefore, you must know  that he speaks truth. Speak to him, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  President turned his eyes towards the old Indian, who, impassive as an idol,  sat at his feet smoking a cigarette. He answered Maraquando&rsquo;s inquiring look  with a grunt of assent to Jack&rsquo;s remark. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a true Indian, Excelencia! Of the Mayas I am, and my name is that of their  kings. Cocom speaks now the truth. Don Xuarez is also an Indian, he comes from  the hidden city of Totatzine. He has an understanding with the high-priest,  Ixtlilxochitli. Don Hypolito said war, and the Chalchuih Tlatonac, through the  priests of Huitzilopochtli, said war. Therefore are six thousand Indians in  arms. Now the opal is in the possession of the enemies of the god&mdash;in Tlatonac,  a city hated by Ixtlilxochitli and Xuarez. They have told their fighting men  that this war is a holy war, for the recovery of the sacred shining stone. Were  it not for the opal, the Indians would not dare to come to Tlatonac even with six  thousand braves. But it is a holy war. They will dare anything to recover the  sacred stone. Therefore will they come here, Excelencia, and camp under your  walls. This is the truth, I swear by the shrine of the Holy Mother of God.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be so,&rdquo; said Maraquando, musingly; &ldquo;the opal is in Tlatonac, without  doubt. My niece has it in her chamber, and knowing how sacred the Indians hold  the gem, I doubt but that they will fight boldly to gain it again for the  hidden shrine of their God, Huitzilopochtli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  Don Miguel. And to gain it they will come to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  must not be!&rdquo; cried the President, emphatically; &ldquo;I will send an army against  them, and encounter their host at Chichimec.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  what result, Se&ntilde;or? Even if you conquered, the victory would cost you many men,  and thus would your army be weakened to encounter Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true! Don Juan. But what then is to be done.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  the Indian army come to Tlatonac. Let them camp under the walls. Close the  gates of the city, and make no hostile sign.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  say you, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; said Maraquando, in a fiery tone. &ldquo;Would you have me leave  this savage foe in peace till joined by Don Hypolito&mdash;by the rebel Xuarez?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will not be joined by Xuarez, Don Miguel. When the rebels arrive, they will  find no savage allies under the walls of Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it could be so, it would be well. But how, Se&ntilde;or, do you propose to make this  savage army vanish without a blow?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  means of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand, mi amigo. Explain, if you will be so gracious. I am all  attention.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  began to explain without further preamble. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Observe,  Excelencia,&rdquo; he said slowly, so that Don Miguel could have no difficulty in  following his reasons, &ldquo;It is now noon&mdash;this night, if I mistake not, the Indian  army will come to Tlatonac&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  interrupted Cocom, nodding his head like a mandarin, &ldquo;I have heard this thing  spoken with many tongues. Your messenger, Excelencia, will confirm what I say.  The Indian army will march this night for Tlatonac. At dawn will you see them  encamped round the walls.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proceed,  Don Juan,&rdquo; said the President, gravely. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you can see, Se&ntilde;or Maraquando,&rdquo; pursued Jack, emphasising his remarks with his  finger, &ldquo;the savages will not arrive till night, so as it is now but noon, we  will have time to make ready for their arrival.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  You said make no preparations!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  hostile preparations! No, Se&ntilde;or; listen, I pray you. We have the Chalchuih  Tlatonac, the properties of which are regarded with superstitious reverence by  the Indians. What the opal commands they will do. When it glows red, they  prepare for war. Let an azure ray shine, and they know that the god commands  peace, and, at whatever cost, will lay down their arms.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is this done, this glowing of red, of blue?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will explain, Se&ntilde;or. In the hidden city I saw it. The opal hung by a golden  thread before the shrine of Huitzilopochtli, and this thread was twisted in a  certain way by the priests. By careful calculation, they could tell how far it  would untwist, so that the opal stone depended motionless, showing the colour  they wished. If they desired war, the red side of the stone revealed itself&mdash;if  peace the blue. To prophesy plenty, the yellow ray came to the front, and so on  with all the tints.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you say, Don Juan, that if these Indians saw the opal glowing blue, they would  lay down their arms?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly,  Se&ntilde;or! and withdraw at once to Totatzine, leaving Xuarez to meet the forces of  the Junta alone. If the stone glows blue, they know it is the will of the god  that they should not fight.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel smiled incredulously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt, Se&ntilde;or, whether these warriors, flushed with the sacking of Puebla de los  Naranjos and Chichimec would obey the stone now, even though it glowed blue and  thus proclaimed peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excelencia!&rdquo;  broke in Cocom, earnestly, &ldquo;you know, not the power of the Chalchuih Tlatonac.  I, Se&ntilde;or am a good Catholic. I believe not in the devil stone; but my  countrymen, Se&ntilde;or, think that the spirit of the god Huitzilopochtli dwells in  the gem. They believe that he would punish them with plagues unto death were  they to disobey his will as conveyed by the opal. The shining precious stone is  the strongest thing in the world to them. Believe me, Excelencia, that when the  warriors see the stone glow blue, even were they on the eve of entering  Tlatonac, they would lay down their arms and retire to the forests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust this may be so,&rdquo; said Maraquando, addressing himself to Jack, not  unimpressed by the Indian&rsquo;s speech; &ldquo;but where, Se&ntilde;or Duval, do you propose to  let them see the opal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the chapel of Padre Ignatius, outside the walls,&rdquo; replied Jack, promptly. &ldquo;Cocom  knows where there is an image of the war-god. He will set it up on the altar of  the chapel. Before it, by a thread, we will hang the sacred stone. At dawn all  will be ready, and Cocom can so twist the thread that when the opal hangs  motionless it will glow blue. The Indians will arrive during the night. At dawn  they will spread themselves through the suburbs, and enter the chapel of the good  Padre. There they will see the image of their god, the sacred splendour of the  opal. They will kneel down and worship, watching the twisting of the gem. When  it stops and glows blue, then will they know Huitzilopochtli is satisfied with  the sacking of the two towns, and now commands peace. Before noon, Excelencia,  there will not be a single Indian left before the walls. They will retire into  the forests, to the sacred city of Totatzine, and thus will Xuarez lose his  allies.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Maraquando  listened to this proposal in silence, his cheek resting in the palm of his  right hand, nor when Jack had concluded did he alter his position. He mused  long and deeply, neither of his guests attempting to interrupt his meditations.  This idea of detaching the Indians from Xuarez, by means of the opal, seemed to  him to be childish. That an army of six thousand untutored savages flushed with  victory should voluntarily retire at the bidding of Huitzilopochtli spoken  through the stone, seemed improbable. But then Maraquando had never been to  Totatzine, he did not know in what extreme veneration the opal was held by the  Indians, and thus deemed Jack&rsquo;s proposition weak, when in reality it could  scarcely have been stronger. Nothing is so powerful as superstition, and to  work on the minds of the Indians through their abject belief in the virtues of  the shining precious stone was a master-stroke on the part of Duval. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; said Maraquando, at length raising his eyes, &ldquo;that the carrying  out of this scheme will entail the loss of the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Duval, coolly; &ldquo;but by such a sacrifice you gain more  than you lose. The Indians will desert Xuarez, you will be able to march your  army south, and conquer him in the neighbourhood of Centeotl before he has time  to approach nearer to the capital. Then you can crush his nest of traitors in  Acauhtzin. Better lose the opal than Tlatonac, and if we do not succeed in  getting rid of the Indians it may be that the city will fall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  says my niece Do&ntilde;a Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have spoken to her, Se&ntilde;or, and for the sake of the city, she is willing to run  the risk of losing the jewel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel smiled approvingly. He was patriotic himself, and liked to see the same  quality displayed by all his family. At the same time, he was a just man, and  knowing how Dolores loved the gem, did not care about taking advantage of her  offer to sacrifice the same, unless she voluntarily consented to surrender the  sacred stone. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will ask the lady herself,&rdquo; he said, rising from his chair. &ldquo;One moment, Se&ntilde;or;  I shall return with my niece.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  disappeared down the staircase leading to the patio, and Jack was left alone  with Cocom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be that the Indians will not dare to take the jewel,&rdquo; said Jack, looking at  the old man. </p>
  <p>Cocom  uttered a grunt which might have meant anything. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rest  content, Don Juan. Once the Chalchuih Tlatonac leaves the walls of the city, it  will never return again. Back to the sacred shrine of Totatzine shall it go.  The high priest has ordered it be sought for far and wide, lest the god afflict  the people with plagues for its loss.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  if I remained in the chapel, and watched it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  Se&ntilde;or? Nay, that, indeed, would be rash. The Indians would slay you. Only one  will watch the jewel; but that one cannot prevent the worshippers seizing it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean yourself?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is said. I speak of Cocom. He shall sit by the image of the god, when the  Indians enter the chapel of the good father.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the Indians might slay you, Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  which is to be must be,&rdquo; replied the old man, stolidly. &ldquo;Cocom must watch the  sacred gem, so that it sends the blue ray of peace from its breast. The tribes  have been told by Ixtlilxochitli that Cocom is a traitor, and false to the  worship of the old gods. When he is seen, he must die.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my friend, I&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  silent, Se&ntilde;or. Not you nor any man can turn aside the spear of Teoyamiqui. Why  should I murmur if death be my portion? I am old, I am mutilated, I am weary of  life. If I die I die, and for the safety of the white people. It may be, Se&ntilde;or,  that, as says the good Padre, Cocom shall go to the heaven of the Christians.  With the Virgin such going rests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  found no words to reply to this speech, and remained silently thinking of how  he could save the old man from death. He had as yet arrived at no conclusion,  when Don Miguel appeared with his niece on the floor of the azotea. Dolores ran  towards Jack and threw herself into his arms. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querido,&rdquo;  she said in a tender voice, &ldquo;my good uncle tells me of your scheme. It is that  of which you spoke to me. It may save Tlatonac from savage foes, and thus do I  aid you to the extent of my powers.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  held out the opal towards him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may lose it altogether, Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  matter, Juanito. It may save the city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you consent to this sacrifice, Don Miguel?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Se&ntilde;or. I think it will turn aside this host of savages. With them away, we can  hope to conquer Xuarez. Otherwise&mdash;&rdquo; Maraquando stopped suddenly, and made a  gesture of despair. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it is merely an experiment,&rdquo; said Jack, doubtfully. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  one which must be successful,&rdquo; cried Dolores, quickly. &ldquo;Querido, can you doubt  that, after what we saw in the sacred city? As the god speaks through the opal,  so will the Indians act. Let it dart, then, its blue ray, and drive them back  to their forests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure you can make it shine blue, Cocom?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  said the old man, with great dignity, &ldquo;I give my life to prove that this shall  be so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  took the opal from the outstretched hand of Dolores. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  be it!&rdquo; he cried, fervently. &ldquo;The opal has brought the Indians to Tlatonac; the  opal shall send them back again to Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Tim  suddenly made his appearance with a face full of excitement. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!  Se&ntilde;or Maraquando!&rdquo; he said, quickly, in Spanish, &ldquo;the messenger you sent to spy  on the Indians at Chichimec has returned.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does he say, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the whole host of Indians are marching from Chichimec, and will be camped round  the walls at dawn. Dios! We are lost!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Jack, brightly, &ldquo;we are saved!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce will save us, Jack?&rdquo; asked Tim, in English. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Duval  held up the harlequin opal. A ray of sunlight struck the jewel, and a blue ray  darted out like a tongue of steel. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said Cocom, stolidly, &ldquo;the Chalchuih Tlatonac prophesies peace.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXXI"></a>Chapter XXXI<br>
    The Luck Of The Opal</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">The  red ray dies in the opal stone,<br>
    The god hath spoken,<br>
    Arrow and bow and spear be broken,<br>
    Red of war is the fiery token,<br>
    And lo! in the zone,<br>
    It pales, and fades, and faints, and dies,<br>
    As sunsets wane in the eastern skies.<br>
    The blue ray glows in the opal&rsquo;s heart,<br>
    The god is smiling,<br>
    Victims no more need we be piling,<br>
    On altar stone for his dread beguiling;<br>
    The blue rays dart<br>
    To tell us war must surely cease,<br>
    So in the land let there be peace.</p>
  <p>Jack  at once proceeded to execute his project. Fortunately Padre Ignatius had gone  south in <i>The Iturbide</i>, thinking his ministrations might be required by  the wounded, else Duval would never have gained the good priest&rsquo;s consent to  such a desecration of his chapel. As it was, Jack hoped to carry out his  scheme, and restore the chapel to its original state before the return of the  old man. The actual elevation of a heathen idol on the shrine of the Virgin,  not being seen by Padre Ignatius, he would think less of the sacrilegious act,  more especially when he would find on his return the altar in nearly the same  state as when he left it. Being a Protestant, Jack had no scruples about the  matter, and Cocom was such a queer mixture of paganism and Catholicism, that  his views were not very decided. He believed in the Virgin certainly; but  seeing that her altar was required to save the city, Cocom thought that she  surely would not object to the conversion for a time of her chapel into a  heathen temple. Besides, if this was not done, the Indians would be sure to  destroy the shrine, so it was best to make an attempt to avert such a disaster,  even in such an illegitimate way, rather than risk the whole place being  destroyed by the savages. This was Cocom&rsquo;s idea in the matter, therefore he  proceeded to put an image of Huitzilopochtli in the place occupied by the  cross. Father Ignatius would have died of horror had he witnessed such daring. </p>
  <p>All  the afternoon they laboured to transfer the chapel into a semblance of the  temple of the war-god, and at length succeeded in making it a very fair  representation. Huitzilopochtli, his left foot decked with humming-bird  feathers, was set up on the shrine itself, a small altar on which a fire was  lighted burned before him, and the walls were draped with mats of featherwork  and pictured linen, whereon were depicted the hideous forms of Aztec deities.  From the roof, by a golden thread, hung the famous opal, spinning in the dim  light. After some calculation, Cocom made a hole in the roof of the chapel, so  that when the sun rose over the walls of the city his beams would pour through  the opening and bathe the gem in floods of gold. </p>
  <p>Where  Cocom had discovered all this idolatrous paraphernalia Jack could not make out,  nor would the old Indian tell. But it confirmed Duval in his belief that in the  near neighbourhood of Tlatonac the natives still worshipped the gods of their  ancestors, for the celerity with which Cocom had produced statue, pictured  linen, and altar, pointed to the existence of some hidden temple close at hand.  In fact, despite Cocom&rsquo;s asseverations to the contrary, Jack began to be  doubtful as to his really being a Christian, for he betrayed far too much  knowledge of paganism in its worst form to be quite orthodox. One thing,  however, was certain, that, pagan or not, Cocom was greatly incensed against  Ixtlilxochitli for maiming him, and was doing his best to thwart the plans of  the savage old priest. </p>
  <p>Things  having been thus arranged, towards sunset Jack tried to persuade Cocom to  return with him to the city, and leave the opal to work out its own spell. This  the obstinate octogenarian refused to do, averring that without his personal  superintendence the scheme would fail. Jack unwilling that a man from whom he  had derived so many benefits should be left unprotected amid a horde of  bloodthirsty savages, insisted on remaining with him to keep vigil during the  night. This offer Cocom also refused, and implored Jack to return at once to  the city, and have the gates closed, as it was near sunset, and the Indian army  would soon be close at hand. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  me here, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, with quiet obstinacy. &ldquo;It may be that I fall not into  their hands. They may take the opal&mdash;that is sure&mdash;but they may not take me. If  you remain, your white skin will attract their fury, and they may sacrifice you  before that very altar you have assisted to rear. I am an Indian, a Maya. Dog  does not bite dog. It may be that I shall escape.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if Ixtlilxochitli can help it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that evil one! He would have my blood, I know, Don Juan. But behold, Se&ntilde;or, if  I&mdash;as the Indians, my countrymen, think&mdash;took the opal from Totatzine, I now  bring it back again. That may save me!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Cocom&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Depart,  Se&ntilde;or; I have my own plans. What says the proverb of the white people? &lsquo;Every  one is master of his own soul.&rsquo; Go! I save mine as I will!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  seemed to Jack that Cocom was desirous of wearing the crown of martyrdom.  However, it was useless to turn him from his purpose, as he was obstinately set  on daring the fury of the Indians. Jack, for a moment, thought of employing  force, and looked at the spare frame of the old man, with the idea of picking  him up and bearing him inside the city. Perhaps something of his purpose showed  itself in his eyes, for Cocom suddenly darted out of the chapel and  disappeared. Though he searched everywhere, Jack was unable to find him, so  proceeded to the Puerta de la Culebra, and reported his arrival to Don  Sebastian, who was stationed there in command of the guard. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Indian, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Refuses  to come within, Don Sebastian. He says he is safe outside.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>De  Ahumada shrugged his shoulders, and made the same remark as had Cocom some  quarter of an hour before. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  Dog does not bite dog.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then  he ordered the gates to be closed, which was accordingly done. It was now too  late to alter existing circumstances, and the whole chances of detaching the  Indian host from the cause of Xuarez lay with Cocom and the opal. Jack went off  to the Casa Maraquando, in order to inform Don Miguel of all that had been  done, and then rewarded himself for that wearisome afternoon by chatting with  Dolores. It had been deemed advisable, by Don Miguel, to keep Jack&rsquo;s scheme  secret, lest, should the attempt fail, and the opal be lost, the populace  should lose heart in the forthcoming struggle with Xuarez. So long as the opal  was in the city, they deemed themselves invincible; so, whether the attempt to  detach the Indians succeeded or failed, Maraquando determined that the people  of Tlatonac should still think that the sacred stone was in the possession of  his niece. </p>
  <p>Late  that night Jack went on the walls with Tim, and together they watched the  Indians gather round the walls. Above the Puerta de la Culebra was fixed a  powerful electric light, which irradiated a considerable portion of the space  beyond the gate. Without the walls there was quite a town, as the huts of the  peons stretched away in long lines, alternating with palms, cacti, aloes, and  densely foliaged omb&uacute; trees. Close to the gate these huts clustered thickly  together, but after a time became scattered, and finally ceased on the verge of  the plains, where the ground was thickly covered with brushwood. </p>
  <p>The  Indians, fearful of the guns protruding from the walls, and doubtful of the  weird glare of the electric light, kept away beyond the line of huts, and  finally camped in the open ground beyond. Notwithstanding the distance they  kept from the town the powerful rays of electric light blazed full on their  camp, and caused them considerable uneasiness. The two Englishmen could see  their tall, dark forms, gliding like ghosts through the white radiance, and at  times a mounted troop of horsemen would dash furiously across the circle of  light, disappearing into the further darkness. Just below, a stone&rsquo;s throw from  the wall, arose the little chapel of Father Ignatius, beneath whose roof Cocom,  with the opal, awaited the dawn. </p>
  <p>For  some hours Jack watched the strange sight that savage picture, starting out of  the surrounding darkness, and ultimately retired to his house, hopeful that before  noon of the next day all the Indians would have disappeared. Tim remained  behind, talking to Don Sebastian, and scribbling notes in his book; but at last  he also went to rest, and the wall was left in possession of De Ahumada and his  guard. All night long the electric light flashed its beams on the camp, so as  to guard against an unexpected attack by the Indians. </p>
  <p>At  dawn, the savages were up and doing before sunrise. They gathered together in  groups, and talked of how they were to attack this formidable city, whose  colossal walls bid defiance to their puny weapons. They could see soldiers  moving along the ramparts, the black muzzles of the guns frowning fiercely  down, and wondered at the absolute indifference of the Republic, who thus  permitted her hereditary enemies to camp before the gates of her principal  city. Everything within the town was quiet, the gates were firmly closed, no  peons were to be seen moving about the suburbs, and the Indians, blackening the  plain with their thousands of men and horses stood perplexed before this  intensely silent town. </p>
  <p>The  east was flaming redly over the ocean waves. The Indians could see the long  line of battlements black against the clear crimson sky. No wind blew across  the desert, and the great banner of the opal hung motionless from its tall  staff. Suddenly, in the red sky, a yellow beam shot up into the cold blue of  the zenith; another and another followed, spreading like a gigantic fan. The  savages threw themselves on their knees, and held up their hands in supplication  to the great deity, who was even now being invoked with sacrifice in the hidden  town of Totatzine. </p>
  <p>The  gold of the sky seemed to boil up behind the walls of the town, as though it  would run over in yellow streams. Then the dazzling orb appeared, and fierce  arrows shot across the green suburbs to the sandy desert, where those thousands  of naked Indians were kneeling. Suddenly a man started in surprise, and looked  inquiringly at his companions. They listened as he had done, and also looked  astonished. In a miraculously short space of time the whole host were in a  state of commotion. Those in front stood still in a listening attitude, those  behind pressed forward to hear this miracle which had startled their  companions. Loud and shrill arose the song from the chapel of Padre Ignatius.  It was the hymn of the opal daily chaunted by the priests of Huitzilopochtli in  the city of Totatzine. </p>
  <p>The  chiefs hastily gathered together, and consulted as to the meaning of this  prodigy. Never before had the sacred song been heard beyond the shrine of the  sacred city, and now its music was thrilling through the still morning air  under the very walls of the capital. The mystery must be solved at any cost,  and commanding their warriors to wait in the camp, all five chiefs, the leaders  of the host, flung themselves on their horses, and galloped bravely up to the  chapel. It was a dangerous thing to do, for at any moment those terrible guns  might vomit forth fire and death; but the chiefs did not care. Fanaticism,  dread of the gods, was their most powerful characteristic, and dismounting from  their horses, they entered the door of the chapel whence the chaunt of the opal  proceeded. </p>
  <p>At  the entrance they stood transfixed with surprise, and for the moment deemed  they were in the Shrine of the Opal at Totatzine. Half-veiled by clouds of  white smoke rolling upward from a small altar, they could see the terrible  features of Huitzilopochtli, in all his blood-stained glory. The mats of  feather-work hung glittering from the walls; they marked the grotesque visages  of their deities scowling from pictured walls, and behind the altar, the hidden  minstrel chaunted the hymn of the opal. </p>
  <p>The  opal! There it hung in the centre of the white smoke. A ray of golden light,  like a finger from heaven, smote it with terrible glory. It was turning  rapidly, as they had seen it in the temple of the god at Totatzine. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chalchuih  Tlatonac!&rdquo; they cried, and all five prostrated themselves before the sacred  gem. High and shrill rang out the song from the hidden singer, and the chiefs,  with reverential awe, watched the spinning opal. Red, yellow, blue, green, the  rays flashed out jets of many-coloured fire every second. It began to revolve  more slowly. Slower and slower! a pause!&mdash;it hung motionless, and a ray of azure  shone benignly from its breast. </p>
  <p>The  song ceased, and a tall man, arrayed in white garments, came from behind the  shrine, holding a blue cloak full length in his arms. This was the ritual  prescribed at the shrine of Huitzilopochtli when the god spoke through the  opal. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  god proclaims peace!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  voice broke the spell. The Indians dashed forward, and strove to seize him, but  he eluded their grip, and vanished. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peace!  Peace! Peace!&rdquo; they heard him cry three times. Their attention was fixed on the  opal, and they did not pursue him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sacred stone!&rdquo; cried the supreme chief; &ldquo;we must bear it back to the shrine of  the god. Forgive us, oh, holy one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>He  snapped the stone off the string, and darted out of the door, followed by his  four companions. At the door an old Indian, now divested of his sacerdotal  garments, met them, and rushed on their principal with a cry of anger. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! Give me back the sacred gem!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cocom!&rdquo;  cried the chief, raising his tomahawk. &ldquo;It was thou who thieved the gem! Die,  vile wretch, who desecrated the shrine of the god.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>His  companions restrained his wrath. The fear of the opal was on them. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Tezuco. The god says peace! The stone burns blue rays.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bind  him, then, and we will take him to Totatzine; there to be sacrificed on the  altar of the offended god.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  a moment Cocom, in spite of his struggles, was thrown across the back of the  horse of one of the chiefs, and they all rode off rapidly towards the camp. In  the centre of the throng, Tezuco halted, and held up his hand. Therein flashed  the opal, and a cry of delight arose from the host, who in a moment recognised  the gem, and at once prostrated themselves before its glory. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children  of the war-god. This hath been given to us again. We saw the stone revolve&mdash;we  saw it stay. Blue was the ray of the gem. Blue, my children, is the sign of  peace. Huitzilopochtli, the lord of war, is appeased. He proclaims peace. No  longer wait we here. To Totatzine!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Totatzine!&rdquo; roared the vast host, and, at a signal, rushed for their horses.  War, plunder, Xuarez, all was forgotten. The blue ray of the opal proclaimed  peace, and this vast host, laying down its arms, departed at the bidding of the  god. </p>
  <p>The  townspeople on the walls of the city saw with amazement the Indians suddenly,  without any apparent reason, strike their camp, and file off in long lines  towards the north. Astonished at the sight, Don Sebastian sent off a message to  the President. </p>
  <p>In  a quarter of an hour he arrived at the Puerta de la Culebra, followed by Jack  and Tim. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold,  Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; cried Jack, triumphantly pointing to the myriads tramping across the  plain. &ldquo;Did I not speak truly? The opal has done its work.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  opal! The opal!&rdquo; murmured those around him, and the cry being caught up by the  populace, passed from one mouth to another. The crowd on the walls, seeing in  the departure of the Indians the influence of the opal, began to cry out madly.  They deemed that the opal was still within the walls of Tlatonac. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Viva  el opale! El Chalchuih Tlatonac!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said Maraquando, with satisfaction, shaking Jack by the hand; &ldquo;you were right,  Se&ntilde;or. The Indians will give us no more trouble. Now we can crush Xuarez in the  south. Se&ntilde;or de Ahumada open the gates!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  a few moments His Excellency, followed by Jack, Tim, and Don Sebastian, was  galloping in the direction of the chapel. They reached it, dismounted, and  entered. The opal was gone and Cocom also! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew we would lose the opal,&rdquo; said Jack, cheerfully; &ldquo;but I thought they would  kill Cocom. Fortunately they have only taken him prisoner.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  reserve him for a more cruel death in Totatzine, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Maraquando,  his delight slightly damped. &ldquo;He has served the Republic well. I would he could  have been saved.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  devil!&rdquo; murmured Tim, in English, as they remounted their horses. &ldquo;In any case,  Jack, his death has saved the Republic. Now the savages have gone away, it won&rsquo;t  be difficult to thrash Don Hypolito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  the city gates a new surprise awaited them. Don Rafael, mounted on a mustang,  came galloping through the gate, and reined up his steed in front of his  astonished father. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father! Great news; good news! I have just returned in <i>The Montezuma</i>. We  have captured <i>The Cortes</i> and the transports.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Don  Miguel looked incredulous. This news, coming after the departure of the  Indians, seemed too good to be true. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, my father,&rdquo; said Rafael, proudly. &ldquo;By noon to-day you will see them in  the harbour. Now Don Hypolito has no fleet.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  cried Jack, tossing his hat in the air. &ldquo;The luck of the opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Those  near repeated his exclamation. It swelled into a roar, and throughout Tlatonac  only one cry could be heard, &ldquo;Vive el opale.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXXII"></a>Chapter XXXII<br>
    Under The Opal Flag</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Marching  away; joyous and gay,<br>
  Rank upon rank with a splendid display,<br>
  Leaving the city at breaking of day.</p>
  <p class="poem">Riding  along, gallant and strong,<br>
  Round us the populace tearfully throng,<br>
  Greeting our going with patriot&rsquo;s song.</p>
  <p class="poem">Under  our feet, flower-buds sweet;<br>
  Tread we in marching through plaza and street,<br>
  Never our kinsfolk again may we meet.</p>
  <p class="poem">Laurels  to earn; foemen to spurn;<br>
  Only for glory we anxiously yearn,<br>
  Conquerors all we will hither return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juan,&rdquo;  said Dolores, seriously, &ldquo;I believe the opal brought us bad fortune. While it  was in the city, Janjalla fell, Don Francisco died, and all went wrong. Now it  is lost, the Indians have departed, the fleet of Xuarez is destroyed, and  everything promises well for the future.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true, in one sense, yet wrong in another,&rdquo; replied Jack, smiling. &ldquo;You must  not forget that it was through the opal the Indians departed, and while it was  in Tlatonac, <i>The Pizarro</i> was sunk, and the two other warships captured.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose never again shall I behold the opal, Juanito?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless you care to pay a second visit to Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Dolores  shuddered. The memory of their peril in the hidden city was a painful one.  Recent events had not obliterated the recollection of that terrible journey to  the coast through the tropical forest. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would certainly not care about seeing Totatzine again, querido. And yet I  would&mdash;if only to save Cocom!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is impossible to save Cocom,&rdquo; responded Jack, a trifle sadly. &ldquo;The only way to  do so would be to lead an army to the hidden city, and rescue him. But how can  such a thing be done in that narrow, secret way? Our soldiers would be cut to  pieces in those rocky defiles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no other way, I suppose?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not sure, Dolores. That ca&ntilde;on road leads to the outer world. If we could  only enter the valley where Totatzine is built by that way, we might succeed in  capturing the city; but I am afraid such an entrance will never be discovered.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay  di mi. Then poor Cocom is lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is his own fault, querida. I tried to save him; but he refused to obey my  orders. Still, there is one chance of aiding him, though I am afraid but a  faint one.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that, my Juan?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  angelito! The sacrifice of the cycle does not take place for two months. I have  escaped it, but Cocom may now be selected by Ixtlilxochitli as the victim. If  we can crush Xuarez and finish the war within the next few weeks, it may be  that we can march troops to the sacred city, and save his life.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can you get to the city? By the secret way?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  by the ca&ntilde;on road. See, Dolores! I have an idea!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  were sitting on the azotea, two days after the Indians had retreated from  Tlatonac. Rafael had just left them, full of glee at the proposed expedition to  Janjalla, and it was then that Dolores had made the remark about the opal which  lead to the conversation regarding Cocom, Totatzine, and the ca&ntilde;on road. </p>
  <p>In  her lap Dolores had a pile of flowers, which she was arranging for the use of  the house. Jack took a handful of these, and, kneeling down on the floor of the  azotea, proceeded to illustrate his theory by constructing a map with the blossoms. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behold,  my own!&rdquo; he said, deftly placing a bud here and there, &ldquo;this rose is Totatzine,  situate fifty miles from the coast in a straight line. Here is Tlatonac,  indicated by this scarlet verbena. From the point where we embarked in the  canoe to the capital is twenty miles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Dolores, much interested in this explanation. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Totatzine to the point where we embarked, and from thence to Tlatonac, is what  we call a right angle. Now, if I draw a straight line from the capital in a  slanting direction, you can see that it passes through Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that, querido! but the third line is longer than the other two.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is longer than each of the other two lines if you take them separately. Shorter  if you take them together. You do not know Euclid, Dolores, else you would  discover that any two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third  side.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Juanito!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolores, vivaciously. &ldquo;From Totatzine to the  point where we embarked is fifty miles, from thence to Tlatonac twenty miles&mdash;in  all, seventy miles. But by your reasoning this third line is not seventy miles.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not! Still I believe it is quite seventy miles from Tlatonac to  Totatzine by this new way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  we cannot go thither in a straight line. If we went by this one I have drawn,  the distance would be much shorter than by the secret way of the sea. But as we  have to follow the railway it is a longer journey&mdash;quite seventy miles. See!  This is Cuavaca, at the foot of Xicotencatl&mdash;thirty miles from Tlatonac; from  Cuavaca to the terminus of the railway it is twenty miles; from thence to  Totatzine possibly another twenty&mdash;in all seventy miles. So you see that the  distance each way, owing to the configuration of the country, is precisely the  same.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but what of that?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not see? At the point where the railway stops it is only twenty miles to  Totatzine. Now, if, as I suspect, there is a road leading up the ca&ntilde;on to the  city, the distance from the termination of the railway works to that road  cannot be very far. If, therefore, we discover the hidden road, we can take our  troops up by rail, march the rest of the distance, and enter Totatzine through  the mouth of the ca&ntilde;on.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  cried Dolores, astonished at this idea. &ldquo;And you propose to attempt this  entrance?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it can be found. Unfortunately Cocom is the only Indian who could supply such  information, and he is a prisoner to Ixtlilxochitli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if he knew of this ca&ntilde;on road, why did he not lead us by that way instead of  towards the coast?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget the whole country is overrun by Indians. We could not have disguised  ourselves as pilgrims had we gone by the ca&ntilde;on road. That is evidently the  secular path. The other way to the coast is sacred.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be done, Juanito.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but it cannot be done till Xuarez is conquered and the war is ended.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!&rdquo;  sighed Dolores, sadly; &ldquo;and when will that be?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  shortly. Now we have succeeded in getting rid of the Indians, we shall be able  to crush Xuarez at one blow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  do you march south?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow  at the latest.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  Se&ntilde;or Felipe be back?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am afraid not. In three days I expect the yacht will return. By that time who  knows but what we may not have conquered the rebels?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Shortly  afterwards this conversation came to an abrupt conclusion as Don Miguel sent a  special messenger to call Jack to the Palacio Nacional. In those days Jack was  a very important personage. Maraquando was so impressed by the way in which the  Indians had been dealt with that he entertained a higher opinion than ever of  Duval&rsquo;s capabilities, and frequently appealed to him for advice. Nor did this  create any jealousy, for the Cholacacans were now beginning to regard Duval as  one of themselves. He was going to marry the niece of their President; he was  the engineer who had constructed the railway; he was deeply interested in the  future of the Republic; so it was generally supposed that when the war was at  an end he would be naturalized, a citizen of Cholacaca, and take up his abode  there altogether. A clever, brilliant young man like Jack was a distinct  acquisition to the country, and the liberal-minded Cholacacans welcomed him  accordingly. </p>
  <p>From  the deepest despair the city had passed into a state of great elation. With the  death of Gomez, all the bad fortune of the Republic seemed to have vanished.  Since Maraquando had seated himself in the Presidential chair, all had gone  well, and the superstitious Tlatonacians looked upon him as a ruler likely to  bring good fortune to the Republic. Nor was such a belief to be wondered at,  seeing how suddenly the tide of fortune had turned within the last few days in  favour of the governmental party. </p>
  <p>The  Indians had departed, and thus was Don Hypolito deprived at one swoop of half  his power. <i>The Cortes</i> menaced by <i>The Columbus</i>, <i>The Iturbide</i> and the torpederas had surrendered, and now with the transports were lying in  the harbour of the capital. Xuarez, by the loss of his fleet, was cut off  completely from the north, and shut up in Janjalla with but six thousand  troops. </p>
  <p>After  these events had transpired, the Junta met in the hall of the Palacio Nacional  to map out the coming campaign. The whole of the members were on the side of  Maraquando. Before the peril which threatened the Republic in the south all  party differences had disappeared, and the representatives of the several  provinces united in upholding the policy of Don Miguel. This judicious unity  was the salvation of the Republic. </p>
  <p>The  capital was garrisoned by ten thousand troops plentifully supplied with cannon,  ammunition, and rifles. This force was under the command of General Benito, who  had been elevated to the command after the death of the ill-fated Gigedo at  Janjalla. The troops were in a great state of excitement, as it was well known  that they were no longer to be held back within the walls of the capital.  Maraquando had decided to throw forward nine thousand men as far as Centeotl,  and leaving one thousand to defend Tlatonac, try conclusions with the rebels in  the open plains. </p>
  <p>At  the second conference of the Junta, this decision was somewhat modified by the  advice of Benito. That astute commander pointed out that in Janjalla lay the  strength of Xuarez. If he was defeated at Centeotl, he could fall back on the  southern capital, whereas, if that was in the power of the Government, he would  have no chance of retreat, and be thus crushed at one blow. The main thing,  therefore, was to capture Janjalla, and deprive the rebels of this last refuge  in case of defeat. </p>
  <p>It  was Rafael who supported the General, and proposed a plan by which the southern  city could be taken. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;  cried Rafael, vehemently, &ldquo;what General Benito says is true. We must leave  Xuarez no refuge. He must be crushed between our armies in the north and south.  Behold, Se&ntilde;ores, in the harbour of our city lie two warships taken from the  enemy, now manned by faithful sailors of the Junta. Also the armed cruiser <i>Iturbide</i>,  and the two torpedo-boats <i>Zuloaga</i> and <i>Montezuma</i>, one of which I  have the honour of commanding. Give us, Se&ntilde;ores, the order to steam south. Put  two thousand troops on board of the transports. Then we will lie in the harbour  of Janjalla, and bombard the town. As Don Hypolito has probably gone north with  the bulk of his army to Centeotl, the town will be ill defended. In the end it  must surrender, and then we can land our troops and push forward to gain the  rear of the rebels. From the north, Se&ntilde;ores, seven thousand men will march  under the command of General Benito. Thus Xuarez will find himself between two  armies, and be forced to surrender or submit to be cut to pieces. The rebels  will be defeated and the war will be ended.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  proposition commended itself to the Junta, and was ultimately adopted. At once  the fleet, under the command of Captain Pedraza, was sent south, with  instructions to bombard and capture Janjalla. Then to lead the troops and push  forward to effect a conjunction with General Benito at Centeotl. The warships,  the cruiser, torpederas, and transports, left the harbour of the capital that  afternoon amid great excitement, and then the populace rolled from sea-gate to  land-gate in order to witness the departure of the army for the south. </p>
  <p>As  yet <i>The Bohemian</i> had not returned from Truxillo, a delay which vexed Tim  mightily, as he wanted to send the boat off again with fresh despatches.  Besides, he knew that Philip would be annoyed at missing the battle which was  to decide the fate of the war. When he had left for Truxillo, there had been no  chance of the loyalists and rebels meeting in open battle; but of late events  had developed so rapidly that it was impossible to delay matters further. The  army was marching for Centeotl, and Philip was absent at Truxillo. </p>
  <p>Only  one person was pleased at this. Eulalia was afraid of losing her lover in what  promised to be a terribly sanguinary affair, and was therefore pleased that he  was out of danger. She had not the Spartan spirit of her cousin, who, though  downcast at the prospect of being separated from Jack, yet bade him march  forward with the army to conquer the rebels, and made no attempt to detain him  by her side. </p>
  <p>Two  thousand infantry had embarked on board the transports for Janjalla, and now  the army, consisting of five thousand foot and two thousand horse, left for the  front by the Puerta de la Culebra. Maraquando was nominally Commander-in-Chief  of the forces, but, his presence being required at Tlatonac, he left the  conduct of the campaign to General Benito. The army of Janjalla, proceeding  thither by sea, was commanded by Colonel Palo, and he was directed, when the  southern city was captured, to march to Centeotl, and effect, if possible, a  junction with the troops from the north. There were also forty field-guns, and  a battery of gatlings, with a corps of engineers. Thus provided, the army of  the Government deemed themselves invincible. </p>
  <p>When  they set out, Maraquando solemnly delivered to Benito the great standard of the  opal, which had never before left the walls of the capital. Now, in all its  splendour, it floated over the heads of the soldiers, a shining star, with its  glitter of feather-work and jewels, leading them south to victory. With that  standard the army could scarcely conceive that there was any chance of defeat. </p>
  <p>All  signs of the Indians had disappeared. There was no doubt that, obeying the  opal, they had retired to the sacred city, and there delivered the recovered  treasure to the high priest. Doubtless Ixtlilxochitli, still desirous of aiding  Xuarez, would stir them up to war; but before they could again emerge from the  forests, General Benito hoped to cut the army of Don Hypolito to pieces, reduce  the south to order, and then marching north, defeat the savage forces under the  walls of the capital. The great strength of the Republic lay in the fact that  by strategy they had succeeded in isolating Xuarez in the south. Owing to the  loss of his fleet, he could no longer depend upon help from Acauhtzin, and now  that his Indian allies had deserted him, he was forced to meet the Royalist  army with a comparatively small army. </p>
  <p>On  Monday afternoon the transports, filled with troops, and convoyed by the  warships, left for Janjalla, and at dawn on Wednesday the army began to march  out of the Puerta de la Culebra on its way to the south. Jack took a fond  farewell of Dolores, and soothed her with promises of his speedy return. Don  Miguel, with some members of the Junta, accompanied Benito some miles on his  way, and then returned to the capital to wait the upshot of this bold attempt  to end the war at a single blow. </p>
  <p>From  Tlatonac the army marched to Chichimec, which they found in ruins. Hardly a  soul was left in the town, for those who survived the massacre had fled  southward to Puebla de los Naranjos. It was true that there, also, they would  find but ruins. This they did not know, as the telegraph-wires had been cut by  the Indians, but as those savages were between Chichimec and the capital, the  unfortunate townspeople were only able to escape southward. </p>
  <p>Leaving  Chichimec, Benito marched to Puebla de los Naranjos, and there found a  considerable number of fugitives from the former city. He was informed that  Centeotl still held out against the rebels, though Xuarez was besieging it  hotly, and that Hermanita was untouched by either savage or rebel. This news  was very comforting, and desirous of reaching that town by nightfall, the  General pushed forward his troops by forced marches. By eight o&rsquo;clock the army  came in sight of Hermanita, and were joyfully greeted by its citizens, who  threw open their gates to receive these whom they justly regarded as their  deliverers. That night the troops occupied the town. </p>
  <p>Centeotl  was but twenty miles further on, and Benito was desirous of ascertaining the  position of Xuarez before venturing to give battle. He sent out Indian spies,  and these speedily brought reports as to the numerical strength of the rebels.  It appeared that Xuarez had in all about seven thousand troops, as he had been  joined by several of the smaller towns of the Republic. He had left but five  hundred to garrison Janjalla, never for a moment dreaming that, guarded as was  the town by <i>The Cortes</i>, it would be attacked by the loyalists from the  sea. Now having lost his sole remaining warship, he could not help seeing that  his position was desperate. By his spies, he learned that the army under Benito  was camped at Hermanita, and that Janjalla was being bombarded by the fleet of  the Junta. </p>
  <p>At  one time he thought of falling back on Janjalla, concentrating all his force  within its walls, and holding out against the loyalists, until reinforced by  his Indian allies. As yet he knew not that they had deserted him and withdrawn  to their forests. Had he been aware of his isolated position, he might have  come to terms with the Junta, but relying on the aid of the savages, and  trusting to Ixtlilxochitli&rsquo;s promises, he felt confident that he would gain a  victory. As Janjalla was being bombarded by the warships, he decided not to  fall back there, as he would but expose his troops to a double danger: the land  army of Benito and the bombs from the sea. </p>
  <p>What  he proposed to do was to meet Benito at Centeotl, defeat his army, and then  either occupy that town, and hold out till his allies came south, or march  north to effect a conjunction with them before the capital. As to Janjalla, he  could do nothing to relieve it. It was absolutely necessary that he should keep  his troops together, so as to meet the army of the Republic under Benito.  Before Janjalla fell into the hands of the Junta, he hoped to conquer the land  forces. It was all a chance, and he fully recognised that his position was most  perilous. The only hope he had of turning the tide of fortune in his favour was  to be joined by the Indians from the north. </p>
  <p>The  warships had left Tlatonac on Monday afternoon, and General Benito, knowing the  weak garrison at Janjalla, calculated that the city would succumb to the  bombardment by Friday at the latest. It was now the morning of that day, and he  determined to march his troops forward to meet the rebel army. From Janjalla,  from Hermanita to Centeotl, it was but twenty miles each way; and assuming that  Janjalla was captured, as there was every reason to believe, General Benito  hoped that the two thousand troops from the south, and his own forces from the  north would meet at Centeotl about the same time. </p>
  <p>With  this idea, he marched with his full strength to Centeotl, for now that the  Indians had vanished, he had no fear of being attacked in the rear, and if  forced to retreat, could fall back on Hermanita, that city being defended by  its ordinary garrison. Don Hypolito, so as not to expose his troops to the  double fire of town and plain, left the shelter of the walls, and occupied a  low range of hillocks running at right angles from the city. Between him and  Benito flowed the river broad and sluggish. </p>
  <p>By  noon the armies faced one another. At one o&rsquo;clock the first shot was fired, and  the battle of Centeotl began. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXXIII"></a>Chapter XXXIII<br>
    The Battle Of Centeotl</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">The  squadrons move across the plain,<br>
    Beneath a rain<br>
    Of deadly missiles falling, falling.<br>
    Oh, could we gain<br>
    Those heights beyond, where guns are calling,<br>
    Of deeds appalling,<br>
    One to the other not in vain,<br>
    Then might we conquer in the fray,<br>
    And victors be e&rsquo;er close of day.</p>
  <p>The  stream lying between the two armies was called the Rio Tardo, from its  slow-flowing current, and emerging from the interior mountains, pursued its way  in many windings to the sea. Centeotl was built on the left bank, so that the  loyalists were unable to occupy the town without crossing the river, and to do  so they would have had to force a passage at the point of the sword. The battle  took place about three miles from the city, on a large plain streaked here and  there with low ranges of sandy hills, and intersected by the broad stream of  the Rio Tardo. </p>
  <p>On  one of these ranges Don Hypolito had planted his artillery, and swept the river  with his heavy guns. He also disposed his infantry along the banks, whence they  kept up a regular fire of musketry on the loyalists. The bridge at Centeotl had  been destroyed prior to the arrival of Benito, so that there was no way of  crossing, save under fire from the foot soldiers, or in the teeth of the  battery posted on the sandy ridges. </p>
  <p>Behind  this battery Xuarez held his cavalry in reserve, lest the loyalists should  accomplish the passage of the river, and the combatants come to closer  quarters. Between Centeotl and the position he had taken up, he placed a line  of some thousand horse, with the object of preventing an attack by the besieged  in his rear. In the disposition of his troops, he showed a wonderful skill in  taking advantage of the capabilities of the ground, and General Benito saw  plainly that it would be with considerable difficulty that he could effect a  crossing of the Rio Tardo. </p>
  <p>On  his side there were no ranges of hills upon which he could post his artillery,  or by which he could protect his men. Nothing but a desolate plain covered with  brushwood incapable of offering the least shelter against the devastating fire  of the insurgents. His only way of crossing the river was to silence the  battery on the sandhills. With this object, he brought up his field-guns, and  opened a heavy cannonade on the heights beyond. The rebels replied, and for  over two hours this cross fire went on without intermission on either side.  Benito trusted by this gunnery to deceive the insurgents as to his real  purpose, which was to attempt a crossing with five hundred horse three miles  further up the stream, near the ruins of the bridge. By doing so he could take  Xuarez in the rear, and while the rebels were employed in facing this new  danger from an unexpected quarter, hoped to cross the river with his full  force. </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito evidently suspected this stratagem, for he kept a sharp eye on the  disposition of the loyalist army in the direction of Centeotl. When he saw a  body of horse move citywards to effect a crossing, he at once sent a troop of  cavalry to dispute the passage. Benito seeing this, despatched a battery of six  gatlings to support his troops, trusting that under the cover of these guns  playing on the enemy they could force the stream. At once Xuarez brought up his  field-artillery, and in a short space of time the cannonading lower down the  river was being repeated further up at the ruins of the bridge. </p>
  <p>The  right wing of the loyalist army, consisting entirely of infantry, was thrown forward  in the direction of Centeotl, and kept up a fusillade, under cover of which the  cavalry in scattered groups tried to cross. The insurgents, however, could not  be dislodged from the opposite bank, and it was impossible to accomplish the  passage under their persistent musketry. For close on three miles along the  banks of the river this line of sharp-shooters extended, and at each end of the  line artillery thundered incessantly. Men on either side were dropping every  moment, and it seemed as though each army would annihilate the other without  either crossing the stream. For four hours the battle had been raging without  the combatants coming to close quarters, and Xuarez&rsquo;s soldiers remaining ever  on the defensive, began to grow impatient. On the other hand, the Royalists  trying to carry the passage of the stream by dash after dash, were warming up  to their work. </p>
  <p>It  would have been madness for Don Hypolito to cross the stream, and with his few  attack the many of the loyalists. The river was his great safeguard, and so  long as that interposed its waters between him and the enemy, he felt  comparatively safe, trusting to hold his position until the arrival of the  Indians from the north, whom he counted upon taking the enemy in the rear. He  saw plainly that his men were growing weary of remaining solely on the  defensive, and submitting to be cut to pieces by the fire of Benito&rsquo;s  artillery; but, until he saw a prospect of being reinforced by the Indians, he  was powerless to do anything but stubbornly prevent the loyalists from fording  the stream. </p>
  <p>General  Benito saw that the rebel leader was unaware of the disaffection of the allies,  and relied on their arriving shortly to turn the tide of war in his favour.  With a view, therefore, to dishearten him, he ordered an Indian scout, attached  to his staff, to ford the river if possible, below the battery point, present  himself to Xuarez as a deserter from the loyalists, and inform him that the  Indians had retreated. The scout at once obeyed, and attempted to swim the river,  but just as he was close on the opposite bank, a rifle-shot struck him, and it  was with the greatest difficulty that he regained the shore. Several rebel  soldiers ran up to finish him with their bayonets, but he implored them to take  him to Xuarez, as he was in possession of certain facts relating to the allies. </p>
  <p>On  being brought into the presence of the rebel leader, he had just time to tell  Don Hypolito of the uselessness of counting on the Indians, and shortly  afterwards expired. Xuarez thought at first it was a device of the loyalists to  gain time, but as hour after hour went on, and no Indians appeared, he began to  believe that he was indeed foolish to depend upon help from that quarter. The  full terror of his position came on him at once. He saw that, deserted by the  Indians, cut off from Acauhtzin, the whole success of the rebellion against the  Junta depended upon his cutting the army of Benito to pieces. Janjalla was  behind him, and he several times thought of falling back on that town, but the  knowledge that it was being bombarded by the loyalist fleet withheld him from  committing such a folly. Centeotl was held in the interests of the Junta. There  was no chance of safety there, so he saw that he must remain in his present  position, and either tire out Benito by holding his position stubbornly, or  dash across the river with the main portion of his troops, and try the fortune  of war in a hand-to-hand fight. </p>
  <p>With  characteristic boldness he decided on the latter of these alternatives, and  sent forward a thousand cavalry to cross the river, and carry the war into the  enemy&rsquo;s camp. Midway between the two batteries, which still kept up their fire,  he brought fifteen field-guns to bear on the masses of infantry on the other  bank, armed only with their rifles, hoping to cut them to pieces, and thus  afford his cavalry a safe landing. Benito ordered five gatling guns to silence  the field battery, and prevent, if possible, the landing of the insurgent  cavalry. Unfortunately, his orders could not be accomplished smartly enough,  and before the gatlings could be brought into position, the field-guns of  Xuarez had opened a heavy fire on the infantry, under cover of which five  hundred horse-men crossed the stream. The landing once effected, others  followed, and the cavalry rode down the infantry like sheep, while right and  left the balls from the field-guns of Xuarez cut passages in the crowded  masses. For the moment the advantage was decidedly with Don Hypolito. </p>
  <p>At  once a thousand cavalry, held in reserve behind the battery, were hurled  forward on the horsemen of the rebels. Five hundred had now crossed the stream,  and there held the loyalists at bay while their comrades formed. The rebel  regiment pierced like a wedge into the mass of infantry, and met the cavalry of  Benito some distance from the bank of the river. What with these horsemen, and  the incessant firing of the field-guns, the infantry of Benito were thoroughly  demoralised, and flying in all directions. The cavalry of Xuarez, with  admirable discipline, formed into lines as soon as they crossed the river, and  steadily drove the horsemen of the loyalists backward. </p>
  <p>Xuarez  at once took advantage of this gain, and, behind his cavalry, sent regiment  after regiment of infantry with orders to carry the battery of Benito by storm.  In vain the foot-soldiers of the loyalists were hurled against the advancing  mass of rebel horse and foot now marching steadily for the battery. They did  not give way one inch. Xuarez hoped to capture the battery, turn the guns  against the loyalists, and then bringing the rest of his troops across the  stream. </p>
  <p>This  unexpected man&oelig;uvre had taken Benito by surprise, and there was but little  doubt that if the battery were captured a panic would ensue amongst his own  men, and thus give Xuarez a decided advantage. The columns of rebels pouring  across the stream pierced the host of loyalists like a wedge and bore steadily  down on the battery which was still under the heavy fire of the insurgent  artillery posted on the sandhills. </p>
  <p>Things  looked black at that moment for the loyalist army, but at this critical  juncture the troops of Benito succeeded in forcing the passage of the stream  further up near the city. What the Opposidores had done in the centre of the  line they did at its end, and, under cover of a heavy fire from their gatlings,  managed to cross the stream and capture the field-guns of the enemy. These were  at once utilised and turned on the rebels, and in a few minutes were pouring a  deadly fire into the masses of cavalry and infantry sent to hold the bridge  passage by Xuarez. An officer galloped post-haste to Benito, informing him of  the crossing of the stream, and the General recognising that he might cut off  the forces of Xuarez on the left bank, sent to the bridge all the soldiers he  could spare, amounting to some fifteen hundred. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the cavalry of Xuarez, supported by several regiments of infantry, were trying  to carry the battery of the loyalists by storm. Their own artillery was now  silent, as so inextricably mingled were rebels and loyalists round the battery  that it was impossible for the gunners of Xuarez to fire without cutting their  own men to pieces. The rebels were still steadily pouring, column after column,  across the stream in the rear of the cavalry, when suddenly their line was cut  in two by the victorious loyalists from the bridge. </p>
  <p>These  had utterly beaten the rebels defending the passage, by turning their own guns  on them, and now those latter were flying towards the centre of the scene of  operations, followed by a scattered body of cavalry, cutting them down in all  directions. The loyalist infantry quickly crossed the river, and followed in  the rear of the horsemen, but, being on foot, were necessarily far behind. The  rebels attempted to re-form and reach the point where their columns were  fording the stream but, flushed with victory, the cavalry of Benito passed  clean through the mass, cutting off all further rebels from joining their  comrades on the opposite shore. </p>
  <p>At  the same time, owing to the deadly fire of the loyalist battery, the invading  soldiers of Xuarez were beginning to give way, and slowly fell back inch by  inch towards the point where they had crossed. They were unable to get back,  however, as the cavalry of Benito held them in check on the opposite bank, and  seeing this, the General threw forward two regiments across the stream further  up, where the bank, owing to the clean sweep made by his cavalry, was  undefended. </p>
  <p>The  rebels now found themselves between two masses of their foes, between two  fires, with nothing but the river between. They slowly retreated before the  infantry, pressing forward from the direction of the battery, and falling back  on the right bank of the river, found themselves unable to cross in the teeth  of the loyalist cavalry holding the opposite bank, while the foot-soldiers  behind fought viciously with the rebels. The cavalry and infantry of Xuarez  thus caught became demoralized, and unable to keep a firm front to the  loyalists, broke up into terrified masses, which were either cut to pieces, or  forced into the stream, where they were shot down by their enemies on the  opposite bank. </p>
  <p>It  was now close on six o&rsquo;clock, and, after five hours&rsquo; incessant fighting, the  advantage was now with the army of the Junta. Benito held the passage of the  bridge near Centeotl, and from thence down to the battery, the banks of the  stream on both sides were held by his own men. The enemy beaten on the right  bank, were slowly falling back on the left, and concentrating themselves round  the hillocks, from which thundered their artillery. Behind the battery, Xuarez  still held three thousand men in reserve, and these he brought forward, with  the intention of hurling them in one last effort of despair, against the  advancing masses of the loyalists. </p>
  <p>General  Benito no longer held back his army, but in person led his soldiers across the  river. In a miraculously short space of time the combat was transferred from  the right to the left bank of the Rio Tardo, and the whole force of the  loyalists, with the exception of the corps of engineers attending to the  battery, had crossed the river, and were pressing forward to carry the citadel  of Xuarez by storm. </p>
  <p>What  with killed and wounded, and prisoners taken, the number of fighting men on  either side was terribly reduced; yet, numerically speaking, the advantage lay  with the loyalists, who could oppose seven thousand men to four thousand on the  part of Xuarez. Confident in his position, and in the shelter afforded by the  sandhills, Don Hypolito gathered his four thousand round the base of his  batteries, and played his guns with deadly effect on the advancing masses of  the loyalists over the heads of his own men. It was now a hand-to-hand  struggle, and though the loyalists had the advantage over the rebels in  numbers, yet as they were unable to bring their guns across the river, the  combat was more or less equalised. The deadly fire from the sandhills played  havoc with their ranks, and they were mowed down in hundreds. Having no  artillery to oppose these guns, and being unable to silence them by the battery  on the opposite bank, the only hope of thrashing the enemy lay in carrying the  sandhills by storm. This Benito, with desperate courage, now proceeded to do. </p>
  <p>As  yet, Xuarez had managed to keep the loyalists in front, and gathering his lines  from the river bank to some distance into the plain, desperately resisted the  attempts of the attacking force to break through and storm the battery. To  protect his rear from the river side, he sent two hundred cavalry to the back  of the sandhills, to guard the stream lest any straggling parties of loyalists  should cross at that point and assail him unexpectedly. He was now entirely on  the defensive, and, unless he succeeded in putting the loyalists to flight with  his artillery, saw not how he could hope to win the victory. </p>
  <p>How  bitterly did he regret the desertion of the Indians, the cause of which  disaffection he could not understand. With them coming from the north, he might  have effected a conjunction by crossing the river as he had done, and thus  captured the battery of Benito. As it was, however, his soldiers had been  beaten back, the loyalists had crossed the river, and now his whole force was  concentrated round the sandhills, upon which was placed his artillery. </p>
  <p>In  his despair, Don Hypolito longed for the darkness, in the hope that under cover  of the night he might be enabled to fall back on Janjalla. Long since he would  have done this but for the timely information that the town was blockaded by  the warships of the Junta. It seemed like madness to retreat into such a  death-trap, and yet if it could hold out against the bombardment until he  arrived, he would at least have walls behind which to fight. He regretted  intensely that he had not captured Centeotl and thrown himself therein to  defend himself against the loyalists. Surrounded by stone walls, he could hope  to wear out the troops of the Republic, and perhaps destroy them in  detachments, but as it was he had no shelter. His whole front was being  assaulted by the loyalists, and behind he had but his battery and a possible  chance of falling back on Janjalla in the night-time. </p>
  <p>The  whole plain from Centeotl to the point of action was now in the hands of the  loyalists, and seeing this the Jefe Politico of the city threw open the gates  and sent forward men with provisions and wine to the wearied troops. Three  hundred soldiers yet remained within the walls, and these also marched out to  join the army of the Republic, and attack Xuarez in his last position. It was  now past seven o&rsquo;clock, and the darkness was rapidly coming on. Don Hypolito  hoped that the loyalists would withdraw and renew the combat next day. In the  interval, his men could rest and sustain themselves with food or fall back at  once on Janjalla. </p>
  <p>This  respite, however, Benito declined to give. While the light lasted, he  determined to keep up the fight, and if possible dislodge Xuarez from his  position before the morning. Deeply did he regret that he had no electric  lights, by the glare of which to conduct the battle; but as it was he took  advantage of the clear twilight, and pushed forward his men vigorously in  attempting to break down the stubborn line of defence offered by Don Hypolito. </p>
  <p>It  is questionable how long this state of things would have lasted, as the rebels  obstinately fought on, and though Benito hurled column after column against  them, not one inch would they yield. The artillery also, from the heights  above, was sweeping down his rearward troops. He sent one thousand across the  river again, to attempt the rear of the enemy, under cover of the fire of  fifteen gatlings, but Xuarez turned four heavy guns on the passage of the  river, and stopped the crossing with ease. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carrajo!&rdquo;  muttered Benito, shutting up his glass in a rage, &ldquo;they will hold out till it  is dark, and then we must stop. During the night they will fall back on  Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  into the hands of our men!&rdquo; replied Jack, who was standing beside the general. &ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or, Don Hypolito knows it is worse than useless to retreat from his present  position. When the morning dawns, you will find him still on those hills.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  All the same, Don Juan, I would like to finish him off to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  send scouts from Centeotl to see if our men are advancing from Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be that the city is not taken.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true. On the other hand, it might be that the city is.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Coincidences  occur in real life as well as in novels and here occurred a case in point. Tim,  who had been to Centeotl to make inquiries, galloped up to Benito at this  moment and saluted. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;General,&rdquo;  he said rapidly, &ldquo;messengers have just arrived from Janjalla. The city is in  the hands of the Junta, and our troops, to the number of two thousand, are  pushing forward by forced marches.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janjalla  in our hands?&rdquo; cried Benito, joyfully. &ldquo;Then Xuarez has no refuge on which to  fall back.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  army shouted on hearing this cheering news, and looked upon the destruction of  the rebels as a foregone conclusion, as indeed it was. Xuarez heard the  shouting, and, becoming aware of the cause by the frequent cries of &ldquo;Janjalla,&rdquo;  ground his teeth with rage, as he saw how fortune was against him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;  he said to his officers, &ldquo;we are condemned to stay here. There is now no hope  of falling back on the seaport. We can but face the enemy, and fight bravely. I  should have heard of this fall before, as my scouts are all over the country to  Janjalla.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  in spite of this discouraging news, he urged his men to fight bravely, hoping  that the night would come, and force the loyalists to withdraw for some hours.  In that time his army could rest and eat, while he himself might think of some  plan by which to circumvent the tactics of General Benito. He was quite  ignorant that two thousand men were marching from Janjalla to attack him in the  rear. </p>
  <p>The  last glimmer of the sunset had long since died out of the sky, and it was now  comparatively dark. As yet, the reinforcements from Janjalla had not arrived  and Benito was almost on the point of ceasing the fight till dawn, when the  moon arose in the west. Her appearance was welcomed by him with joy, for her  light was quite brilliant enough to enable the assaulting party to continue  fighting; and incessantly pressing on the wearied troops of Xuarez seemed the  only chance of beating him from the sandhills and scattering his army. Don  Hypolito cursed the moon audibly, for he saw that his last chance of escaping  in the darkness was gone. Nothing remained for him but to fight on doggedly. </p>
  <p>Then  his scouts arrived, and he learned that in an hour two thousand men would  attack him in the rear. With a cry of rage, he hurled his field-glass down the  hill. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fortune  is against me,&rdquo; he muttered, biting his lip with wrath; &ldquo;my star goes down in  blood. Attacked front and rear, I cannot hold out much longer.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Yet  he was too brave to give in, and, seeing that the town of Centeotl was left  defenceless, as its garrison had joined Benito, he hoped to make a detour, and  throw himself with his remaining troops into the city. One thousand men he  could leave to defend the battery and draw off the attention of the loyalists,  and with his remaining two thousand march silently away to the south, then make  a detour for the city. Then the reinforcements would come up in vain, for he  and his men would have slipped away like an eel from between the two armies. He  never thought of the fate of the thousand men he was leaving behind. But at  that moment he would have given anything to gain time to reconstruct his plans,  and would have sacrificed a million lives so that his campaign should not end  in disaster. </p>
  <p>This  mad scheme to occupy Centeotl in the teeth of the enemy was destined to fail  for lack of time. Before he could move a single column towards the city, the  sound of distant firing was heard, and the reinforcements came up in the rear at  a quick trot. The whole force of Xuarez was disposed along the front of the  battery, protecting it from the assaults of Benito&rsquo;s army. Undefended in the  rear, save for two hundred cavalry guarding the river, it offered itself freely  to the reinforcements for storming. Don Hypolito brought round troops rapidly  from the front to oppose this new danger. The cavalry dashed recklessly between  the battery and the advancing infantry from Janjalla. Three guns, with  depressed muzzles, rained down shot on the masses of infantry. It was all in  vain. The fresh troops, elated by the fall of Janjalla, and the crossing of the  river by General Benito, passed clean over the thin line of cavalry drawn up to  beat them back. A mass of men obliterating man and horse, rolled upward towards  the hastily formed lines of weary soldiers, brought round from the front to  protect the rear. These succumbed in a few minutes, and the guns no longer  being able to do damage by reason of the enemy being directly under their  muzzles, the reinforcements swarmed up the slanting slope of the sandhills with  cries of victory. </p>
  <p>Benito  heard those cries, and at once guessed that the troops from Janjalla were  carrying the battery by storm. Hitherto he had been holding five hundred  cavalry and two thousand infantry in reserve. These were now brought forward  and hurled on the soldiers of Xuarez massed at the foot of the sandhills. The  rebels looked in front, and saw this mass threatening to overwhelm them; they  looked behind, and lo! over the brow of the sandhills poured a black crowd of  men over whose heads floated the yellow standard of the Republic. The guns were  silenced, the gunners bayoneted, and the red flag of Xuarez dragged from its  pole at the top of the hill. Xuarez himself, surrounded by a ring of his  officers, waved his sword for a moment, and then the wave of men passed over  him. A cry spread throughout the host of rebels that he was lost. The men at  the base of the sandhills, seeing the wave of men rolling downward, lost heart  and broke up into scattered masses. On came the army of Benito, and between the  two forces the insurgents crumpled up like paper. </p>
  <p>In  all directions they fled like sheep, and were chased for miles by the  victorious Republicans. Benito, a merciful man, strove to restrain the zeal of  his soldiers. It was all in vain, they were drunken with victory, and sabred  and shot the wretched fugitives without mercy. The smoke hung heavily over the  field of battle, and when it cleared away, the victorious troops of the Junta  saw the great standard of the Republic floating proudly in the place lately  occupied by the battery of the enemy. </p>
  <p>Don  Hypolito had disappeared, his army, broken to pieces, was flying in all  directions. From the triumphant army massed round the sandhills, rose a roar of  joy which made the earth tremble. The wind which had blown away the smoke,  shook out the folds of the opal flag, and the Cholacacans saluted the  invincible banner with cheers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Viva  el opale! Viva el Republica!&rdquo; </p>

  <p>Three  weeks after that memorable victory at Centeotl, the city of Tlatonac was  holding high festival in honour of the triumphant Junta. Every street was  illuminated and decorated with flowers. In the principal places, fireworks, so  dear to the hearts of the Cholacacans were being let off, and the ships lying  in the harbour were brilliant with lights. The populace in their gayest attire  walked singing through the streets, visited the pulque shops, and gathered in  groups to indulge in their national dances. Bands stationed in different  squares, played the Opal Fandango, The March of Zuloaga, and soldiers, the  heroes of the hour, were to be seen everywhere, being f&ecirc;ted and caressed by the  grateful citizens. </p>
  <p>Before  the Palacio Nacional a dense crowd had collected, and the place itself,  brilliantly lighted up, was occupied by a gaily dressed throng. His Excellency  the President was giving a ball in honour of the establishment of peace. On one  of the balconies Jack and Dolores were seated, watching the varied throng  below, and talking of past events. For the hundredth time Dolores was asking  Jack about the battle, and all that had taken place thereat. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure, Dolores, you must be wearied of this more than twice-told tale.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Juanito! It is a tale of which I never weary. Come, querido, tell me once more.  Begin, &lsquo;After the battle&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  the battle,&rdquo; repeated Jack, humouring her fancy. &ldquo;Well, the first thing we did  after the battle was to search for the body of Don Xuarez. He had been last  seen on the summit of the sandhill by his battery. When the reinforcements took  that position by storm, Xuarez vanished, and though we searched everywhere for  his body, it could not be found.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  then you knew that he had escaped?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was presumed so; but even now we are not certain as to what has become of him.  However, he had vanished; and giving up the search for him, dead or alive, in  despair, General Benito left a few hundred men to garrison Centeotl, and pushed  on at once to Janjalla. In the harbour we found the fleet, which had captured  the town by bombarding it, and Captain Pedraza, under instructions from Benito,  took the ships back to Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I remember how joyful we were when they entered the harbour and announced the  victory. Everyone in Tlatonac was mad with joy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  They are mad enough to-night,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling, as he looked down on the  crowd; &ldquo;but under the circumstances, I think it is excusable. The fall of  Acauhtzin, the last stronghold of the Opposidores, is worth being excited  about. Did Rafael tell you all about it, Dolores?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so much as he might have done,&rdquo; pouted Dolores, unfurling her fan; &ldquo;but you see,  Juan, there is Do&ntilde;a Carmencita&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course! Poor girl! Fancy her father being killed when the city was being  bombarded!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great loss, was it not?&rdquo; sighed Dolores, her eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;Ay di  mi. How sad would I feel had I lost my dear uncle.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the fortune of war,&rdquo; said Jack, calmly. &ldquo;Instead of our troops capturing  Acauhtzin and killing Tejada, it might have been Xuarez storming Tlatonac and  shooting Don Miguel. One thing, at least, Do&ntilde;a Carmencita has to be grateful  for: Rafael rescued her unharmed from the burning city, and now she is to be  his wife.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I am to be yours!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and Eulalia is to be Philip&rsquo;s,&rdquo; finished Jack, promptly. &ldquo;I thought Don Miguel  would never give his consent to that marriage.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Juanito!&rdquo; said Dolores, with a mischievous smile, &ldquo;I think my uncle did so to  console Don Felipe for losing his chance of being at the battle.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Philip! Only one battle of any consequence, and he missed it by being away at  Truxillo.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  this moment Dolores was summoned away from her lover by Do&ntilde;a Serafina. The old  lady was a very severe duenna when not asleep, and as Dolores was yet  unmarried, did not approve of her being too much in the society of her future  husband. A little jealousy was mingled with this strict regard for etiquette,  as Do&ntilde;a Serafina had utterly failed to fascinate Peter. All her smiles and  insinuating remarks had been quite thrown away on the little doctor, who showed  no disposition for matrimony, and scrupulously ignored the languishing looks of  his elderly admirer. Finally, Serafina gave up the pursuit of this medical male  as a bad job, and revenged herself indirectly on the sex by being particularly  sharp with Eulalia and Dolores, both of whom were rarely permitted to be more  than a few minutes with their respective lovers. These last blamed Peter in no  measured terms for thus depriving them of the society of their future wives;  but the doctor absolutely refused to sacrifice himself any longer on the altar  of friendship. He announced this in a conversation which took place in the  patio of Casa Maraquando after the ball. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would do anything for you I could,&rdquo; he explained plaintively to Jack and  Philip; &ldquo;but I really cannot go on paying attention to Do&ntilde;a Serafina. She  thinks I am in earnest!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so you ought to be, you little monster,&rdquo; said Tim, quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you were  married.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, why don&rsquo;t you set the example?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  easy talking! I have no one to love me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Journalism  is a jealous mistress,&rdquo; observed Philip, laughing. &ldquo;Tim is devoted to &lsquo;Articles  from a Special Correspondent.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  for you,&rdquo; replied Tim, complacently; &ldquo;but my occupation&rsquo;s gone. Didn&rsquo;t I send  my last article about &lsquo;The Fall of Acauhtzin&rsquo; from Janjalla? and isn&rsquo;t the war  over?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  war is certainly over!&rdquo; said Jack, lighting a cigarette; &ldquo;but the danger of  another war is not yet past.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Jack?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Hypolito still lives; and while he lives, the Republic is not safe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  lives!&rdquo; echoed Philip, in surprise. &ldquo;Why, Jack, I don&rsquo;t see how you can make  that out. He was not found on the field of battle, nor in Janjalla, nor in  Acauhtzin. He must be dead!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Don Hypolito is not the man to die so easily. Where he is, I do not know, but I  am certain he is yet alive.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>There  was silence for a few minutes, as each was busy with his own thoughts regarding  the probable resurrection of Xuarez. After the battle of Centeotl, he had  vanished utterly from the face of the earth. It was thought he had fled to  Janjalla, or perchance to Acauhtzin; but in neither of those towns could he be  discovered. After a bombardment of five hours, the latter city had surrendered  to the warships. Don Jos&egrave;, the Governor, in the absence of Xuarez, had been  killed by the bursting of a bomb, and many of his officers had shared the same  fate. Of Xuarez, however, nothing could be discovered, and Don Miguel was much  disturbed thereat. With a restless spirit like the rebel leader still working  in secret, the danger was not yet at an end, and the President was determined  to spare no effort to bring Xuarez, to justice. While the four friends were  thinking over this matter, Don Rafael, who had been holding a private  conversation with his father, entered the patio. </p>
  <p>That  young man was the hero of the bombardment of Acauhtzin. He had recovered Do&ntilde;a  Carmencita; his father had consented to his speedy marriage with that lady, and  he was idolised by his fellow-citizens. With all this good fortune, he should  have been gay and lighthearted; but as he entered the patio, he certainly  looked anything but happy. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  What ails you, Rafael?&rdquo; asked Jack, as his friend threw himself into a seat,  and sighed heavily. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carambo!  Everything is wrong. My father refuses his consent to our marriages.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  interrupted Philip and Jack, in dismay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  Xuarez is discovered and punished,&rdquo; finished Rafael, dismally. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Philip, with a breath of relief, &ldquo;it might have been worse. I thought you  were about to say Don Miguel had refused his consent altogether.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  I don&rsquo;t know if it does not amount to that,&rdquo; replied Rafael, shrugging his  shoulders. &ldquo;How are we to find this ladron of a Xuarez? He is not at Acauhtzin.  He is not in the south. Where then are we to look for him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you not find out?&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can find out nothing, mi amigo. For my part, I believe he is dead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  my part, Se&ntilde;or Rafael, I believe he is alive,&rdquo; retorted Tim, gruffly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  And where do you think he is to be found, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quien  sabe,&rdquo; said Tim, carelessly. &ldquo;But you know, Se&ntilde;or, that after the battle of  Centeotl, I rode to Janjalla, to wire my report to England?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  there, I heard two prisoners talking. They, deeming me to be a foreigner, and  not knowing that I was conversant with Spanish, spoke freely.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  And they said?&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  about Don Hypolito, but talked of Pepe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pepe!&rdquo;  echoed Philip, quickly. &ldquo;The zambo who decoyed Dolores from Tlatonac&mdash;the lover  of Marina?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same. Pepe, it appears, had followed Xuarez to Janjalla, being, as we know, the  prince of spies. When <i>The Cortes</i> was taken, and Xuarez was thus cut off  from getting back to Acauhtzin, Pepe happened to be in Janjalla. The troops of  Xuarez were wondering, in the case of defeat, how they could escape from the  hands of our men. Pepe laughed, on hearing their doubts, and said he could  easily escape to Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Totatzine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the sacred city. He said no one could follow him there, and that he knew of a  secret way in the south, which would take him thither.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Jack, the secret way you came is to the north of Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Philip turning  towards Duval. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true! But for a long time I have had my suspicions that there is a second way  to that city, by the ca&ntilde;on road, of which I told you. It is by that way, to my  mind, that Pepe intended to go.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  mi amigo!&rdquo; said Rafael, triumphantly; &ldquo;but you quite forget. Pepe was captured  in the south, after the battle of Centeotl, and is now in prison at Tlatonac,  awaiting punishment.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true! He did not escape to Totatzine, as he intended. But where was he  captured? At the battle of Centeotl. Now, seeing that Don Hypolito has  disappeared, it is just possible that Pepe told him of the second secret way to  the sacred city, and that Xuarez may have escaped thence.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  exclaimed Rafael, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Think you, Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal, that  this dog is now at Totatzine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not sure, but it might be so. Ixtlilxochitli is his friend. There he would  be safe, and if at the battle of Centeotl Pepe told him of this southern way to  the city, when he saw that all was lost, he probably took advantage of the  information.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not find out if this is so, from Pepe?&rdquo; suggested Jack, when Tim ceased  speaking. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will tell nothing,&rdquo; replied Rafael, in disgust. &ldquo;This zambo is a mule for  obstinacy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  might try, at all events,&rdquo; said Philip, cheerfully. &ldquo;Where is Pepe, mi amigo?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the prison of the Palacio Nacional. If you think, Se&ntilde;ores, there is any chance  of getting information from the zambo, let us seek him now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  to-night?&rdquo; said Peter, looking at his watch, &ldquo;or rather this morning. It is two  o&rsquo;clock. You are all weary with the ball. Better wait till to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  exclaimed Rafael, throwing his heavy cloak over his shoulder. &ldquo;We will go now.  My father absolutely refuses to let any of us marry until we discover Xuarez. I  want to know where he is to be found at once, otherwise I shall get no rest. As  for you, se&ntilde;or&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will come, by all means,&rdquo; said Philip, putting on his sombrero. &ldquo;It is also to  my interest to find Xuarez, else I may not marry your sister, Rafael.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will all go!&rdquo; said Jack, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Tim, you may get some copy, and  make an article of it&mdash;&rsquo;The Confessions of a Spy.&rsquo; Peter, you can go to bed, as  this matter does not interest you in the least.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Peter, indignantly. &ldquo;I am as anxious as you are to see you  married, Jack. But with your permission, I shall go to bed, because I do not  think you&rsquo;ll get any information out of Pepe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  try, at all events,&rdquo; observed Philip, emphatically. &ldquo;I want to marry Eulalia.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I,&rdquo; said Juan, following his friends to the door, &ldquo;want to do three things,  none of which I can accomplish unless Pepe tells us of the secret way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the three things, Jack?&rdquo; asked Tim, curiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,  I want to marry Dolores. Second, I desire to save the life of Cocom, who is a  prisoner at Totatzine; and, third, I am anxious to obtain possession again of  the harlequin opal.&rdquo; </p>

    The Ca&ntilde;on Road</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">This  is a tropical forest,<br>
    Where myriad leaves forming a roof overhead, keep out the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effulgence of sunlight,<br>
    So that beneath is the region of shadows and dimness;<br>
    Yet in this spectral twilight rise cities, magnificent, lonely;<br>
    Built in the far-distant days of giants&mdash;great architects they!<br>
    Sky-piercing pyramids, plinth, and column, and capital.<br>
    Line upon line of pillars, that loom in the darkness eternal,<br>
    Staircases huge, vast halls, and temples majestical;<br>
    Now no longer receiving the throngs of worshippers holy,<br>
    Only the bat flits through the ruins; ravenous beasts now wander<br>
    Through street, and square, and palaces gorgeous.<br>
    Who built all these splendours? We know not who built them.<br>
    Yet do they loom in the twilight region of shadows,<br>
    Encircled by tropical forests.</p>
  <p>As  a rule, Dr. Grench was an early riser, and denied himself the luxurious  idleness of morning slumbers, but on this special occasion he did not wake at  his usual hour. The dancing of the previous night had proved too much for the  virtuous Peter, who always went to bed early, consequently he was very tired,  and by no means pleased at being awakened unexpectedly by Jack. Peter was in  the middle of a delightful dream, in which he was hunting unusually large  beetles. After a time, however, the beetles began to hunt Peter, and one,  having caught him, was shaking him severely. The shaking woke him up, and the  beetle changed to Jack, who was trying to pull Peter out of bed. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  matter?&rdquo; grumbled Peter vaguely, struggling into a sitting position. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  want to get up.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must,&rdquo; said Jack, serenely, &ldquo;or we shall start without you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Start?  what? where? when? Beetle-hunting?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter,  you are not awake! What do you mean by such delirious talk? Put on your  clothes, and come down to breakfast. We&rsquo;re all waiting.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  vanished, and Peter, wondering what was the matter, got out of bed with  manifest reluctance. A cold bath drove the fumes of sleep from his head, and  dressing rapidly, he repaired to the dining-room, where he found his friends  and Rafael making a hasty meal. Peter stared, and began to ask questions. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  what is&mdash;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  here&rsquo;s Peter,&rdquo; said Philip, looking up with a smile. &ldquo;Come on, sluggard, and  have something to eat. We are going to Cuavaca by train.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Train!&rdquo;  repeated the doctor, taking his seat. &ldquo;What train?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s  train, you idiot,&rdquo; said Tim, giving Peter a dig in the ribs. &ldquo;Your wits are  wandering!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think yours must be,&rdquo; retorted Peter, addressing the company collectively. &ldquo;What  is the meaning of this early rising?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are going to Cuavaca.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  heard of it.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you hear of it now,&rdquo; said Jack, crossly; &ldquo;how stupid you are, Peter. I will  explain: we saw Pepe, the zambo, last night, and on condition that his life is  spared, he has promised to guide us to the city of Totatzine by this second  secret way.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and Cuavaca?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cuavaca  is a town thirty miles inland. The railway line is laid down to that place, and  twenty miles beyond. We are taking a thousand troops to Cuavaca, and intend to  leave them there, while Pepe shows us the ca&ntilde;on road. Then we will lead them by  that way to Totatzine, save Cocom, take Xuarez prisoner, and secure the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  said Peter, argumentatively, &ldquo;is the end of your railway near this hidden city?  or does a trackless forest lie between the terminus and the ca&ntilde;on road?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  made a diagram on the tablecloth with knives and plates. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look,  Peter! This is Tlatonac. This Cuavaca. We go to the latter place by rail. From  Cuavaca the railway is constructed another twenty miles, and stops in the  middle of a vast forest. Here, according to Pepe, is Totatzine, sunken out of  sight in its hollow valley. Between the end of the railway and Totatzine is a  distance of twenty miles, more or less&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  tangled forest and brushwood!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort. Don&rsquo;t I tell you Pepe has promised to show us the secret way&mdash;the  other secret way? The entrance is from a ruined city, about a mile to the right  of the railway works. We find out that city, take our men from Cuavaca to it,  and thence march up the ca&ntilde;on road to Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  Don Juan!&rdquo; exclaimed Rafael, who had been looking at Jack&rsquo;s table-map. &ldquo;It  seems to me that if the railway goes on it will pass by and reveal this hidden  city.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  it. Had there been a chance of its doing so, we would have had trouble with the  Indians pulling up the rails. No, mi amigo. The line is surveyed a long  distance further on. If it turned to the right, it might certainly hit  Totatzine; but, as you see, it trends to the left, and if used for a century  could never reveal the existence of the sacred city. Ixtlilxochitli saw that,  and did not mind the railway passing, so to speak, by his door. The city is too  well hidden by its encircling mountains and by the windings of the ca&ntilde;on to be  discovered without special exploration.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it seems to me awfully stupid that the priests should take so much trouble over  the one secret way and never bother about the other.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  observation of Philip&rsquo;s seemed to strike Jack, and he reflected a few moments  before he replied. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  you say is very true, Philip,&rdquo; he replied slowly; &ldquo;the secret way leading to  the sea is very complicated, and even then the priests always blindfold  pilgrims on the platform. This other road, leading from the ruined city, must  be blocked up by rubbish, and what not. There is a wall across the entrance to  the ca&ntilde;on, but it is pierced by a gate always open. No one comes by the narrow  track, so I expect the entrance to that road has been choked up, and the way  fallen into disuse.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did Pepe find it out?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows! But the secret must be his alone else the priests would have destroyed  the ca&ntilde;on path leading to the pierced wall, and so cut off communication  entirely from that side of the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope Pepe is not leading us into an ambush,&rdquo; said Peter, anxiously, as they  arose to go. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he does, it will cost him his life,&rdquo; replied Philip, grimly. &ldquo;Pepe, my dear  doctor, marches before us with a pistol at his head. The first signs of  treachery, and he falls dead. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll risk that catastrophe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time Peter had concluded his breakfast, and they all set out to the Puerta  de la Culebra, near which, beyond the walls, was the railway station. On the  previous night Pepe, under promise of his life being spared, had admitted that  Don Hypolito had fled northward overland to Totatzine, gaining the city by the  inland secret way. This road Pepe promised to reveal on condition that the  President spared his life. Next morning, Rafael told his father of the offer,  and, as Don Miguel was anxious to capture Xuarez, he readily assented to the proposition  of the zambo. </p>
  <p>Of  course the six thousand Indians, who had been disbanded by the influence of the  opal, were not in the sacred city. Their villages were far to the north, near  Acauhtzin, and as they only came south to the festivals of the opal, by the  secret way of the sea, it was unlikely that the troops led by Rafael and Jack  would encounter any resistance. The forests where the railway ended, and where,  according to Pepe, the ca&ntilde;on road began, were singularly devoid of population.  This might have been caused by the jealousy of the priests, lest some wandering  Indians should find the entrance to the ca&ntilde;on road from the ruined city. If so,  this jealous suspicion caused their ruin; for, had the district been infested  with Indians, they, seeing an unusual concourse of soldiers at Cuavaca, would  at once have warned the priests of the intended invasion of Totatzine. Then the  ca&ntilde;on road could have been easily defended against the troops from Tlatonac by  a small body of defenders, and the disaster averted. As it was, however, the  inhabitants of the sacred city were entirely ignorant of their danger until the  foe was under their walls. </p>
  <p>The  railway line was completed as far as Cuavaca, a little inland village which  promised to shortly develop into a city, owing to its being the future starting  place, whence lines were to run north and south throughout the whole length of  Cholacaca. From the capital to this terminus extended a vast plain for over  thirty miles, so that there was no difficulty in laying the line, and it had  been speedily completed under the vigorous superintendence of Jack. There were  no engineering difficulties to be overcome, and the railway ran easily in a  straight line over the plains to the foot of the volcano Xicotencatl, where  Cuavaca was situated. From this point began a rugged and mountainous country,  which extended northward as far as Acauhtzin. Twenty miles of railway had been  constructed with great difficulty, as, owing to the configuration of the  country, the line was singularly curving and irregular. Bridges had to be built  across ca&ntilde;ons, tunnels had to be pierced through solid rock, and embankments,  faced with stone walls, constructed where the ground fell away rapidly to  moderately sized plains. The district was situated in the tierra templada,  about ten thousand feet above sea level; but, the grade constantly ascending as  the iron road went northward, it was calculated by Jack that the last portion  of the way would run some short distance below the snow line of the tierra  fri&aacute;. </p>
  <p>This  expedition to capture Totatzine was not without its dangers. It was the season  of festival and the sacred city would doubtless be filled with fanatical  worshippers, who would fiercely resist the attempted seizure of their shrines.  A thousand well-armed infantry were sent to Cuavaca by Don Miguel, and, leaving  these quartered in the village, Jack, with his three friends and Rafael, guided  by Pepe, went forward to search for the secret entrance. When this was found,  they intended to return and take the troops by railway twenty miles, and thence  lead them by the secret entrance up the ca&ntilde;on road. When this was done, a  reinforcement of another thousand soldiers was to arrive at Cuavaca, and await  instructions there, lest the first should fail to capture the city. The engines  running on the line from Cuavaca were singularly powerful machines, strongly  built, so as to ascend the gradient to the northward, and there were plenty of  trucks in which troops could be taken to the end of the railway. Jack also had a  few carriages shifted from the Cuavaca line to that running northward, so that  the whole body of soldiers now stationed at the little town could be conveyed  to the hoped-for entrance of the ca&ntilde;on road in a remarkably short space of  time. </p>
  <p>By  noon all the troops were quartered at Cuavaca, and then Jack started by the  northern line for the ca&ntilde;on road. He only took an engine with one carriage, so  as to travel as rapidly as possible. At first he wanted to go forward himself  with Pepe, but Philip would in no way consent to his doing this. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t trust that zambo, Jack,&rdquo; he said, decisively; &ldquo;he might take advantage of  your being alone, and knock you on the head.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely,  when I am armed and he is not. If only we two go, we can travel on the engine.  If you all come, I must fix on a carriage.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  that won&rsquo;t make much difference,&rdquo; retorted Philip, quickly. &ldquo;We are all keen on  the business, and want to see how matters turn out. Tim, Peter, Rafael, and  myself are all coming with you, Jack; so hitch on a carriage to your engine  right away.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  was accordingly done without further objection on the part of Duval, and they  left Cuavaca about one o&rsquo;clock, travelling rapidly so as to reach the terminus  with as little delay as possible. According to Pepe, it would take some hours  for them to discover the ruined city, and they did not expect to return before  six o&rsquo;clock. Then it would have to be decided whether they would take the  troops on to the ruined city at once, or wait till the next day. </p>
  <p>Cuavaca  was situate at the base of the great volcano Xicotencatl, which reared its  white peak high above the surrounding mountains. North and south stretched  ranges from the central point with summits more or less covered with snow, and  from Cuavaca began dense forests which clothed the slopes of these mighty  hills. Leaving the village by the side towards the north, the engine with its  solitary carriage ran through a moderately long tunnel piercing a high range of  hills, which shot outward at right angles from the principal mountains. From  thence it emerged on to a deep valley, and skirted the side of the hills in a  winding track cut out of the solid rock. Jack was on board the engine with the  driver, personally superintending the journey, and his three friends with Rafael  were admiring the view from the windows of the carriage. Pepe, guarded by two  soldiers, was seated at the end of the carriage, and looked anything but  cheerful under such surveillance. </p>
  <p>The  scenery was truly wonderful. Sliding along the side of the mountains, those in  the carriage looking out, saw not the line on which they were running, but  looked down eight or nine hundred feet into the depths below. Sometimes the  line was built of solid masonry clamped with iron, and it was anything but  pleasant to think how the train was clinging like a fly to the perpendicular  sides of the giant hills. Below swirled rapid torrents raging over black rocks,  or flowing in broad streams between flat mud-banks. The engine would proceed  along a level for some distance, then pant slowly up an ascending gradient;  suddenly turning a sharp curve, she would shoot breathlessly down a decline on  to a long narrow bridge thrown across a wide expanse of river bed intersected  by thin streams, which at time of rain joined their forces into one vast flood.  Owing to the infinite windings of the line, it was built on the narrow gauge  system, so as to permit the quick turning of curves, and when the engine,  leaning to one side, shot round these turnings, the sensation was anything but  pleasant. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a most wonderful line, so far as engineering goes,&rdquo; said Philip, drawing back  from the window with a sudden qualm, as the carriage rocked dangerously; &ldquo;but  it is devilishly unpleasant. If we went over!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  wouldn&rsquo;t be much of us left,&rdquo; said Tim grimly. &ldquo;Begad, Philip, I&rsquo;ve been in a  mighty lot of railway trains, but this line of Jack&rsquo;s beats Banagher, and  Banagher beats the devil.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santissima!&rdquo;  said Rafael, uneasily, &ldquo;I trust, Se&ntilde;ores this devil of an engine will not fall  over the cliff.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  never travel on this line for pleasure,&rdquo; cried Peter, who was seated on the  opposite side to the precipice for safety; &ldquo;nor do I think it will be much  patronised by people when opened.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sea for me,&rdquo; remarked Philip, thankfully; &ldquo;anything but being boxed up in this  place, with a chance of falling five or six thousand feet without hope of  getting out of the carriage.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>In  truth the journey was singularly unpleasant in many places. Jack had  constructed his line thoroughly well; but there was no denying that the sudden  turns, the unexpected descents, the narrow bridges, and the frequent tunnels,  were enough to shake the nerves of the strongest man. On all sides arose the  snow-clad peaks, far below ran rivers, spread forests, gaped ca&ntilde;ons and between  heaven and earth crawled the train, holding on to the sides of mountains. The  colours and lights sweeping over the scenery were exquisite, the landscape  below, above, was grand and impressive, but the four men in the carriage felt  somewhat nervous at this tremendous journey. In ordinary cases, they were brave  enough, and prepared for any emergency; but boxed up in this carriage they felt  helpless should an accident occur. As to Jack, he was used to such travelling,  and looked at his work with great pride. </p>
  <p>At  length the engine shot from a deep and narrow cutting into the depths of a  broad-spreading forest, clothing a deep valley. Through its centre ran a  torrent, and the line skirted this to the left, through dense woodland, towards  the high peaks of a mountain in the far distance. Midway in this valley the  engine slowed down, and ultimately stopped. Philip, looking out of the window,  saw a wide clearing, with upturned soil, fallen trees, and here and there huts  erected. It was the terminus of the railway; and, thankful to have arrived in  safety, they all jumped out on to the sward with alacrity. </p>
  <p>Beyond  this clearing appeared a track cut through the forest, trending in the  direction of the distant peaks, but the line stopped at the beginning of this  avenue. Scattered rails, piles of sleepers, the abrupt termination of the line,  showed that it went no further. Between this point and the unknown city of  Totatzine intervened a distance of twenty miles. The little party, with their  guns and revolvers all in order, stood looking around them at the unfinished  line. Pepe, guarded by the two soldiers, was sullen and watchful. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is Totatzine?&rdquo; said Rafael, staring round this wilderness of trees. </p>
  <p>Pepe  pointed to the north-east, beyond the peaks. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is there, Se&ntilde;or. In the hollow of the hills.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the buried city?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!  I will show it to you, Se&ntilde;ores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Pepe,&rdquo; said Jack, staying the zambo, as he turned off to the left, &ldquo;how  can you tell the way to this city from here?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  Se&ntilde;or Americano, I escaped from Totatzine to this place four months ago. I was  sent by Don Hypolito before the war to the priest Ixtlilxochitli, and he  detained me in the city. I could not find the secret way to the sea, and one  night went out through the wall on to the ca&ntilde;on road. It led me many miles  along the side of the cliffs, then down a staircase into a forest; at length,  Se&ntilde;ores, it took me through a tunnel. I had to climb over some rubbish of  stones and earth up another staircase, and found myself in a large city of  ruins. Leaving that, I pushed through the forest to the left, and came upon  this clearing, where I found the men of the Se&ntilde;or Americano at work. They took  me to Tlatonac, and there I remained till I went to Acauhtzin with Marina, as  the Se&ntilde;or knows.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you tell my men of your discovery of this way?&rdquo; asked Jack, abruptly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Se&ntilde;or Americano. I feared the vengeance of the priests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the railway at this point four months ago, Jack?&rdquo; asked Philip, looking round  at the clearing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  There was a possibility of war, and I was just going to England to get you to  come here. The works were left in the condition you now see them. If this zambo  escaped, as he says, he could easily have reached Tlatonac from this point.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bueno!&rdquo;  said Rafael, in a satisfied tone, &ldquo;thus far his story is true. Let us go  forward, amigos.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  made a sign to Pepe, who at once proceeded to walk towards the woods on the  left, guarded by the two soldiers. His escort was well armed, so the zambo did  not try to escape, knowing that before he could run a few yards he would have a  bullet in his skull. The rest of the party followed, keeping their revolvers  handy, in case of a possible surprise from Indians. They saw none, however, as  the forest was completely deserted by all humanity. Pepe pushed forward through  the brushwood, and they followed. In case they should lose their way, they  blazed the trees with the hatchets with which they had taken care to provide  themselves. Jack was resolved not to trust the zambo too far. </p>
  <p>For  about a mile they proceeded through a comparatively well-defined track in a  north-western direction, then suddenly turned so as to face the distant peaks  some fifteen miles away. This new path gradually broadened out into a wide  avenue, and at the end of three miles, buildings, and ruins of walls began to  make their appearance in a scattered fashion. At length, at the conclusion of  another mile, they entered a paved road, adorned on either side by statues of  Aztec deities, similar to those on the platform facing the sea. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot believe that this city is unknown,&rdquo; said Jack to Philip, as they marched  on abreast behind Pepe and his guards. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? No one would suspect its existence from the railway clearing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  that is true! But occasionally there must be some tribes of Indians about here,  and they would be sure to hit upon it. Between the clearing and the beginning  of this broad road it is but four miles, and the tracks seemed pretty well  defined&mdash;clear enough at all events, to guide anyone hither. Once in this  avenue, and it is easy to strike the city&mdash;as now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They  had emerged suddenly into a vast space, built over with mansions, palaces,  temples, and mighty walls. A pyramid of earth, surmounted by a ruined teocalli,  was placed in the centre of the city and the wide streets shot off from this  omphalos in a similar way to those of Totatzine. In fact, on exploring the city  thoroughly, Jack came to the conclusion that those who had built Totatzine had  also constructed this place. The plan was precisely the same, and, judging from  the massive buildings, the carven fa&ccedil;ades of the walls, the broad terraces, and  the enormous flights of steps, it must have been a populous place of some  importance. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Judging  from what we see, I think it must be a royal city,&rdquo; said Philip, looking  awestruck at these colossal works of the dead. &ldquo;Here, perchance, the king had  his seat, and the secret way was constructed from this place to the sacred city  of Totatzine, where the god Huitzilopochtli had his shrine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events, I have no doubt that this city is well known to the Indians of the  present day,&rdquo; replied Jack, decisively; &ldquo;though doubtless the entrance to the  ca&ntilde;on road, choked up by rubbish, has escaped their notice. Did they know of  its existence, Ixtlilxochitli would have closed up the narrow track leading  round the precipice into the interior wall.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was now between four and five o&rsquo;clock, so they had not much time to lose if  they desired to find the entrance before sunset. The engine, in charge of the  driver, had been left in the clearing, Jack judging it would be quite safe  there, as no Indians seemed to be in the vicinity. They had brought provisions  with them, and if it was necessary, could camp out in the clearing till dawn,  when they could go back to Cuavaca to bring the troops. </p>
  <p>Pepe  marched forward into the central square, and then led them towards the extreme  end of the city. Here a surprise awaited them, for they found that the town was  built against a vast cliff, some eighty or ninety feet in height. A lengthy  temple, reached by a flight of steps, was cut out of the solid rock, with  ranges of pillars massive in the design and architecture. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;  cried Philip, in amazement, as he surveyed the Cyclopean ruins; &ldquo;these temples  are like those of Petra. What great men must they have been who built such  shrines! A great civilisation once flourished here, Jack.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt,&rdquo; said Tim, who was much impressed by these grand remains; &ldquo;these  Toltecs, or whatever you call them, were greater than the Aztecs. Cortes, to my  mind, found a vastly inferior civilisation than had been when these cities were  built.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo,  Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal!&rdquo; cried Rafael, overhearing his remarks; &ldquo;we have nothing  like this in Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  are likely to have,&rdquo; said Peter, dryly; &ldquo;the Toltecs were greater builders than  the Spaniards.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Guided  by Pepe, they entered into this rock-hewn temple, and found themselves in a  vast hall. At the back of the shrine, now unoccupied by any idol, appeared a  ruined archway choked up with rubbish. The explorers had taken the precaution  of bringing torches with them, knowing there was a tunnel to be gone through.  From this entrance, as Pepe informed them, it was fifteen miles to the hidden  city of Totatzine. Lighting the torches, they climbed over the rubbish and  fallen stones heaped in front of the archway, and began to ascend an immense  staircase. Jack and Philip went first of all, followed by Pepe and his guards,  after whom came the three remaining members of the party. </p>
  <p>Up  this staircase they ascended, and, at length emerging into the light of day,  found themselves on a vast plateau, thickly covered with forests. A well-paved  road, still gently ascending, stretched through these woods into the infinite  distance. It was overgrown with brushwood and giant trees; still they found no  difficulty in getting along, owing to the admirable way in which the stone  blocks had been laid. This road ran for five miles, and then suddenly  disappeared down a shallow flight of steps, under a low archway. Here Pepe stopped,  and pointed downward. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  steps, Se&ntilde;or Americano,&rdquo; he said, addressing Jack, &ldquo;lead down for a quarter of  a mile, then along a tunnel for three-quarters of a mile. It brings you out on  to the bed of the torrent flowing through the ca&ntilde;on. The narrow path leads from  its mouth for nine miles to the pierced wall. When there, you are just below  the walls of Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  and his friends held a consultation as to the wisdom of proceeding further that  night. The darkness was coming on, and it would be as well to get back to the  clearing before the night. There they could camp out, and return to Cuavaca for  the troops at dawn. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  my part,&rdquo; said Philip, quietly, &ldquo;I do not think we need explore further on our  own account. Pepe has spoken truly up to the present, and without doubt this  tunnel leads to the torrent of the ca&ntilde;on and the narrow path, as he describes.  Let us return to the clearing, go back to Cuavaca, and bring on the troops.  They can camp in the ruined city to-morrow night, and next morning can march to  Totatzine.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  rest of the party agreed to this plan, and, leaving the shallow tunnel at the  foot of the protecting range of the Totatzine mountains, they returned to the  camp. Now that he had shown them the way, Pepe wanted to be set free; but this  the whole party unanimously refused to do. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, my friend,&rdquo; said Rafael, making himself the mouthpiece of the others, &ldquo;you  may warn the Indians we are coming. Till Totatzine be taken by our troops, you  are a prisoner.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Pepe  was forced to abide by this decision, and composed himself to sleep in the  clearing, watched vigilantly by his guards, who, knowing that his escape might  bring the savages on them, kept a keen eye on his slumbers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;  said Jack, as they turned in, &ldquo;we will return to Cuavaca for the troops, and  before nightfall they shall camp in the ruined city.&rdquo; </p>

    The Destiny Of The Opal</b></h2>

    The terrible spirit of fire.</p>
  <p>There  were many Indians in Cuavaca, and had these entertained any suspicion that  there was a second secret way to the sacred city by the ca&ntilde;on road, they would  have at once warned Ixtlilxochitli of the impending danger to the Chalchuih  Tlatonac. As it was, however, they could not conceive the reason of the troops  leaving Cuavaca for the interior of the country. From their wanderings in that  district, they knew perfectly well that the line stopped suddenly in the midst  of a dense forest, and there appeared to be no reason that soldiers should be  sent thither. The generally received opinion among them was, that as the  Indians of the north had been on the war-trail, these soldiers were sent up by  the Government to punish such rebellion. With this idea, the peons of Cuavaca  took no heed of the expedition, knowing that it would be impossible for  civilised troops to discover their brethren in the vast forests among the  rugged mountains. </p>
  <p>Thus,  when next day at noon the explorers returned to lead the soldiers to the buried  city, none of the Indians suspected the truth. Indeed, the troops themselves  were in absolute ignorance as to their destination, as Rafael, thinking the  Indians of Cuavaca might learn too much, ordered the soldiers to blindly obey his  orders, and not question as to where they were going. Thus he hoped to camp a  thousand men that night within the streets of the ruined city, and surprise  Totatzine by dawn, when the priests and the populace would be engaged in  worshipping the opal. The wall towards the ca&ntilde;on would be quite undefended, as  never within the memory of the priests had anyone come into this city from that  direction. Ixtlilxochitli thought that the way was quite blocked up, and never  for a moment deemed that his bitterest foes would capture the city from the  ca&ntilde;on road. </p>
  <p>All  that day the trains went back and forward between Cuavaca and the clearing,  taking troops into the interior of the country. So soon as they arrived at the  railway terminus, they were marched off through the woods to the buried city,  and there ordered to camp for the night, or at least till such time as their  leaders chose to guide them forward. By sunset a thousand well-armed,  well-disciplined troops were bestowed in the ruined city of the Toltecs, within  fifteen miles of the opal shrine, and yet not a soul, save the leaders, knew  that this was the case. </p>
  <p>The  troops having been brought thus far, Rafael, as leader of the expedition, held  a council of war as to the advisability of remaining there for the night, or  pushing on to the narrow path of the ca&ntilde;on so as to surprise the inhabitants of  Totatzine by dawn. Jack and Tim were strongly in favour of marching at once,  and as Philip afterwards came round to this opinion, Rafael almost made up his  mind to move forward without delay. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  here to the ca&ntilde;on torrent it is mostly tunnels,&rdquo; urged Jack, persuasively; &ldquo;so  whether we go by day or night it does not matter, as we must carry torches. We  can easily march along that road on the plateau between the two tunnels, and  when we enter the last one, can arrive at the bed of the torrent about  midnight. Let us camp there with as many men as possible, and then march along  the narrow path at the first glimpse of daylight. Thus we will be able to  assemble on the platform under the pierced wall while the populace and priests  are in the great square of the teocalli. They will be unprepared, and we can  capture the city without almost a blow.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they will be equally unprepared during the day,&rdquo; said Rafael, with some  hesitation, &ldquo;so why not wait here till dawn?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will not be unprepared during the day,&rdquo; replied Jack, decisively, &ldquo;that pierced  wall has people on it occasionally. Sometimes they come out on to the platform  overlooking the torrent. If these saw our soldiers coming two abreast along the  narrow path they would give the alarm, and the defenders of the city could kill  our advance guard and block up the road. Now, if we can get five or six hundred  on to the platform by sunrise, they can keep the populace at bay until the rest  of our men arrive, then the city will be easily taken.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  two men can walk abreast on the path?&rdquo; asked Philip, dubiously. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a matter of fact, three can walk abreast, but it is safer with two. The path is  cut out of the side of the ca&ntilde;on, and is very dangerous. It must be attempted  by daylight. Nine miles of narrow path in the dark would end in our losing our  men. Besides, who knows but what that infernal Ixtlilxochitli, to make things  quite safe, may not have destroyed portions of the path?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he&rsquo;s done that, there won&rsquo;t be much chance of our taking the city,&rdquo; said Tim,  in disgust. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  Se&ntilde;or Correspo&ntilde;sal,&rdquo; replied Rafael, gravely; &ldquo;all things considering, I think  it will be best to take Don Juan&rsquo;s advice, and march two or three hundred men  to the torrent camping-ground to-night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>This  plan being adopted, the council broke up at once. It was decided that Jack and  Rafael should push on with three hundred men guided by Pepe. These were to camp  at the entrance of the tunnel where it led to the narrow path by the torrent.  At dawn the remaining seven hundred men, under the leadership of Philip, Tim,  and Captain Martez, should follow, and by the time they arrived at the torrent  camping-ground, the advance troop would have reached the platform under the  pierced wall, which they could hold till the reinforcements arrived. As a  matter of fact, Jack and Rafael hoped to have the full strength of their men on  the platform and in the city before the inhabitants took the alarm; but, in any  event, three hundred could hold the narrow path entrance to the platform while  the rear came up steadily. Having settled these important details, they all  made a hearty meal, and, after bidding their friends an affectionate farewell,  Jack and Rafael, with their little band, pushed forward. </p>
  <p>The  men now knew that their destination was Totatzine, and so many rumours were  current in Cholacaca over the amount of treasure concealed in this sacred city  that they were madly desirous of getting to the town. Without hesitation they  followed Don Rafael and the Englishman up the grand staircase, from the  entrance whence all rubbish had been cleared away. On arriving at the top, they  saw the broad paved road stretching straight before them in the semi-darkness,  and still keeping their torches lighted to guide them on their way, marched  steadily along the five miles until they arrived at the foot of the great  peaks. Here was the shallow tunnel, also choked up by rubbish. This was  speedily cleared away by a hundred willing hands, and then the leaders making  Pepe go down into the darkness between his guards, followed with their men. The  zambo made no attempt to escape, as now seeing the power of the Junta, and  knowing that his life was safe, he had quite gone over to the side of Don Hypolito&rsquo;s  enemies. </p>
  <p>The  staircase led downward into the bowels of the earth for over a quarter of a  mile, then suddenly admitted them into a vast gallery through which the air  blew keenly. Jack was unable to restrain his admiration at the mechanical skill  which the Toltecs&mdash;if they had been the engineers&mdash;displayed in thus piercing  these vast tunnels through the solid rock. The red glare of the torches showed  them that the sides were cased in brick painted with images of the gods, and  the path under their feet was smoothly paved with stonework, worn by the feet  of countless generations. To accomplish such marvels, these long-dead nations  must have possessed wonderful engineering capabilities, and employed thousands  and thousands of slaves. The latter might have been taken in war, and forced to  labour at these colossal works, but where the Toltecs learned engineering was  more than Jack could discover. </p>
  <p>The  tunnel was only a mile long, and in a short space of time they emerged on to a  vast natural platform at the very bottom of the ca&ntilde;on. To the left, looking  from the tunnel, the great gap ended at the distance of a quarter of a mile,  and through the opening they could see the flat extent of plains, and the  distant pinnacles of mountains. On the right the ca&ntilde;on turned suddenly to one  side, and they saw themselves shut in, so to speak, by vast rocky walls  towering up to the height of some thousands of feet. The torrent gushed and  raged a little distance below the natural terrace, and on one side of it arose  a narrow flight of steps leading to the path which ended at the sacred city  itself. </p>
  <p>So  difficult had been the way that it was now nearly midnight, so the wearied  troops camped on the terrace, and made a meal as best they could. There was but  little chance of their presence being discovered by any human being in that  desolate ca&ntilde;on, but Rafael, judging it best to be on the safe side, forbade  them to light fires. Fortunately the night was warm, every man possessed a  zarape, and they slept in comparative comfort. </p>
  <p>It  was a critical period, as discovery by any wandering Indian meant death to the  whole band in that narrow gulch; but, to Rafael&rsquo;s relief, the dawn broke  showing not a human being to be in sight. They saw the narrow path winding like  a thread along the rocks in the distance, and it looked a dangerous way to go.  It was, however, the only way to the city, and once they arrived under the  pierced wall, they could keep the path open for their reinforcements to follow. </p>
  <p>Jack  made the men eat a hearty meal before starting, and would liked to have made  them drink hot coffee, but that there was a risk in lighting fires. At the  first faint light of morning, which was about six o&rsquo;clock, the men having  finished their meal, looked to their rifles and ammunition, flung their zarapes  round their shoulders, and prepared to ascend the narrow staircase. </p>
  <p>Still  keeping Pepe before all as guide, lest he should send them forward into some  unknown danger, the two young men mounted to the path, and in the space of an  hour the whole company were winding along two abreast. Below they looked down  thousands of feet, above the cliffs arose stern and precipitous, but the path,  though narrow, was well-made and safe, so, two by two, they marched forward in  silence. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a couple of hours the rest of the troops will reach the torrent,&rdquo; said Jack to  Rafael, as they walked along; &ldquo;and by the time we gain the pierced wall, they  will not be far behind.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once  we are on the platform you speak of, I do not care, Juan,&rdquo; replied Rafael,  grimly; &ldquo;but I hope by all the saints the Indians will not see us before we can  get off this path. They could cut us off with the greatest of ease.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  fear,&rdquo; said Duval, casting an anxious look at the sky, still cold and grey; &ldquo;at  sunrise they will all be in the great square worshipping the opal. Totatzine,  you know, Rafael, is a sacred city, and it is death for any inhabitant to  remain away from the morning sacrifice. That is how the priests keep their hold  on the people.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the women?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  will be present also.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must be a large plaza,&rdquo; said Rafael, disbelievingly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  large. Much larger than the Plaza de los Hombres Ilustres at Tlatonac.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!  What clever people those Toltecs must have been.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>As  they proceeded, the ca&ntilde;on wound to right and left, shutting itself in at every  curve with its own walls, so that they never saw more than a short distance  before them. Jack feared lest the path should suddenly come to an end behind  one of the curves; but as Pepe, who knew the way, marched boldly on, this did  not seem possible. The grey sky began to flash crimson, and the stars to the  eastward died out in the rosy hues of dawn. They could see the torrent far  below like a white thread, and hear its voice, hoarse and incessant, rising  upward. The serrated summits of the ca&ntilde;on rocks loomed black against the  changing sky. </p>
  <p>On,  on, and on. The road never seemed to come to an end, but stretched ever before  them narrow and perilous-looking, a hanging-way between heaven and earth. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope to the Lord none of the men will grow dizzy, and fall over,&rdquo; said Jack,  anxiously; &ldquo;the path is so narrow, the depth so terrible.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  fear of that, mi amigo,&rdquo; replied Rafael, cheerfully; &ldquo;they are all too  determined to get gold and silver in Totatzine to lose the chance of not arriving  there. Believe me, Juan, they are as anxious as we are to get to the end of  this infernal path. By the way, Martez and Se&ntilde;or Felipe must be on it by now,  with their men.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  glanced at his watch. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  we have been over two hours now, marching. I expect Martez will press onward as  quickly as possible, so as to join us without delay. Hullo!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw a glimpse of green just now. We are nearly at the end of the journey.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  word passed along the narrow line of men, and they grasped their rifles  tighter, with fierce joy at the thought that they would soon be in the heart of  the golden city, so famous throughout Cholacaca. The path began to slope  downward gently. It turned round a corner sharply, and lo! before them, Jack and  his friend saw the sacred town, sparkling like a jewel, in the hollow of the  green valley. A wall, glistening like silver, stretched along the whole front  of the ca&ntilde;on, and before this was a broad stone platform, on which a thousand  men could assemble with ease. Below was the torrent, and on this side of the  rocks was a narrow path, ending abruptly in a precipice. Jack pointed out this  latter to Rafael. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you see that, my friend?&rdquo; he said, slowly; &ldquo;it leads from the secret entrance  to the other path below the bridge, in the centre of the town. If you took that  way, you would fall into the torrent, and be lost for ever.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dios!&rdquo;  said Rafael, awestruck, &ldquo;what devils are these priests.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  platform and wall were absolutely deserted. The gates were wide open, and  through the vast arch-way they could see into the streets of the town. A rosy  flame, with yellow shafts, appeared behind the arid peaks of the east, and loud  and shrill the invaders heard the sacred hymn, saluting the rising luminary.  For centuries that song had not been heard by the white man&mdash;not since Montezuma&rsquo;s  altars had ceased to smoke had civilised beings seen what they now saw. A vast  pyramid in the centre of the city, crowned with a silver temple, and dotted at  the summit with tiny figures invoking the gods. It was the last time that song  would ever rise; the last time the sun would be saluted with bleeding victims  and rolling incense; for the last stronghold of the Aztec deities was  discovered. The waves of advancing civilisation were about to roll over this  primeval city, and blot it and its fierce deities out for ever. </p>
  <p>Silently,  with anxious hearts, the little band turning the last corner of the path,  stepped downward on to the platform. When Jack found himself there, he breathed  a sigh of relief. Even though the Indians found them now, they could not stop  them in their onward course. His men poured on to the platform, fell into line  silently, and thus established a defence at the mouth of the narrow path, while  their comrades rapidly came onward to their assistance. The city was as good as  won. But Xuarez&mdash; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must take care that Don Hypolito does not escape, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Rafael,  anxiously, as the troops massed themselves under the pierced wall. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  that to me, Rafael. I have an account to settle with Xuarez. He shall not  escape me.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  we attack the city at once?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. It will be as well to get inside the walls, lest we should be  discovered and the gates closed. Leave fifty men on the platform, mi amigo, so  as to hold it open for the reinforcements, then we can penetrate into the town.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Making  for what point?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  great square. We must capture the bridges, and so hold the people who are now  worshipping on one side of the city. They shall thus not be able to get their  weapons.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  reinforcements will arrive shortly.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  about an hour, I fancy. I told Martez to march as rapidly as possible, and I  have no doubt he is pushing on with all speed. Come, then, Rafael! Let us march  into the city, and don&rsquo;t forget to seize Xuarez and the opal! Also we must  rescue Cocom.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Ixtlilxochitli?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  throw him into the torrent,&rdquo; said Jack, savagely; &ldquo;he was going to offer me up  to that infernal deity of his. I believe he is making a sacrifice now.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it&rsquo;s Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so! We will be spared the trouble of shooting him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>By  this time the full number of men had arrived on the terrace, and leaving fifty  men to guard the path, Jack, in company with Rafael, pushed forward through the  gate into the city. No sooner had they got inside, and were marching down the  street leading to the principal bridge, than some women saw them. Thunderstruck  at their appearance, these paused, and then began to yell loudly. Rafael sent  forward some soldiers to seize them, but they disappeared, running in the  direction of the great square. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carajo!&rdquo;  muttered Maraquando, savagely; &ldquo;they will alarm the town. Forward, men! Keep  close together. Se&ntilde;or Duval, take fifty men, and hold the lower bridge. I, with  one hundred, will keep the middle one, and you, Se&ntilde;or Riconada, can hold the  bridge near the wall with the rest of our forces. Thus we will be able to keep  all the Indians in the square till the arrival of our friends.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  and Riconada hastened to obey these orders and blockaded the three bridges.  Scarcely had they established themselves when the serpent-skin drums on the  summit of the teocalli began to roll out the alarm. Frantic with rage and  astonishment, the worshippers streamed towards the three bridges so as to repel  the daring foes. No one could understand how these invaders had entered the  city, and Ixtlilxochitli smitten with fear, called on the children of  Huitzilopochtli to defend their god. The crowd pouring towards the bridges were  driven back by the soldiers, and as they were without weapons, owing to having  gone to the square for sacrifical purposes, they could do nothing.  Ixtlilxochitli was equal to the occasion, and from some secret store produced  shields and spears, bows and arrows, and swords of obsidian. The drums rolled,  the trumpets shrilled, and the priests on the platform of the teocalli  frantically invoked the god, while those whom they had aroused desperately  attempted to force the bridges. </p>
  <p>A  feeling of superstitious terror was in the breasts of the Indians. These  terrible white men, whom no obstacle seemed to hinder, had entered Totatzine as  though by magic. How they had evaded the spies and overcome the difficulties of  the secret way none knew, much less how they had discovered the passage. No one  thought of the ca&ntilde;on road, not even Ixtlilxochitli, who never dreamed of danger  from that quarter. All the inhabitants of Totatzine knew was that their worst  foes were in the heart of their sacred city, and that, unless they drove them  forth at once, the Shrine of the Opal would be lost for ever. </p>
  <p>Flights  of arrows fell round the soldiers holding the three bridges, and many were  killed, as they had no shields with which to protect themselves. On the other  hand, the round bucklers held up by the savages were no hindrance to the  bullets of the invaders, and as the soldiers kept up a steady fire into the  dense mass of worshippers, the ground was soon cumbered with the dead and  dying. </p>
  <p>Jack  in vain looked for Xuarez, but could see no sign of him. On the summit of the  teocalli he saw a vast crowd of priests crying on the war-god to defend his  shrine, and thought for a moment, as the black mass parted, that a man was  lying on the stone of sacrifice. But the next instant the throng closed  together again, and he was forced to give his attention to the task of  defending the causeway. His soul revolted against this butchery, and he ordered  his soldiers to deal as gently as possible with the comparatively defenceless  enemy. Nevertheless, he knew that the safety of himself and his friends  depended on keeping the Indians blockaded until the reinforcements arrived, and  was forced to massacre the crowds which hurled themselves with fanatical  devotion against his men. </p>
  <p>Owing  to the depth of the torrent, there was no way of crossing it save by the  bridges, and these being held by the invaders, it was impossible for the  Indians to fight to any advantage. Wave after wave rolled across the narrow  bridges, and midway were repelled by the incessant fire of the Tlatonacians.  The spears and arrows of the Indians did deadly work, and the centre of the  causeways were soon filled with corpses, white men and red men mingled  promiscuously together. Jack saw plainly that the three bridges could be held  by them for hours, yet wished from his soul that Martez and Philip would come  up with the reinforcements, if only to put a stop to this wholesale massacre. </p>
  <p>Thousands  of Indians were pent up in the square of the sacrifice, all arrayed in festal  robes of white with chaplets of flowers. These latter were now torn off and  cast underfoot, the white garments were spotted with blood&mdash;the blood of their  friends&mdash;and, frantic with rage, the multitude did all that valour could do to  break through the handful of men holding the bridges. The drums were rolling  their thunder incessantly, the trumpets shrieked like human beings, priests  bellowed, the worshippers yelled, and constantly could be heard the ominous  cracking of the rifles, as every shot carried death into the white mass heaving  tumultuously in the square. </p>
  <p>All  at once a trumpet beyond the walls rang out clear and thin. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  cried Jack, waving his sword, &ldquo;the reinforcements at last.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was indeed the seven hundred men, who had arrived sooner than was expected.  Martez, anxious to aid his leader as speedily as possible, had marched his men  rapidly along the narrow path, and now they were steadily streaming through the  gate, making for the several bridges where the fight seemed hottest. As the  priests were shouting down encouragements to the people below, Rafael decided  to attack the teocalli, and stop this work. Once the shrine was taken, and it  was possible the Indians might yield without further trouble, a thing he  heartily desired, as, like Jack, he was weary of this massacre. </p>
  <p>Tim  and Martez stayed with Don Rafael, while Philip joined Jack, and Peter, who was  quite war-like in appearance, went to the town bridge, where Riconada was  fighting. At a given signal, all three bodies of soldiers commenced to converge  towards a single point, that being the teocalli. The priests saw this man&oelig;uvre,  and bellowed with fear. Many threw themselves down the steep sides of the  pyramid, in vain offering themselves to the war-god in the hope that he would  decree victory to their fellow-countrymen. The women in the square were  shrieking wildly, and hurling stones, wrenched from the houses, at the soldiers  as they pushed the mass of men steadily before them. From the summit of the  pyramid a cloud of incense rolled heavenward, and Ixtlilxochitli, in the red  robe of sacrifice, stepped forward to the verge of the steps, holding up the  opal in order to encourage his people. </p>
  <p>A  yell arose from friend and foe alike as they saw the glint of the stone, and  the Indians closed resolutely round the base of the teocalli in a vain attempt  to prevent the enemy from taking it by storm. All their valour and  self-sacrifice was in vain. The three compact bodies of men pushed forward,  shoulder to shoulder, through the white mass, leaving behind three several  streaks of red and yellow, the uniformed bodies of their fellow-countrymen.  Ixtlilxochitli saw these rivers of fierce soldiery converge towards the  staircase of the teocalli, and yelling aloud to Huitzilopochtli, flashed the  opal incessantly in the sun. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is Xuarez!&rdquo; panted Philip, in the ear of Jack, as they cut their way onward. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Ixtlilxochitli. That chap in red. He is bound. By Jove, Jack, I believe the old  fiend meant to sacrifice him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity  he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Jack, grimly; &ldquo;look out Philip. Ah, there is Tim. Hurrah, Tim!  See which of us will reach the staircase first.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Even  in the midst of danger, Jack could not help joking, and Tim burst out laughing  as he hurled his huge form by Rafael through the crowd. </p>
  <p>All  at once their mirth ended. At the foot of the teocalli they stumbled over a  nude corpse with a ragged wound in the breast. It was the body of Cocom. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has been sacrificed,&rdquo; cried Jack, fiercely. &ldquo;Forward men! Avenge his death.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  advancing troops cheered loudly, and pressed steadily on towards the great pyramid. </p>
  <p>The  soldiers in the other part of the city had set fire to the dwellings, and  already the flames were rising heavenward. Mad with rage, the Indians fought on  doggedly, but could do nothing against the discipline of regular troops; inch  by inch they gave way before the line of steel pressed against their breasts.  The invaders stepped over corpses on their way to the teocalli, and those lying  on the ground not yet dead, twining their arms round the legs of their foes,  strove to throw them. The noise was something deafening, and the whole square  was one vast field of carnage. </p>
  <p>Jack  and Rafael, with their respective troops, reached the foot of the staircase at  the same time, and began to climb up. The priests, frantic with terror, threw  down huge stones, tore the tiles off the shrine, and hurled them viciously at  their foes. The drum was still beating, the incense rolling, and high above the  din could be heard the strident voice of the old high-priest calling on his  gods. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!  Rafael! keep your eye on Xuarez; he is free,&rdquo; replied Philip, as they fought  their way upward. </p>
  <p>Such,  indeed, was the case. Don Hypolito had managed to get his hands free, and was  now struggling with Ixtlilxochitli. Why he did so, none of the Englishmen could  make out, unless it was to kill the old man for trying to sacrifice him to  Huitzilopochtli. The attendant priests closed round the struggling figures to  help their head, and thus omitting to defend the teocalli, in a few moments the  assailants were on the top. </p>
  <p>Jack  sprang up first on to the platform, closely followed by Tim. The crowd of  priests rolled on either side, rolled over the sides of the pyramid, falling  into the frantic mass below. Then they saw the design of Xuarez. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Catch  him Tim; he has the opal!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Xuarez,  with torn clothing and pale, blood-stained face, stood against the shrine with  the opal flashing in one hand and a spear in the other. Jack dashed forward to  seize him, and Xuarez, with a yell of rage, hurled the spear. In a second Tim  had thrown himself between the weapon and Jack, receiving it full in his  breast. He fell back with a cry into Philip&rsquo;s arms, and Jack, mad with anger at  his friend&rsquo;s disaster, flung himself forward on Xuarez. The rebel leader dashed  to one side, and threw himself over the smooth side of the pyramid, sliding  downward on his back. Jack, with his revolver firmly grasped in his right hand,  followed in the same way; but before he reached the ground a red mass shot  rapidly past him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ixtlilxochitli.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The  rebel leader, holding the opal on high, dashed through the crowd of Indians,  who opened a path before the sacred gem, followed closely by the red figure of  the high priest. Jack saw the idea Xuarez had in his head. He was making for  the secret way under the bridge, hoping to escape to the mountains with his  booty. At once he followed the flying figures, but the crowd closed around him,  and he had much to do to protect himself. Martez saw his danger and sent a body  of soldiers to his assistance. In a few minutes, he was safe on the bridge  surrounded by his friends. Xuarez and Ixtlilxochitli had disappeared through  the secret entrance. </p>
  <p>Determined  to revenge the wound of Tim and secure the opal, Jack would have followed, when  he heard a hundred voices on the platform beyond the pierced wall shout out the  name of Xuarez. Wondering the reason of this, he darted up the street, followed  by a few troops, and on gaining the platform, looked over to where the soldiers  were pointing. </p>
  <p>On  the rocky ledge below, he saw two men struggling for the possession of the  opal. Xuarez, hotly pursued by the old priest, had taken the wrong turning  below the bridge, and they were now reeling on the verge of destruction. Nearer  and nearer they came to the brink, then Xuarez, evidently seeing he was lost,  threw the harlequin opal into the torrent. The great gem described a curve in  the air, flashed rainbow hues in the sunlight, then dropped sheer into the  boiling torrent below&mdash;lost for ever to the world. In another second,  Ixtlilxochitli had forced Xuarez over the ledge, and the two men, locked in one  another&rsquo;s arms, shared the fate of the gem. </p>
  <p>Jack  stood on the edge of the platform, looking in silent horror at the fate of the  rebel leader, when he heard his name cried out loudly, and turned to see Peter  hurrying towards him with a face of horror. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!  Jack! Tim!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tim!&rdquo;  echoed Jack, with a pang of fear, &ldquo;is he wounded?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is dead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  waited to hear no more, but, followed by Peter, raced back to the teocalli.  With the fall of the shrine had fallen the city, and Jack, crossing the square  untouched, ran up the staircase rapidly. There, on the summit, supported in  Philip&rsquo;s arms, with Philip&rsquo;s tears dropping on his dead face, lay Tim,  merry-hearted Tim, whom they all loved so truly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Tim!&rdquo; cried Jack, with a burst of anguish, and fell on his knees beside the  dead body. </p>
  <p>Below  the tumult continued, the incense still rolled upward; but the last sacrifice  had taken place in the teocalli of Totatzine, and Tim was the victim. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXXVII"></a>Chapter XXXVII<br>
    Farewell, Tlatonac</b></h2>
  <p class="poem">Let  us sail eastward, where the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow rises o&rsquo;er the crimson wave,<br>
  Our western toils at last are done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rest, for ever, rest we crave.</p>
  <p class="poem">Oh,  see the shore fades far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dim spot in the distant blue,<br>
  And eastward breaks the coming day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which bids our life-day dawn anew.</p>
  <p class="poem">Old  times are at an end,&mdash;our lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have had their share of sighs and tears;<br>
  Now, loyal friends, with loving wives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hopeful look to coming years.</p>
  <p>A  cheer arose from the crowd at the sea-gate, the warships dipped their flags in  salutation, the guns thundered from the forts, and <i>The Bohemian</i> steamed  slowly out of Tlatonac Harbour. At her mainmast fluttered the Union Jack, over  her stern drooped the Opal flag, for the daughter and niece of His Excellency  Don Miguel Maraquando were on board, on their way to England, with their  husbands, Sir Philip Cassim and Jack Duval. That same day had they been married  by Padre Ignatius, and were now departing for the honeymoon, therefore did the  guns thunder, the people cheer, the flags dip. </p>
  <p>Six  weeks had elapsed since the fall of Totatzine, since the death of poor Tim, and  many events had taken place during that interval. When the teocalli was  captured and the priests slain, the Indians, deprived at one blow of gods and  leaders, yielded in despair to their conquerors. Don Hypolito dead, Cocom  sacrificed, the opal lost, nothing more could be obtained from the town, so  Rafael withdrew his troops by the ca&ntilde;on road, and returned to announce to the  Junta that they need no more fear the restless ambition of Xuarez. </p>
  <p>Poor  Tim&rsquo;s body was taken back to Tlatonac by his sorrowing friends. For a long time  they could scarcely believe that he was dead. Tim, who was so light-hearted and  full of spirits; but alas! there was no doubt that he had died almost  instantaneously on the platform of the teocalli. The spear, thrown with  vigorous hate by Xuarez, and intended for the breast of Jack, had dealt a fatal  wound, and Tim had but time to grasp Philip&rsquo;s hand in faint farewell before he  passed away. The three survivors were wild with grief at this loss, so cruel,  so unexpected, and reverentially carried the body of their old schoolfellow to  the capital for burial. In view of Tim&rsquo;s services during the war, and the  regard entertained for him by the Cholacacans one and all, the Junta decreed a  public funeral to the remains; so Tim&rsquo;s body, with much pomp, was consigned to  the vaults of the cathedral, amid the firing of cannon, the knolling of bells. </p>
  <p>It  was some weeks before the three Englishmen could recover sufficiently from this  cruel blow to attend to necessary matters. Now that the country was at peace,  and Don Hypolito slain, the President gave his hearty consent to the marriages  of Dolores, Eulalia, and Carmencita. The weddings were very quietly celebrated,  as neither Jack nor Philip felt inclined for revelry now that Tim was dead;  and, indeed, so many of the Tlatonacians had lost relatives in the late war,  that public festivities would have been out of place. Therefore the weddings  were celebrated by Padre Ignatius in a very quiet fashion, and afterwards Jack  and Philip, with their respective brides, departed for England in <i>The  Bohemian</i>, while Don Rafael and Carmencita went north to Acauhtzin in a  warship. </p>
  <p>It  was Philip&rsquo;s intention to establish himself and Eulalia in his ancestral home  in Kent, and live the useful life of a country gentleman, varied by occasional  voyages in <i>The Bohemian</i>. He could not make up his mind to part with the  yacht, nor did Eulalia wish him to do so, and having proved herself to be a  capital sailor, she took as much interest in the boat as did Sir Philip  himself. Eulalia, having been shut up all her life in Tlatonac, now showed a  decided desire for rambling, so it seemed as though even marriage would not  cure Philip of his gipsy proclivities. Still before such matters were decided  upon, the baronet deemed it advisable to install his Spanish wife in the family  mansion, and introduce Lady Cassim to the country people. </p>
  <p>As  to Jack and Dolores, they were only paying a flying visit to the old country  for a few weeks, as Duval had finally made up his mind to settle in Tlatonac,  and become a naturalized citizen of that city. The life suited him; he was  married to a native lady of the place, and, moreover, the Junta had given him  full control of all engineering works connected with the country; so Jack, with  the full approval of Peter and Philip, thought he could not do better than  establish himself in this new land. The country was rich in natural  productions, in timber, ores, and precious stones, so when Jack&rsquo;s railways  opened it up throughout the whole length, there was no doubt but that Cholacaca  would become one of the most flourishing Republics of the Americas. </p>
  <p>Owing  to the severe lesson at Totatzine, it was anticipated that the Indians would be  too cowed to give the Government further trouble, and this proved to be the  case. The last stronghold of the old gods had fallen, and the sacred city,  which had been the centre of incessant conspiracy against the Republic was  quite broken up. With the vanishing of the opal, it lost its character of a  sacred town, and now being thrown open to the world by the discovery of the  secret paths, no longer possessed any mysterious charm for the Indians. With no  centre, with no crafty priesthood, the power of the tribes, instead of being  concentrated, became scattered, and there is no doubt that in the near future,  when the country is a network of railways, that the savage tribes will vanish  before the advancing flood of civilisation. </p>
  <p>Peter  did not come in <i>The Bohemian</i>, as he had accepted the invitation of a  celebrated naturalist to visit him up Mexico way, and hunt beetles and  butterflies in company. Faithless Peter, he refused to marry Do&ntilde;a Serafina, and  fled the smiles of his elderly charmer, for the, to him, dearer delights of  entomology. Baffled in one quarter, Do&ntilde;a Serafina was successful in another,  for she turned her attention to Don Alfonso Cebrian, and succeeded, after some  difficulty, in marrying the Intendante of Xicotencatl, who had for some years  been a widower. Serafina found on marriage that she possessed a step-daughter,  with whom she could not agree, but speedily settled her future by marrying her  off to Captain Velez, who thus became the Intendante&rsquo;s son-in-law after all. </p>
  <p>After  leaving Tlatonac, the four people on board <i>The Bohemian</i> were talking of  these things on deck, in the warm sunshine. It was the afternoon of a perfect  day, and the yacht steamed merrily along towards the distant ocean. To the  surprise of Philip and Jack, the ladies proved to be excellent sailors, and  were quite fascinated with the yacht, much to the gratification of old Benker,  who, for the first time in his crusty old life, approved of the existence of  the female sex. </p>
  <p>When  they were tired roaming about and making inquiries about this, that, and the  other thing, they settled down in comfortable deck-chairs to talk about the  future with their respective husbands. Dolores and Jack were returning to  Tlatonac shortly, so had but the same life to look forward to; but Eulalia was  secretly dismayed at the prospect of being an English lady. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Querido!&rdquo;  she said to Philip, looking at him over the top of her big black fan, &ldquo;I cannot  talk your tongue. And your English ladies! I hear they are so cold. And your  climate. Oh, Felipe, I fear your climate.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you all these nice things, Eulalia?&rdquo; asked Philip, smiling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don  Pedro.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear girl, you must not believe what Peter says. He doesn&rsquo;t know a thing,  except what relates to beetles. You are learning to talk English very quickly,  and as to the English ladies&mdash;they will all fall in love with you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the climate of England,&rdquo; added Jack, wickedly, &ldquo;is the best in the world.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied Philip, laughing, &ldquo;I cannot conscientiously say that. But neither  Eulalia nor myself will stay much in England. We shall travel.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Eulalia  clapped her hands with glee on hearing this delightful proposal, and Dolores  settled the future course of such travelling. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever  you may go, Se&ntilde;or Felipe,&rdquo; she said smiling, &ldquo;forget not that Juan and myself  dwell in Tlatonac, and shall expect you both once a year.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  or less!&rdquo; cried Jack, lazily. &ldquo;Come in a year, Philip, and you will see how  Cholacaca is going ahead. I will have that railway to Acauhtzin ready before  you know where you are. All those little forest towns will soon be in  communication with the outside world&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Totatzine?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Totatzine has lost its mysterious charm of the unknown. I&rsquo;ll turn it into a  resort for invalids, or a Central American Monte Carlo. Where Huitzilopochtli  was worshipped, future generations will adore the goddess of play.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  that rate, you will still have victims offered at the shrine,&rdquo; said Philip,  grimly; &ldquo;but, after all, Jack, it was a pity we lost the opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  it not be found again?&rdquo; asked Dolores, who deeply regretted the vanished jewel. </p>
  <p>Jack  shook his head. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid not. Xuarez threw it into the torrent. Heaven only knows in what  profound depths it now lies. Perhaps it is best so. While it was on earth, it  caused nothing but trouble, from the time it was in the possession of  Montezuma, to the death of Xuarez.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  it is lost, I suppose the superstition will die out!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Superstition  dies hard. All kinds of legends will grow up about that famous gem. It will  still be remembered for many years, the more especially as Tlatonac is still,  and ever shall be, the City of the Opal.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Dolores is still the guardian of the opal,&rdquo; said Eulalia, pensively. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  guardian of a stone that has now no existence,&rdquo; replied Dolores, laughing; &ldquo;but,  after all, I had rather the jewel was lost than my Juan.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Dolores!&rdquo; said Jack, with a sad smile, &ldquo;had it not been for the Se&ntilde;or  Correspo&ntilde;sal, your Juan would have been lost.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Tim,&rdquo; muttered Philip, softly, turning away to conceal his emotion. </p>
  <p>The  tears sprang to Dolores&rsquo; eyes, and Eulalia was scarcely less affected. It  seemed too terrible that they should all be so happy, when poor Tim, whom they  loved so much, should be lying in the grave. The bitterest part of it was that  the death had taken place just when the war was over. Tim had escaped the siege  of Janjalla, the battle of Centeotl, only to fall in a skirmish at the obscure  town of Totatzine. It was fate! </p>
  <p>They  remained silent for a few minutes, thinking of the dead man, and then Philip aroused  himself with an effort. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;  he said, with a smile. &ldquo;We must not be melancholy on our wedding-day. Poor Tim  himself would have been the last to countenance such folly. We can talk of  other things. Of Rafael, for instance.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is not much to talk about Rafael,&rdquo; said his sister, lightly; &ldquo;he is married to  Do&ntilde;a Carmencita. He is now Governor of Acauhtzin, and when Cholacaca has a  fleet, he shall be its almirante. I think Rafael is very fortunate, Felipe.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so fortunate as I am,&rdquo; replied the baronet looking at her fondly. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  as I!&rdquo; cried Jack, slipping his arm round Dolores&rsquo; waist. &ldquo;Ah, Philip, how many  things have taken place since we sailed over these waters! Did I not tell you  you would bring home a bride?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did, and I half believed you. For once, you have prophesied correctly. I am  grateful to you, Jack, for having led me to secure this prize. When you came  back to England, I was settling down into a crusty old bachelor; but now you  will find me a devoted husband&mdash;all through your coming to England.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,  rather, all through the agreement we made at Bedford School, so many years ago.  That boyish freak has brought us good fortune and charming wives.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  Peter is still a bachelor.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Peter will marry a beetle! I expect we shall see him in England shortly. For  myself, I do not complain of Fate; nor does Dolores.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Jack  bent down tenderly, and kissed Dolores, which example seemed so good to Philip  that he at once followed suit. </p>
  <p>The  sun was setting in the west, and the sky was one blaze of colours. Pale rose,  tawny-yellow, and high above, the delicate blue of the departing day. The sky,  the sea were all glittering with rainbow hues of unexampled brilliancy. The  yacht, leaving all this splendour behind, steamed steadily onward towards the  coming night. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like the Chalchuih Tlatonac,&rdquo; said Dolores, pointing to the sunset. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we are leaving it behind,&rdquo; replied Jack, taking her hand; &ldquo;but I do not regret  it, querida. If Fate has denied me the harlequin opal, she has given me a  dearer and more precious gift&mdash;yourself.&rdquo; </p>
