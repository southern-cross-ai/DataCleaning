<h2>The Camisade<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Rafael Sabatini</h2>

<h3>An Episode of the War of La Vendée</h3>

<hr>

<h3><i>Cassell's Magazine of Fiction, May 1916</i>
</h3>

<hr>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>The good folk of Niort had seen the Royalist army march out of
their town in the rosy light of the midsummer dawn. A horde some
six or seven thousand strong, they had presented a motley but
inspiring spectacle to the moist, admiring eyes of the loyal
inhabitants. Most of them in their peasant garb--a garb adopted
indeed by many who were not peasants--they thundered along in their
wooden shoes, all bearing the device of the red kerchief, the
consecrated heart upon their breasts, and the white cockade in
their round hats.</p>

<p>In quitting Niort they were falling back before the Republican
army under Westermann, dispatched by the Convention to make an end
of these brigands, these mutinous yokels who had rebelled against
the sacred authority of the nation, and who had snatched up arms
for God and King--both of which institutions the Republic had
abolished.</p>

<p>So the good folks of Niort had crowded to windows and doorways
to cheer and speed them, shouting <i>"Vive le Roi!"</i> until they
were hoarse as crows.</p>

<p>That had been at dawn. Now, at sunset, they crowded again to the
doors and windows, and again they grew hoarse with shouting. But
this time the cry was <i>"Vive le République!"</i> and the army
they cheered was a detachment of the Blues under General Canclaux
which came swinging into the town to the tune of the
"Marsellaise"--a martial, orderly legion, vastly different from
that peasant horde. This was Westermann's vanguard, some five
thousand strong, sent to hold Niort as an outpost of the main army
which lay at Nantes.</p>

<p>In a white-panelled room in a substantial house in the Rue de
l'Eglise, Maître Falgoux, the attorney, sat moodily listening to
the distant shouts of the crowd; he was short of stature and very
slim, and there was something austere in the clear-cut, ascetic,
wax-like face, in the grizzled tie-wig, the plain suit of black and
steel buckles of his shoes. With him, beyond the table which
gleamed faintly in the fading light, sat a young girl, whose eyes,
dilated now by a certain dread, were as dark pools in the white
oval of her face.</p>

<p><i>"Canaille!"</i> he said softly, but with unutterable
malignity, through teeth that were tight clenched. "Who that had
heard them this morning could now believe his ears? Ha!" He laughed
short and bitterly. "Long live the King at dawn, and long live the
Republic at dusk. The epitome of Frenchmen! Ready to dance to any
tune that's piped, ready to feed from any hand, be it clean or
dirty."</p>

<p>"It is fear makes them shout now," said the girl, defending
them, "not loyalty, as was the case this morning."</p>

<p>But he was not appeased. "Which is to say that they are cowards.
And from cowards what can you hope for?"</p>

<p>The door opened and a man entered. He was of middle height,
broad, powerfully built and bull-necked, with a swarthy, masterful
face that was not without a certain virile beauty.</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded very eagerly. "What news?"</p>

<p>The new-comer advanced. He set his heavy riding-crop and conical
hat upon the table, and briefly announced the strength of this
Republican detachment which had come to occupy Niort.</p>

<p>"I have all that I remained to learn," he said, "and I have but
paused that I might take my leave of you before I rejoin M. de
Lescure."</p>

<p>"And shall you tell him also, Cadouin, of the reception which
these dogs have given the Republican rabble?" Anger throbbed in the
old man's voice.</p>

<p>But Cadouin merely shrugged. "What does it signify? They shout
'Live the Republic!' that their homes may escape violation. In
their hearts, maître, they are loyal to us, and when we return--as
return we shall, and very soon, to sweep this Republican filth out
of Niort--they will cry 'Live the King!' once more and with
redoubled energy."</p>

<p>"That is what I have been saying," exclaimed the girl, glad to
have her faith confirmed.</p>

<p>He turned to her, and his dark eyes smouldered. He made her a
slight, deferentail inclination, which lent a certain courtier-like
grace to his clumsy figure. "Then, mademoiselle," he said, "you
have proved yourself as wise as you are lovely."</p>

<p>Her eyelids flickered and her glance fell away before his
devouring gaze. She drew back a little, beset by a confusion that
obviously was not pleasurable. The compliment was gross and clumsy;
moreover, her attitude must have made it plain to any man of
insight that compliments from this visitor were not desired. But
there was no man of insight present. Her father turned slightly
aside, as if not to intrude upon what he conceived to be a private
matter between his daughter and Cadouin, and occupied himself with
his snuff-box.</p>

<p>"I pray you may be right," he said. "But their vile behaviour
savours of cowardice, and I do not like cowards."</p>

<p>"Oh, not cowardice, but a wise discretion," said Cadouin,
smiling. "Just such a discretion as bids me not to linger here in
obedience to my ardent wishes." And again his eyes sought the
girl's face, but sought in vain, A slight frown drew his dark brows
together. "Already I have perhaps been foolish," he added. "I have
risked a deal to come to you, for these Republicans understand
organisation, and when they occupy a town they make themselves
masters of it indeed. The gates will already be in their hands, and
none may pass out whose papers are not in order--who cannot display
the civic card."</p>

<p>"Then--" began the other in some alarm,</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what I am doing, Monsieur Falgoux. I do not leave by
any of the gates, but by way of your garden and the river. Blaise
shall ferry me over, and I will swim my horse. They have not yet
had time to post sentries on the farther bank, if, indeed, it has
so much as occurred to them." He held out his hand. "Au revoir,
then, maître. You shall see me soon again."</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux took the outstretched hand and pressed it
warmly.</p>

<p>"Au revoir, my son," he said affectionately. "God guard you!" He
turned to his daughter. "Summon Blaise, Madeleine, and then conduct
Monsieur Cadouin."</p>

<p>She made no demur, although the task was one she willingly would
have escaped. It was not only that Cadouin was himself so utterly
distasteful to her, but that she feared how he might profit by this
opportunity. Of intent her father did not accompany them; that,
too, was plain; and so, having summoned Blaise, she set out across
the garden with the old servant and the young Royalist. But this
was not at all to the young Royalist's pleasure. He conceived that
Blaise's society might very well be foregone, and, being by nature
free from foolish hesitancy, he bade the servant go ahead and make
ready the boat.</p>

<p>Thereafter he hung back a little, and the twain proceeded slowly
through the twilit garden, Cadouin leading his horse.</p>

<p>"I hope, mademoiselle," he said, softly, "that you understand
how impossible it would have been for me to have departed without
coming to take my leave of you."</p>

<p>"It might have been wiser, monsieur," she replied, feeling that
she must say something, and seeking for something that should be
neither committal nor yet unkind.</p>

<p>"Wiser, perhaps. But would you have me wise to such a point as
this?"</p>

<p>"I would not have you endanger your life unnecessarily,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"You care, then, Madeleine? It would grieve you were my life cut
short?"</p>

<p>"Naturally, monsieur," she answered, her tone so restrained as
to forbid the further pursuit of this theme.</p>

<p>But it was not easy to restrain or rebuff Cadouin. "Yet to have
gone without seeing you again merely out of consideration of my
safety--why, faith, that were too high a price to pay for safety, I
think."</p>

<p>His insistence upon the risks he ran disgusted her a little--and
the more since she perceived his boastful hollowness. Yet she
desired to be gentle with him.</p>

<p>"You should remember, monsieur, that you have a duty towards the
Royalist army, and that to jeopardise your life is not quite to
accomplish that duty."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of duty," said he.</p>

<p>"Then I beg that you will, monsieur," she answered him, and this
time there was no mistaking the forbidding asperity of her
voice.</p>

<p>If Cadouin was not the man to shirk obstacles, neither was he
the man to batter his head against a wall. He was not so
unintelligent as not to perceive that the season was unpropitious
to his wooing. He assured himself that there was nothing
surprising, perhaps, in this, considering the state of nerves in
which every woman must be who lives amid such constant marching and
counter-marching. So he lapsed into silence, and in silence they
came to the edge of the gleaming river where Blaise waited with the
boat. Yet at the moment of departure he must revert to his
frustrated courtship. He took her hand and held it a moment in his
own, never heeding how limply it was surrendered.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, insisting upon that note of pathos
which he conceived must end by melting her reserve, "you know what
the times are. We who part here this evening may never meet again.
The countryside is infested by the agents of this execrable
Republic. I ride amid danger."</p>

<p>"I will pray Heaven to watch over you, monsieur," she said, but
so cold and formally that he dropped her hand, and with a short
"Adieu," which sounded more like an expletive than a valediction,
he stepped at last into the waiting boat.</p>

<p>She found her father waiting for her in the panelled room, where
by now the candles had been set and the shutters closed.</p>

<p>"He got safely away?" he greeted her.</p>

<p>"No doubt," she answered shortly. She drew a chair to the table
and sat down.</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows and scanned her in silence for a moment.
"No doubt?" he echoed. "But did you not wait to ascertain?"</p>

<p>"I did not think there was the need. I conducted him to the boat
as you bade me."</p>

<p>He closed his snuff-box with a vicious snap. "And you had not
the grace to wait to see that he crossed in safety?" he ejaculated
with some heat.</p>

<p>"It did not occur to me that there was any danger."</p>

<p>"You exasperate me," he informed her. "This good Cadouin, who is
devoted to you, tarries at the risk of his life in a town invested
by the Republican rabble merely that he may come to take his leave
of you--for you may be sure it was not of me that he was thinking.
Just that he may see you again he endangers his neck, and all the
gratitude you can find it in your heart to display--"</p>

<p>But she interrupted him. "Monsieur talks too much of his
danger," she said. "Brave men do not talk of danger when it exists,
still less when it does not."</p>

<p>"When it does not? How when it does not?"</p>

<p>A wan smile crossed her pale face. "The gates of Niort are in
the hands of the Republicans. None may pass without presenting a
civic card. But on the farther bank of the Sèvre there are yet no
Republican sentries. I ask you, then, my father, what risk Monsieur
Cadouin incurred in in choosing to come this way?" He was
nonplussed for the moment, and she continued: "Yet Monsieur
Cadouin, whose only safe way out of Niort lay through our garden
and by the river, comes here vaunting himself of the risk he runs
to come and take his leave of us."</p>

<p>"Why are you so set against him?" he asked her suddenly,
shifting his ground without scruple.</p>

<p>"I am not set against him," she replied. "I am indifferent to
him."</p>

<p>"Why?" he insisted, his mouth tight as a trap.</p>

<p>"Because he does not succeed in arousing my regard. Perhaps it
is that he makes such clumsy endeavours, and thereby but succeeds
in wearying me."</p>

<p>He snorted impatiently. "It is just feminine perversity," said
he. "Women are all the same. Their regard is forever bestowed upon
worthless good-for-noughts. Here is an honest, upright, God-fearing
fellow, a man fairly well born and of some substance, who can give
you a good position in the world. He loves you; he wishes to make
you his wife. But since he has all the virtues that a woman could
desire in a husband he fails to arouse your regard!" he added with
infinite scorn, breathing noisily through his thin nostrils. "What
is the worth of your regard? A graceless fellow like that sometime
apprentice of mine, that good-for-nothing Babylas, aroused it
without an effort--a fellow I was constrained to send away because
of his idle habits."</p>

<p>She bridled and he perceived it, and perceiving it his anger
increased.</p>

<p>"That is not true, my father," she returned. "You did not
dismiss him because of his idle habits. You dismissed him because
he was poor and because he and I--"</p>

<p>"How?" he stormed, then checked. "So?" he considered her. "And
after three years, in which his name has never ben mentioned, it
seems that you can still change colour at the sound of it. So! What
constancy!" he sneered. Then his pale countenance momentarily
flamed. "And that is why Cadouin cannot arouse your regard. Now the
truth is out. Now I understand you. You have been deceiving me
these three years. Your thoughts have been with that vagabond all
the time. You have corresponded with him?" he demanded.</p>

<p>He saw a crimson stain spread from her brow to her neck.</p>

<p>"Not for two years," she answered him in a low voice.</p>

<p>But that her eyes were averted she might have seen the sudden
tightening of his lips, the cunning narrowing of his eyes.</p>

<p>"And you don't know what has become of him, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"How should I?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, then. The last news I had of him--over a year
ago--he was a Jacobin, a <i>sansculotte</i>, one of the hungry
<i>valetaille</i> that followed at the heels of that ranting rascal
Desmoulins in Paris, one of the <i>canaille</i> who have robbed
France of her King and seek to rob her of her God."</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, now very white, her eyes seeming larger and
more sombre than ever.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" she cried out in horror. "Babylas could
never have done that."</p>

<p>On the instant a sharp rattling knock fell on the door of the
house. Living amid alarms they checked their dispute at once to
listen. They heard the door opened, a sound of voices coming
gradually nearer, then along the passage rang the jingle of spurs
and the clatter of a sabre.</p>

<p>Madeleine clutched her breast in alarm. Her father squared his
shoulders to the mantelshelf and faced the door, his head thrown
back, his mouth tight.</p>

<p>The door was thrust open, and under the lintel, stooping
slightly on account of his height, stood an officer of the
Repiblican army in his blue coat with its white facings and crimson
epaulettes. In his hand he carried a great cocked hat decked with a
tricolour cockade; his black hair was tied in a stiff military
club, and his handsome face was smiling gently upon Maître Falgoux
and his daughter.</p>

<p>They stared at him oncredulously. The man within that uniform
came so aptly upon their talk of him that they might well mistrust
the evidence of their eyes.</p>

<p>It was Babylas!</p>

<hr>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>He stood there while you might count ten, looking from one to
the other with that faint and rather indefinable smile upon his
lips, waiting, but in vain, for a word of welcome or
recognition.</p>

<p>At length he advanced slowly into the room.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you do not recognise me?" he asked. "Faith,
I have grown a little in these last two years, and this uniform
makes certain changes in my appearance akin to changes in my point
of view. But at heart, and to you at least, I am always
Babylas."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," snapped the attorney, his voice corrosive
with the acid of sarcasm. He spoke with a great dignity, a trifle
stilted and forensic in manner. "If we have been silent, sir, it is
from amazement. Do not misunderstand me. Our amazement is not
caused by the sight of you in this <i>canaille</i> livery, but by
your effrontery in presenting yourself before us."</p>

<p>Babylas remained imperturbable under the insult. He had not been
out into the great world, rubbing shoulders with history-makers and
himself lending a hand in the making of it, to be hurt by the
pin-pricks of this stiff little provincial attorney who had once
been his master.</p>

<p>"You have not changed, maître," he answered tolerantly. "You are
still the same--still unable to view a question from any point but
your own. It is a failing fatal to success. You pronounce from your
own side before you have heard the evidence for the other. You
assume that it is pure effrontery has brought me here, whereas it
is affection for you--the lingering affection of the pupil for his
master--and the desire to serve you and to save you from
unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"I fail utterly," was the stinging answer, "to see how your
presence is to accomplish that. On the contrary--"</p>

<p>Babylas laughed, good-humouredly almost, and interrupted him.
"Ah, wait!" he cried. "Let me explain. The Republic works with
system and wisdom in all things. Gone are the slip-shod, untidy
methods of the old regime. Thus when a couple of hours ago our
General Canclaux dismounted at the Mairie, he was accompanied by
his quartermaster. He summoned the maire, demanded a list of the
inhabitants, and deputed me to assist the quartermaster in
allotting billets to our detachment. It was impossible for me to be
in Niort and not to think of you. Aware of what your feelings were
in the old days, and knowing your stubbornness which would prevent
you from marching with the times, I feared for you and for the
citoyenne here should an officer of the Convention be billeted upon
you. Moreover, apart from the trouble which your principles might
make for you, all officers of the Convention--I regret to be
compelled to make the confession--are not quite men at whose mercy
I could bear to think of your being placed. Therefore, maître, that
you might be spared unpleasantness, and perhaps worse, I took the
resolve to billet myself upon you for the time that our detachment
may be detained here in Niort."</p>

<p>There was something so frank and friendly in his bearing,
something so overwhelmingly convincing in what he said, that Maître
Falgoux was momentarily at a loss, deprived of his weapon of
sarcasm. Moreover, Babylas had said enough to awaken prudence. It
occurred to the attorney that to maintain his hostile attitude
might be to anger Babylas, and that if Babylas were angered he
might depart, exchanging his billet with some other officer who
probably would not scruple to exercise the brutality peculiar to
soldiers of the Convention towards the <i>noblesse</i> and the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> with Royalist sentiments. All manner of evils
might result from such an exchange. There would be danger,
overwhelming danger, to himself and to his daughter. Whilst, on the
other hand, not only did he not doubt that Babylas would treat them
with consideration, but he further reflected in that brief moment
that from Babylas he might even derive information concerning the
Republican forces which might be useful to his friends.</p>

<p>He unbent then, but only in part. More his feelings would not
permit.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the thought," he said, yet with a certain
stiffness that robbed the words of most of their intrinsic
graciousness. "You will forgive me if I judged rashly. Such
judgment was based upon my feelings, upon my convictions."</p>

<p>"I should lock those convictions away in a cupboard for the
present, citizen," replied Babylas with a smile. "It does no good
to air them; indeed it has led many a fine fellow to sneeze his
head into the National Basket. Mine is a friendly warning."</p>

<p>"I thank you. I shall endeavour to be guided by it. Do you look
to make a long sojourn here?"</p>

<p>"Just as long as my regiment remains."</p>

<p>"You will have luggage?"</p>

<p>"A soldier's luggage is no great affair. My valise is below. I
am free for the evening, and so, perhaps, whilst awaiting
supper--and I confess that I am famished--perhaps the citoyenne
will suffer me to sit?"</p>

<p>It was the first time he had directly addressed her. She started
and flushed before his question and the lingering glance by which
it was accompanied.</p>

<p>"I have been in the saddle since morning, citoyenne," he added,
as if in apology--in reality to indulge himself in the luxury of
speaking to her--"and, naturally, I am a little weary."</p>

<p>"O monsieur," she faltered. "Your pardon. Pray sit. I will see
that supper is brought at once." And upon that she left them, eager
to escape from the room and from the Colonel's presence, that she
might have some moments alone in which to collect herself and
school herself against the confusion and emotion astir in her.</p>

<p>He sprang to the door and held it for her with a courtliness
that few of her father's Royalist friends had ever displayed.
Rubbing shoulders with the great world had given Babylas a polish
and an ease that had not been his in the days of his apprenticeship
at Niort, in the days when he had captured her tender heart.</p>

<p>When she had departed he unbuckled his sabre and set it across a
chair, together with his cocked hat. Then, forgetting his weariness
and his expressed desire to sit, he crossed to the open casement,
and with one knee upon the window-seat he leaned out, inhaling the
cool fragrance of that garden. It was a garden very dear to him, a
garden that had been constantly in his dreams these three years
past, in all the murky turmoil and welter through which his career
as a Revolutionist had led him. It was a garden that had begotten
in him a sweet and very constant <i>nostalgie</i>, for to him it
was inseparably associated with the thought of Madeleine. Now, at
last, he beheld it again, breathed its perfume on this summer
night, and felt as only those feel who, after weary waiting, come
to realise a long-cherished dream. He sighed with a profound
gratitude. In all his five-and-twenty years of life he had never
been so glad to be alive.</p>

<p>Upon that sigh he turned, and found the attorney's sunken
smouldering eyes fixed upon him in a brooding look. He dropped to
the window seat, stretched his legs luxuriously before him, and
flung an arm along the sill.</p>

<p>"Citizen," he said--and Maître Falgoux winced at the obnoxious
title--"you made a Revolutionist of me when you drove me
hence."</p>

<p>"If you speak with regret," said the attorney, "I welcome the
access of grace in you, whilst disavowing your actual
statement."</p>

<p>Babylas smiled, "Ever the same!" he said.</p>

<p>"I thank you for the unconscious compliment. Honest men do not
change their views or turn their coats."</p>

<p>"Which is to say that honest men never reason, never question
what is, never ask themselves if things might be better, that
honest men are content to spend their lives in the iron cages of
convention which their fathers wrought for them. That may be your
conception of an honest man, citizen, but it is to say that an
honest man is of necessity a fool."</p>

<p>"Since it is impossible that we should agree, I would suggest in
our common interest that we do not discuss such matters during the
brief season of your sojourn here."</p>

<p>But Babylas was irrepressible.</p>

<p>"You delude yourself, <i>mon maître</i>. You say that it is
impossible that we should agree, but what you really should say is
that you do not wish to hear any arguments that would move you from
the opinions which you hold because your father held them before
you. Believe me, citizen, it is such men as you have made the
Revolution necessary, unavoidable."</p>

<p>"Such men as I!" It was a cry of indignation.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Men of inflexible rigidity of mind. Men who were
impervious to reason, who refused either to think or discuss the
questions that were set before them for the bettering of France,
for the removal of all the injustice and cruelty that rendered
progress impossible in this tortured land. Such men, I say, drove
the reasoners to desperation, Where argument fails force must be
resorted to. Your kind would not argue, would not even listen, and
so it became necessary to sweep your kind away, to purge the land
of you and the <i>noblesse</i>, your leaders, that through blood
and sorrow and suffering a sweeter, purer France might come to be
created."</p>

<p>"And you have created it?" sneered Falgoux.</p>

<p>"Not yet. The thing is in the doing. But it will be done, be
very sure of that. The edifice your kind had built threw too great
a shadow over the land; it shut out God's sunshine from the poor.
We sought to show you this, we sought to convince you of the
injustice of it, and to prevail upon you to make alterations in the
structure which would have removed the evil. It was not that you
refused. It was that you would not even listen to us; and so we
have torn the building down as a preliminary to reconstructing it
upon more equitable lines."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the attorney tartly, "when you talked thus to
the Parisian rabble in the gardens of the Palais Royal no doubt you
cut a very heroic figure. But I would remind you that neither place
nor audience is quite the same at present. You waste your
eloquence, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Babylas with a sigh, impervious ever to the other's
sarcasm. "Yet, <i>mon maître</i>, I beg you to bear these things in
mind."</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"To the end that you may come to understand that all men are not
rogues who do not happen to think as you think. You see, <i>mon
maître</i>, I do not wish you to think me a rogue."</p>

<p>"I judge your actions rather than your words."</p>

<p>"That is just what I would have you do. But judge my actions
accurately. Consider that, had I chosen, I might even have lived in
comparative ease in Paris as a smug attorney. Instead, because I
had dreamt dreams, because I desired to see those dreams realised
for this poor land of France, I starved, citizen. For a year I
suffered penury. Gladly I flung away a livelihood, possibly a
career, that I might follow whither the voice of conscience led me,
that I might lend a hand to the regeneration of France, to the
breaking of the fetters by which the poor were overburdened. You
speak of honesty. That, citizen, is my conception of honesty. And
however you may disagree with the principles that drove me, you
must agree with the purity, the single-mindedness of my purpose. I
say again, I desire that you should think well of me, which is why
I have said so much." And he stood up, a fine commanding figure of
a man.</p>

<p>"I fail, monsieur," replied the attorney, "to understand your
desire to earn the good opinion of so insignificant a person as
myself."</p>

<p>And then, before Babylas could make any answer, the door opened
and Madeleine re-entered, followed by Blaise's wife, who came with
a laden tray to set the table for supper.</p>

<p>But Maître Falgoux was far from failing, as he had said, to
pierce the other's motives. He suspected them, and, covertly
watching the Republican now and observing how his eyes followed
Madeleine as she assisted the elderly woman to prepare the table,
his suspicions grew to certainty. This Babylas, it seemed, had the
gift of constancy. He must keep a watch upon his daughter.</p>

<p>That was Falgoux's last thought as he fell asleep that night. It
was his first upon awakening next morning. It drew him from his bed
far earler than was his habit, and his intuitions sent him to scan
the garden from his window. There he beheld what his intuitions had
led him to expect. The Republican was walking with his daughter,
talking earnestly, and she listening with drooping head and hands
helplessly folded before her.</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux's eyes blazed as he watched them. He rapped out
an oath--a thing extremely rare with him--and performed a hasty and
untidy toilet that he might go and set a term to that
communion.</p>

<p>It had happened that an hour ago Babylas, awakening in that room
that had been his own in those happy days when he had been
Falgoux's apprentice, and seeing the sunlight playing upon his
whitewashed ceiling, had risen instantly, and, like the attorney an
hour later, had gone straight to the window to behold that garden
of his memories in the light of day.</p>

<p>Among the green of the apple trees he had detected a flutter of
white muslin, and realising that opprtunity was now his friend he
had determined not to waste it. He had dressed with speed, but
without haste. Unlike the attorney, it was not his daughter that he
went to interview. He gave a certain care to the arrangement of his
stock and the clubbing of his hair. Yet he accomplished it with
soldierly celerity.</p>

<p>He came to her through the grass that was a-sparkle with dew
down to the gravelled walk by the gleaming river, and at his
approach she stood still, with fluttering heart and trembling
limbs, desiring at once to receive and to avoid him.</p>

<p>In silence he took her hand, and she relinquished it, desiring
and yet not desiring this. A moment he held it, looking at her out
of his deep blue eyes with such a curious humble hunger in his face
as must have moved her had she but dared to raise her glance from
the gravel path. Then, seeing that the hand was not withdrawn, he
raised it to his lips, murmuring her name.</p>

<p>"Madeleine!"</p>

<p>She awakened from her entrancement at the sound of his voice and
drew her hand away sharply, so that his lips no more than brushed
it. She looked at him at last, and there was a defiance in her
eyes, a tumult in her bosom.</p>

<p>"For two endless years," he said, "I have hungered for this
meeting, dreamt of it in a dream tortured by doubts since you left
my last letter unanswered."</p>

<p>"I?" she cried, surprised out of the reserve she had been
building up. Then she recovered. "Your memory tricks you, sir, I
think; which is not surprising considering the turbulent life you
have lived."</p>

<p>He frowned. "You mean?" he begged.</p>

<p>The question exasperated her. Womanlike, she leapt to bitter
conclusions, founded upon her certainty that ignorance of her
meaning was no more than an affectation, an imposture. There had
been no room for thought of her in his life. But now that he was
returned his memories reviving, he sought to bridge the hiatus by a
contemptible pretence. She was "convenient"--that was the odious
word she chose to describe his present attitude.</p>

<p>"There is really not the need to make a song about it, monsieur.
It can matter little whether it was you or I who wrote the last
letter."</p>

<p>"It can matter little to you, you mean?"</p>

<p>"That is what I mean."</p>

<p>"Ah!"--he caught his breath like a man who has suddenly been
stabbed--"in that case I will but beg that you pardon me my
intrusion here. Knowing your father as I do I have conceived it
possible that he had confiscated the last letter that I wrote to
you. A doubt lingered, and I came to set that doubt at rest."</p>

<p>She looked away across the river, her agitation increasing
despite herself. The thought had occurred to her too.</p>

<p>"You might have written again," she said before she knew that
she had said it, expressing a passing thought.</p>

<p>"That your father might again confiscate it? That his eyes might
profane what was intended for no eyes but yours, that his lips
might sneer over the heart that I opened to you? Clearly I could do
only what I have done. Wait and trust to my faith in your sweet
constancy. And now, Madeleine, you say it cannot matter?"</p>

<p>She believed him in the matter of the letters; she saw that she
had done him a wrong in doubting him through these past two years,
She was glad of that; perhaps because it was at least the affront
to her vanity was removed. She was re-instated in her self-respect
by the assurance that she was not a woman flouted, a passing fancy
cast aside. But the assurance did not make her merciful.</p>

<p>"How can it matter," she answered him, "since you are become
what you are--a <i>sansculotte</i>, one of the <i>canaille</i>, a
murderer, a--"</p>

<p>"Spare me a little," he implored her, interrupting. "There may
be something to be said on my side. God gave me a mind that I might
reason, and I employed it. I made my talents fruitful, I
think--indeed, I hope--that it must have happened in any case, but
I know that if it did happen when and as it did, it was because of
you."</p>

<p>"Because of me? Do you mock me, or do you insult me?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Madeleine. Because I was poor whilst your father had
amassed himself a little fortune, he came to fear lest I should
seek to become his son-in-law. To avert so monstrous an evil he
perpetrated a mean injustice--"</p>

<p>"You must not speak of my father, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Let it pass; it is said. I shall not repeat it. Your father
sought a pretext to be rid of me and dismissed me from my
apprenticeship. It was an injustice that set me thinking of the
thousand injustices that were daily being done by the noble and the
wealthy. That he brought sorrow and despair upon me, and perhaps
upon you, was naught to him. That I had gifts of mind and an
application that should carry me far along the road of honest
endeavour weighed for nothing with him. I was poor, therefore I was
undesireable; I was to be cast out, broken if necessary. Then I
considered all the thousands whose cases were no better than mine,
who either because they could show neither lineage nor wealth were
ground into the dust. And that was the spark from which I lit my
revolutionary torch. God had given me a gift of speech, and I
employed it so long as speech and argument were necessary. God had
given me a gift of bodily strength, and I am employing this now
that it is required to enforce the other."</p>

<p>"It is the common cant," she answered him, for, indeed, reared
as she had been in an atmosphere of intensest loyalty to the
old-established order of things, such heresies served but to arouse
her resentment and disgust.</p>

<p>Until Babylas had voiced his sentiments she had been almost
prepared to forgive him the uniform he wore, conquered by her
feelings for him. But these feelings he was now stifling by his
revolutionary eloquence.</p>

<p>"Cant?" he echoed. "Where is the cant? Are these things true or
are they false? Ask yourself."</p>

<p>"Even if they were true, would they justify all the butchery you
revolutionists have perpetrated? Do they justify the slaughter of
women? The murder of the sacred person of the King himself?"</p>

<p>"The King?" His face flushed and sneered. "How well they conceal
the truth from you. A king who plotted with Austria and Prussia
that he might overrun France by German hordes and so support his
tottering throne at the cost of the country he was sworn to defend.
Is that a king to be handled tenderly?"</p>

<p>"You are blasphemous!" she cried, "I will not listen to you.
You--you are vile!"</p>

<p>But he was not to be silenced. He reasoned on, he spoke much as
he had spoken to her father last night, and the burning eloquence
that had fired a Parisian mob began at last to have some effect
upon the woman he loved. She was confused and bewildered by a lucid
reasoning that was so subversive of all the things to which she had
clung. So that in the end she begged him almost piteously to
desist.</p>

<p>"Why? Oh, why do you tell me all this? Why do you seek to poison
my mind with it?"</p>

<p>"I do not poison it. You have been so reared that you deem the
very elixir of life a poison. I tell you this, not only to the end
that you may know the truth, but to the end that you may know me,
and know what forces have been at work to make me what I am. I tell
you this because I cannot have you think me vile, since I love you,
Madeleine."</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was a gasp, no more. And then she saw her father
issuing from the house, and was thankful for the respite his coming
brought her.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Later that morning the perturbed Maître Falgoux questioned his
daughter closely and searchingly. The result almost satisfied him.
She confessed frankly now that ever since Babylas had left them
three years ago she had nourished a tenderness for him, but that
this tenderness he had himself slain when he presented himself
before her in the garb of a Republican, and by his speech insulted
all the principles that she accounted sacred.</p>

<p>Falgoux did not for a moment doubt her sincerity. He knew her
character too well, knew her loathing of deceit and subterfuge and
her natural courage and intelligence which rendered falsehood
unnecessary. It was very well, he assured himself. This visit of
Babylas's, which he had accounted so very inopportune, was, it
seemed, the very medicine needed to cure her of her obstinate
attachment to his memory. A wise man would have been content to
have left matters there for the present. But Maître Falgoux was not
wise--at least, where women were concerned. In his unwisdom he
deemed the season a timely one for advocating Cadouin's case.</p>

<p>He rubbed his lean hands together. "I am glad, my dear," he
said, "glad both on your account and this good Cadouin's whose
wishes you will no longer withstand."</p>

<p>But at that she stared at him in dismay.</p>

<p>"What has Monsieur Cadouin to do with it?" said she. "I beg that
you will not press me further, my father." And upon that she left
him that she might escape a recapitulation of all the arguments he
was wont to employ in Cadouin's favour.</p>

<p>This troubled him. It shook his confidence in her sincerity.
Ultimately it led him to dispatch Blaise to summon Cadouin.</p>

<p>Blaise, armed with a civic card which he had no difficulty in
procuring, departed upon his errand, and as a result of it Cadouin
himself made his appearance at the house in the Rue de l'Eglise
that same evening.</p>

<p>He came, unannounced, upon father and daughter as they were
sitting in that white-panelled room, and they started up with a cry
of concern at sight of him.</p>

<p>"So soon," exclaimed the attorney. "How did you contrive
it?"</p>

<p>"I came with Blaise's card, leaving Blaise at Fontenay to await
my return," he answered.</p>

<p>"But the danger of it."</p>

<p>"Is none so great as you would suppose. The sentries cannot
remember everybody who passes out. Moreover, I reckon that the
guard would have been changed since Blaise left Niort, and no doubt
it will be changed again ere he returns. Besides," he added, his
dark eyes seeking Madeleine's, "I am not a man to be detained by
dangers when inclination spurs me on. But you desire my presence,
maître."</p>

<p>Falgoux looked at his daughter, hesitating. "Fetch wine,
Madeleine," he bade her shortly.</p>

<p>Whilst she was gone upon that message the attorney succinctly
related what had happened. The coming of Babylas, the avowed affect
of his republicanism upon Madeleine's feeling towards him, his own
lingering doubts.</p>

<p>Cadouin listened avidly with hunched shoulders, hands clasped
behind him, and a dark scowl upon his broad face. Jealousy seethed
within him, and the fires of it were not to be extinguished by the
repetition of Madeleine's assurance that there was an end to any
regard that ever she might have nourished for Babylas. Cadouin's
jealousy was of that fierce quality which embraces the past as well
as the present where the object of it is concerned. Whatever
Madeleine might feel now for Babylas, she had practically confessed
that once she loved him, and that was something which must be a
thorn in Cadouin's very soul as long as Babylas lived.</p>

<p>"You did well to send for me," he said at last, speaking through
clenched teeth. He moved to the window, deep in thought.</p>

<p>"What do you advise?" asked Falgoux.</p>

<p>Madeleine entered at that moment bearing a tray laden with a
flagon and three tall, graceful glasses. Cadouin watched her as she
poured the wine. He received from her hands the glass she brought
him with a bow and a smile. He raised it and gave the toast:</p>

<p>"Live the King, and death to all Republicans!"</p>

<p>Her father repeated the words after him. Madeleine drank in
silence, emptying the half-glass she had poured herself.</p>

<p>"I trust you approve the toast, mademoiselle," quoth
Cadouin.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," she answered.</p>

<p>"It is well," he said, "it is well." He had taken his decision.
He would here and now resolve Maître Falgoux's lingering doubt
concerning her. "Hither into your house, mademoiselle, one of these
slimy <i>sansculottes</i> has crawled to thrust himself." It was in
vain that the attorney, who did not perceive the depth of Cadouin's
purpose, flashed him warning glances. The Royalist pursued his
theme. "He is included in the latter half of that toast,
mademoiselle." He spoke with grim significance.</p>

<p>He saw her set down her empty glass and observed that her hand
shook slightly; he observed, too, the sudden dilation of her eyes
and the constrained expression of her face.</p>

<p>"But since the lives of our enemies are not to be toasted away,"
he continued, "we must devise other means to rid you of this
incubus."</p>

<p>"Such as?" she asked him in a small voice.</p>

<p>He advanced to the table and set down his half-emptied
glass.</p>

<p>"There is a way," he said, "which has done good service against
some dozens of these upstarts. We who fight the King's battles must
fight them as we can, and one method which has been widely employed
is that of single combat. These ruffians, recruited from the
rabble, know nothing of the gentleman's weapon," and he tapped the
slender rapier at his side. "But in their self-sufficient arrogance
they never shirk an engagement."</p>

<p>"But that is murder," she said, and sat down by the table and
looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Murder?" he scowled. "Do you call it murder to kill a man in
fair fight?"</p>

<p>"Do you call it fair fight in which only one of the combatants
has knowledge of the weapons employed?" she countered.</p>

<p>He laughed, undismayed, amused, indeed, by the ingenuousness of
her point of view.</p>

<p>"The fault is theirs, mademoiselle. If they set themselves up as
equals of gentlemen, it is for them to make good their boast in all
things. They must take the consequences. Indeed, many of them have
already taken them. There is a little band of noble spadassins that
is doing good work in France. To that band I have the honour to
belong."</p>

<p>"I should not boast of it, Monsieur Cadouin," she said, and
there was cold contempt in her voice.</p>

<p>It stung him. "Ha!" said he, with a catch in his breath. "What a
sudden concern for the <i>canaille</i>!"</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, my concern is for the noblesse and its honour, which
I would not see smirched by deeds more worthy of these
revolutionary hinds."</p>

<p>"You are sure, mademoiselle, that these feelings are not
dictated by concern for one of these revolutionary hinds of whom
you speak?" His sneer was so malignant that it provoked Maître
Falgoux himself into intervening. For although the attorney himself
could be lavish in sarcasm where his daughter was concerned, he
permitted it in no one else.</p>

<p>"Nay, Cadouin," he said sharply, "the girl is right. Such
methods are entirely unworthy. They savour, indeed, of murder, and
a cause does not prosper that needs to be supported by such
deeds."</p>

<p>Cadouin looked at the attorney, flushing darkly. He was very
angry, but before he could find expression for it the door was
suddenly opened, and Blaise's wife came to warn them that the
Colonel was riding down the street. She had seen him from one of
the windows, and knowing Monsieur Cadouin to be there, she had
taken the liberty of coming to warn them.</p>

<p>It was an announcement that scattered all Monsieur Cadouin's
anger, and together with it all thought of his purpose of picking a
personal quarrel with Babylas.</p>

<p>"I had best go at once then," he announced, obviously a little
startled by the news.</p>

<p>Never had he seemed so contemptible to Madeleine as in this
abrupt change from his recent blustering. It occurred to her that
he was ever as eager to avoid danger as he was eager to boast of
incurring it.</p>

<p>"If your haste is great, monsieur," said she, "the window is
none so far from the ground."</p>

<p>He looked at her with anger flickering through the reproach of
his glance. He checked and placed a hand on his heart, like a man
who speaks from his inmost conscience.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he replied gravely, "if I depart at all it is
out of concern for you and your father. I would not be the means of
bringing trouble upon this house; but I shall come again, and
soon."</p>

<p>Upon that, with a last brief word of farewell he flung out, and
went by way of the garden that he might be sure of avoiding the man
he had proposed to eviscerate.</p>

<p>"I do not think, my father," said Madeleine, smiling a little
sadly, "that I admire Monsieur Cadouin."</p>

<p>"You heard what he said," her father reproached her. "It was
concern for us that prompted his departure, and perhaps respect for
your opinions. You would not have him stay and beard this fellow,
lest he should do murder. And now you imply that he should not have
gone as he did. You are unreasonable. All women are unreasonable,"
he added querulously.</p>

<p>The Colonel entered, bowed gravely, and was as gravely greeted.
He set down his sword and hat, and went to fling himself upon the
window seat. He was weary, he announced. There had been much to do
that day, so much that he had no time to breathe at ease until this
moment.</p>

<p>"But why did your guest depart in haste, citizen?" he asked
presently. "I trust it was not my coming drove him hence?"</p>

<p>They stared at him in sudden alarm. The Maître Falgoux drew
himself up very erect and stiff. But it was Madeleine who
challenged him.</p>

<p>"Do you spy upon us, Monsieur le Colonel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Spy upon you? Name of a name! What a thing to impute!" he
laughed. "It is not to spy to behold what is thrust under a man's
very eyes. I observe, that is all. If you were to do as much," and
his glance included both of them, "perhaps you would cling less
rigidly to your old beliefs." He pointed to the table. "There are
three glasses, therefore, three people were lately drinking here;
one of those glasses is neither the one standing before you,
citizen, nor before you, citoyenne; therefore it is a clear
inference that it was your visitor's, and since it is still half
full of wine it is equally clear that he departed without giving
himself time to finish it."</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux laughed a little awkwardly. "I compliment you,
sir, upon your acumen." he said.</p>

<p>"Yet you will not trust it, citizen," was the grave answer. "In
a simple matter such as this I can perforce convince you that I
reason clearly, But in graver and more far-reaching matters you not
merely mistrust my conclusions, but you mistrust me for drawing
them and detest me for holding them. Yet, I assure you, the signs
are no less obvious than those three glasses to him who can see,
the inferences no less inevitable."</p>

<p>"If we are to observe the amenities that are desirable among
those whom chance has placed under the same roof," was the stilted
answer, "your observation and unerring reason should warn you that
it is expedient to ignore political differences."</p>

<p>But Babylas would be warned of no such thing. Not a day passed
but that with Maître Falgoux, or with his daughter, or with both of
them, he would draw the conversation to that dangerous topic, and
sometimes he would harangue them as he had harangued the people in
the Palais Royal in the old days, until there were moments when the
force of his eloquence would touch the heart of one or the other of
his listeners. But such moments were rare and evanescent. Prejudice
was too deeply rooted in them both. Father and daughter alike were
bigots in their royalism, and bigotry is a thing impervious to
reason and to argument. Rob bigots of all arguments to bolster up
their beliefs, and they will still cling to them in the conviction
that although themselves they have no argument at hand wherewith to
answer the assailant, yet such arguments must and do exist.</p>

<p>There was something almost pathetic in the attitude of Babylas,
which entirely escaped them. They never realised that it was not
their conversion that was the object of his harangues, but just his
own reinstatement in their eyes, that what he really sought was to
make them understand how he had seen things and how inevitable it
was that he should so see them, to the end that they might forgive
him beliefs that were so opposed to their own. Their goodwill was
all he desired, not their conversion to the doctrines of the
Revolution, however much he might be the apostle of the latter.</p>

<p>It was Cadouin himself who--upon his next secret visit--opened
the attorney's eyes to his possible danger, and the attorney,
stout-hearted as he was, grew chill with the shock of sudden
apprehension.</p>

<p>"You are indiscret to reveal your views to him," was Cadouin's
censure. "Consider that he is in love with Madeleine. He is a dog
of a Republican. I know his breed. They stop at nothing. For a
while he will fawn and gambol because he thinks it may serve his
ends; let him once despair of that, and what is to prevent him
sending you to the guillotine? Who is to save Madeleine from him
then? Who is to prevent him from appropriating her?"</p>

<p>Falgoux uttered a groan, overwhelmed by sudden realisation of
his position, but there was no cause for his despair. Cadouin had
taken measures. It may have been just the consideration of this
state of things, just the desire to serve his own ends that had
spurred him to conceive and to advise M. de Charette, the Royalist
leader, upon a certain course. Since alone he hesitated to tackle
Colonel Babylas, he had resolved to employ to that end a portion of
the Royalist army, and at the same time to strike a blow for the
Royalist cause.</p>

<p>He had gone to Charette with his proposal, because Charette
seemed the likeliest man to see eye to eye with him. It was a
ruthless, murderous business, and Charette was become a ruthless,
murderous fellow in the intensity of his hatred of the Republic.
Not another of the Vendéen leaders would have listened to Cadouin's
plan, but Charette absorbed it eagerly with eyes thatn glistened
with hate and ferocity. He had commended Cadouin's shrewdness, and
he had there and then announced that if Cadouin could complete the
necessary preparations he would see the plan executed.</p>

<p>And this was the very business that had brought Cadouin once
more in secret to Niort. Lacking a <i>carte de civisme</i> this
time, he had come by way of the river; he had dodged the single and
not too attentive sentry, and had swum across in the dusk. His
clothes were drying in the kitchen below, and Blaise would ferry
him back anon. Meanwhile, he had arrayed himself in some odd
garments and a bed-gown borrowed from Maître Falgoux.</p>

<p>The Colonel, he had assured himself before seeking the attorney,
was absent on duty, and would not return until ten o'clock that
night, so that he had a good hour before him.</p>

<p>"Where is Madeleine?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"In her room," replied Maître Falgoux. "Your apparel," he added,
"is sufficient to ensure her absence. We can talk at our ease."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Cadouin rose, crossed to the door, opened it, and
looked out, to make quite sure that the coast was clear. Then he
returned slowly to his chair.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he announced, "there is a very glorious enterprise
afoot to rid Niort of this pestilence and to strike a blow that may
be far-reaching in its consequences, so far-reaching that it may
replace the King upon his throne and restore to France her
God."</p>

<p>"Tell me! Tell me!" said the attorney, leaning forward in his
sudden eagerness.</p>

<p>"One thing is yet necessary to complete our preparations. We
need a stout friend in Niort who will supply the missing link in
our chain. Maître, the time has come when you can serve the cause
you love. You are the friend we need--you and no other."</p>

<p>"Speak," said the attorney without hesitation; "and though my
life should be demanded, I will give it joyfully to advance the
cause of God and the King."</p>

<p>Had either of them observed the porcelain door-knob at that
moment he would have seen that it turned, yet the door did not
open. It was as if someone had paused in the very act of
entering.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Cadouin. "Now listen." And the door-knob
slowly and silently revolved back again to its original
position.</p>

<p>"In their abject generalship," the Royalist pursued, "these
Republicans have neglected to fortify themselves here on the side
of the river. They consider that the river itself is a sufficient
barrier; moreover, they are confident that they would have ample
warning of any projected attack upon this side. They guard the bank
adequately as they suppose for such a purpose, but in reality the
guard is utterly inadequate, as witness my presence here. It is for
us, monsieur, to take advantage of this state of things. The
surprise is planned--a camisade, a night attack. All that we lack
is the co-operation of a trusty Loyalist in Niort. What do you say,
maître? Will you be that co-operator?"</p>

<p>"What do I say? What do I say?" faltered Maître Falgoux, rising
in his agitation. "What do you expect me to say, Cadouin? All that
I have, all that I am, is at the service of the King and his sacred
cause."</p>

<p>"I knew it, <i>mon maître</i>. It was the answer upon which I
depended when I proposed this plan of mine to M. de Charette. All
is in readiness. We shall muster secretly at Fontenay some two
thousand strong; Niort itself should yield us another five hundred,
and so we shall have all that we need, for our aim is to take these
<i>canaille</i> by surprise and destroy them piecemeal. On Sunday
night there will be no moon. Precisely at midnight we shall be on
the opposite shore. We shall see to it that the sentry shall have
been removed. A few of us will creep on in advance to attend to
that. Then one of us will swim across bearing a cord with him. By
means of this a half-dozen ropes are to be drawn across the stream,
and one end of each will be tied to a tree, the other end we shall
make fast on the other side. By these ropes to serve them as
guides, our men will cross, wading and swimming, their powder in a
bundle on their heads. The spot chosen is your own meadow-land down
at Saint-Pré. The high walls enclosing it will screen our movements
from any belated <i>sansculotte</i>. There we shall muster quietly,
and then by the meadow gate--of which you will give me the key--we
stream out upon Niort. Every loyal man in the town must be warned
and ready to join hands with us. We want only those that are
absolutely to be trusted. I have brought you a list of them. And
even then none is to be informed of the way by which we are coming.
That, monsieur, will be your task."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Falgoux nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>"We shall cross exactly at midnight, but to make quite sure the
signal for them will be when the clock of St. Antoine chimes the
hour of one. Upon the stroke of it let them issue quietly from
their houses. Let every man wear a white shirt over his clothes, as
we shall be doing. Thus we shall be able to distinguish friend from
enemy in the dark. Bid all repair to the market square, where we
shall join them. And I dare swear," he added, "that in half an hour
the town will be in our hands and the Republicans annihilated. The
rest that is to do can wait until that much is accomplished. The
Republicans' own caution in billeting most of their men upon none
but trusted patriots will assist us, the Royalists here, being in
the main free of these unwelcome lodgers, will be free to make
their preparations without fear of being surprised."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Maître Falgoux.</p>

<p>"And you will prepare the Royalists of Niort?"</p>

<p>"You can depend on me."</p>

<p>"Then you can depend on us to plunge these Republicans from one
slumber into a deeper one." And he laughed, relishing his jest.
"For our aim will be to take them in their beds. Be generous with
your wine on Sunday night. See that your Colonel Babylas drinks his
fill. We will do the rest."</p>

<p>Falgoux winced at that. He did not relish the thought of murder
in his own house.</p>

<p>Then the door-knob turned again, and this time the door opened
quite suddenly, although no steps had been heard to approach it.
Both men started. In the doorway stood Madeleine, her face of the
colour of granite. They might have noticed it, but that the message
she delivered scattered all conjecture from their minds.</p>

<p>"Colonel Babylas has just returned. He is here,"</p>

<p>Cadouin twisted this way and that, seeking a nook in which he
might conceal himself. But the white-panelled room offered him no
slightest cover.</p>

<p>The attorney swore. "In Heaven's name, what brings him thus a
good half-hour before his time?" he cried.</p>

<p>"That is of little consequence," snapped Cadouin, his face very
grey. "What matters is that I am trapped, and my life is in
danger."</p>

<p>At last it seemed that the danger which he boasted of loving had
overtaken him.</p>

<p>"What matters even more--" the attorney was beginning, when
Cadouin fiercely interrupted him. The Colonel's sword came clanking
along the passage.</p>

<p>"Nothing matters more to a man than his life," said the Royalist
in the fierce, futile assertion of despair.</p>

<p>And then Colonel Babylas stood at gaze in the doorway.</p>

<hr>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>Beyond a slight elevation of his eyebrows the soldier permitted
no indication of his surprise to appear. His wide-set, observant
eyes took in the details of Cadouin's grotesque apparel, and his
keen wits instantly supplied the reason of it.</p>

<p>He advanced a step, then checked, as if hesitating.</p>

<p>"Do I intrude?" he asked, looking from one to another, his
manner charmingly deferential.</p>

<p>Cadouin made the fatal mistake of assuming this hesitation and
deference to be based on fear. His own failing courage instantly
revived. He was conscious, too, that it was imperative that he
should acquit himself with valour and dignity in the eyes of
Madeleine, that he should score an advantage over a man in whom he
half-suspected a rival.</p>

<p>"What else can you suppose?" he answered, sneering.</p>

<p>"Let me make haste, then, to repair the fault," replied Baylas,
half-turning as if to depart, his smoothness unruffled. "I had not
expected the pleasure of seeing you, Citizen Cadouin," he
added--for he had known Cadouin in the days of his apprenticeship.
"I regret that our meeting should be so very brief and
fugitive."</p>

<p>"It is a regret I do not share," said Cadouin, and flattered
himself that he was cutting a fine figure, observed with
satisfaction Madeleine's faint air of wonder.</p>

<p>"That I can understand," said Babylas, smiling with unruffled
amiability. "As a soldier of the Convention," he added after a
moment's pause, "let me apologize for the existence of conditions
which impose upon you the necessity of swimming to pay your visits.
I am desolated you should be so greatly inconvenienced,
citizen."</p>

<p>And on that he would have quitted the room, but that Cadouin,
more and more persuaded that the Republican went in terror of him,
would not rest content.</p>

<p>"You are too cursedly polite," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"That, citizen," was the smooth answer, "is something with which
I could never reproach you."</p>

<p>It was rank folly on the part of Cadouin, but, vanity and
jealousy combining to urge him, he was not to be restrained.</p>

<p>"Sir, you are a scoundrel--a scoundrel, do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly, citizen."</p>

<p>"What do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Amongst other things that you are a fool, Citizen Cadouin. I
have always suspected it. None but a fool would attempt to provoke
a man who is master of the situation."</p>

<p>"You flatter yourself that you are master of the situation, do
you?" snapped Cadouin, in spite of a warning tug at his sleeve from
Falgoux.</p>

<p>"I assure myself of it without flattery."</p>

<p>"You are impervious, then, to insult?" roared Cadouin, the more
infuriated by the other's calm.</p>

<p>"Oh, by no means! Alas! I am but human, Citizen Cadouin, and I
would warn you not to test me too far. I think it is quite plain
you desire to pick a quarrel with me. It is within your power to
succeed. Others of our kind--one or two of your famous Royalist
spadassins have succeeded. But I had a surprise in store for them.
As the offended party I had the choice of weapons, and I chose
sabres. Their ignorance of the ways of that weapon proved as
profound as my ignorance of the small sword on which they had
counted. But they were committed, and so forced to submit to let me
carve them at my ease. If I spare you this surprise it is out of
deference to our host, Maître Falgoux; I would not have him
troubled to give an account of your presence here, for it is well
known, citizen, that you are serving in Charette's army of
brigands, and to harbour you is a grave offence. For the same
reason I forbear from having you arrested. But there are limits to
the extent to which I can neglect my duty, and I would advise you,
citizen, to resume your own clothes without delay, whether they be
wet or dry, and to disappear."</p>

<p>He walked calmly to the door. There he paused to look at his
watch.</p>

<p>"I give you a quarter of an hour, citizen, in which to quit
Niort. More I cannot do," And he went out, closing the door after
him.</p>

<p>Cadouin stood livid with rage begotten of his utter defeat. He
realised how pitiable a figure he had cut in that brief contest,
how completely the honours were with the Republican--so completely
that it was actually by his favour that Cadouin continued at
liberty, and was at liberty to make his escape. That talk of sabres
had sickened him, as it had sickened one or two others of his
kidney, who, intent upon murder in the guise of a duel, had
suddenly found the tables turned upon them.</p>

<p>"What was I to do?" he asked, appealing to father and daughter.
"What was I to do with a fellow who talked of sabres? As well
propose a combat with butchers' knives. Faugh! And yet," he added,
on a sudden inspiration that should restore him in their esteem, "I
should not have been deterred even by that if my own life had been
all that was in jeopardy. I had to think of the cause I serve, and
the thing that is even now to do. The King's service cannot spare
me."</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name," cried Falgoux, "consider that now, and get
you gone while there is time. Come, man, I will get your clothes
for you. You shall have that key, too. And if there is anything
else you have to say, you can say it whilst you are dressing.
Come!"</p>

<p>For all his danger and the urgency of the case, Cadouin went
reluctantly. He desired a word yet with Madeleine; but that word
was denied him by the attorney, who hurried him away.</p>

<p>Left alone, Madeleine, very pale and thoughtful, sank to the
window-seat. Cadouin had aroused her contempt by contrast with the
dignified imperturbability and generosity of Babylas. She was not
to know that it was chiefly consideration for herself that had
dictated the Colonel's conduct, that the desire to appear
heroically in her eyes had prompted him to keep a firm hand on his
temper, and to display a twofold magnanimity towards Cadouin, of
which, in different circumstances, the Royalist would certainly
have seen no sign. After all, you see, Babylas was but human and a
little of a self-seeker, at least where Madeleine Falgoux was
concerned.</p>

<p>She found a certain disloyalty creeping into her thoughts. It is
almost impossible to admire the member of one faction and despise
the member of another without at the same time being drawn to
sympathy and antipathy for their respective sides. Out of her
deep-seated abhorrence of the revolution and all that it had bred,
she reproached herself now for these mutinous feelings that were
stirring in her.</p>

<p>She heard her father and Cadouin go down the garden in the dark,
accompanied by Blaise, who would take Cadouin across the river in
the boat.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Babylas came in. Instantly she rose to
depart, pursuing the course she had set herself since that first
interview of theirs on the morning after his coming--never to
permit herself to be alone with him.</p>

<p>But he detained her.</p>

<p>"A moment, citoyenne," he begged. "There is something I should
like to say. It concerns your father, citoyenne, and yet I have
thought that if you were to convey my warning, it might have
greater effect. I should regret, too, if coming from me it should
seem to have the air of a threat, or should be so construed by
him."</p>

<p>"What is it, monsieur?" She was a little breathless.</p>

<p>"Warn him, citoyenne, that he is extremely unwise in the course
he is pursuing, and counsel him to abandon it."</p>

<p>"What course is that, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"He will know better than I. I am not blind. It is quite obvious
to me that your friend Cadouin's visits are more or less regular.
There was the wine-glass the other day you remember. Now I am fully
informed of the Citizen Cadouin's association with Charette and
Cathelineau. I conclude, therefore, that he is a go-between--an
agent--and that his visits here at the risk of his neck are
concerned with some plotting into which he is inveigling your
father. Bid your father wash his hands of plots, and leave politics
alone as he loves his neck and as he loves you. The Republic has as
many eyes as Argus. Tell him so, mademoiselle. Use persuasion with
him, as you love him."</p>

<p>She was deathly pale and her bosom was in tumult, yet she looked
him straight between the eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she answered, "you are quite at fault. Monsieur
Cadouin is the future husband chosen for me by my father. Let that
explain to you his frequent secret visits at the risk of his
neck."</p>

<p>She saw the ripple of pain that spread across his face, leaving
a shadow in his clear eyes. Then he bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>"The explanation is more than adequate," he replied. "I thank
you for the confidence."</p>

<p>And upon that the interview ended, leaving her a profound
feeling of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>But that night, alone with her father after the Colonel had
retired, she conveyed his warning, and added to it the most
strenuous intercessions of her own. He listened gloomily,
frowning.</p>

<p>"It is idle to counsel me against my duty," he said at last, but
there was a lack of heartiness in the words. "Whatever the risk,
whatever the cost, I must bear it for the sake of my faith and my
principles."</p>

<p>"Then it is true you are plotting something?" she cried, as if
until now she had possessed no knowledge of the fact.</p>

<p>"I did not say so much."</p>

<p>"But you don't deny it. Nor is there any need. But, father, do
you intend to persevere?"</p>

<p>He looked at her, a faint smile on his thin-lipped mouth.</p>

<p>"My child," he said in a voice of gentle remonstrance, "if I
were indeed concerned in any plot for the greater honour and glory
of our God and our King, you would not have me abandon it now?"</p>

<p>"Not after what has happened here to-day--after Colonel Babylas
allowing Monsieur Cadouin to go free? Has Colonel Babylas not
placed us under a debt? Can we in honour avail ourselves of his
generosity to plot his ruin?"</p>

<p>He looked at her again, and his eyes now were hard and
suspicious.</p>

<p>"You are pleading for the <i>sansculotte</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am pleading for your honour and for your safety," she
answered.</p>

<p>"The latter is of no account; of the former you must allow me to
be the best judge, my girl," he said. "We must take what advantage
we can of the <i>canaille</i>. Babylas was perhaps foolish to let
Cadouin go free. But it would be illogical to argue that our hands
are to be bound by his act of folly."</p>

<p>"His act of generosity, you mean, my father."</p>

<p>"That," was the shrewd answer, "is what he would have it appear.
I see that it has some effect upon you, and so no doubt his purpose
would be served were I a fool too. Peace, girl! Keep to your own
affairs," he ended peremptorily, and thus brought the discussion to
a close.</p>

<hr>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>It was on a Monday--the last Monday in June--that Cadouin had
paid that visit of his to Maître Falgoux. The camisade was planned,
as we have seen, for the following Sunday, so that the attorney had
the best part of a week in which to go about the task of preparing
the Royalists of Niort to bear their share in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the precautions that he used, his activities
were necessarily such that of a certainty they must have aroused
the suspicions of the Committee of Public Safety, but for the
immunity from "observation" which he enjoyed, thanks to the
sponsorship of that stalwart Republican, Colonel Babylas.</p>

<p>Returning more than once during that week at odd hours to the
house in the Rue de l'Eglise, Babylas almost invariably found the
attorney from home. Something was engaging him prodigiously. And
Babylas, not without his suspicions that whatever the business
might be it was not unconnected with Cadouin's surreptitious
visits. He feared that some mischief might be brewing--that is to
say, he feared for Maître Falgoux. To show the attorney that he was
wide awake he dropped a word of warning on the Wednesday at the
midday meal.</p>

<p>"I do not know, maître," he said, "whether you have means of
communicating with Citizen Cadouin. If so, and lest he should not
have taken my warning sufficiently to heart, you would do well to
inform him that the guard across the river has been considerably
increased, and that any further attempt to swim across will most
certainly earn him a bullet through such brains as he
possesses."</p>

<p>This news of the increase of the guard on the farther bank of
the river brought Falgoux a pang of sudden anxiety. He must know
how far this increased guard extended, whether it was merely to
observe the spot where last Cadouin had crossed, or whether,
indeed, it might not reach along the whole of the opposite bank as
far even as Saint-Pré, which was to be the object of the first
stage of the attempt on Sunday night.</p>

<p>"You have considered it necessary to watch the shore opposite my
garden?" he inquired probingly, anxiously awaiting the reply to his
inward doubts rather than to his spoken words.</p>

<p>"Can you blame me?" returned Babylas. "More than once a visitor
from ouside has reached you, and with the best intentions towards
you I must see that this does not continue."</p>

<p>The attorney was answered, and he breathed more freely; there
was an almost perceptible relaxing of the tension of his ascetic
face.</p>

<p>Then Babylas proceeded to elaborate what he had said.</p>

<p>"Because I do not believe, maître, that the Republic is in any
serious danger from your friends, I can close my eyes to things for
which the Republic would call you to account did evil follow, and
call me to account, too, for not having observed them."</p>

<p>"I am profoundly indebted to you," said Falgoux, with such tart
irony that Madeleine flushed and looked up quickly to see how the
Colonel took the thrust.</p>

<p>"Your goodwill, <i>mon maître</i>, is all that I desire," he
answered in a quiet, level voice that robbed his words of all
suspicion of self-vaunting. "God knows I have done my best to earn
it. But you will persist in treating me as an enemy in spite of all
the proofs I give you that I am your friend. Why must political
differences beget such bitterness towards me in your hearts?" And
his appeal was to father and daughter alike.</p>

<p>"Sir, once already have I asked you to abstain from political
questions," was the uncompromising answer.</p>

<p>"And I have abstained from them more than you have imagined,
perhaps," replied the young man, stung into some slight show of
heat for the first time. "More than once this week, for instance, I
have on the point of speaking to you about the business that is
engaging you so much these days."</p>

<p>The old man's jaw dropped, and a greyness overspread his face.
It seemed to him in that moment that the Republic was indeed
Argus-eyed, or else it was this soldier who enjoyed that
all-penetrating vision.</p>

<p>"What--what do you mean?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"I did not touch upon the topic because it must have involved us
in arguments that are disdainful to you. Yet, notwithstanding all
your contempt and scorn for me, <i>mon maître</i>, it is I who have
stood between you and the Committee of Public Safety. They might
have asked you some awkward questions about all these comings and
goings of your own and your friends in Niort--your rebel friends,
<i>mon maître</i>, for the Republic is well-informed of whom to
trust and whom to watch."</p>

<p>"I--I have been doing nothing, sir, for which any just tribunal
could proceed against me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But--name of a name!--the Republic does not wait
for men to act. She judges them upon their intentions, and their
intentions can be dragged to light by the sort of inquiries
conducted by the Public Safety."</p>

<p>"Then--then my innmunity?" babbled the old man, very shaken.</p>

<p>"Is due to the fact that I, who am above suspicion, have
guaranteed your good faith. If trouble were to arise from
negligence pursuant upon my sponsorship"--the Colonel made a
gesture with the edge of his hand across his throat--"I should have
to pay. I mention this only that you may not continue to account me
a fool, and that you may spare me your little forensic sarcasms at
my opinions and your sneers at the respect and goodwill I profess
to bear you." He paused a moment, looking squarely at his pale and
shaken host.</p>

<p>Himself he led a change of conversation but with only
indifferent success, and no sooner were father and daughter alone
once more than they reverted to the topic. It was Madeleine who led
the way to it.</p>

<p>"I spoke the other day," she said, "of the debt under which we
stand to Colonel Babylas. I little knew at the time--nor did you,
my father--the full extent of that debt. But we know it now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Falgoux gloomily, "we know it now."</p>

<p>"It is plain from what the Colonel has said that if you succeed
in your plot it is due solely to the immunity he has procured you
from arrest, thanks to his having screened you from the suspicion
that was already pointing to you."</p>

<p>"Well?" his voice was as harsh and irritable as hers was calm
and judicial.</p>

<p>"It is no less plain that the Colonel's ruin, and no doubt his
life, will be the price he will have to pay for his generosity. Can
you consent to that?"</p>

<p>He rose in agitation. Two hectic spots were burning on his livid
cheeks. He spoke in exasperation more bitter because he was
conscious of the injustice of his only conceivable defence.</p>

<p>"What choice have I? Am I to sacrifice my King and my faith
because the Colonel is a fool?"</p>

<p>"His only folly," she insisted, "is the folly of
generosity."</p>

<p>"And nothing else?" he challenged her, glaring almost fiercely.
"Say rather that it is the folly of love-sickness." He grew
reckless in his frenzy to justify himself. "Is it out of
consideration for me do you suppose, that Babylas has done what he
has done? Heaven knows he has no reason for such self-sacrificing
affection. I have no doubt he would have handed me over to the
Committee of Public Safety a week ago but for the circumstance that
I have a daughter--a daughter who is weak enough to urge me to be
unfaithful to all that I hold sacred because--"</p>

<p>"Stop!" she bade him, rising in her turn. And stop he did,
realising a little late that he was not taking the right tone, that
in endeavouring to avoid the path of one danger he was plunging
into that of another still more grave.</p>

<p>"You cannot," she said, "be unconscious of the injustice of your
words. If you are, then I can prove it to you. Lest he should
suspect that M. Cadouin's visits had a political significance, I
informed him that M. Cadouin was the husband you had chosen for me,
leaving him to assume that if M. Cadouin risked his life to get
through the Republican lines it was simply through the
impetuosity--of a lover--that he came to see me, in short."</p>

<p>Her father stared at her, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"You let him believe that, and yet he--"</p>

<p>"And yet he bade me warn M. Cadouin that his duty had compelled
him to increase the guard, lest others with other intentions should
penetrate hither as M. Cadouin has done. You may conclude from that
whether it is merely consideration for me, or the hope of winning
me, that has dictated the generosity of his behaviour towards
you."</p>

<p>But although she used the argument to convince her father, and
did in part convince him, yet she did not convince herself. What
Maître Falgoux had said she held to be the true explanation of the
Colonel's conduct, an explanation that might never have occurred to
her had he not rashly thrust it under her notice. It increased her
loathing of the thing that was plotted.</p>

<p>Was Babylas' affection indeed so profound, sincere, and
self-denying that for her sake he shielded not only her father who
had ever been hostile to his wooing of her, but even the very man
whom she had given him reason to suppose was her lover? And was his
life to pay the price of his devotion to her?</p>

<p>The matter seemed whittled down to a personal one between
herself and him. It was his affection for her--no less--that
afforded the foundation upon which it had been possible to
construct a conspiracy that must involve his ruin. The realisation
of this filled her with horror. Her every instinct was to warn him.
Yet she realised that to do so she must betray the cause which was
her religion--indeed of which her actual religion was part--and
must deliver up her father to the merciless tribunal of the
Convention. If only she had been spared the knowledge of what was
hatching. If only she had not had the mischance to stand outside
that door whilst Cadouin had expounded the plot to her father and
enlisted his co-operation. That was the idle wish that haunted her,
driving her to the verge of distraction.</p>

<p>On the evening of Saturday she went to sit by the river,
watching its smooth flow and wondering whether it did not offer her
a way of escape from the mental torture with which she was
afflicted. Her brooding was disturbed by the click of spurs and the
clank of a sabre approaching from the direction of the house. She
did not turn her head, however, until the Colonel stood beside
her.</p>

<p>"Citoyenne," he said gently, "forgive this intrusion which
common courtesy demands. It will be the last you have to endure
from me. I have sought you that I might take my leave of you."</p>

<p>For a moment during which she weighed and realised the
significance of his words, she sat quite still, her head forward,
her whole attitude a little muddled as if under a blow. Then she
looked up sharply, her heart leaping in this sudden and unexpected
relief of an intolerable burden.</p>

<p>"You are departing?" she cried, and there was no mistaking the
gladness that rang in her voice. It was eager and
incredulous--incredulous that thus, as by a miracle almost, her
agonising doubts were all resolved for her. She saw the deepening
gloom of his overcast face, the sudden flicker of his eyelids and
compression of his lips. She perceived how her obvious joy had
wounded him. Pity stirred in her. Poor fellow! Did he but guess the
true sources of that joy, how different might not his feelings
be!</p>

<p>"In view of your satisfaction, citoyenne," he said, smiling a
little bitterly, "it were almost ungracious to express my own
regrets. It were more courteous of me to rejoice that I relieve you
of a presence that is distasteful. Yet you will suffer me to thank
you for the hospitality afforded me here. We are marching on
Fontenay."</p>

<p>"When--when do you go?" she asked. "To-night or to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"On Monday morning, citoyenne. To-morrow I shall be fully
occupied with measures that are to be taken, and I may not have
another opportunity of seeing you."</p>

<p>Her heart had stopped again. She looked dully across the river,
and it seemed to her that the sunlight had grown obscured. Not
until Monday morning! All her satisfaction had been idle, then.
Monday morning would be some hours too late. She spoke her thoughts
aloud.</p>

<p>"Why not until Monday morning?" she asked, and there was a note
of exasperation in her voice.</p>

<p>"There are certain measures to be taken," he repeated. "The
movement has only just been resolved upon. I trust your
satisfaction is not diminished." There was a pause. Then he spoke
again. "Citoyenne, forgive the liberty I am taking on the score of
the good intentions by which I am prompted. Use your endeavours
with your father to induce him to stifle the expression of his
hostility to the Republic. Prevail upon him to be cautious. Let him
harbour aristocratic feelings in his heart, but let him keep the
expression of them from his lips; and let him keep himself clear of
any plottings against the Convention. It is all worse than idle,
and it can but bring him into the gravest peril. Lastly, citoyenne,
if at any time you need a friend, pray do not scruple to use me. I
command some little influence with the members of the National
Convention, and I ask you to believe that I shall never be happier
than when exerting it in your favour--although I pray that the need
may not arise."</p>

<p>"You--you are very kind, monsieur." She spoke the words
mechanically, and a silence followed.</p>

<p>He waited patiently a while. At last, seeing that he waited in
vain--</p>

<p>"Adieu, citoyenne," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Adieu, monsieur," she answered without looking up.</p>

<p>She heard his sigh, and then the crunch of the gravel, and the
click-click of his spurs as he marched away. At last there was
silence. She was completely alone. Huddled there by the river she
sank her head to her arms and fell a-sobbing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>Throughout that fateful Sunday she was alone in the house--save,
of course, for Blaise and his wife. The Colonel had gone betimes to
his duties of preparation for the evacuation of Niort. Her father
had followed very shortly after, and continued absent through that
dreary summer day, no doubt equally busy with the final
preparations for the camisade.</p>

<p>He returned towards sunset, jaded and worn, yet with a flush
upon his prominent cheek-bones and a fanatical glitter in his
little eyes.</p>

<p>His daughter stared at him out of her haunting eyes.</p>

<p>"Where have you been all day?" she asked him, lest from her
silence he might suspect= the fullness of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Serving the King," he growled in answer. He hectored a little
to cover his uneasiness before her.</p>

<p>She professed weariness and withdrew to her room.</p>

<p>Fully dressed as she was she flung herself upon her bed and lay
staring up at the ceiling, faced ever by those two dread
alternatives. However she decided she must loathe and abhor herself
for a traitress all her life. It seemed inevitable to her that she
must choose the alternative that meant passivity, since she felt
that she could never exert the strength to positive action.</p>

<p>She stared at the white ceiling and watched the daylight
gradually fade from it; at last it was no more than a faint grey
blur, and she heard the clocks of Niort striking the hour of ten.
Three more hours, and then--</p>

<p>Soon after she heard steps under her window, which overlooked
the street; they were accompanied by the click of spurs and the
trailing clank of a sabre on the cobbles. There was a knock at the
door. It was Colonel Babylas returning. She heard him enter, and
she reflected with another shudder that he would never leave that
house alive again. The Royalists would come to butcher him in his
bed. That was the return that was to be made for his shielding of
her father. He was to be ruthlessly sacrificed, a victim of the
generosity prompted in him by his love for herself. Yet, unless she
could be false to the cause she honoured, unless she could become a
traitress to her God and King, unless she was prepared to betray
her father and her friends and all those loyal souls who strove to
stamp out this revolutionary madness from distracted France, she
must lie there and suffer this murder to be done, and so by her
passivity become a traitress no less vile.</p>

<p>She heard in snatches, between the opening and closing of a
door, the Colonel and her father in conversation. No doubt her
father would be giving him wine and fair words to lull those
watchful wits of his.</p>

<p>Later, she heard the Colonel coming up to his room--across the
landing opposite to her own. She heard his door close softly, and
the completest silence fell upon the house. Yet her father
continued below. He would not seek his bed that night.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck, and lastly twelve. She counted the
strokes. The Royalists would even now be crossing the river
opposite the meadows of Saint-Pré. She sat up and pressed her hands
to her throbbing temples. After a little while she slipped from the
bed. She crossed to the window, and thrusting it wide she leaned
there listening. No faintest sound came to disturb the stillness of
the summer night. The Republicans slept tranquil and
unsuspicious.</p>

<p>She wondered how far it might yet be from the appointed hour.
She groped her way to the table in the dark, found the tinder-box,
and having kindled a light applied it to a candle. She inspected
the little clock on the overmantel to find that it was exactly
half-past twelve. In that moment inspiration came to her, pointing
out a middle course, by which she might steer between the two
odious alternatives that had tortured her.</p>

<p>She set the candle down upon the table, and stood there in
thought a moment. Yes, the thing could be done. She could warn the
Colonel--but warn him only when there could no longer be time for
him to give the alarm. Thus, whilst he might save himself he would
be too late to save the Republicans. Thus, she assured herself, she
would be neither a traitress to him nor to the cause. Thus, whilst
the cause would prevail he, at least, would not suffer.</p>

<p>In a great surge of thankfulness she hugged that inspiration to
her soul. She went down on her knees by the chair and poured out
her thankfulness in prayer. Then when she rose again it was to
consider more precisely the moment at which it would be wise to
rouse Babylas.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, she thought at first, would meet the case; then,
lest ten minutes should prove too much, she reduced it to eight,
and finally to seven. This would barely give him time. That the
Royalists would not move an instant before the appointed hour she
knew, since the agreement was that the signal should be the stroke
of one o'clock.</p>

<p>She sat down to wait, and the next twenty minutes dragged slowly
on, so slowly that it seemed to her a year before the longer hand
of her little clock pointed to ten minutes to one. She rose, her
heart beating as if it would stifle her. At nine minutes to one she
suddenly grew afraid lest she were running the thing too closely.
Best wake him at once.</p>

<p>She blew out the taper and groped her way to the door. Very
softly she opened it and stood listening, hearing nothing but the
drumming of her pulses. On tip-toe, in her stockinged feet, she
crossed the landing to the door of the Colonel's room. A board
cracked like a pistol shot, and she stood suddenly still with
fluttering breath and straining ears.</p>

<p>But the silence of the house continued and she went on. She
reached the door, and was then suddenly nonplussed. It had been her
intention to wake him in the ordinary way, by knocking on the
panels. Not until now did it occur to her that such knocks must
rouse more than the Colonel.</p>

<p>She must go into the room. She turned hot and cold at the
thought. Then steeled herself with the reflection that a man's life
hung in the balance. Very softly she lifted the latch. The door
yielded. Softly she crept in, her hand brushing the wall. Yet at
the second step a voice challenged her out of the darkness.</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>The Colonel who had schooled himself to sleep on his back so
that both his ears might be clear of the pillow, had awakened
instantly.</p>

<p>"Sh--" she answered him in terror--terror of him and terror lest
her father below should have heard his voice. "It is
I--Madeleine--monsieur. Do not speak--do not make a sound."</p>

<p>She heard him stir, nevertheless, and his quick, "What is
it?"</p>

<p>She advanced yet another step.</p>

<p>"Niort is to be taken by surprise at one o'clock this morning. A
camisade is planned, and the Republicans are to be slaughtered in
their beds. It is seven minutes to one, monsieur. I dared not warn
you before. Escape!" she added. "Drop from your window to the
garden, and go while yet there is time. In seven minutes it will be
too late. Go!"</p>

<p>She turned and crept back to the open door. She heard him
whispering something that she could not catch.</p>

<p>"I have told you all that matters," she muttered urgently. "Make
your escape. You have barely time."</p>

<p>Outside his door she stood listening. Below all was quiet. Her
father had not been disturbed. Behind her she heard soft, swishing
movements, which announced to her that the Colonel was afoot.</p>

<p>She fled back to her own room and fell on her knees by the
bed.</p>

<p>Babylas, wide awake at once, had dressed with the lightning
speed of the campaigner. But there was no panic in his haste. If
for a second under the shock of her news a chill of fear had struck
him, it had quickly been quenched in the glow of the reflection
that she was concerned for his life. Though she might hate the
Republican in him, to the man himself, he argued, obviously she was
not indifferent. He conjectured at once that she had delayed
warning him until the last moment so that he should have no time in
which to give the alarm, and he trembled lest such should indeed be
the case.</p>

<p>It seemed to Madeleine that she had but gone down upon her knees
when a faint but very urgent tapping fell upon her door. She sped
to open, and guessed it to be the Colonel who stood there, although
in the utter darkness she could see no one. His body brushed
against hers as he entered and closed the door. His movements made
no sound, for he carried his boots in one hand and his sabre in the
other.</p>

<p>"What was the arrangement made, citoyenne?" he questioned
urgently.</p>

<p>She gasped and clutched her bosom.</p>

<p>"Go, go!" she panted, whispering. "What can the arrangement
matter now? Save yourself. You cannot hope to save the others."</p>

<p>"So I gather," he answered, glibly conveying the false
impression that he was concerned but for himself. "Yet unless I
know more precisely what is afoot I am likely to run into the
danger in attempting to run from it."</p>

<p>Briefly she told him that Charette's men must already be within
the town, that they would have gained their entrance by the river
and the meadows of Saint-Pré, and that they were to join forces
with the Royalist townsmen in the market-square on the stroke of
one o'clock.</p>

<p>"How on the stroke of one?" he inquired. "Do you mean that the
stroke is to be the signal for the citizens to make for the
market-square?"</p>

<p>"That is it, yes, yes," she answered.</p>

<p>He reflected, then, that thus a few minutes might still be to
his credit.</p>

<p>"Very well, citoyenne," he said. "From my heart I thank you for
the warning and for your thought of me. By your leave, now, I shall
drop from your window. It is not so high."</p>

<p>"But that is the way to the street," she protested.</p>

<p>"Of course. That is why I prefer it."</p>

<p>"Your way lies by the garden and the river. The boat--"</p>

<p>"I cannot gain the garden without being seen by your father who
is below. The light from his window is still upon the lawn."</p>

<p>She drew a sharp breath.</p>

<p>"But this way--" she began.</p>

<p>"Is really the only way, citoyenne. The moments are flying," he
reminded her, whereupon in a panic she swept a sheet from the bed,
meaning to use it as a cord for him. But he never waited for it.
Already he was astride the sill. The street below was utterly
deserted.</p>

<p>He slipped down until he hung at full stretch from the sill. The
distance from the window to the street was something under twelve
feet.</p>

<p>He looked up at her before letting go. Her face was no more than
a grey blur in the gloom. He breathed a word of thanks, and dropped
lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>She leaned out to look after him, and beheld him running down
the street like a hare in the direction of the market-place and the
mairie, and making no sound as he ran, for his feet were still clad
in stockings only.</p>

<p>It was a dishevelled figure, with hair hanging in wisps about
his face and the military coat buttoned awry that burst into the
desecrated church where half his regiment was quartered exactly as
the clock in the belfry struck the hour of one.</p>

<p>Madeleine, still leaning from her window, heard that single
stroke, sounding to her strained imagination as a note of doom, and
her heart tightened with terror. Babylas had but vanished round the
corner, it seemed to her. Inevitably he must run straight into the
arms of the Royalists. She swayed and clutched at the sill for
support. She was stifling, her senses were swimming. He was lost;
her effort to save him had been in vain. And then, as she let
herself drop upon the bed, she fell to reviling herself for her
loyalty to the cause and to her father, which had led her to such
excessive caution. She should have warned him in time, no matter
the cause. What, indeed, mattered King or noblesse to her; what
mattered anything if Babylas were slain?</p>

<p>Thus she came face to face with her real self, stripped of all
pretence, and realised how her love for Babylas--the old love which
she had pronounced dead--had survived his revolutionary apostasy,
and was never more alive than in this hour when she believed him
doomed.</p>

<p>Her anguish made her unconscious of the flight of time. It was
with a shock that presently she recovered from it, aroused by the
sudden realisation that everything continued quiet in the town,
that was yet no sign of the invading party. In a fever of
excitement she returned to the window and looked out. Niort was
apparently all wrapt in slumber.</p>

<p>What had happened? She bethought her that her father still sat
below. Why had he not gone forth?</p>

<p>She kindled a light and consulted her clock to find to her
amazement that already it was half-past one.</p>

<p>She drew a chair to her window and sat down, She would keep
vigil there until it was daylight, and she would pray.</p>

<p>In the blackness of a doorway at one of the corners of the
market-place leaned Colonel Babylas, invisible, waiting and
doubting now. Across the mouths of three streets that debouched
into the market-place he had posted his men in files, each
detachment in command of an officer to whom briefly but
unmistakably he had given his orders of what was to be done. And
there the men waited silent, immovable.</p>

<p>He had acted with all speed, yet it was ten minutes past one
before he had disposed his forces. He had been thankful then for
the slight--but to his own mind entirely typical--lack of
punctuality on the part of the Royalists. Later, he had become
impatient. Now, at last, he was beginning to doubt whether
something altogether other than unpunctuality were not the
explanation, whether Madeleine had been mistaken, almost whether he
were not the victim of some ruse.</p>

<p>It would be a few minutes before two o'clock when at last he
heard a sound to reward him for his patience. Madeleine heard it
too. Indeed, as a preliminary to it, she had heard her father
stirring in the house. She heard him go to the front door, open it
and stand there, looking out. Almost at once one or two other doors
in the street had opened, and, peering from her window, she saw
shadowy forms steal out and slink silently away. Then almost at
once she caught a sound as of water rolling continuously upon a
shore. She recognised it quickly for the muffled marching of the
multitude.</p>

<p>A wild terror seized her then. Had she been mistaken in the
time? Impossible. Were they, then, an hour too late? That, too, was
impossible, for the citizens of Niort, who were acting in concert
with them, were even then in the act of slipping from their houses
to lend a hand in the organised massacre.</p>

<p>And then she understood. The original arrangement had been
altered. Cadouin had found a way to send word that the blow was to
be delivered at two o'clock instead of at one o'clock.</p>

<p>She heard that oddly muffled marching pass down the main street
to the market-square. Then suddenly and sharply upon the night came
the two strokes of the hour, and she wondered, agonisedly, what
would follow. Had Babylas taken her advice and made himself safe,
or had he risked all upon rousing his men?</p>

<p>Her knowledge of him and her very faith in him increased her
terrors. He was not the man to fly. He would never have escaped and
left his men to perish.</p>

<p>And then, as if to confirm these belated, agonised reflections,
she heard shouts in the distance, followed almost immediately by a
crackling, rolling volley of musketry. At that point her senses,
strained beyond their capacity for endurance, forsook her, and she
sank down in merciful unconsciousness upon her bed.</p>

<p>Babylas had seen that shadowy horde of men, still dripping from
their immersion and marching barefooted that they might make the
less noise, come swinging into the market square, their weapons
gleaming lividly in the night. He had heard whispered commands and
had seen them drawn up there awaiting the citizens who were to join
them, but who had already been quietly seized by the Republicans
holding all the avenues of approach save that of the main street
which was the way of Saint-Pré--the way into the trap.</p>

<p>Then Babylas had raised his voice, and it rang out with a brazen
note to startle those conspirators.</p>

<p>"Vive le République!"</p>

<p>It was the signal. On the words, even as the shock of them was
stirring that massed multitude, from each of the three streets
leapt long, jagged lines of fire, and a hail of musketry tore
bloody gaps in that too solid human mass. With cries and oaths the
Royalists broke apart, turning this way and that to seek their
assailants. They formed hastily, automatically, into groups, and
each flung itself towards one of the streets where the marksmen
lurked.</p>

<p>But the soldiers of the Republic had their orders. The men in
the front rank knelt immediately after firing their volley, and
over their heads the second rank emptied their muskets at the
advancing groups, and then knelt in their turn and began to reload
whilst the third rank continued the entertainment. They worked with
the precision of a machine, and scarcely had the third ranks fired
than the first were up again with reloaded muskets, ready to begin
all over again.</p>

<p>It was not, however, necessary. The third volley poured panic as
well as death into the tattered ranks of the rebels.</p>

<p>"Throw down your arms!" Babylas commanded, and down they came
with a rattle, all save a few defiant ones who preferred to die
sword in hand rather than to trust themselves to the mercies of the
Convention.</p>

<p>Torches were quickly kindled, and the soldiers now advanced to
hem in their prisoners.</p>

<p>A few who flung themselves forward found upon the Republican
bayonets the death they sought. But one desperate fellow there was
who, breaking past the soldiers, hurled himself upon Babylas.</p>

<p>It was Cadouin--an infuriated, desperate Cadouin, who had caught
sight of the man he deemed his personal enemy, and sought with fury
to make an end of him before he fell himself. He swung a heavy
sabre in a cutting stroke at the Colonel's head. Babylas, almost
taken by surprise, was no more than in time to deflect the
descending blade. As in his turn he instinctively cut back, he
recognised Cadouin, and sought to arrest the stroke midway. He
robbed it of half its force by that sudden effort, but it was
beyond him altogether to arrest its impetus. So the keen blade cut
through Cadouin's felt hat and stretched him upon the cobbles.</p>

<p>Babylas paused a moment, looking down at him. He uttered a sigh
of regret, and then passed on to attend to the matters that awaited
him.</p>

<p>Thus was Cadouin left to lie among dead and wounded. But he was
not dead and only very slightly wounded. The blow had partially
stunned him, and he was bleeding profusely from a nasty
scalp-wound. But that was the full extent of his injury.</p>

<p>In a very few moments he revived sufficiently to look about him.
The torches shed a lurid light upon that shambles, and to these
were now added the lights of windows overlooking the square. Yet
where Cadouin had fallen he lay in shadow. He took advantage of it
to glide snake-wise towards the mouth of one of the streets. The
distance was short and he covered it unobserved. In the street,
after a careful survey, and seeing that it was clear, he rose under
the shadow of a wall and set off at a trot.</p>

<p>Thus he came panting and almost exhausted to the house of Maître
Falgoux. He found the door open, and reeling across the threshold
he advanced into the house. He passed into room after room, but
found all empty until he came to Madeleine's. He thrust open the
door and there paused, a ghastly, terrific figure.</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux was seated near the bed, his face as hard and
livid as granite. On her knees beside him was his daughter, who had
just made full confession of her deed. With his own hands he who
had given her life would have deprived her of it, but for her
appeal that she had intended no betrayal. And she made the appeal
not that she might save her life from his blind anger, but that she
might save herself from his contempt, that he might think her no
viler than she was.</p>

<p>Having heard all he understood, and, understanding, he sat
there, stricken and hesitating yet upon his course, weighing and
balancing and unable to decide.</p>

<p>To help him in this now came Cadouin.</p>

<p>"God!" he ejaculated. "We have been betrayed. They have mowed us
down, and those that survived are taken. We have been
betrayed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the attorney, his voice hard. "Yes, we have been
betrayed."</p>

<p>"But by whom, monsieur? By whom?" The other advanced, waving his
arms in his fury, and Madeleine instinctively shrank back before
him.</p>

<p>"How was it possible that they should have had word of it? How
comes it that Colonel Babylas was--" Suddenly he checked. His eyes,
riveted upon something near the window, dilated suddenly. A
suspicion that had been steadily growing in his mind was suddenly
turned to certainty.</p>

<p>He strode across the room and picked up a pair of spurred boots
and a sabre lying there, where the Colonel had left them when he
dropped from the window.</p>

<p>"How come these here--here in Madeleine's chamber?" he inquired,
livid, ferocious, his eyes ablaze.</p>

<p>It was in that moment that Maître Falgoux took at last his
decision. The father in him overcame the politician, the Royalist.
He beheld in Cadouin's face and glaring eyes the danger that now
threatened his daughter, and he rose to shield her.</p>

<p>"How come you here yourself?" he asked, with sudden and
unexpected heat. "Do you make so free of my house that no room is
sacred from you? And by what right do you dare challenge my
daughter's--"</p>

<p>"Oh, have done, fool!" roared Cadouin. "Do you not see how
betrayal came? Do you not see that this shameless woman--"</p>

<p>"Leave my house," the attorney commanded him.</p>

<p>Cadouin stood still, staring in amazement. He passed a heavy
hand across his face to wipe away the blood that was trickling down
across it.</p>

<p>"Leave your house?" he echoed dully. "<i>Bon Dieu</i>! Are you,
too, a party to this infamy? By Heaven I'll leave your house, and
next time we come this way in force I'll see that this nest of
treason is razed to the ground." He was in a cold rage now,
deadlier far than his erstwhile blind passion. "I'll leave your
house," he ran on, nodding his head with sneering menace. "I'll
leave your house. I go by the river, in the boat, but I take this
infamous traitress with me to teach her what is due to the King's
cause. I'll keep a watch on her hereafter, to see that she betrays
us no more."</p>

<p>Maître Falgoux with an oath stepped between his daughter and the
man whom he desired for her husband.</p>

<p>"You are out of your senses, monsieur. You had best go at once,
I think." His old eyes were flashing, and there was a glow on his
sallow cheeks. "At once!" he repeated and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>"Would you resist me?" Cadouin laughed. "Stand aside, fool. I
should regret to hurt an old man. But--<i>nom de Dieu!</i>--stand
aside."</p>

<p>He flung forward, to be checked suddenly by a voice from the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Really, Citizen Cadouin, you try my patience too far."</p>

<p>He spun round to behold Colonel Babylas--rather untidy and with
his toes peeping out of stockings that had been reduced to tatters
by the night's work, but nonetheless imperturbable.</p>

<p>He stood arrested, and fear crept gradually into his face and it
turned grey under its smears of blood.</p>

<p>"Once already I have warned you that it is not wise of you to
come a-visiting Maître Falgoux. Still," he ended with a shrug,
"since you are a friend of his--"</p>

<p>"No friend of mine, by Heaven!" cried the attorney.</p>

<p>"No longer, eh? Ha! Still, lest Maître Falgoux should be asked
awkward questions if you were found here--dead or alive--I think
you had better go at once, citizen. I should advise you to go by
the garden, take the boat, and pray for luck to avoid the sentry's
vigilance. You are used to it."</p>

<p>He stood away from the door, and waved a hand towards it in
dismissal of the Royalist. Cadouin stood hesitating a moment,
scarce believing that he was to be allowed to escape with his life.
Then he shuffled forward.</p>

<p>"I should not plan any more camisades, Citizen Cadouin," the
Colonel admonished him. "It's a form of attack that savours more of
murder than of war, and, as you perceive, it is apt to be unlucky
to the camisaders. Bon voyage, citizen."</p>

<p>Cadouin departed, and the Colonel looked about the chamber.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive my intrusion, <i>mon maître</i>," he said, "but
I am looking for my boots."</p>

<p>"You--you came very opportunely, sir," said the attorney, still
shaken from the encounter with Cadouin.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked up with a quick smile. "It is the first time
that it has had the good fortune to happen to me in this house,
ardently though I have desired it."</p>

<p>"I have been a little slow to understand things, perhaps," said
Falgoux. "It has taken me some time to perceive that it is possible
for a gentleman to serve the Republic and for a--a <i>canaille</i>
to serve the King."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, citizen," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>Then he looked at Madeleine, "Have you nothing to say to me,
now, citoyenne?" he permitted himself to wonder.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered, sobbing. "Nothing." And then as if to
prove it she rose and flung herself weeping upon his breast. And
the odd thing is that Maître Falgoux turned aside his head lest he
should intrude upon a matter that was clearly private.</p>
