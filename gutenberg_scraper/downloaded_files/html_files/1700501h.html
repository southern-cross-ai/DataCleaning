    Faces In The Fire</b></h2>
  <p>A  WET Sunday&mdash;dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy. Even the bells ringing the  people into evening service seemed to feel the depressing influence of the  weather, and their brazen voices sounded hoarse and grumbling, as if they rang under  protest. Cold, too!&mdash;not a brisk sharp frost &mdash;for here in Melbourne frost and  snow are unknown; but a persevering, insinuating, gnawing cold, just  disagreeable enough to make one shiver and shake with anxiety to get home to a  bright fire and dry clothes. Overhead a leaden-coloured sky, with great masses  of black clouds, from out whose sombre bosoms poured the steady rain, splashing  noisily on the shining roofs, and swelling the gutters in the streets to  miniature torrents.</p>
  <p>And  then the wind,&mdash;a gusty, chilly wind,&mdash; that came along unexpectedly, and drove  the unwilling rain against the umbrellas of struggling pedestrians, or else  took a mean advantage of its power, and turned their umbrellas inside out, with  a shrill whistle of triumph. The steady light streamed out from the painted  church windows, and the dull, blurred glare of the street lamps was reflected  in the wet pavements. Ugh! a night not fit for a dog to be out in, and yet  there were a good many people hurrying along to the church, in answer to the  clamorous voices of the bells.</p>
  <p>Some  folk, however&mdash;wise in their generation &mdash;preferred staying at home to sitting in  church, with damp boots and a general sense of stickiness about their clothes,  and though possibly their souls suffered from such an omission, their bodies  were certainly more comfortable. Among these godless people, who thus preferred  comfort to religion, were two young men occupying a room on a first floor, the  windows of which looked across to the church, now full of damp and steaming worshippers.</p>
  <p>A  room in a boarding-house&mdash;especially one where boarders only pay twenty-five  shillings a week&mdash;is not generally a very luxurious apartment, and this special  room was certainly no exception to the rule. It was square, with a fairly lofty  ceiling, and the walls were covered with a dull red paper, which, being  mellowed by time, had assumed a somewhat rusty hue.</p>
  <p>It  was rapidly growing dark outside, and there was no light in the room, save that  which came from a roaring coal fire blazing brightly up the chimney, and  illuminating the apartment in a curiously fantastic manner. It sent out red  shafts of light into dark corners, as if to find out what was hidden there, and  then being disappointed, would sink back into a dull, sulky glow, only to fall  into a chaotic mass, and blaze merrily up once more.</p>
  <p>The  apartment wherein the fire played these elfish tricks was furnished  comfortably, but the furniture had a somewhat dingy look. The carpet was  threadbare, except under the table, where there could be traced some vestiges  of its original pattern. A cottage piano was pushed into a corner slanting  ways, and beside it was a great untidy pile of music. At one end of the room, a  desk covered with papers, and immediately above it a shelf containing a small  array of well-worn books. Near the desk stood an aggravatingly bright  sideboard, whereon were some glasses, a jug of water, and a half-empty bottle  of whisky. Four or five lounging chairs of wicker-work were scattered about,  covered with rugs of wallaby fur, whilst the walls and mantelpiece were almost  covered with photographs, mostly of women, but here and there a male face,  showing the well-known features of Beethoven, Chopin, and other famous  musicians.</p>
  <p>This  somewhat incongruous apartment was a private sitting-room in an East Melbourne  boarding-house, and was at present in the occupation of Ezra Lazarus,  journalist. Ezra Lazarus himself was seated at the piano playing snatches of  music, while on the hearth-rug, smoking a pipe, lay a man propped up on his  elbow, with his head resting on his hand, staring into the burning coals, and  listening to his friend playing.</p>
  <p>Ezra  Lazarus was a young man of medium height, with a slender figure, a pale face,  rather dreamy, dark eyes, and black hair and beard carefully trimmed. He  dressed neatly, and, in contrast to most of his race, wore no jewellery. Why he  had become a journalist no one knew,&mdash;himself least of all,&mdash;as his tastes did  not lie in the direction of newspaper work, for having all the Hebraic love of  music, he was an accomplished pianist. As for the rest&mdash;staid in his demeanour,  soft-spoken in his language, and much given to solitary wanderings. Yet he was  no misanthrope, and those who knew him intimately found him a most charming  companion, full of quaint ideas and bookish lore, but he was essentially a man  of ideality, and shrank from contact with the work-a-day world. For such a  nature as this a journalistic sphere was most unsuitable, and he felt it to be  so, but having drifted into such a position, he lacked the energy to extricate  himself from his uncongenial employment, and accepted his fate with oriental  apathy, recompensing himself in some measure by giving every spare moment to  the study of music.</p>
  <p>The  man lying before the fire was the direct opposite of Ezra, both in appearance  and temperament. A tall, sinewy-figured young fellow of six-and-twenty, with  restless keen grey eyes under strongly-marked eyebrows, and a sensitive mouth,  almost hidden by a small fair moustache.</p>
  <p>His  nose was thin and straight, with delicately-cut nostrils, and his head was well  set on his broad shoulders, albeit he had a trick of throwing it back which  gave him a somewhat haughty carriage. He had a fair complexion, with that  reddish-brown hue which comes from constantly living in the open air, and  altogether looked like a man addicted to sport rather than to study.</p>
  <p>This  was Keith Stewart, who, having passed most of his life in Gippsland, and in  wandering about Australia generally, had a year previously come down to  Melbourne with the laudable intention of devoting himself to literature. That  he was poor might be surmised from his shabby, well-brushed clothes, and his  face constantly wore that expression of watchfulness habitual to those who have  to fight the world in their youth and be on their guard against everyone.</p>
  <p>That  two such dissimilar natures as these could find any reciprocity appears  strange, but curiously enough some undercurrent of sympathy had drawn them  together from the first time they met. Jew and Gentile, musician and student,  different nationalities, different trains of thought, yet the mere fact that  they could both live in an ideal world of their own creation, heedless of the  restless life which seethed around, seemed to form a bond of concord between  them, and their mutual isolation drew them almost imperceptibly together.</p>
  <p>Keith  had only been boarding in the house a week, consequently Ezra knew nothing  about his friend&rsquo;s life, beyond the fact that he was poor and ambitious. As  Stewart never volunteered any information about himself, Ezra, with the  delicacy of a sensitive nature, shrank from forcing himself on his confidence.  The inexhaustible subjects of books and music, a walk by the banks of the  Yarra, or an occasional visit to the theatre, had been, so far, the limit of their  social companionship. Their inner selves were still unknown to each other. To  all, however, there comes a moment when the desire to unburden the mind to a  sympathetic nature is strong, and it was in such a moment that Ezra Lazarus  first learned the past life of Stewart.</p>
  <p>On  this dreary Sunday night Ezra let his fingers wander over the piano, vaguely  following his thoughts, and the result was a queer mingling of melodies &mdash; now a  bizarre polonaise of Chopin, with its fantastic blending of patriotic joy and  despairing pain, then a rush of stormy chords, preluding a Spanish dance,  instinct with the amorous languor and fierce passion of the south. Outside, the  shrill wind could be heard sweeping past, a sheet of rain would lash wildly  against the windows, and at intervals the musical thunder of the organ sounded  from the adjacent church.</p>
  <p>Keith  smoked away steadily and listened drowsily to the pleasant mingling of sounds,  until Ezra began to play the Traviata music, with its feverish brilliancy and  undercurrent of sadness. Then he suddenly started, clenched his hand, and  taking his pipe from his mouth, heaved an impatient sight, upon hearing which,  Lazarus stopped playing, and turned slowly round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  link of memory?&rdquo; he said, in his soft voice, referring to the music.</p>
  <p>Stewart  replaced his pipe, blew a thick wreath of smoke, and sighed again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he replied, after a pause; &ldquo;it recalls to me&mdash;a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  laughed half sadly, half mockingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  the Eternal feminine of George Sand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  sat up cross-legged in front of the fire and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be cynical old chap,&rdquo; he said, glancing round; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of hearing the  incessant railing against women&mdash;good heavens! are we men so pure ourselves,  that we can afford to cast stones against the sex to which our mothers and  sisters belong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not mean to be cynical,&rdquo; replied Ezra, clasping his hands round one of his  knees, &ldquo;I only quoted Sand, because when a man is thinking, it is generally&mdash;a  woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  a debt&mdash;or a crime&mdash;or a sorrow,&rdquo; interposed the other quickly; &ldquo;we can ring the  changes on all of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is cynical now?&rdquo; asked the Jew, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I,&rdquo; denied Keith, emphatically, drawing hard at his pipe; &ldquo;or if I am, it is  only that thin veneer of cynicism, under which we hide our natural feelings  now-a-days; but the music took me back to the time when &lsquo;Plancus was consul&rsquo;&mdash;  exactly twelve months ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  Plancus is consul still; don&rsquo;t be downhearted, my friend; you are still in the  pleasant city of Prague.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant?  that is as it may be. I think it a very disagreeable city without money. Bohemianism  is charming in novels, but in real life it is generally a hunt after what  Murger calls that voracious animal, the half-crown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  after women!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah! Lais and Phryne; both charming, but slightly improper, not to say  expensive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  the other side of the shield,&rdquo; said the Jew gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucretia,  and&mdash;and&mdash;by Jove, I can&rsquo;t recollect the name of any other virtuous woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the lady of the music?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  affianced wife,&rdquo; retorted Stewart curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Ezra thoughtfully, &ldquo;then we have a feeling in common, I am also engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  laughed gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  we both think our lady-loves perfect,&rdquo; he said lightly. &ldquo; &lsquo;Dulcinea is the  fairest woman in the world,&rsquo;&mdash;poor Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  is to me,&rdquo; said Ezra emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; answered Stewart, with a smile. &ldquo;I can picture her, tall, dark, and  stately, an imperial daughter of Judah, with the beauty of Bathsheba and the  majesty of Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  wrong,&rdquo; replied Lazarus dryly, &ldquo;she is neither tall, dark, nor stately, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  exact opposite&mdash;I take your meaning,&rdquo; said Keith composedly; &ldquo;well, my Dulcinea  is like the sketch I have given&mdash;beautiful, clever, poor, and&mdash; a governess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you haven&rsquo;t seen her for a year?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;a  whole twelvemonth&mdash;she is up Sandhurst way trying to hammer dates and the rule  of three into the thick heads of five small brats, and I&mdash;well I&rsquo;m an  unsuccessful literary man, doing what is vulgarly known as &lsquo;a perish.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you take up writing?&rdquo; asked Lazarus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made me take up writing?&rdquo; repeated Stewart, staring vaguely into the fire. &ldquo;Lord  knows&mdash;destiny, I suppose&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had a queer sort of life altogether. I was born  of poor but honest parents, quite the orthodox style of thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  your parents alive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  laconically.</p>
  <p>There  was a pause of a few moments, during which time Keith was evidently deep in  thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;According  to Sir Walter Scott,&rdquo; he observed at length, &ldquo;every Scotchman has a pedigree. I&rsquo;ve  got one as long as the tail of a kite, only not so useful. I&rsquo;d sell all my  ancestors, as readily as Charles Surface did his, for a few pounds. My people  claim to be connected with the royal Stewarts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  name is spelt differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  spelt correctly,&rdquo; retorted Keith coolly, &ldquo;in the good old Scottish fashion; as  for the other, it&rsquo;s the French method acclimatised by Mary Stuart when she  married the Dauphin of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  now I know your pedigree, what is the story of your life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  life?&mdash;oh! I&rsquo;m like Canning&rsquo;s knife-grinder.&lsquo;Story, I&rsquo;ve got none to tell.&rsquo; My  father and mother found royal descent was not bread and butter, so they sold  the paternal acres and came out to Australia, where I was born. The gold fever  was raging then, but I suppose they inherited the bad luck of the Stewarts, for  they did not make a penny; then they started a farm in Gippsland and ruined  themselves. My father died of a broken heart, and my mother soon followed, so I  was left an orphan with next to nothing. I wandered all over Australia, and did  anything that turned up. Suppressing the family pride, I took a situation in a  Sandhurst store, kept by a man called Proggins, and there I met Eug&eacute;nie  Rainsford, who, as I told you, taught the juvenile Progginses. I had a  desultory sort of education from my father, and having read a good deal, I  determined to take to literature, inspired, I suppose, by the poetic melancholy  of the Australian bush. I wrote poetry with the usual success; I then went on  the stage, and found I wasn&rsquo;t a heaven-born genius by any means, so I became a  member of the staff of a small country paper, wrote brilliant articles about  the weather and crops, varied by paste-and-scissors&rsquo; work. Burned the midnight  oil, and wrote some articles, which were accepted in Melbourne, so, with the  usual prudence of genius, I threw up my billet and came down here to set the  Thames, or rather the Yarra, on fire. Needless to remark, I didn&rsquo;t succeed or I  shouldn&rsquo;t be here, so there is my history in a nutshell.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Miss Rainsford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I engaged myself to her before I left Sandhurst,&rdquo; said Keith, his face growing  tender, &ldquo;bless her&mdash;the letters she has written me have been my bulwark against  despair&mdash;ah! what a poor devil a man is in this world without a good woman&rsquo;s  love to comfort him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you doing anything now?&rdquo; said Ezra thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  I&rsquo;m leading a hand-to-mouth, here-to-day-gone-to-morrow existence. I&rsquo;m a  vagabond on the face of the earth, a modern Cain, Bonnie Prince Charlie in  exile&mdash;the infernal luck of my royal ancestors still sticks to me, but, ah, bah!&rdquo;  shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more, old chap, we can resume  the subject to-morrow, meanwhile play me something. I&rsquo;m in a poetic mood, and  would like to build castles in the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  laughed, and, turning to the piano, began to play one of Henselt&rsquo;s morceaux, a  pathetic, dreamy melody, which came stealing softly through the room, and  tilled the soul of the young man with vague yearnings.</p>
  <p>Staring  idly into the heart of the burning coals, he saw amid the bluish flames and red  glimmer of the fire a vision of the dear dead days of long ago&mdash;shadows  appeared, the shadows of last year.</p>
  <p>A  glowing sunset, bathing a wide plain in delicate crimson hues; a white gate  leading to a garden bright with flowers, and over the gate the shadow of a  beautiful woman stood talking to the shadow of a man &mdash;himself.  Mnenosyne&mdash;saddest of deities &mdash;waved her wand, and the shadows talked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when will you come back, Keith?&rdquo; asked the girl shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I am a great man,&rdquo; replied the other shadow proudly. &ldquo;I am riding forth like  Poe&rsquo;s knight in search of El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;El  Dorado is far away,&rdquo; returned the sweet voice of the girl; &ldquo;it is the Holy  Grail of wealth, and can never be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will find it,&rdquo; replied the man shadow hopefully. &ldquo;Meanwhile, you will wait and  hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will wait and hope,&rdquo; replied the girl, smiling sadly; and the shadows parted.</p>
  <p>The  rain beat steadily against the panes, the soft music stole through the room,  and Stewart, with idle gaze, stared into the burning heart of the fire, as if  he expected to find there the El Dorado of his dreams.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    Keith Meets With An Adventure</b></h2>
  <p>AFTER  a storm comes a calm; so next morning the sun was shining brightly in the blue  sky, and the earth had that clean, wholesome appearance always to be seen after  heavy rains. The high wind had dried the streets, the drenched foliage of the  trees in the Fitzroy Gardens looked fresh and green, and there was a slight  chilliness in the atmosphere which was highly invigorating. Indeed, it was like  a spring morning, mildly inspiriting; whilst all around there seemed to be a  pleasant sense of new-born gladness quickening both animal and vegetable life.</p>
  <p>After  breakfast, Ezra, who was going to the office of <i>The Penny Whistle</i>, the paper for which he worked, asked Keith to  walk into town with him, and, as the young man had nothing particular to do, he  gladly assented. They strolled slowly through the gardens, admiring the  glistening green of the trees, the white statues sharply accentuated against  their emerald back-ground, and the vivid dashes of bright colour given by the  few flowers then in bloom.</p>
  <p>Stewart  appeared to have quite recovered from his megrims of the previous night, and  strolled gaily along, every now and then inhaling a long breath of the keen  air. Ezra, who was watching him closely, saw from his actions his intense  appreciation of his surroundings, and was satisfied that the young man  possessed in a high degree that poetical instinct which has such an affinity  with the joyousness or gloom of Nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  this is a morning when it is good to live,&rdquo; said Keith brightly. &ldquo;I always  envied the satyrs and dryades of heathendom, with their intense animal  enjoyment of Nature &mdash; not sensuality, but exuberant capability of enjoying a  simple life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  that with which Hawthorn endowed Donatallo?&rdquo; suggested Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Donatallo!&rdquo; said Stewart, with a sigh; &ldquo;he is a delightful illustration of the  proverb, &lsquo;Where ignorance is bliss&rsquo;&mdash;he was happy till he loved&mdash;so was Undine  till she obtained a soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have read a great deal?&rdquo; observed Lazarus, looking at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  faith; my reading has been somewhat desultory,&rdquo; replied Stewart carelessly. &ldquo;All  is fish that comes to my net, and the result is a queer jumble of information;  but let us leave this pleasant gossiping, and come down to this matter-of-fact  world. How do you think I can better my position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly know as yet,&rdquo; replied the Jew, thoughtfully caressing his beard; &ldquo;but if  you want immediate work, I can put you in the way of obtaining employment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Literary  work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately  no&mdash;a clerkship in a&mdash;a&mdash;well, an office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!  I hate the idea of being cribbed and confined in an office; it&rsquo;s such an  artificial existence. However, beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers, so tell me all about  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father wants a clerk,&rdquo; said Ezra deliberately, &ldquo;and if I recommended you I  think you could get the position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  And what is your father&rsquo;s occupation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a very aristocratic one,&mdash;a pawnbroker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  stopped short, and looked at his companion in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t imagine you being the son of a pawnbroker,&rdquo; he said in a puzzled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; asked Ezra serenely. &ldquo;I must be the son of some one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but a pawnbroker, it&rsquo;s so horribly un-poetical. Your father ought to have been  a man of letters &mdash; of vague speculations and abstruse theories&mdash;a modern Rabbi  Judah holding disputations about the Talmud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lazarus  shrugged his shoulders, and walked slowly onward, followed by his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear lad, the days of Maimonides are past, and we are essentially a  money-making race. The curse which Jehovah pronounced on the Jews was the same  as that of Midas&mdash;they turn everything they touch into gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  pleasant enough punishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Midas  did not find it so; but to resume&mdash;my father, Jacob Lazarus, has his shop in  Russell Street, so I will speak to him to-day, and if he is agreeable, I will  take you with me to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;ll get the billet, but the wages  will be small.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  all events, they will keep body and soul together till I find my El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  refer to literary fame, I suppose. How did you first take to writing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you asked me that question last night,&rdquo; said Keith, smiling, &ldquo;and I told  you I couldn&rsquo;t explain. Like Pope, I lisped in numbers, and the numbers came. I&rsquo;ve  no doubt they were sufficiently bad. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why all authors  begin with verse; perhaps it&rsquo;s because rhymes are so easy &mdash;fountain suggests  mountain, and dove is invariably followed by love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you had any articles accepted since your arrival in Melbourne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  or two, but generally speaking, no one acknowledges that a possible Shakespeare  or Dickens is embodied in me. I&rsquo;ve sent plays to managers, which have been  declined on the plea that all plays come from London. I have seen editors, and  have been told there was no room on the press&mdash;publishers have seen me, and  pointed out that a colonial novel means ruination&mdash;encouraging for the future  brainworkers of Australia, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must all serve our apprenticeship,&rdquo; answered Lazarus quietly. &ldquo;The longest lane  has a turning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt; but my particular lane seems devilish long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  laughed, and they walked down Collins Street, watching the crowd of people  hurrying along to business, the cabs darting here and there, and the cable  tramcars sliding smoothly along. Pausing a moment near the Scotch Church, they  heard a street organ playing a bright melody.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  tune is that?&rdquo; asked Keith, as they resumed their walk. &ldquo;Sounds awfully pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Song  from &lsquo;Prince Carnival,&rsquo; &rdquo; replied Ezra, referring to an opera then running at  the Bon-Bon Theatre. &ldquo;Caprice sings it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Caprice. I&rsquo;d like to see that opera,&rdquo; said Keith. &ldquo;You might take me to the  theatre tonight to see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; assented Ezra. &ldquo;You will like Caprice&mdash;she is very charming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if rumour speaks truly, very wicked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Added  to which, she is the best-hearted woman in the world,&rdquo; finished the Jew dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a contradiction,&rdquo; laughed Stewart. &ldquo;Women are always contradictory&mdash;&rsquo;tis a  privilege of the sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  one they take full advantage of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  airy badinage came to an end somewhat abruptly, for just as they arrived near  the Victoria Coffee Palace, they were startled by the shriek of a woman.</p>
  <p>On  the other side of the street a gaudily-dressed girl was crying and wringing her  hands, while a child of about seven years of age was standing paralysed with  fear directly in the way of a tram-car that came rushing down the incline. The  two men stood horror-struck at what seemed to be the inevitable death of the  child, for, though the driver put on the brakes, the speed was too great, and  destruction appeared inevitable. Suddenly Keith seemed to recover the use of  his limbs, and, with a sudden spring, bounded forward and tore the child off  the fatal track, himself falling together with the child to the ground. He was  not a moment too soon, for hardly had he fallen before the car at a slower  speed rolled past, and ultimately came to a standstill at the foot of the  incline.</p>
  <p>Stewart  arose to his feet considerably shaken, his clothes torn and covered with mud,  and a painful feeling in the arm, on which he had fallen. Ezra crossed over to  him, and the rescued child was standing on the footpath in the grasp of the  gaudily-dressed girl who spoke volubly, regardless of the crowd of people  standing by.</p>
  <p>The  conductor of the car came to inquire into the affair, and having found that no  one was hurt, retired, and the tram was soon sliding down the street. The crowd  dispersed gradually, until only the child, Ezra, Keith, and the shrill-voiced  girl were left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  gracious, good &lsquo;eavens!&rdquo; said this young lady, who appeared to be a nursemaid,  and spoke rapidly, without any stops; &ldquo;to think as you should have bin nearly  squashed by that ingine, and all comin&rsquo; of runnin&rsquo; out into the road, an&rsquo;  taking no notice of me as was postin&rsquo; a letter in the pillarbox, not seeing  anythin&rsquo;, thro&rsquo; want of eyes at the back of me &lsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  child, a quaint, thin-faced little girl, with dark eyes and glorious  reddish-coloured hair, took no notice of this outburst, but pulled Keith&rsquo;s coat  to attract his attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, man,&rdquo; she said, in a thin, reedy voice; &ldquo;I will tell mumsey, and she will  say nice things to you, and I will give you a kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  was touched in his soft heart by this naive appeal, and, bending down, kissed  the pale little face presented to him, much to the alarm of the nursemaid, who  lifted up her hands in horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  gracious, good &lsquo;eavens!&rdquo; she piped shrilly, &ldquo;as to what your mar will say, Miss  Megs, I don&rsquo;t know, a-kissin&rsquo; strange gents in the h&rsquo;open street; not but what  he don&rsquo;t deserve it, a-dragin&rsquo; you from under the ingine, as oughtn&rsquo;t to be let  run to spile&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue, Bliggings,&rdquo; said Ezra sharply; &ldquo;you ought to look more carefully  after Meg, or she&rsquo;ll be killed some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  gracious and good &lsquo;eavens!&rdquo; cried Bliggings sniffing, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t Mr  Lazarhouse; and, beggin&rsquo; your pardon, sir, it ain&rsquo;t my fault, as is well known  to you as children will &lsquo;ookit unbeknown&rsquo;t to the most wary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  there,&rdquo; said Lazarus, bending down to kiss Meg; &ldquo;least said, soonest mended; thanks  to my friend here, it&rsquo;s no worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  he ought to git a meddler,&rdquo; asserted Miss Bliggings, on whose feminine heart  Keith&rsquo;s handsome face had made an impression. &ldquo;But, gracious and good &lsquo;eavens,  they only gives &lsquo;em for drowndin&rsquo;, though I never lets Miss Megs go near water,  ingines bein&rsquo; unexpected in their actions, and not to be counted on in their  movin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye,  Meg,&rdquo; said Lazarus, cutting short Bliggings in despair. &ldquo;Tell your mamma I&rsquo;ll  call and see her about this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  bring the man,&rdquo; said Meg, glancing at Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and bring the man,&rdquo; repeated Ezra, upon which Meg, being satisfied, made a  quaint-like curtsey to both men, and was going away, when she suddenly came  back, and pulling Keith&rsquo;s coat till he bent down, put her arms round his neck  and kissed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey  will be nice,&rdquo; she murmured, and then trotted quietly off with Bliggings, who  kept expressing her opinion that, &ldquo;Oh! gracious, good &lsquo;eavens! she was red up  to her eyes at such conduct,&rdquo; a somewhat unnecessary assertion, seeing her  complexion was permanently the colour of beetroot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  into Lane&rsquo;s Hotel and have a glass of brandy,&rdquo; said Ezra, when Meg and her  attendant had disappeared; &ldquo;you need it after the shaking you have had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the child&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Keith, as he went into the bar. &ldquo;You seem to know  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  laughed softly, and ordered a glass of brandy for his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  curious way Fate has of working,&rdquo; he said, rather irrelevantly. &ldquo;She has played  into your hands to-day, for that child is Kitty Marchurst&rsquo;s, better known as &lsquo;Caprice.&rsquo;  &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know she had a child,&rdquo; said Keith. &ldquo;Who is the father? Is she married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  she is not married. As to the father, it&rsquo;s a long story; I&rsquo;ll tell you all  about it some day. Meanwhile, you have done her a service she will never  forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much  good it will be to me,&rdquo; said Keith disbelievingly</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  exactly hit it,&rdquo; replied Ezra composedly. &ldquo;She can do you a great deal of good,  seeing that she is the reigning favourite of the stage at present. I will  introduce you to her to-night, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  shrugged his shoulders, and replied slowly,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best friend an ambitious man can have is a clever woman; a wiser man than I  made that remark.&rdquo; </p>

    Prince Carnival</b></h2>
  <p>THE  &ldquo;Bon-Bon&rdquo; was the smallest, prettiest, and most luxurious theatre in Melbourne,  and was exclusively devoted to farcical comedy, burlesque, and opera-bouffe,  the latter class of entertainment being now the attraction. There was no pit,  the circle and boxes being raised but little above the level of the stalls. The  decorations were pink, white, and gold, the seats being covered with pale,  rose-coloured plush, with curtains and hangings to match, while the electric  lights, shining through pink globes, gave quite a warm glow to the theatre. The  dome was decorated with allegorical figures representing Momus, the God of  laughter, and Apollo, the God of music, while all round the walls were  exquisitely-painted medallions of scenes from celebrated operas and burlesques.  The proscenium was a broad frame of dullish gold, the curtain of roseate plush,  and on either side of the stage were life-size statues of Offenbach and Planch&eacute;  in white marble. Altogether, a charming theatre, more like a cosy drawing-room  than a place of public entertainment.</p>
  <p>At  the entrance was a high flight of white marble stairs, leading to a wide  corridor, the walls of which were hidden by enormous mirrors, and at intervals  stood white marble statues of the Greek divinities, holding aloft electric  lights. On the one side was the smoking-room,&mdash;a luxurious lounge,&mdash;and on the  other a refreshment bar, all glass and glitter, which was crowded between the  acts by the thirsty patrons of the play.</p>
  <p>Ezra  and Keith arrived about nine o&rsquo;clock, just as the first act of &ldquo;Prince Carnival&rdquo;  was over, and finding the <i>salon</i> tolerably full, Lazarus sat down near one of the small, marble-topped tables,  and lighting his cigarette, proceeded to point out to Keith all the  notabilities present.</p>
  <p>The  first to whom he called Stewart&rsquo;s attention was a group of three. One, a tall,  portly-looking man, with a red, clean-shaven face and black hair, was  irreproachably attired in evening dress, and chatted to a fair-haired youth  with a supercilious smile, and a short, bald-headed old gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see those three?&rdquo; said Ezra, indicating the group. &ldquo;The dark man of the  ponderous Samuel Johnson type is Ted Mortimer, the lessee of the theatre; the  idiot with the eyeglass is Lord Santon, who has come out from London to see us  barbarians, and the apoplectic party with the bald head is no less a personage  than Mr Columbus Wilks, the great globe-trotter, who is going to write a book  about Australia and New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will take him some time,&rdquo; observed Keith, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; said Lazarus coolly. &ldquo;He will run through the whole of Australasia in  a few weeks, be the guest of the governors of the different colonies, and then  give his impressions of our government, politics, trade, amusements, and  scenery in a series of brilliant articles, whose truth and accuracy will be quite  in accordance with the time which he has taken to collect his materials.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he cannot judge of things so rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not; but he will view everything through the rose-coloured spectacles of  champagne and adulation, so his book will depict our land as a kind of  nineteenth-century Utopia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Lord Santon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  hereditary legislator, who is being <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> for his title, and will go back to his ancestral halls with the firm conviction  that we are a kind-hearted race of&mdash;savages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are severe,&rdquo; said Keith, in an amused tone; &ldquo;you ought to give a lecture,  entitled &lsquo;Men I have noticed;&rsquo; it would certainly draw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  all the women, not the men; they don&rsquo;t care for hearing remarks about  themselves: but there is the bell for the rising of the curtain, so we had  better go to our seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  left the now empty <i>salon</i>, and went  into the dress circle, which holds the same rank in the colonies as the stalls  do in the London theatres. Though the house was crowded, they succeeded in  getting excellent seats, being, in fact, those always reserved for the critics  of <i>The Penny Whistle</i>. The orchestra  played a lively waltz, to which the gods in the gallery kept time, and then the  curtain drew up on a charming scene, representing a square in Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prince  Carnival&rdquo; was one of those frivolous French operas with a slightly naughty  plot, witty dialogue, brilliant music, and plenty of opportunity for gay  dresses and picturesque scenery. The principals and chorus consisted mostly of  girls, with just a sprinkling of men, so that their deeper voices might balance  the shrillness of those of the women. Of the plot, the least said the better,  as it was merely a string of intrigues, connected by piquant couplets and  sparkling choruses, with occasional ballets intervening.</p>
  <p>As  far as Keith could gather, it had something to do with the adventures of the  quack Cagliostra in Rome, who was the comic man of the play, and figured in  various disguises, the most successful being that of a prominent politician.  Cagliostra tries to gain the affections of a young girl beloved by a mountebank  called Prince Carnival, who thwarts him all through the play. The second act  was the carnival at Rome, and a crowd of masquers were singing a riotous chorus  and pelting one another with flowers. Suddenly, during a lull in this fantastic  medley, a high, clear voice was heard executing a brilliant shake, and  immediately afterwards Caprice bounded gaily on to the stage, singing a  melodious waltz song, to which the masquers moved in measured time.</p>
  <p>She  was dressed in a harlequin costume, a mask on her face, a fool&rsquo;s baton in her  hand, and innumerable silver bells hanging from her cap and dress, which  jingled incessantly as she danced. But what attracted Keith&rsquo;s attention were  the diamonds she wore&mdash;several stars and a necklace. She seemed one splendid  blaze of jewels, and his eyes ached watching their flash and glitter during the  rapid gyrations of her restless figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  those paste jewels?&rdquo; he asked Ezra, in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paste!&rdquo;  echoed that young man, with a soft, satirical laugh. &ldquo;Caprice wear paste jewels!  Ask the men she&rsquo;s ruined where all their thousands went &mdash;where all their lands,  horses, shares, salaries, disappeared to! Paste! Bah! my dear fellow, you don&rsquo;t  know the number of ruined homes and broken hearts those diamonds represent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  act proceeded; the dialogue scintillating with wit, and the choruses becoming  more riotous. Intrigue followed after intrigue, and situation after situation,  in all of which Caprice was the central figure, until the climax was reached,  in a wild bizarre chorus, in which she danced a vigorous cancan with  Cagliostra, and finished by bounding on his shoulders to form the tableau as  the curtain fell, amid the enthusiastic applause of the audience.</p>
  <p>Ezra  and Stewart went out into the smoking-room to light their cigarettes, and heard  on all sides eulogies of Caprice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d  make her fortune on the London stage,&rdquo; said Santon to Mortimer. &ldquo;Got such a lot  of the devil in her&mdash;eh? &mdash; by Jove! Why the deuce don&rsquo;t she show in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  replied Mortimer shrewdly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let her go if I can help it. Don&rsquo;t  tempt away my only ewe lamb, when you&rsquo;ve got so many flocks of your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t look much like a lamb,&rdquo; said Columbus Wilks dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she doesn&rsquo;t belie her looks,&rdquo; retorted Mortimer coolly. &ldquo;My dear sir, she&rsquo;s got  the temper of a fiend, but she&rsquo;s such a favourite, that I put up with her  tantrums for the sake of the cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  this conversation was going on, Ezra and his friend were smoking quietly in a  corner of the room chatting about the opera, when the Jew suddenly drew Keith&rsquo;s  attention to a tall man talking to a friend in a confidential manner. He had a  thin, sharp-looking face, keen blue eyes, and fair hair and beard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  gentleman,&rdquo; said Lazarus, &ldquo;could probably tell you something about those  diamonds, he is an American called Hiram Jackson Fenton, manager of the &lsquo;Never-say-die  Life Insurance Company.&rsquo; Rumour &mdash; which is true in this case, contrary to its  usual custom&mdash;says he is Caprice&rsquo;s latest fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must have a lot of money to satisfy her whims,&rdquo; said Keith, looking at the  American.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo;  Ezra shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t much actual cash, for he lives far  above his income. However, with a little judicious dabbling in the share  market, and an occasional help from the children of Israel, he manages to get  along all right. Our friend Caprice will ruin him shortly, and then he&rsquo;ll  return to the Great Republic, I presume &mdash; good riddance of bad rubbish for  Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who is that colourless-looking little man who has just come up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is rather washed out, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Ezra critically. &ldquo;That is his assistant  manager, Evan Malton. For some inexplicable reason they are inseparable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  and is Mr Malton also smitten with Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  badly&mdash;more shame to him, as he&rsquo;s only been married for twelve months&mdash;he  neglects his young wife, and dances attendance at the heels of his divinity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  Hiram J&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name, object?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. You see they&rsquo;re both mixed up in speculation, and work together for  their mutual benefit. Malton is the Lazarus&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean myself&mdash;who picks up  the crumbs of love that fall from Mr Dives Fenton&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t last long,&rdquo; said Keith in disgust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will last till Malton gets rid of Fenton, or Fenton gets the better of  Malton&mdash;then there&rsquo;ll be a row, and the weakest will go to the wall. Tell me,  whom do you think will win?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should say Fenton,&rdquo; replied Keith, glancing from the effeminate countenance of  Malton to the shrewd, powerful face of the American.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly;  he is, I fancy, the stronger villain of the two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Villain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I call any man a villain who neglects his wife for the sake of a light-o&rsquo;-love.  As for Fenton, he is the most unscrupulous man I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to be pretty well acquainted with the scandal of Melbourne society,&rdquo; said  Stewart as they went back to their seats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, it is my duty; the press is ubiquitous. But tell me your opinion of  Caprice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Judging  by her acting to-night, she&rsquo;s a devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till the end of this act, and you&rsquo;ll swear she&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  will be correct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both&mdash;she&rsquo;s  a mixture!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  curtain again drew up, amid the shuffling of the audience settling themselves  in their places, and represented a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> in the gardens of Cagliostra&rsquo;s palace, brilliant with coloured lights and  fantastically-dressed people. According to the story, Cagliostra has obtained  possession of his prize, and woos her successfully, when Prince Carnival enters  and sings a ballad, &ldquo;So Long Ago,&rdquo; in the hope of touching the heart of his  false love.</p>
  <p>Caprice,  dressed in a tight-fitting costume of silk and velvet, which showed off her  beautiful figure to perfection, stood in the centre of the stage with a sad  smile, and sang the waltz-refrain of the song with great feeling.</p>
  <p class="verse">For  it was long ago, love,<br>
    That time of joy and woe, love!<br>
    Yet still that heart of thine<br>
Is mine, dear love, is mine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave to the jingling words a touch of pathos which was exquisitely beautiful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe she feels what she sings,&rdquo; whispered Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you knew her story you would scarcely wonder at that,&rdquo; said Ezra bitterly.</p>
  <p>The  song was redemanded, but Caprice refused to respond, and, the clamour still  continuing, she shrugged her shoulders and walked coolly up the stage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  in a temper to-night,&rdquo; said Mortimer to Santon. &ldquo;They can applaud till they&rsquo;re  black in the face, but devil an answer they&rsquo;ll get from her, the jade! She isn&rsquo;t  called Caprice for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so it happened, for the audience, finding she would not gratify them, subsided  into a sulky silence, and Caprice went coolly on with the dialogue. Cagliostra,  repentant, surrenders the girl to Prince Carnival, and the opera ended with a  repetition of the galop chorus, wherein Keith saw the sad-eyed woman of a few  moments before once more a mocking, jibing fiend, dancing and singing with a  reckless abandon that half-fascinated and half-disgusted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a contradiction,&rdquo; said Keith, as they left the theatre; &ldquo;one moment all tears,  the next all laughter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  a spice of the devil in both,&rdquo; replied Ezra cynically. &ldquo;She is the Sphinx woman  of Heine &mdash;her lips caress while her claws wound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had a drink and a smoke together, after which they went round to the  stage-door, as Ezra, in pursuance of improving Keith&rsquo;s fortunes, was anxious to  introduce him to Caprice. Lazarus appeared to be well-known to the door-keeper,  for, after a few words with him, they were admitted to the mysterious region  behind the scenes. Caprice, wrapped up in a heavy fur cloak, was standing on  the stage talking to Fenton. All around was comparatively quiet, as the  scene-shifters having ended their duties for the night had left the theatre.  Stewart could hardly believe that the little golden-haired woman he saw before  him was the brilliant being of the previous hour, she looked so pale and weary.  But soon another side of her versatile nature showed itself, for Fenton, saying  something to displease her, she rebuked him sharply, and turned her back on the  discomfited American. In doing so she caught sight of Lazarus, and ran quickly  towards him with outstretched hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Mr Lazarus,&rdquo; she said rapidly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you! Meg told me all  about her accident to-day, and how narrowly she escaped death. Good God, if I  had lost her! But the gentleman who saved her&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is here,&rdquo; said Lazarus, indicating Keith, who stood blushing and confused  before this divinity of the stage.</p>
  <p>In  another moment, with a sudden impulse, she was by his side, holding his two  hands in her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have done what I can never repay,&rdquo; she said rapidly, in a low voice. &ldquo;Saved my  child&rsquo;s life, and you will not find me ungrateful. Words are idle, but if  actions can prove gratitude, you may command me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the young lady is all right,&rdquo; stammered Keith, as she dropped his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; rather shaken, but quite well,&rdquo; answered Caprice, in a relieved tone. &ldquo;Dear  me, how careless I am; let me introduce you to these gentlemen&mdash;Mr Fenton, Mr  Malton, and last, but not least, Mr Mortimer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  three gentlemen bowed coldly, Fenton in particular, eyeing Keith in a  supercilious manner, which made him blush with rage, as he thought it was owing  to his shabby clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my carriage there?&rdquo; said Caprice, in reply to a speech of Malton&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh, then,  I may as well go. Good-night, everybody. Mr Stewart, will you give me your arm?&rdquo;  and she walked off with the delighted Keith, leaving Fenton and Malton  transfixed with rage, while Mortimer and Ezra looked on chuckling.</p>
  <p>Caprice  talked brightly to her new friend till he placed her in her brougham, then  suddenly became grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  down and have supper with me on Sunday fortnight,&rdquo; she said, leaning out of the  window. &ldquo;Mr Lazarus will be your guide. Good-bye at present,&rdquo; giving him her  gloved hand. &ldquo;God bless you for saving my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  carriage drove off, but not before Keith had seen that tears were falling down  her face, whereat he marvelled at this strange nature, and stood looking after  the carriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  not as bad as they say,&rdquo; he said aloud. Ezra, who was just behind him, laughed  aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew you&rsquo;d say she was an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    Lazarus</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was a very little shop of squat appearance, as if the upper storey had  gradually crushed down the lower. Three gilt balls dangling in mid-air over the  wide door indicated the calling of the owner, and, in order that there should  be no mistake, the dusty, rain-streaked windows displayed the legend, &ldquo;Lazarus,  Pawnbroker,&rdquo; in blistered golden letters. There were three windows in the upper  storey, and these being innocent of blinds or curtains, with the addition of  one or two panes being broken, gave the top of the house a somewhat dismantled  look. The lower windows, however, made up for the blankness of the upper ones,  being full of marvels, and behind their dingy glass could be seen innumerable  articles, representing the battered wrecks of former prosperity.</p>
  <p>Gold  and silver watches, with little parchment labels attached, setting forth their  value, displayed themselves in a tempting row, and their chains were gracefully  festooned between them, intermixed with strings of red coral, old-fashioned lockets,  and bracelets of jet and amber. Worn-out silver teapots were placed dismally at  the back in company with cracked cups and saucers of apparently rare old  Worcester and Sevres china. Dingy velvet trays, containing innumerable coins and  medals of every description, antique jewellery of a mode long since out of  date, were incongruously mingled with revolvers, guns, spoons, cruets, and  japanned trays, decorated with sprawling golden dragons; richly-chased Indian  daggers, tarnished silver mugs, in company with deadly-looking American bowie  knives; bank-notes of long since insolvent banks were displayed as curiosities,  while a child&rsquo;s rattle lay next to a Book of Beauty, from out whose pages  looked forth simpering faces of the time of D&rsquo;Orsay and Lady Blessington. And  over all this queer heterogeneous mixture the dust lay thick and grey, as if  trying for very pity to hide these remnants of past splendours and ruined  lives.</p>
  <p>The  shop was broad, low-roofed, and shallow, with a choky atmosphere of dust,  through which the golden sunlight slanted in heavy, solid-looking beams. On the  one side there was a row of little partitions like bathing-boxes, designed to  secure secrecy to those who transacted business with Mr Lazarus, and, on the  other, long rows of old clothes were hanging up against the wall, looking like  the phantoms of their former owners. At the back, a door, covered with faded  green baize, and decorated with brass-headed nails, gave admittance to the  private office of the presiding genius of the place. The whole appearance of  the shop was gloomy in the extreme, and the floor, being covered with boxes and  bundles, with a little clearing here and there, it was naturally rather  embarrassing to strangers (especially as the bright sunlight outside prevented  them seeing an inch before their noses) when they first entered the dismal den  wherein Mr Lazarus sat like a spider waiting for unwary flies.</p>
  <p>In  one of the bathing machines aforesaid, a large red-faced woman, with a gruff  voice and a strong odour of gin, was trying to conclude a bargain with a small,  white-faced Jewish youth whose black beady eyes were scornfully examining a  dilapidated teapot, which the gruff lady asserted was silver, and which the  Jewish youth emphatically declared was not. The gruff female, who answered to  the name of Tibsey, grew wrathful at this opposition, and prepared to do  battle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  &lsquo;uns knows more nor youngers,&rdquo; she growled in an angry tone. &ldquo; &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t by the  sauce of babes and sucklers as I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be teached.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Old  your row,&rdquo; squeaked Isaiah, that being the shrill boy&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Five bob, and  dear at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Tibsey snorted, and her garments&mdash;a tartan shawl and a brown wincey&mdash;shook with  wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor  a mussy, &lsquo;ear the brat,&rdquo; she said, lifting up her fat hands; &ldquo;why, five poun&rsquo;  wouldn&rsquo;t buy it noo; don&rsquo;t be &lsquo;ard on me, my lovey&mdash;me as &lsquo;ave popped everythink  with you, includin&rsquo; four silver spoons, a kittle, a girdiron, an&rsquo; a  coal-scuttle; don&rsquo;t be &lsquo;ard, ducky; say ten an&rsquo; a tizy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  bob,&rdquo; returned the immovable Isaiah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  Jewesis is the cuss of hus hall,&rdquo; cried Mrs Tibsey, whacking the counter with a  woefully ragged umbrella. &ldquo;You cheats an&rsquo; you swindles like wipers, an&rsquo; I &lsquo;ates  the sight of your &lsquo;ook noses, I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  &lsquo;ave the boss out,&rdquo; said Isaiah, in a high voice, like a steam whistle, to  which Mrs Tibsey replied in a rolling bass, a duet which grew wilder and wilder  till the sudden opening of the green baize door reduced them both to silence.</p>
  <p>An  old man appeared&mdash;such a little old man&mdash; very much bent, and dressed in a greasy  old ulster which covered him right down to his ragged carpet slippers. He had  white hair and beard, piercing black eyes under shaggy white eyebrows, sharply-cut  features, and a complexion like dirty parchment, seared all over with innumerable  lines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  again?&rdquo; he said, in a feeble Jewish voice. &ldquo;Oh, you devil!&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; here a fit  of coughing seized him, and he contented himself with glaring at Mrs Tibsey,  upon which he was immediately confronted by that indomitable female, who seized  the teapot and shook it in his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  bob!&rdquo; she shrieked; &ldquo;five bob for this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  much&mdash;far too much,&rdquo; said Lazarus in dismay; &ldquo;say four, my dear, four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten;  I want ten,&rdquo; said Mrs Tibsey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; four; you say ten, but you mean four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  six.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take it,&rdquo; said Mrs Tibsey, dashing it down in wrath, &ldquo;and the devil take you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  in good time&mdash;all in good time,&rdquo; chuckled the old man, and disappeared through  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, you oughter &lsquo;ave taken the five,&rdquo; sniggered Isaiah, making out the  pawnticket. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s four bob, don&rsquo;t spend it in drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  drink, you hugly himp,&rdquo; said the lady, sweeping the money into her capacious  pocket, where it reposed in company with an empty gin bottle; &ldquo;me drink, as  takes in washin&rsquo; and goes hout nussin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; was quite the lady afore I fell  into the company of wipers; me dr&mdash; well,&rdquo; and, language failing her, Mrs Tibsey  sailed majestically out of the shop, coming into collision with Ezra and Keith,  who were just entering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  whirlwind in petticoats,&rdquo; said Keith, startled by this ragged apparition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Askin&rsquo;  your parding, gents both,&rdquo; said Mrs Tibsey, dropping a very shaky curtsey, &ldquo;but  a young limb h&rsquo;insides bin puttin&rsquo; my back hup like the wrigglin&rsquo; heel &lsquo;e h&rsquo;are,  and if you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to pop anythink, don&rsquo;t let it be a silver teapot, &lsquo;cause  old Sating h&rsquo;inside is the cuss of orphens and widders,&rdquo; and, having relieved  her mind, Mrs Tibsey flounced indignantly away to refresh herself with her  favourite beverage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Complimentary  to your parent,&rdquo; observed Keith, as they entered the shop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they&rsquo;re much worse sometimes,&rdquo; said Ezra complacently. &ldquo;Isaiah, where&rsquo;s my  father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  &lsquo;is room,&rdquo; replied Isaiah, resuming the reading of a sporting newspaper.</p>
  <p>Ezra  opened the green baize door without knocking, and entered, followed by Keith. A  small square room, even dingier than the shop. At one side a truckle bed pushed  up against the wall, and next to it a large iron safe. A rusty grate, with a  starved-looking fire, had an old battered kettle simmering on its hob. At the back  a square dirty-paned window, through which the light fell on a small table  covered with greasy green cloth, and piled up with papers. At this table sat  old Lazarus, mumbling over some figures. He looked up suddenly when the young  men entered, and cackled a greeting to his son, after which effort he was  seized with a violent fit of coughing, which seemed to shake him to pieces. The  paroxysm having passed, he began to talk in his feeble, Jewish voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He,  he! my dear,&rdquo; looking sharply at Keith, &ldquo;is this the young man you spoke of?  Well, well &mdash;too good-looking, my dear&mdash;the women&mdash;ah, the women, devil take &lsquo;em,  they&rsquo;ll be turning his head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  his own business, not yours,&rdquo; said Ezra curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He,  he! but it is my business&mdash;they&rsquo;ll love him, and love means presents&mdash;that means  money &mdash;my money&mdash;I can&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rather severe, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Keith, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t  tell a man&rsquo;s character altogether by his face&mdash;good looks do not invariably mean  libertine principles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I know, I know!&rdquo; muttered Lazarus, rubbing his hands together; &ldquo;well, well, can  you keep books?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have been accustomed to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you honest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  generally considered so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He,  he! that&rsquo;s not saying much. What wages do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  pounds a week,&rdquo; said Stewart modestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, my dear, what a large sum; say two, my dear, two pounds, or forty  shillings, it&rsquo;s very large; you can save out of two pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you think so,&rdquo; said Keith dryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my doubts on the subject;  however, beggars must not be choosers, so I agree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  trial, mind on trial,&rdquo; muttered the old man cautiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  quite agreeable,&rdquo; replied Keith complacently, hoping that by the time his trial  is over he would be on the staff of some paper. &ldquo;What are the hours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine,  my dear,&rdquo; said Lazarus, stroking his beard, &ldquo;nine till six, with half-an-hour  for something to eat in the day&mdash;a bun and a cup of coffee &mdash;don&rsquo;t be  extravagant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t very well be, on such a salary,&rdquo; replied Stewart. &ldquo;Well, Mr Lazarus, as  it&rsquo;s all settled, I&rsquo;ll come at nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes! quite right; but no horse-racing, no gambling, no women&mdash;they&rsquo;re the devil,  my dear, the devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  rather hard on the sex, father,&rdquo; said Ezra satirically, &ldquo;considering how useful  they are to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!  quite right, quite right,&rdquo; chuckled the old man. &ldquo;Oh, I know fine ladies; they  come to old Lazarus for money&mdash;to sell diamonds&mdash;ah, my dear, there&rsquo;s lots of  diamonds in that safe, he, he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you&rsquo;re not afraid of being robbed,&rdquo; said Keith.</p>
  <p>The  old man looked up with a sudden gleam of suspicion in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; I keep the keys under my pillow, and I&rsquo;ve got a pistol. I can fire it, oh,  yes, I can fire it, then the neighbours, my dear, all round; oh, I&rsquo;m quite safe&mdash;yes,  yes, quite safe; no one would hurt old Lazarus. How&rsquo;s Esther, my dear?&rdquo; turning  suddenly to his son.</p>
  <p>Esther  was the girl to whom Ezra was engaged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I took her the other night to see Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  cried old Lazarus, lifting up his hands. &ldquo;Oh, dear, dear, what a woman. I know  her, oh, I know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Personally?&rdquo;  asked Keith, whereupon Mr Lazarus suddenly became deaf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, a fine woman; ruins everybody, ruins &lsquo;em body and soul, and laughs at &lsquo;em,  like the fiend she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  looked at his paternal relative in disgust, and took Keith&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  boy, good boy,&rdquo; muttered his parent, nodding his head, &ldquo;make money, my dear,  make &mdash;&rdquo; here another fit of coughing interrupted him, and Ezra hurried Keith  away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo;  said Ezra, lifting up his hat when they were in the street; &ldquo;how I hate the  miasma of that place. it&rsquo;s like the upas tree, and kills all who come within  its circle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think your father knows Caprice?&rdquo; asked Keith, as they walked down Bourke  Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  tell you,&rdquo; answered Lazarus coolly; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised&mdash;he knows half the  women in Melbourne. When a spendthrift wants money, he goes to my father; when  a woman is in trouble, she goes there also; in spite of her lovers, Caprice is  such an extravagant woman, that I&rsquo;ve no doubt she&rsquo;s had dealings with my  father. If the secret life of Lazarus the pawnbroker were only written, it  would be very interesting, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad I got the place,&rdquo; said Keith thoughtfully: &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t much, but will keep  me alive till I get on my feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure to drop into a newspaper appointment,&rdquo; replied Ezra, &ldquo;and of course I  will do my best for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  very good,&rdquo; answered Keith gratefully; &ldquo;ha, ha, what queer tricks the jade  Fortune plays us. I come to Melbourne full of poetic dreams, and find my fate  in a pawnbroker&rsquo;s office&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t romantic, but it&rsquo;s bread and butter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not the first poet who has gone to the pawnbroker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect I&rsquo;m the first that ever went on such good terms,&rdquo; retorted Keith  shrewdly. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    A Woman&rsquo;s Appeal</b></h2>
  <p>ACCORDING  to some writer, &ldquo;Human beings are moulded by circumstances,&rdquo; and truly Kitty  Marchurst, better known as Caprice, was an excellent illustration of this remark.</p>
  <p>The  daughter of a Ballarat clergyman, she was a charming and pure-minded girl, and  would doubtless have married and become a happy woman, but for the intervention  of circumstances in the form of M. Gaston Vandeloup. This gentleman, an ex-convict,  and a brilliant and fascinating scoundrel, ruined the simple, confiding girl,  and left her to starve in the streets of Melbourne. From this terrible fate,  however, she was rescued by Mrs Villiers, who had known her as a child, and it  seemed as though she would once more be happy, when circumstances again  intervened, and through her connection with a poisoning case, she was again  thrown on the world. Weary of existence, she was about to drown herself in the  Yarra, when Vandeloup met her, and tried to push her in. With a sudden craving  for life, she struggled with him, and he, being weak for want of food, fell in  and was drowned, while the unhappy girl fled away, she knew not whither.</p>
  <p>A  blind instinct led her to &ldquo;The Home for Fallen Women,&rdquo; founded by a Miss Rawlins,  who had herself been an unfortunate, and here for a time the weary,  broken-hearted woman found rest. A child, of which Vandeloup was the father,  came to cheer her loneliness, and she called the little one Margaret, hoping it  would comfort her in the future. But the seeds of evil implanted in her breast  by Vandeloup began to bear fruit, and with returning health came a craving; for  excitement. She grew weary of the narrow, ascetic life she was leading&mdash;for  young blood bounded through her veins&mdash;and she was still beautiful and  brilliant. So, much against the wishes of the matron of the institution, she  left the place and returned to the stage.</p>
  <p>The  Wopples family, with whom she had previously acted, had gone to America, and  she was alone in the world, without a single friend. She called herself  Caprice, for her real name and history were too notorious for such a public  career as she had chosen. All avoided her, and this worked her ruin. Had one  door been open to her&mdash;had one kind hand been stretched forth to save her&mdash; she  might have redeemed the past; but the self-righteous Pharisees of the world  condemned her, and in despair she determined to defy the world by giving it  back scorn for scorn.</p>
  <p>It  was a terribly hard and dreary life she led a first&mdash;no friends, very little  money, and a child to support. The future looked black enough before her; but  she determined to succeed, and Fortune at length favoured her.</p>
  <p>She  was playing a minor part in a Christmas burlesque, when the lady who acted the  principal character suddenly fell ill, and Kitty had to take her place at a  very short notice. She, however, acquitted herself so well that, with one  bound, she became a popular favourite, and the star still continuing ill for  the rest of the run of the piece, she was able to consolidate the favourable  impression she had made. She awoke to find herself famous, and played part  after part in burlesque and modern comedy, always with great success. In a  word, she became the fashion, and found herself both rich and famous.</p>
  <p>Ted  Mortimer, the manager of the Bon-Bon Theatre, persuaded her to try  opera-bouffe, and she made her first appearance in the Grand Duchess with  complete success. She followed up her triumph by playing the title roles in  Girofle Girofla, La Perichole, and Boccaccio, scoring brilliantly each time;  and now she had created the part of Prince Carnival, which proved to be her  greatest success. Night after night the BonBon was crowded, and the opera had a  long and successful run, while Kitty, now at the height of her fame, set  herself to work to accomplish her revenge on the world.</p>
  <p>She  hated women for the way they had scorned her, and she detested men for the free  and easy manner in which they approached her; so she made up her mind to ruin  all she could, and succeeded admirably. One after another, not only the gilded  youth of Melbourne, but staid, sober men became entangled in her meshes, and  many a man lived to curse the hour he first met Kitty Marchurst.</p>
  <p>Her  house at Toorak was furnished like a palace, and her dresses, jewels, horses,  and extravagances formed a fruitful topic of conversation in clubs and  drawing-rooms. She flung away thousands of pounds in the most reckless manner,  and as soon as she had ruined one man, took up with another, and turned her  back on the poor one with a cynical sneer. Her greatest delight was to take  away other women&rsquo;s husbands, and many happy homes had she broken up by her  wiles and fascinations. Consequently, she was hated and feared by all the women  in Melbourne, and was wrathfully denounced as a base adventuress, without one  redeeming feature. They were wrong: she loved her child.</p>
  <p>Kitty  simply idolised Meg, and was always in terror lest she should lose her.  Consequently, when she heard how Keith had rescued her child from a terrible  death, her gratitude knew no bounds. She heard of the young man&rsquo;s ambitions  from Ezra, and determined to help him as far as it lay in her power. Thus, for  the first time for many years, her conduct was actuated by a kindly feeling. </p>
  <p>The  drawing-room in Kitty&rsquo;s house at Toorak was a large, lofty apartment, furnished  in a most luxurious style. Rich carpets, low lounging chairs, innumerable rugs  and heavy velvet curtains. A magnificent grand piano, great masses of tropical  foliage in fantastically-coloured jars, priceless cabinets of china, and  costly, well-selected pictures. One of her lovers, a rich squatter, had  furnished it for her. When he had lost all his money, and found her cold and  cruel, he went off to the wilds of South America to try and forget her.</p>
  <p>There  were three French windows at the end of the room, which led out on to a broad  verandah, and beyond was the lawn, girdled by laurels. Kitty sat at a  writing-desk reading letters, and the morning sun shining through the window  made a halo round her golden head. No one who saw her beautiful, childish face,  and sad blue eyes, would have dreamed how cruel and relentless a soul lay  beneath that fair exterior.</p>
  <p>At  her feet sat Meg, dressed in a sage-green frock, with her auburn curls falling  over her face, playing with a box of bricks, and every now and then her mother  would steal an affectionate glance at her.</p>
  <p>Curiously  enough, Kitty was reading a letter from the very man who had given her the  house, and who was now dying in a pauper hospital in San Francisco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forgive you freely,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;but, ah, Kitty, you might have feigned a love  you did not feel, if only to spare me the degradation of dying a pauper, alone  and without friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman&rsquo;s face grew dark as she read these pitiful words, and, crushing up the  letter in her hands, she threw it into the waste-paper basket with a cynical  sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  she muttered contemptuously, &ldquo;does he think to impose on me with such tricks?  Feign a love! Yes, kiss and caress him to gratify his vanity. Did I not give  him fair warning of the end? And now he whimpers about mercy&mdash;mercy from me to  him&mdash;pshaw! let him die and go to his pauper grave, I&rsquo;ll not shed a tear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  she laughed harshly.</p>
  <p>At  this moment Meg, who had been building two edifices of bricks, began to talk to  herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo;  said Meg, putting the top brick on one building, &ldquo;is the House of Good, but the  other is the House of Sin. Mumsey,&rdquo; raising her eyes, &ldquo;which house would you  like to live in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the House of Good, dear,&rdquo; said Kitty in a tremulous voice, touched by the  artless question of the child. &ldquo;Come to mumsey, darling, and tell her what you  have been doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg,  nothing loath, accepted this invitation, and, climbing up on her mother&rsquo;s knee,  threw her arms round Kitty&rsquo;s neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had some bread and milk,&rdquo; she said confidentially; &ldquo;then I went and saw my  Guinea pigs. Dotty&mdash;you know, mumsey, the one with the long hair&mdash;oh, he  squeaked&mdash;he did squeak! I think he was hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you been a good little girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good?&rdquo;  echoed Meg doubtfully. &ldquo;Well, not very good. I was cross with Bliggings. She  put soap into my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  naughty to be cross, darling,&rdquo; said her mother, smoothing the child&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;What  makes you naughty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;  said Meg, nodding her head sagely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the wicked spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  laughed, and, kissing the child, drew her closer to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  darling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to give the man who stopped the wheels a present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  would you like to give him, my precious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  took some consideration, and Meg puckered up her small face into a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; she decided at length, &ldquo;the man would like a knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  knife cuts love, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if you get a penny for it,&rdquo; asserted Meg wisely. &ldquo;Bliggings told me; let me get  a knife for the man, mumsey &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, dear,&rdquo; said Kitty smiling; &ldquo;the man will then know my little daughter has  a kind heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg  is a very good girl,&rdquo; asserted that small personage gravely; and, climbing down  off her mother&rsquo;s knee, she began to play with the bricks, while Kitty went on  with her correspondence.</p>
  <p>The  next letter evidently did not give Kitty much satisfaction, judging by the  frown on her face. She had written to Hiram J. Fenton asking for some money,  and he had curtly refused to give her any more. She tore up the letter, threw  it into the waste-paper basket, and smiled sardonically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she muttered angrily. &ldquo;Very well, my friend, there are  plenty of others to give me money if you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment there came a ring at the door, and shortly after the servant  entered with a card. Kitty took it carelessly, and then started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton,&rdquo; she muttered, in a puzzled tone. &ldquo;Evan Malton&rsquo;s wife! what does she  want, I wonder? I thought I was too wicked for virtue to call on me&mdash;it appears  I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  glanced at the card again, then made up her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  the lady in,&rdquo; she said calmly; and, when the servant disappeared, she called  Meg. &ldquo;Mumsey&rsquo;s sweetheart must go away for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; asked mumsey&rsquo;s sweetheart, setting her small mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey  has to see a lady on business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg  collected the bricks in a pinafore, and walked off to the French window, when  she turned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg  will play outside,&rdquo; she said, shaking her curls, &ldquo;and will come in when mumsey  calls.&rdquo; Scarcely had Meg vanished when the servant threw open the door and  announced,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  tall, slender girl entered the room quickly, and, as the door closed behind,  paused a moment and looked steadily at Kitty through her thick veil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton?&rdquo; said Kitty interrogatively.</p>
  <p>The  visitor bowed, and, throwing back her veil, displayed a face of great beauty;  but she had a restless, pitiful look in her eyes, and occasionally she  moistened her dry lips with her tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take a seat?&rdquo; said the actress politely, taking in at a glance the  beautiful, tired face and quiet, dark costume of her visitor</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; replied Mrs Malton, in a low, clear voice, and sat down in the chair  indicated by her hostess, nervously clasping and unclasping her hands over the  ivory handle of her umbrella. She glanced at Kitty again in a shrinking kind of  manner, then, with a sudden effort, burst out quickly,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have called&mdash;I have called to see you about my&mdash;my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty&rsquo;s  lip curled, and she resumed her seat with an enigmatical smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  what about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  you guess?&rdquo; said Mrs Malton imploringly.</p>
  <p>Kitty  shook her head in a supercilious manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at a loss to understand the reason of your visit,&rdquo; she said, in a cold,  measured manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Evan Malton&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said the other rapidly. &ldquo;We have only been married a  year&mdash;and&mdash;and we have one child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  presume you did not call to inform me of your domestic affairs,&rdquo; replied Kitty  mercilessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was so fond of me&mdash;we loved one another devotedly till&mdash;till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  he met me, I suppose,&rdquo; said Kitty coolly, throwing herself back with an amused  laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that complaint before&mdash;you wives never seem to know how to  retain your husbands&rsquo; affections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  him back to me&mdash;oh give him back to me,&rdquo; cried the young wife, clasping her  hands. &ldquo;You have many richer and better than he. I love my husband, and you  have parted us&mdash;oh, do&mdash;do&mdash;give him back to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Mrs Malton,&rdquo; replied the actress coldly, &ldquo;I do not encourage him, I assure  you. He&rsquo;s a bore, and I detest bores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he loves you&mdash;he loves you&mdash;he worships the ground you tread on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  waste of good material; for his devotion will never be rewarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo; said Mrs Malton breathlessly.</p>
  <p>Kitty  rose to her feet, and laughed bitterly &ldquo;Love him&mdash;love any one,&rdquo; she muttered,  with a choking cry. &ldquo;I hate the whole lot of them. Do you think I care for  their flattery, their kisses, their protestations&mdash;bah! I know the value of such  things. Love&mdash;I hate the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  my husband comes here,&rdquo; said the other timidly.</p>
  <p>Kitty  turned on her fiercely &ldquo;Can I help that? Is it the candle&rsquo;s fault that the  moths are attracted? I don&rsquo;t ask your husband to come; if he finds in me what  he misses in you, it is your fault, not mine&mdash;your errand is useless, I cannot  help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned to go, but the young woman sprang forward and caught her dress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall not go&mdash;you shall not!&rdquo; she almost shrieked. &ldquo;You and Fenton are dragging  us both to perdition; he has ruined himself for your sake, and his friend&mdash;God  help him&mdash;his friend has insulted me with words of love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I the guardian of your virtue?&rdquo; said Kitty pitilessly.</p>
  <p>Mrs  Malton stood wringing her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  God, have you no pity? I am a woman like yourself&mdash;my husband should protect me,  but he leaves me for you&mdash;and,&rdquo; in a whisper, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know all&mdash;he has given  you presents, rich presents, and to do so has committed a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  hush!&rdquo; glancing fearfully around, &ldquo;not so loud&mdash;not so loud&mdash;yes, he has  embezzled money, thousands of pounds, for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  gave a cry, and grasped at a chair for support.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;did  not&mdash;not ask him for his presents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but it was for your sake &mdash; your sake. You must help him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo;  laughed Kitty mockingly, &ldquo;help him? Help him!&mdash;help any man! My good woman, if  he went into the prisoner&rsquo;s dock to-morrow, I would not lift one finger to save  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Malton fell on her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my God, don&rsquo;t talk like that!&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;You will ruin him&mdash;you will  ruin him.&rdquo; Kitty swept round with a cold glitter, like steel, in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  it is my business to ruin men. When I was poor, and anxious to lead a good  life, any outstretched hand might have saved me; but no, I was a pariah and  outcast &mdash; they closed their doors against me. I asked for bread, they gave me a  stone&mdash;they made of me a scourge for their own evil doing&mdash;this is the time for  my revenge; fallen and degraded though I be, I can wring their hearts and ruin  their homes through their nearest and dearest, and you come to ask me to  relent&mdash; you, who, if you saw me to-morrow on the streets, would draw your  skirts aside from the moral leper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; moaned the other, beating her breasts with her hands. &ldquo;Have mercy, have  mercy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the manager of the company, Mr Fenton; he is your lover &mdash; he can refuse  you nothing. Speak to him, and see if anything can be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is my child to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  You are a mother&mdash;so am I: you love your child&mdash;I love mine; yet you would make my  innocent child suffer for its father&rsquo;s crime. Oh, if you have any feelings of a  mother, spare the father for the sake of the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  stood irresolute, while the woman at her feet burst into wild and passionate  weeping.</p>
  <p>At  this moment Meg entered the room by the window, and paused for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;why does the lady cry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  would have interposed, but Mrs Malton stretched out her hands to Meg with a  quiet indrawing of her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am crying for my little girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she dead?&rdquo; asked Meg, coming to the kneeling woman, and touching her shoulder.  &ldquo;Poor lady&mdash;poor, poor lady!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  could contain herself no longer. With a sudden impulse, she bent down and  raised the weeping woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do what I can,&rdquo; she said huskily, and sank into a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God!&rdquo; cried Mrs Malton, advancing, but Kitty waved her off, while Meg stood  looking from one to the other in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,  go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Malton bent down and kissed her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  God be merciful to you, as you have been to me,&rdquo; and, without another word, she  departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey,&rdquo;  said Meg, trying to take her mother&rsquo;s hands from her face, &ldquo;were you cross to  the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  darling, no!&rdquo; replied Kitty, drawing Meg close to her. &ldquo;Mother was kind to the  lady because of her little girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  mumsey, dear mumsey; Meg loves you,&rdquo; and she put her arms round Kitty&rsquo;s neck,  while the poor woman leaned her aching head against the innocent breast of her  child, and burst into tears </p>

    The Annoyance Of Hiram J. Fenton</b></h2>
  <p>It  is a curious fact that Melbourne has, in its social and business aspects, a  strong leaven of Americanism, and visitors from the great Republic find  themselves quite at home in the Metropolis of the South. There are the same  bold, speculative qualities, the same restless pursuit of pleasure, and the  same rapidity and promptness of action which characterises the citizen of San  Francisco or New York. Consequently, there are many Americans to be found in a  city so congenial to their tastes, and of these Hiram J. Fenton was one.</p>
  <p>He  had come over from the States as the agent of a dry-goods firm, and, travelling  all through the Australasian colonies, soon saw the enormous capabilities of  wealth that lay before him. Gifted with a ready tongue and a persuasive manner,  he interested several opulent Victorians in a scheme for floating a Life  Insurance Company. A prospectus was drawn up, which promised incalculable  wealth to those who would take shares, and, by means of Mr Fenton&rsquo;s brilliant  command of words, and skilful manipulation of figures, The Never-say-die  Insurance Company soon became an accomplished fact. A handsome suite of offices  was taken in Collins&rsquo; Street, a large staff of clerks engaged, a genial medical  man, whose smile itself was a recommendation, remained on the premises to  examine intending policy-holders, and the emissaries of the company went to the  four quarters of the globe to trumpet forth the praises of the affair, and  persuade people to insure their lives. The company prospered, a handsome  dividend was soon declared, and, thanks to his Yankee sharpness, Mr Fenton now  found himself occupying the enviable position of manager with a large salary.</p>
  <p>He  was a handsome man in a bold, sensual way, with a certain dash and swagger  about him which impressed strangers favourably, but a physiognomist would have  mistrusted his too ready tongue and the keen glance of his eye. There is no  greater mistake than to suppose a villain cannot meet an honest eye, for, as a  matter of fact, a successful villain having his nerves under admirable control  can stare any one out of countenance, and the keen, rapid glance can take in at  once the weak points of a stranger.</p>
  <p>Mr  Fenton occupied pleasant apartments, went into society a great deal, and  altogether was a very popular man. Cold, calculating, and far-seeing as he was,  he had yet a weak spot in his character, and this was extreme partiality for  the female sex. Any woman, provided she was pretty, could twist him round her  finger: and as Kitty Marchurst now had him in her toils, she took full  advantage of his infatuation. There was a certain amount of notoriety in being  the lover of the now famous Caprice; but Fenton had to pay pretty dearly for  his position. Kitty spent his money like water, and when he ventured to  remonstrate, laughed in his face, and told him he could go if he liked, an  intimation which only made him resolve to stick closer to her. Nevertheless,  about this time relations were rather strained between them, and any one  knowing the facts of the case would have seen that the end was not far off.</p>
  <p>As  to Evan Malton, he was Fenton&rsquo;s assistant manager, and was the moon to the astute  American&rsquo;s sun. Weak, irresolute, and foolish, he was, nevertheless, by some  strange contradiction, a capital business man. This arose from his long  training in office work; he could do nothing by himself, but guided by Fenton,  he made an admirable subordinate, and was amenable to his superior in every  way. He admired Fenton greatly, copied him in his dress and mannerisms,  affected a rakish demeanour towards his friend&rsquo;s mistress, and thoroughly  neglected his poor wife, a neglect of which Fenton tried to take advantage. Had  Malton known this, it would doubtless have changed his feelings towards the  American, for though he thought he was justified in leading a fast life, he  strongly objected to his wife showing any liking for any one but himself.  Fenton, however, believing in no woman&rsquo;s virtue, did not despair, but protected  Kitty openly, to delude Malton into a false security, and made love to Mrs  Malton <i>sub ros&acirc;</i>.</p>
  <p>It  was quite warm out of doors in spite of the season, and out on Kitty&rsquo;s lawn  were a group of people laughing and talking together. Kitty, in a comfortable  chair, was chatting to Keith and Ezra, who had just arrived, and there were  several other ladies present, including Milly Maxwell, who was the second lady  at the Bon-Bon&mdash;dark-browed, majestic, and passionate; Dora Avenant, who looked  like a doll and had the brains of one; and Mrs Wadby, who wrote scandal and  dresses for <i>The Penny Whistle</i> under  the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Baby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  to the gentlemen, there were present Ted Mortimer, bland and smiling; Slingsby,  the parliamentary reporter; Delp, the theatrical critic: Toltby, the low  comedian at the Bon-Bon, and about half-a-dozen others, who were more or less  connected with the stage and the press. The men were smoking, chatting, or  drinking, according to their various tastes, whilst the ladies were sipping  their afternoon tea; and, of course, the conversation was mostly about  theatrical matters.</p>
  <p>In  the drawing-room, however, close to the window, sat Meg, buried in a big  armchair, reading a fairy tale, and a pretty picture she made with her little  loose white dress, and her glorious hair falling about her pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the beautiful Princess,&rdquo; read Meg in ecstasy, &ldquo;fell asleep in the Magic Castle  for one hundred years&mdash; oh!&rdquo; breaking off suddenly, &ldquo;how hungry she must have  been when she woke up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg  shook her head over this problem and resumed the story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a great forest grew round the castle, which could not be got through till the  handsome Prince arrived.&rdquo; Here the drawing-room door opened, and Meg looked up,  half expecting to see the handsome prince.</p>
  <p>It  was only Fenton, however, and he disliked Meg intensely, a dislike which that  young person was by no means backward in returning, so she went calmly on  reading her book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  where&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo; asked Fenton, in his slightly nasal voice, looking at the  little figure with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey&rsquo;s  in the garden,&rdquo; replied Meg with great dignity, flinging back her curls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  where you ought to be,&rdquo; said Fenton ill-naturedly, &ldquo;getting fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  reading a fairy tale,&rdquo; explained Meg, closing her book; &ldquo;mumsey said I could do  what I liked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  mother don&rsquo;t rear you well,&rdquo; retorted the American, and he walked away, when a  peal of laughter made him turn round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  funny faces you make,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;I feel quite laughy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to spank you,&rdquo; observed Fenton, with no very amiable expression of  countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a bad man,&rdquo; said Meg indignantly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a badder&mdash;not a bit like my Mr  Keith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  sneered Fenton, &ldquo;and who is Mr Keith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a very nice gentleman,&rdquo; replied Meg, pursing up her lips; &ldquo;he stopped the  wheels going over me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish he hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; muttered Fenton vindictively. &ldquo;Meg, go and tell mother I want  her right away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo;  retorted Meg obstinately; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a rude man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  make you smart,&rdquo; said Fenton, catching her arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  mumsey,&rdquo; cried the child, in a tone of relief, and Fenton turned just to see  Kitty looking at him like an enraged tigress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lay a finger on my child,&rdquo; she said viciously, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  American released his hold on Meg with an awkward laugh, and took a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you teach her manners,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; flashed out Kitty haughtily. &ldquo;And now you are here, I wish to  speak with you. Meg, my treasure, run out and say mumsey won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey&rsquo;s  going to be cross with you now,&rdquo; said Meg consolingly to Fenton, and then ran  out laughing, the man looking angrily after her.</p>
  <p>Left  alone, Kitty sat down near Fenton and began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  asked you for five hundred,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and  I refused,&rdquo; sulkily</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I saw by your letter. What is your reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine  also. Why did you refuse?&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sick of your extravagance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caprice  laughed in a sneering way that brought the blush to his cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I&rsquo;m dependent on you for money?&rdquo; she said, with scorn. &ldquo;I know fifty  better men than you who would give me the money if I asked them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go and ask them,&rdquo; he returned brutally. Kitty sprang to her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I will; that means your dismissal.&rdquo; Fenton caught at her dress in  genuine alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! don&rsquo;t go; you know I love you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  well,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;that you refuse me a paltry five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would give it to you, but I haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  get it,&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  nearly ruined,&rdquo; he cried desperately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  retire, and make room for better men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a devil!&rdquo; hissed Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. I told you what to expect when I first met you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say you will throw me over because I&rsquo;ve no money left?&rdquo; he said  fiercely, grasping her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  an old glove,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  kill you first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  you are melodramatic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Kitty, Kitty!&rdquo; with a sudden change to tenderness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call me by that name,&rdquo; said the woman, in a low, harsh voice. &ldquo;Kitty Marchurst  is dead; she died when she went on the stage, and all womanly pity died with  her. You are speaking to Caprice, the most notorious woman in Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  sat sullenly silent, glancing every now and then at her beautiful, scornful  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you won&rsquo;t give me money,&rdquo; she said at length, mindful of her promise to Mrs  Malton, &ldquo;you can do something else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton was here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton!&rdquo; he interrupted, springing to his feet. &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Several  unpleasant things about your love for her,&rdquo; said Kitty coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; he began, but Kitty shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  I&rsquo;m not jealous; I only care for your money, not for you. But about this visit;  her husband has embezzled money in your office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  turned a little pale, and looked steadily at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Embezzled  money, the scoundrel!&rdquo; he said furiously</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Kitty derisively. &ldquo;Not a noble, upright gentleman like Hiram  Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned from her with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been a good friend to him right along,&rdquo; he said in an angry tone. &ldquo;He was fixed  up for life, if he&rsquo;d only behaved himself; now I&rsquo;ll put him in prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that you can make love to his wife,&rdquo; retorted Kitty coolly</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care two straws about his wife,&rdquo; replied Fenton, with a scowl. &ldquo;You are  the only woman I love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  promise me to help this unhappy man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not; you are asking me to compound a felony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not a lawyer,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t understand legal terms. I am only  asking you to save him from gaol for his wife&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo; jealously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  do I love any one except myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your child,&rdquo; with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  my child be. Will you help Evan Malton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the law must take its course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll help him myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business&mdash;the money must be replaced&mdash;find out how much is missing, and let me  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the good? you&rsquo;ve not got the cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  what I ask!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well!&rdquo; sulkily. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay the money myself; but I&rsquo;ll give him time to repay  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and Kitty,&rdquo; shamefacedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you have that five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  boy,&rdquo; said Kitty approvingly, and laughed. She had gained both her points, so  could afford to do so. At this moment Meg entered the room from the garden,  followed by Keith, on seeing whom Fenton&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey!&rdquo;  said Meg, bounding up to Kitty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given him the knife, and he says it&rsquo;s  lovely&mdash;don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; turning to Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Words  fail me to express my appreciation,&rdquo; said Stewart, with a smile, looking at the  large&mdash;very large ivory-handled knife, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s got an inscription, &lsquo;From Meg,&rsquo;&mdash;beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will cut love, Mr Stewart,&rdquo; said Kitty, with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; interposed Meg, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s given me a lucky sixpence. He says we&rsquo;re engaged  now, and when I grow up, mumsey, I&rsquo;m going to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this true?&rdquo; asks Kitty gaily. &ldquo;Are you going to rob me of my daughter? This is  dreadful! What do you say, Mr Fenton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Fenton smiled in a ghastly manner, then hurried away muttering under his  breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  bad temper,&rdquo; observed Stewart, looking after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my dear,&rdquo; said Kitty airily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s jealousy.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    Mirth And Laughter</b></h2>
  <p>KITTY&rsquo;S  supper parties were always delightful, though slightly godless. The guests were  usually men and women of the world, connected with art, literature, and the  drama, so a general tone of brilliancy permeated the atmosphere. The hostess  herself was an admirable conversationalist, and what with the wine, the  laughter, and the influence of the midnight hour, the excitement seemed  contagious. Every one was amusing, and witty stories, caustic remarks, and  sarcastic epigrams followed one after the other in reckless profusion.</p>
  <p>Very  pretty the supper-table looked, though, it must be confessed, rather  disorderly. It was not a very large table, but accommodated the present company  admirably, and under the soft light of the tapers, with which the room was  illuminated, the silver and glass sparked brilliantly. Half-filled glasses of  champagne and burgundy, crumbs on the white table-cloth, and a general array of  disorderly plates, showed that supper was over. The guests had pushed away  their chairs, and were smoking and chatting, while a light breeze came in  through the open French window, and somewhat cooled the temperature of the  room. The smoky atmosphere, the flashing of the light on the bare shoulders of  the women, gay feminine, laughter, and the general air of unconventionality,  fascinated Keith as he sat beside his hostess, listening to the desultory  conversation, and occasionally joining in. Slingsby was speaking about a new  book which had come out, and this gave rise to a brilliant rattle of pungent  wit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  called &lsquo;Connie&rsquo;s Crime,&rsquo; a mixture of blood and atheism.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  so they say; a hash-up of the Newgate Calendar and Queen Mab, with a dash of  realism to render it attractive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awfully  bad for the public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  they read worse in papers. The <i>Penny  Whistle</i> was bewailing the prevalence of criminal literature, yet you can&rsquo;t  take up a night&rsquo;s issue without finding a divorce case or a murder&mdash;the pot  calling the kettle black with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  suppose either it or shilling shockers have much to do with the morals of the  public&mdash; we&rsquo;re all going to the deuce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pessimistic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  true. It&rsquo;s a game of follow my leader, with Father Adam at the head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gad,  he ought to have arrived at his destination by this time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  we&rsquo;ll all find that out when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you forget we start in this new country with all the old-world civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and all the old-world vices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  are a natural concomitant of aforesaid civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  abusive you all are,&rdquo; said Kitty, shrugging her shoulders; &ldquo;people are not so  bad as you make out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  they&rsquo;re worse,&rdquo; said Delp lightly. &ldquo;Put on your diamonds and go through  Victoria like that young person in Moore&rsquo;s song, &lsquo;Rich and rare were the gems  she wore,&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t be treated as well, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I&rsquo;m very careless of my diamonds,&rdquo; laughed Kitty; &ldquo;I certainly take them  home from the theatre every night, but I generally put the case safely away in  the drawer of my looking-glass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very safe place,&rdquo; observed Lazarus approvingly; &ldquo;for illustration see Poe&rsquo;s  story of &lsquo;The Purloined Letter.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust to fiction for suggestions,&rdquo; said Fenton gaily; &ldquo;some  night you&rsquo;ll be minus your jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take the risk,&rdquo; retorted Kitty rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the drawing-room. Mr  Lazarus, you come also. I have got the score of that new opera-bouffe &lsquo;Eblis,&rsquo;  and I want you to try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  a failure in town,&rdquo; growled Mortimer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a failure in Melbourne,&rdquo; replied Kitty, and with this  parting shot she went away, followed by the ladies and Ezra Lazarus. Keith  remained behind, and, lighting a fresh cigarette, listened to the conversation,  which was now slightly horsey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what&rsquo;s going to win the cup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  knew a man who didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is true, &lsquo;Devil-may-care.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  outsider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  generally win, but don&rsquo;t prophesy too soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  or like Casandra, your prophecies won&rsquo;t be believed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Casandra&mdash;another dark &lsquo;un?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;a  woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talking  about women, I wish you&rsquo;d get more chorus girls, Mortimer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  quite enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course&mdash;quantity, not quality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  been snubbing you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wrong  again; they never snub any one who can give them diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  by Jove. I wish I had some myself&mdash;say Caprice&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  grudge them to her, dear boy &mdash; the savings of years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every  one grinned.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Keith grew tired of this scintillating talk, and leaving Ezra rattling away at  a gallop in the drawing-room, he arose and went out into the hall. Glancing  carelessly up the stairs, he saw a little figure in white coming down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Meg,&rdquo; said Keith, going to the foot of the stairs to receive her, &ldquo;what are you  doing at this hour of the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg  wants mumsey.&rdquo; said the child, putting her arms round his neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey&rsquo;s  busy,&rdquo; replied Keith, lifting her up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you back to bed, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  want to go to bed,&rdquo; said the child, though she could hardly keep her eyes open.</p>
  <p>Keith  laughed, and rocked her slowly to and fro in his arms for a few minutes,  humming softly till Meg grew tired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  Meg go to bed now?&rdquo; he whispered, seeing she had closed her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Meg&rsquo;s sleepy&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  went upstairs with the quiet little figure in his arms, and seeing an open door  leading to a room in which there was a subdued light, caused by the lowering of  the gas, he went in, and finding Meg&rsquo;s cot, placed her in it, and tucked her  carefully in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,  dear,&rdquo; he whispered, kissing her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,  mumsey; good-night, God,&rdquo; murmured Meg, thinking she was saying her prayers,  and fell fast asleep.</p>
  <p>Keith  went downstairs again, and met Fenton in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo;  exclaimed that gentleman, &ldquo;where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Putting  Meg to bed,&rdquo; replied Stewart, laughing. &ldquo;I found her wandering about like an  unquiet spirit,&rdquo; and having no desire for a conversation with Fenton, he  strolled off to the drawing-room leaving the American looking after him with an  angry frown.</p>
  <p>No  one was in the drawing-room but Ezra and the ladies&mdash;the former being seated at  the piano playing over the music of &ldquo;Eblis,&rdquo; while Kitty Marchurst stood beside  him, looking over his shoulder. Lazarus had just finished a valse, which was  not by any means original, being made out of reminiscences of other music.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  only one decent thing in the whole opera,&rdquo; said Kitty impatiently &mdash; &ldquo;this,&rdquo; and  she hummed a few bars; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s called, &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s Deceit.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disagreeable  title,&rdquo; said Keith idly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a capital song,&rdquo; retorted Kitty &ldquo;Eblis sings it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the principal character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem anxious to play the devil,&rdquo; said Stewart, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eblis  is the Oriental name for the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I understand.&rdquo; Kitty&rsquo;s quick perception seized the idea at once. &ldquo;Yes, there  would be some fun in playing such a character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  give myself and Lazarus a commission to write you a part. I am anxious to make  a start, and I think Lazarus would write charming music. I&rsquo;ll be librettist,  and, of course, can write the character to suit you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  glanced critically at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you compose music,&rdquo; she asked Lazarus.</p>
  <p>In  answer, he played a charming gavotte, bright and crisp, with a quaint rhythm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  pretty,&rdquo; said Kitty critically, &ldquo;but not my style. Play something with a little  more &lsquo;go&rsquo; in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  this?&rdquo; He brought his hands down on the ivory keys with a tremendous crash, and  plunged into a wild fantastic galop that made everybody long to dance. Kitty  clapped her hands, and her whole face lighted up with enthusiasm as the  brilliancy and dash of the melody carried her away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;  she cried, when he finished. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want; write me music like that, and  I&rsquo;ll engage to have it produced. You&rsquo;ll do. Now, sir,&rdquo; turning to Keith, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s  your idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  a burlesque than opera-bouffe,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;what would you say to &lsquo;Faust  Upset&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah! we&rsquo;ve had so many burlesques on Faust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  such a one as I propose to write. I intend to twist the whole legend round;  make Miss Faust a Girton girl who has grown old, and longs for love, invokes  the Power of Evil, enter Caprice as Miss Mephistopheles, a female demon,  rejuvenates Miss Faust by paint and powder, takes her to see Mr Marguerite, who  is a young athlete, and so throughout the whole legend; to conclude with Miss  Mephistopheles falling in love with Mr Marguerite, and disputing possession  with Miss Faust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  ha!&rdquo; laughed Kitty, &ldquo;what a capital idea. It will be new, at all events; but I  won&rsquo;t decide till I see the first act complete; if it&rsquo;s as good as it promises,  I&rsquo;ll get Mortimer to stage it after &lsquo;Prince Carnival.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  was delighted, as now he seemed to have obtained a chance of seeing what he  could do. Ezra smiled, and nodded to Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you she&rsquo;d be a good friend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The  gentlemen all came into the room, and in a short time there was a perfect babel  of voices talking about everything and everyone. Suddenly Fenton, with a  half-smoked cigar in his hand, entered the room and crossed over to Kitty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a rough-looking man outside who wants to see you,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  turned a little pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  husband of Madame Midas,&rdquo; she said, in an annoyed tone. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walking  up and down in front of the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remain  here; I&rsquo;ll see him,&rdquo; she said, in a decided tone, and, without being noticed,  left the room.</p>
  <p>On  entering the dining-room, she found Mr Villiers seated at the supper-table  drinking champagne from a half-empty bottle, having entered through the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; she asked, coming down to him.</p>
  <p>Mr  Villiers was in his usual condition of intoxication, and began to weep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  Kitty, dear little Kitty,&rdquo; he said, in a maudlin tone, &ldquo;the friend of my dear  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  dear wife,&rdquo; said Kitty scornfully; &ldquo;the woman you deceived so shamefully; she  was well quit of you when she went to live in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  left me to die alone,&rdquo; wept Villiers, filling his glass again, &ldquo;and only lets  me have a hundred pounds a year, and she&rsquo;s rolling in money &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  enough for you to get drunk on,&rdquo; retorted Kitty. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shan&rsquo;t get a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  I shall. You talk about me treating my wife badly; what about you&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  clenched her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did treat her badly,&rdquo; she said, with a cry. &ldquo;God help me, I&rsquo;ve repented it  often enough since!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were a nice girl till you met Vandeloup,&rdquo; said Villiers. &ldquo;Ah, that confounded  Frenchman, how he made me suffer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  Vandeloup alone; he&rsquo;s dead, and it will do no good you reviling him now. At all  events, he was a man, not a drunkard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  loves him still, blow me!&rdquo; hiccuped Mr Villiers rising&mdash;&ldquo;loves him still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  a sovereign,&rdquo; said Kitty, thrusting some money into his hand. &ldquo;Now, go away at  once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t get more. Get away, or I&rsquo;ll order my servants to turn you out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  staggered up to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you, indeed? Who are you to talk to me like this? I&rsquo;ll go now, but I&rsquo;ll come  back, my beauty! Don&rsquo;t try your fine airs on me. I&rsquo;ll get money from you when I  want it; if I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll make you repent it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  stood looking at him like a statue of marble, and pointed to the open window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  spare you for your wife&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  lurched towards the window, then, turning round, shook his fist at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  not done with you yet, my fine madam,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for  these fine airs, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  staggered out without saying the vile word, and disappeared in the darkness.</p>
  <p>A  vile word, and yet what was that Mrs Malton said about her child blushing for  her father? God help her, would Meg live to blush for her mother? Kitty put out  her hands with a sob, when a burst of laughter from the next room sounded in  her ears. The momentary fit of tenderness was over, and, with a harsh laugh,  she poured out a glass of champagne and drank it off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  world is there,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I must part with the child for her own good,  and she will lead that virtuous, happy life which a miserable wretch like  myself can never hope to reach.&rdquo; </p>

    A Mysterious Affair</b></h2>
  <p><i>The Penny Whistle</i> was a purely sensational newspaper, and all those who  liked spicy articles and exaggerated details purchased it, in order to gratify  their tastes. Its circulation was enormous, and its sale increased still more  when the following article appeared in its columns on the Tuesday after Kitty&rsquo;s  supper party:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">BURGLARY  AT THE HOUSE OF A WELL-KNOWN ACTRESS</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;We  often hear accounts of great jewel robberies having taken place in London, but  nothing of the kind, at least in any noticeable degree, has been perpetrated in  the colonies until last Sunday night, or, to speak more exactly, Monday  morning, when the house of Caprice, the well-known actress, was entered, and  jewels to the amount of &pound;5000 were stolen. The house in question is situated in  Toorak, almost immediately on the banks of the Yarra-Yarra, and, as far as we  can learn, the following are the circumstances connected with the affair:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;On  Sunday night Caprice entertained a number of friends at a supper party, and the  servants all being downstairs attending to the guests, the upper part of the house  was left entirely uninhabited. It is at this time, probably between twelve and  one o&rsquo;clock, that the burglary is supposed to have been perpetrated. The  company departed about three o&rsquo;clock, and on going up to her room, Caprice  found the window wide open. Knowing that it had been closed, she suspected  something was wrong, and went to the place where she kept her diamonds, only to  find them gone. She sent at once for her servants, and an examination was made.  It was found that the house had evidently been entered from the outside, as the  window was not very far from the ground, and some ivy growing on the wall made  a kind of natural ladder, which any man of ordinary agility could scale.  Curiously enough Caprice&rsquo;s child, aged seven, was asleep in the room, but  appears to have heard nothing. Next morning another examination was made, and  it was found that the ivy was broken in several places, showing clearly the  mode of entrance. The window had not been latched, as no chance of a burglary  was apprehended, the house always having been looked upon as a remarkably safe  one. The diamonds were usually kept in a small safe, but on returning from the  theatre on Saturday night they had been placed in the drawer of the  looking-glass, where they were judged to be safe, as it was not thought likely  any thief would look in so unlikely a place for valuable jewellery. Below will  be found a plan of the house and grounds as furnished by our special reporter,  and the probable track of the burglars indicated.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700501h-images/page079.png" width="800" height="737"></p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;It  will be seen from this plan that the drawing-room and dining-room, in both of  which the guests were assembled, are in the front of the house, so that the  most likely thing is that the burglar or burglars entered the grounds by the  gate, or along the banks of the river, and climbed up into the house by the  window C shown on the plan.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;After  securing the plunder, two modes of exit were available, either as indicated by  the dotted line which would take the thief out of the gate into the road, from  whence it would be easy to escape, or along the banks of the river, as shown by  the other lines. In either case escape was perfectly easy. Of course the danger  lay in detection while in the house, but this was considerably guarded against  by the fact that the noise and laughter going on below effectually drowned all  sounds of any one entering the house.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;The  thief must have known that the diamonds were in the bedroom, and that a number  of people would be present on Sunday night, therefore he chose a time when he  would be most likely to escape detection. We believe that a detective has gone  down to Toorak to make inquiries, and we have no doubt that the thief will soon  be secured, as it would be impossible for such valuable jewels to be disposed  of in Melbourne or other colonial cities without arousing suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Fenton who insisted upon a detective being employed to investigate the  robbery, as, for some extraordinary reason, Kitty seemed unwilling to allow the  matter to be inquired into.</p>
  <p>The  detective who accompanied Fenton to Kitty&rsquo;s house was known by the name of  Naball, and on the retirement of Kilsip had taken his place. He was only of the  age of thirty, but remarkably clever, and had already distinguished himself in  several difficult cases. Detective work was a positive mania with him, and he  was never so happy as when engaged on a difficult case&mdash;it had for him the same  fascination as an abstruse mathematical problem would have for an enthusiastic  student. To Kilsip belonged the proud honour of having discovered this genius,  and it seemed as though the pupil would soon surpass the master in his  wonderful instinct for unravelling criminal puzzles. Mr Naball was an  ordinary-looking young man, who always dressed fashionably, and had very little  to say for himself, so that few guessed the keen astute brain that was hidden  under this somewhat foppish exterior. He listened to everything said to him,  and rarely ventured an opinion, but the thieves of Melbourne well knew that  when &ldquo;The Toff,&rdquo; as they called Naball, was on their track, there was very  little chance of escape from punishment.</p>
  <p>On  this day when they were on their way to Toorak, Fenton was excited over the  matter, and ventured all kinds of theories on the subject, while Mr Naball  smoked a cigarette, and admired the fit of his gloves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think the thief will try and dispose of them in Melbourne?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo;  returned Naball, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s a born fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  certain I know the thief,&rdquo; said Fenton quietly. &ldquo;I told you that the man  Villiers was seen about the place on the night of the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myself  and Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  saw him last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Naball imperturbably, &ldquo;then she&rsquo;s the best person to see on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a bad lot,&rdquo; said Fenton; &ldquo;he was mixed up in that poisoning case eight years  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Midas case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Caprice, or rather Kitty Marchurst, was concerned in it also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I believe,&rdquo; replied Naball; &ldquo;every one was innocent except Jarper and Vandeloup&mdash;one  was hanged, the other committed suicide. I don&rsquo;t see what it has to do with the  present case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  this,&rdquo; said Fenton sharply, annoyed at the other&rsquo;s tone, &ldquo;Villiers is a  scoundrel, and wouldn&rsquo;t stop at robbery if he could make some money over it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  knew Caprice had diamonds worth five thousand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; every one in Melbourne knows that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he know where they were kept?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a safe in the room, and a thief, of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  go there first&mdash;precisely&mdash; but you forget the diamonds were taken out of the  drawer of her looking-glass&mdash;a most unlikely place for a thief to examine. The  man who stole the jewels must have known where they were kept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Fenton, and looked astonished, as he was quite unable to explain this. He  was about to reply, when the train having arrived at its destination, they got  out, and walked to Kitty&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>She  was in the drawing-room writing letters and looked pale and haggard, her eyes  having dark circles beneath them, which told of a sleepless night. When the two  men entered the room she welcomed them gracefully, and then resumed her seat as  they began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought you Mr Naball to look after this affair,&rdquo; said Fenton, looking at  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind,&rdquo; she replied coldly; &ldquo;but, the fact is, I have not yet decided  about placing it in the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the diamonds?&rdquo;&mdash;began Fenton in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  mine,&rdquo; finished Kitty coolly; &ldquo;and as the loss is mine, not yours, I will act  as I think fit in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then,  turning her back on the discomfited Fenton, she addressed herself to the  detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like your opinion on the subject,&rdquo; she said graciously, &ldquo;and then I will  see if the case can be gone on with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball,  who had been keeping his keen eyes on her face the whole time, bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all the details of the robbery,&rdquo; he observed cautiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are simple enough,&rdquo; replied Kitty, folding her hands. &ldquo;I bring them home from  the theatre every night, and usually put them in the safe, which is in my room.  On Saturday night, however, I was tired, and, I must confess, rather careless,  and as the case was on my dressing-table, I placed it in the drawer of my  looking-glass, to save me the trouble of going to the safe. I gave a supper  party on Sunday night, and when every one had gone away, I went upstairs to  bed, and found the window open; recollecting where I had put the diamonds, I  opened the drawer and found them gone. My servants examined the ground beneath  the window, and found footmarks on the mould of the flower-bed, so I suppose  the thief must have entered by the window, stolen the jewels, and made off with  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  she had finished, Naball remained silent for a minute, but just as Fenton was  about to speak, he interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will ask you a few questions, madame,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;When did you see  the diamonds last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  six o&rsquo;clock on Sunday night. I opened the drawer to get something, and saw the  case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were in the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  else would they be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  one might have stolen them previously, and left the case there to avert  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.  The case is also gone besides, I locked the case on Saturday night, and had the  key with me. No other key could have opened it, and had the case been forced, I  would have seen it at once. See,&rdquo; lifting up her arm, &ldquo;I always wear this  bracelet, and the key is attached to it by a chain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  glanced carelessly at it, and went on with his questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  generally kept the diamonds in the safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it was quite an oversight not placing them in there on Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one knew they were in the drawer of your looking-glass on that particular night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  Fenton interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  get along too fast,&rdquo; he said quickly &ldquo;Everyone at the supper-table knew you  kept them there; you said it to them yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  glanced sharply at Kitty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I did,&rdquo; she replied quietly; &ldquo;but I spoke as if the diamonds were always  kept there, which they were not. I did not say they were in the drawer on that  particular night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mentioned it generally?&rdquo; said Naball tranquilly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  All the people present were my guests, and I hardly think any of them would rob  me of my diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  any of the servants in the room when you made the remark?&rdquo; said the detective  slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  none; and the door was closed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  paused a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;the diamonds were stolen between six o&rsquo;clock  and the time you went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Kitty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  You saw the diamonds last at six; they were gone by three; you mentioned where  you kept them at the supper-table; now, the thief must have overheard you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you  suspect my guests, sir,&rdquo; cried Kitty angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; said the detective quietly; &ldquo;but I suspect Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Villiers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Mr Fenton tells me you saw him on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  flashed a look of anger on the American, who bore it unmoved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was outside, and wanted to see me. I saw him, gave him some money, and he  left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I tell you he overheard you say where you kept the diamonds, because he was  hiding outside the window; so, after seeing you, he committed the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I think,&rdquo; said Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;  cried Kitty. &ldquo;What have you got to do with it? I don&rsquo;t believe he stole them,  and, whether he did or not, I&rsquo;m not going to continue this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  lose your diamonds,&rdquo; cried Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  my business,&rdquo; she returned, rising haughtily; &ldquo;at all events, I have decided to  let the matter rest, so Mr Naball will have all his trouble for nothing. Should  I desire to reopen the affair, I will let you both know. At present, good  morning,&rdquo; and, with a sweeping bow, she turned and left the room. </p>
  <p>Fenton  stared after her in blank amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God! what a fool!&rdquo; he cried, rising. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;since she declines to give me power to investigate. I must throw  the affair up. But,&rdquo; also rising, and putting on his hat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a  look at the ground beneath the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  both went out, Naball silent, and Fenton in great wrath, talking of Kitty&rsquo;s  conduct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  an idiot she is!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What is she going on in this way for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have some motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Women  don&rsquo;t require a motive for anything,&rdquo; said Naball, imperturbably proceeding to  examine the ground under the window, through which the thief had made his exit.  The flower-bed was filled with tall hollyhocks, and some of these were broken  as if some heavy body had fallen from above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  clambered down by the ivy,&rdquo; murmured Naball to himself, as he bent down. &ldquo;The  ivy is broken here and there; the flowers are also broken, so he fell on them  in a heap&mdash;probably having missed his footing. Humph! Clever man, as he did not  step again on the flower-bed, but jumped from where he fell on to the grass. Humph!  grass hard and rather dry; no chance of footmarks. Question is, which way did  he go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the gate, of course,&rdquo; said Fenton impatiently.</p>
  <p>The  detective walked across the lawn to the gate, but could find no trace of  footmarks, as the lawn was dry, and the footpath, leading out into the pavement  of the street was asphalted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he did not go by the gate, as a man in such rags as Villiers would have been  sure to be seen coming out of a private house. That would be suspicious;  besides, he would have been afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly;  he&rsquo;s been in prison two or three times since his connection with the Midas  case, and has got a wholesome dread of the law. No; he did not go by the gate,  but by the river.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  river!&rdquo; repeated Fenton, in amazement.</p>
  <p>Naball  did not answer, but walked back to the window, then along the side of the  house, turned the corner, and went down the sloping green bank which led to the  river. Still he could see no footmarks. The grass ended at an iron fence, and  beyond was the uncultivated vegetation, rank and unwholesome, that clothed the  banks of the river. Between this and the grass, however, there was a strip of  black earth, and this Naball examined carefully, but could find nothing. If  Villiers had come this way, he could only have climbed the fence by first  standing on this earth in order to get near enough, but apparently he had not  done so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not come this way,&rdquo; he said, as they walked back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how could he have left the place?&rdquo; asked Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the gate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gate? You said he would be afraid of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he would, had he been doing anything wrong. Had he stolen the diamonds, he  would have gone down by the bank of the river rather than chance meeting a  policeman on the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what does this prove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  had he met a policeman, he could have explained everything, and referred him to  Caprice as to his interview, and right to come out of the house. In a word, it  proves he did not steal the diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t give an opinion unless I&rsquo;m certain,&rdquo; said Naball deliberately; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll  tell you what I think You heard Caprice say she won&rsquo;t go on with the case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I can&rsquo;t understand her reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can; she stole the diamonds herself.&rdquo; </p>

    An Unknown Benefactor</b></h2>
  <p>EVERYONE  was greatly excited over the great jewel robbery, especially as it had taken  place at the house of so celebrated a person as Caprice, and numerous were the  conjectures as to the discovery of the thieves. When, however, it became known  that the lady in question declined to allow an investigation to be made, and  was apparently contented to lose five thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds, the  excitement grew intense. What was her motive for acting in such a strange way?  All Melbourne asked itself this question, but without obtaining a satisfactory  answer. Reference was made to Kitty&rsquo;s antecedents in connection with the Midas  poisoning case, and the public were quite prepared to hear any evil of her,  particularly as her career since then had been anything but pure.</p>
  <p>The  name of Villiers was mentioned, and then it transpired that Villiers had been  seen outside her house on the night of the robbery It was curious that another  crime should have happened where these two, formerly implicated in a murder  case, should have come together, and disagreeable rumours began to circulate.  Then, by some unexplained means, the opinion of Naball became known regarding  his assertion that Caprice had stolen the diamonds herself. Here was another  mystery. Why on earth should she steal her own jewels? One theory was that she  required money, and had sold them for this purpose, pretending that they were  stolen, in order to satisfy the lovers who gave them to her. This was clearly  absurd, as Caprice cared nothing for the opinion of her lovers, and, moreover,  the donors of the diamonds were long since dead or ruined, so the idea of the  detective was unanimously laughed at. But then the fact remained, she would not  allow an investigation to be made; and how was this to be accounted for? One idea  was mooted, that Villiers had stolen the diamonds, and she would not prosecute  him because he was the husband of the woman who had been kind to her. In this  case, however, she would have easily got back her jewels by a threat of  prosecution, whereas they were still missing. Other solutions of the problem  were offered, but they were unsatisfactory, and Melbourne settled itself down  to the opinion that the whole affair was a mystery which would never be solved.</p>
  <p>Keith  and Ezra had both been puzzled over the affair, and offered Kitty their  services to unravel the mystery, but she curtly dismissed them with the remark  that she wished the affair left alone, so they had to obey her, and remain in  ignorance like the rest of the public. Affairs thus went on as usual, and the  weeks slipped by with no further information being forthcoming.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  &ldquo;Prince Carnival&rdquo; was still running to crowded houses, and Kitty appeared  nightly, being now a still greater attraction on account of the robbery of  which she was the heroine. She had fulfilled her promise to Keith, in seeing  Mortimer about the chances of production for &ldquo;Faust Upset.&rdquo; The manager was  doubtful about the success of the experiment of trying Colonial work, and told  Kitty plainly he could not afford to lose money on such a speculation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all stuff,&rdquo; he said to her when she urged him to give the young men a chance; &ldquo;I  can get operas from London whose success is already assured, and I don&rsquo;t see  why I should waste money on the crude production of two unknown Colonials.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all very true,&rdquo; retorted Caprice, &ldquo;and, from a business point of view, correct;  but considering you make your money out of Colonial audiences, I don&rsquo;t see why  you shouldn&rsquo;t give at least one chance to see what Colonial brains can do. As to  crudity, wait and see. I don&rsquo;t want you to take the opera if it is bad, but if  you approve of it, give it a chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the end Mortimer promised, that if he approved of the libretto and music, he  would try the piece at the end of the run of &ldquo;Prince Carnival,&rdquo; but put &ldquo;Eblis&rdquo;  in rehearsal, in case his forebodings of failure should be justified. When,  however, the first act was finished and shown to him, he was graciously pleased  to say there was good stuff in it, and began to be a little more hopeful as to  its success. So Keith worked hard all day at his employment, and at night on  his libretto, to which Ezra put bright, tuneful music. With the usual sanguine  expectations of youth, they never dreamt of failure, and Keith wrote the most  enthusiastic letters to his betrothed, announcing the gratifying fact that he  had got his foot on the lowest rung of the ladder of fame.</p>
  <p>As  to his uncongenial employment at the pawnshop, he strove to conquer his  repugnance to it, and succeeded in winning the approval of old Lazarus by his  assiduous attention to business. He attended to the books, and, as time went  on, the pawnbroker actually let him pay money into the bank, so great had his  confidence in the young man become. He increased Keith&rsquo;s salary, and even then  chuckled to himself over his cleverness in retaining such a clever servant at  so low a price.</p>
  <p>Though  his business was ostensibly that of a pawnbroker, he was in the habit of  conducting very much more delicate transactions. In his dingy little den at the  back of the shop he sat like a great spider waiting for flies, and the flies  generally came in at a little door which led from the room into a dirty yard,  and there was a kind of narrow right-of-way which gave admittance to this yard  from the street. By this humble way many well-known people came, particularly  at night&mdash;the fast young man who had backed the wrong horse, the speculative  share-broker, and the spendthrift society lady, all came here in quest of  money, which they always got, provided their security was good, and, of course,  they paid an exorbitant percentage. Lazarus had dealings with all sorts and  conditions of men and women, but he was as silent as the grave over their  affairs, and no one knew what secrets that dirty old Hebrew carried in his  breast. Of these nocturnal visitors Keith saw nothing, as he left at six o&rsquo;clock,  after which Isaiah shut up the shop, and the front of the house was left in  profound darkness, while business went on in the little back room.</p>
  <p>It  was now a fortnight since the robbery, and the nine days&rsquo; wonder having ceased  to amuse, people were beginning to forget all about it. Keith still lived in  East Melbourne with Ezra, and on going home one night was surprised to find a  letter from the manager of the Hibernian Bank, which informed him that the sum  of five hundred pounds had been placed to his credit. Stewart went next day to  find out the name of his unknown benefactor, but the manager refused to tell  him, as he had been pledged to secrecy. So Keith returned to Ezra in a state of  great perplexity to talk over the affair. They sat in Ezra&rsquo;s sitting-room, and  discussed the matter late at night with great assiduity, but were unable to  come to any conclusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know any one who would do you a good turn?&rdquo; asked Lazarus, when he heard  this news,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no  one,&rdquo; replied Keith. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a single relative in the Colonies, and no  friend rich enough to give me so much money&mdash;unless it were your father,&rdquo; with a  sudden inspiration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He!&rdquo;  laughed Ezra scornfully; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d as soon part with his blood. Why, I asked him to  give me some money so that I could marry, and he refused. What he wouldn&rsquo;t do  for his son he certainly would not do for a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  very queer,&rdquo; observed Keith meditatively. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Caprice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  likely; she needs all her money herself,&rdquo; said Ezra. &ldquo;Besides, I hear she&rsquo;s  been rather hardup of late. I suppose Fenton will soon go broke, and then, <i>Le roi est mort, vive le roi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a pity she goes on like that,&rdquo; said Keith, regretfully. &ldquo;I like her so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and she likes you,&rdquo; retorted Ezra pointedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get entangled in the  nets, or you&rsquo;ll forget all about the girl at Sandhurst. Does she know you&rsquo;re  engaged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t tell her if I were you,&rdquo; said the Jew significantly, &ldquo;or she&rsquo;ll  withdraw the light of her countenance, and then it will be all up with our  burlesque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,  nonsense,&rdquo; replied Stewart, with an uneasy laugh. &ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;ll be Fenton&rsquo;s  successor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I. I&rsquo;m not far enough gone for that. Besides, I&rsquo;ve no money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  except your anonymous five hundred, which would be nothing to Caprice. So, as  she wants money, I expect it will be old Meddlechip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he&rsquo;s married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  O Sir Galahad,&rdquo; retorted Ezra sarcastically; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s an unholy old man for  all that&mdash;she&rsquo;ll ensnare him, and we&rsquo;ll see how long it will take her to break  the richest man in the Colonies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the deuce take Kitty Marchurst and her affairs,&rdquo; said Keith impatiently. &ldquo;I  want to know who sent me this money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  not ask,&rdquo; murmured Ezra. &ldquo;Curiosity is a vice. Remember Adam and Eve, Bluebeard&rsquo;s  wife, etcetera. Take the goods the gods bestow, and don&rsquo;t try to find out where  they come from; but now you are rich, you&rsquo;ll be giving up the shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;ll stay on for a time till I find that the five hundred is really and truly  mine. Who knows, some day it may take to itself wings and fly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  certainly would with some young men,&rdquo; said Ezra; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think you are  that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right. I want to save up all my money for Eug&eacute;nie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you are going to marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I get rich. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t marry her if Caprice can help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  disbelievingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she&rsquo;s fallen in love with you, and her love, like the gifts of the Danaes, is  fatal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish.  I&rsquo;m not a child. Caprice will never take my heart from Eug&eacute;nie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hercules,&rdquo;  remarked Ezra musingly, &ldquo;was a strong man; yet he became the slave of a woman.  Solomon was a wise man&mdash;same result. My friend, you are neither Hercules nor  Solomon, therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  departed hurriedly.</p>

    Naball Makes A Discovery</b></h2>
  <p>When  Kilsip undertook to educate Naball in the business of a detective, he gave him  an epigrammatical piece of advice: &ldquo;Cultivate curiosity.&rdquo; This golden rule Naball  constantly followed, and found it of infinite service to him in his difficult  profession. He was always on the look-out for queer cases, and when he  discovered one that piqued his curiosity, be never rested until he found out  all about it. The Red Indian follows the trail of his enemy by noting the most  trivial signs, which to others with a less highly cultivated instinct would  appear worthless. And Naball was a social Red Indian, following up the trail of  a mystery by a constant attention to surrounding events. A casual observation,  a fleeting expression, a scrap of paper&mdash;these were the sign-posts which led him  to a satisfactory conclusion, and he never neglected any opportunity of  exercising his faculties. By this constant practice he sharpened his senses in  a wonderful degree, and cultivated to the highest extent the unerring instinct  which he possessed in discovering crimes.</p>
  <p>Consequently,  when he found there was no legal authority to be given him in unravelling the  mystery of the diamond robbery, he determined to investigate it on his own  account, in order to satisfy his curiosity. To a casual spectator, it appeared  to be a mere vulgar burglary, in which the thieves had got off with their  plunder, and until his interview with Caprice the detective had supposed it to  be so. But when he went over in his own mind the peculiar circumstances of that  interview, he saw there was a complicated criminal case to be investigated, so  he set himself to work to unravel the mystery, and gratify his inquiring mind.</p>
  <p>In  the first place, he drew up a statement of the case pure and simple, and then,  deducing different theories from the circumstances, he tried to get a point  from whence to start. He placed his ideas in the form of questions and answers,  as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>Q.  Was Villiers outside on the verandah when Caprice mentioned where her diamonds  were kept?</p>
  <p>A.  To all appearances he was.</p>
  <p>Q.  Had he any inducement to steal the diamonds?</p>
  <p>A.  Undoubtedly. He was poor, and wanted money, proved by his calling on Caprice  and asking for some. He said he would be revenged because she did not give him  more than a sovereign, and there would be no sweeter revenge than to steal her  diamonds, as it would punish her, and benefit himself.</p>
  <p>Q.  Did he know the room where the diamonds were kept?</p>
  <p>A.  Yes. Caprice said her bedroom, and as Villiers had been several times to the  house before, he knew where it was.</p>
  <p>Q.  Did Caprice know Villiers had stolen her jewels?</p>
  <p>A.  Extremely probably, hence her refusal to prosecute, as he was the husband of  Madame Midas, whom she had treated so basely. The refusal to prosecute Villiers  might be, in Caprice&rsquo;s opinion, an act of expiation.</p>
  <p>When  he had got thus far, Naball paused. After all, this was pure theory. He had not  a single well authenticated fact to go on, but all the circumstances of the  case seemed to point to Villiers, so he determined to go on the trail of  Villiers, and find out what he was doing.</p>
  <p>Mr  Villiers had of late been under the espionage of the police, owing to some  shady transactions with which he was connected, so Naball knew exactly where to  find him, and, putting on an overcoat, he sallied forth in the direction of the  slums in Little Bourke Street, with the intention of calling on a Chinaman  named Ah Goon, who kept an opium den in that unsavoury locality.</p>
  <p>To  his drinking habits Villiers now added that of being a confirmed opium smoker,  and was on terms of intimacy with Ah Goon, in whose den he was accustomed to  pass his evenings. Naball therefore intended to watch for Villiers, and find  out, if possible, when, owing to drink and opium combined, he was not master of  himself, what he had done on the night of the robbery after leaving Caprice.</p>
  <p>He  soon entered Little Bourke Street, and plunged into the labyrinth of slums,  which he knew thoroughly. It was a clear, starry night, but the cool, fresh air  was tainted in this locality by the foul miasma which pervaded the  neighbourhood, and even the detective, accustomed as he was to the place, felt  disgusted with the sickly odours that permeated the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Ah  Goon&rsquo;s house was in a narrow right-of-way off one of the larger alleys, and  there was a faint candle burning in the window to attract customers. Pausing at  the door a moment, Naball listened to hear if there was any European within.  The monotonous chant of a Chinese beggar could be heard coming down the alley,  and every now and then the screams of two women fighting, while occasionally a  number of noisy larrikins would come tramping heavily along, forming a strong  contrast to the silent, soft-footed Orientals.</p>
  <p>Pushing  open the door, Naball entered the den, a small, low-ceilinged room, which was  filled with a dull, smoky atmosphere. At the end was a gaudy-looking shrine,  all yellow, red, and green, with tinsel flowers, and long red bills with  fantastic Chinese letters on them in long rows. Candles were burning in front  of this, and cast a feeble light around&mdash;on a pile of bamboo canes and baskets  heaped up against the wall; on strange-looking Chinese stools of cane-work; on <i>bizarre </i>ivory carvings set on shelves;  and on a low raised platform at the end of the room, whereon the opium-smokers  reclined. Above this ground-floor were two or three other broad, shallow  shelves, in each of which a Chinaman was lying, sunk deep in an opium slumber;  there was also a kerosene lamp on the lower floor, beside which Ah Goon was  reclining, and deftly preparing a pipe of opium for a fat, stolid-looking  Chinaman, who watched the process with silent apathy.</p>
  <p>Ah  Goon looked up as the detective entered, and a bland smile spread over his face  as he nodded to him, and went on preparing his pipe, while Naball stood  watching the queer operation. There was an oil lamp with a clear flame in front  of Ah Goon, who was holding a kind of darning-needle. Dipping this into a  thick, brown, sticky-looking substance, contained in a small pot, he twirled  the needle rapidly, spinning round the glutinous mass like treacle. Then he  placed it in the flame of the lamp, and turned it slowly round and round for a  short time until it was ready; then, having placed it in the small hole of the  opium pipe, which he held ready in his other hand, he gave it to his  countryman, who received it with a grunt of satisfaction, and, lying back, took  the long stem between his lips and inhaled the smoke with long, steady breaths.  When his pipe was done, which was accomplished in three or four whiffs, he  devoted himself to preparing another, while Ah Goon arose to his feet to speak  to Naball.</p>
  <p>He  was a tall man, with a thin, yellow-skinned, emaciated face, cunning, oblong  eyes, and flattish nose. His pigtail, of course&mdash;black hair craftily lengthened  by thick twisted silk&mdash;was coiled on top of his head; and his dress, consisting  of a dull blue blouse, wide trousers of the same colour, and thick, white-soled  Chinese slippers, by no means added to his personal beauty. Standing before  Naball, with an unctuous smile on his face, and his long, slender hands clasped  in front of him, Ah Goon waited for the detective to speak.</p>
  <p>Naball  glanced rapidly round the apartment, and not seeing Villiers, addressed himself  to the stolid Celestial, who was looking slyly at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  Goon, where is the white man who comes here every night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plenty  he come allee muchee night&mdash;me no have seen,&rdquo; replied Ah Goon, blinking his  black eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know that,&rdquo; retorted Naball quickly; &ldquo;but this one is short&mdash;black hair and  whiskers&mdash; smokes opium&mdash;drinks a lot&mdash;is called Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether  Ah Goon recognised the gentleman thus elegantly described was doubtful; at all  events, he put on a stolid air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me  no sabee,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
  <p>Naball  held out a half-a crown, upon which Ah Goon fixed his eyes lovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  money was too much for Ah Goon&rsquo;s cupidity, so he gave in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him  playee fan-tan-ayah!&rdquo; he answered, in a sing-song voice, &ldquo;allee same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Naball did not waste any words, but threw the half-crown to the expectant Ah  Goon, and turned towards the door. Just as he reached it there was a noise of  hurried footsteps outside, and Villiers&rsquo; voice, husky and savage, was heard,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  Goon, you yellow devil, where are you?&rdquo; and there came a heavy kick at the  door.</p>
  <p>In  a moment Naball drew back into a shadowy corner, and placed his finger on his  lips to ensure silence, a pantomime which the intelligent Ah Goon understood at  once.</p>
  <p>Villiers  opened the door and lurched noisily into the room, stopping for a minute on the  threshold, dazed by the yellow, smoky glare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  you, Ah Goon,&rdquo; he cried, catching sight of the Chinaman, &ldquo;I want some  money&mdash;more money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  Goon no have,&rdquo; murmured that individual, clutching; his half-crown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  lost all I had on that infernal fan-tan of yours,&rdquo; shrieked Villiers, not  heeding him; &ldquo;but my luck must change&mdash;give me another fiver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  Goon no have,&rdquo; reiterated the Chinaman, edging away from the excited Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  your no have,&rdquo; he said fiercely; &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ve only had twenty pounds from you,  and those diamonds were worth fifty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Diamonds!  Naball pricked up his ears at this. He was winning after all. Kitty did not  steal her jewels, but this was the thief, or perhaps an accomplice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me more money,&rdquo; cried Villiers, lurching forward, and would have laid his hand  on the shoulder of the shrinking Chinaman, when Naball stepped out of his  corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter?&rdquo; he asked, in his silky voice.</p>
  <p>Villiers  turned on the new-comer with a sudden start, and stared suspiciously at him;  but the detective being muffled up in a heavy ulster, with his hat pulled over  his eyes, he did not recognise him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; he said ungraciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  replied Naball quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only strolling round the Chinese quarter out of  curiosity, and heard you rowing this poor devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  devil!&rdquo; sneered Villiers, with a glance of fury at Ah Goon, who had  complacently resumed his occupation of preparing an opium pipe; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s rich  enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  said the detective, carelessly&mdash;&ldquo;to lend money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that to you?&rdquo; growled Villiers, with a snarl. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I can borrow money if I  like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you&rsquo;ve got good security to give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  glared angrily at the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Security,&rdquo;  explained Naball smoothly; &ldquo;means borrowing money on land, clothes, or&mdash;or  diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  gave a sudden start, and was about to reply, when the door opened violently,  and a bold, handsome woman, dressed in a bright green silk, dashed into the  room and swooped down on Ah Goon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  my dear,&rdquo; she said effusively, &ldquo; &lsquo;ere I am; bin to the theatre, and &lsquo;ere you  are preparing that pisin of yours. Oh, I must &lsquo;ave one pipe to-night, just one,  and&mdash; Who the blazes are you?&rdquo; catching sight of the two strangers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut  up,&rdquo; said Villiers, and made a step towards her, for just on the bosom of her  dress sparkled a small crescent of diamonds set in silver. The woman&rsquo;s eyes  caught his covetous glance, and she put her hand over the ornament.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said scowling. &ldquo;Lay a finger on me and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  ended with a stifled cry, for without warning, Villiers had sprung on her, and  his hands were round her throat. Ah Goon and another Chinaman jumped up and  threw themselves on the two, trying to separate them. The woman got Villiers&rsquo;  hands off her, and started to sing out freely, so Naball began to think of  retreating, as the noise would bring all the undesirable bullies of the  neighbourhood into the unsavoury den.</p>
  <p>While  thus hesitating, the woman flung the diamond ornament away from her with an  oath, and it fell at Naball&rsquo;s feet. In a moment the detective had picked it up  and slipped in into his pocket.</p>
  <p>Villiers,  seeing the ornament was gone, flung the woman from him with a howl of fury, and  turned to look for it, when the door was burst violently open, and a crowd of  Chinese, all chattering in their high shrill voices like magpies, surged into  the room. Ah Goon, with many gesticulations, began to explain, Villiers to  swear, and the woman to shriek, so in the midst of this pandemonium Naball  slipped away, and was soon walking swiftly down Little Bourke Street, with the  diamond ornament safe in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe this is one of the stolen jewels,&rdquo; he muttered exultingly, &ldquo;and Villiers  was the thief after all. Humph! I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. Well, I&rsquo;ll find out  the truth when I see how she looks on being shown this little bit of evidence.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11</b><br>
  <b>What Naball  Overheard</b></h2>
  <p>IT  is said that &ldquo;Counsel comes in the silence of the night,&rdquo; so next morning Mr  Naball, having been thinking deeply about his curious discovery, decided upon  his plan of action. It was evidently no good to go straight to Caprice and show  her the diamond crescent, as, judging from her general conduct with regard to  the robbery, she would deny that the jewel belonged to her.</p>
  <p>The  detective therefore determined to ascertain from some independent person  whether the jewel was really the property of Caprice, and after some  consideration came to the conclusion that Fenton would be the most likely  individual to supply the necessary information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  her lover,&rdquo; argued Naball to himself as he walked along the street, &ldquo;so he  ought to know what jewellery she&rsquo;s got. I dare say he gave her a lot himself;  but, hang it,&rdquo; he went on disconsolately, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m bothering about  this affair; nothing will come of it; for some reason best known to herself,  Caprice won&rsquo;t let me follow up the case. I can&rsquo;t make it out; either she stole  the jewels herself, or Villiers did, and she won&rsquo;t prosecute him. Ah! women are  rum things,&rdquo; concluded the detective with a regretful sigh.</p>
  <p>He  had by this time arrived at The Never-say-die Insurance Office, and on entering  the door found himself in a large, lofty apartment, with a long shiny counter  at one end, and a long shiny clerk behind it This individual, who looked as if  he were rubbed all over with fresh butter, so glistening was his skin, received  him with a stereotyped smile, and asked, in a soft oily voice, what he was  pleased to want?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  my card up to Mr Fenton,&rdquo; said Naball, producing his pasteboard from an elegant  card-case, &ldquo;and tell him I want to see him for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  oleaginous clerk disappeared, and several other clerks looked up from their  writing at the detective with idle curiosity. Naball glanced sharply at their  faces, and smiled blandly to himself as he recognised several whom he had seen  in very equivocal places. Little did the clerks know that this apparently  indolent young man knew a good deal about their private lives, and was  anticipating coming into contact with several of them in a professional manner.</p>
  <p>Presently  the oily clerk returned with a request to Mr Naball to walk into the manager&rsquo;s  office, which that gentleman did in a leisurely manner; and the shiny clerk,  closing the door softly, returned to his position behind the shiny counter.</p>
  <p>Mr  Fenton sat at a handsome writing-table, which was piled up with disorderly  papers, and looked sharply at the detective as he took a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Naball,&rdquo; he said, in his strident voice, &ldquo;what is the matter? Can&rsquo;t give you  more than five minutes&mdash;time&rsquo;s money here. Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five  minutes will do,&rdquo; replied the detective, tapping his varnished boots with his  cane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed!&rdquo; Mr Fenton laid down his pen, and, leaning back in his chair, prepared  to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I&rsquo;ve been looking after Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; said the American. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man I suspect&mdash;fixed up anything, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. but I was down Little Bourke Street last night in an opium den, to which Villiers  goes, and I found this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  took the diamond crescent, which Naball held out to him, and looked at it  closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&mdash;set  in silver&mdash;rather toney,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;well, is this part of the swag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I want to find out,&rdquo; said Naball quickly. &ldquo;You know the peculiar way in  which Caprice has treated this robbery &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know she&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; retorted Fenton politely. &ldquo;She ought to go right along in  this matter; but for some silly reason, she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve come to you. I&rsquo;m going down to see her when I leave here,  and it&rsquo;s likely she&rsquo;ll deny that this belongs to her. Now, I want your evidence  to put against her denial. Is this the property of Caprice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  examined the jewel again and nodded. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; he replied, with a nasal drawl, &ldquo;guess I gave her this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you&rsquo;d recognise it,&rdquo; said Naball, replacing the jewel in his pocket; &ldquo;so  now I&rsquo;ll go and see her, in order to find out how Villiers got hold of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stole  it, I reckon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that,&rdquo; replied the detective coolly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Caprice cares  two straws about Villiers being the husband of Madame Midas. If he stole the  diamonds, she&rsquo;d lag him as sure as fate; no, as I told you before, she&rsquo;s got a  finger in this pie herself, and Villiers is helping her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the diamonds were stolen on that night,&rdquo; objected the American.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember you told me that Caprice had an interview in the  supper room with Villiers? Well, I believe she went upstairs, took the  diamonds, and gave them to Villiers to dispose of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;d like to find out,&rdquo; retorted Naball. &ldquo;She evidently wanted a sum of  money for something; now, are you aware that she wanted money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  she&rsquo;s always wanting money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt&mdash;but this must have been a specially large sum?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  glanced keenly at Naball&rsquo;s impassive face, drummed impatiently with his fingers  on the table, then evidently made up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  you what,&rdquo; he said rapidly. &ldquo;she did want a large sum of money&mdash;fact is, a  friend of hers got into a fix, and his wife went howling to her, so she said  she would replace the money, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt sold her diamonds to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it was something like that,&rdquo; said Naball coolly; &ldquo;but why the deuce  couldn&rsquo;t she sell her diamonds openly without all this row?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  you&rsquo;d better ask her,&rdquo; said Fenton, rising to his feet: &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t let me  meddle with the affair, so I can&rsquo;t do anything&mdash;if she&rsquo;s fool enough to lose or  sell five thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds, I can&rsquo;t help it: and now, sir,  the five minutes&mdash;&rdquo; glancing at his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  up long ago,&rdquo; replied Naball, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m curious about this  case, and I&rsquo;m going to get at it somehow, so at present I&rsquo;m off down to see  Caprice about this,&rdquo; and he tapped his breast-pocket, where the jewel was  placed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t get anything out of her,&rdquo; said Fenton yawning, &ldquo;if all you surmise is  true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what she says,&rdquo; observed Naball, going to the door. &ldquo;I can discover  all I want from the expression of her face when she knows what I&rsquo;ve got, and  where I got it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this Naball disappeared, and Fenton, returning to his desk, flung himself back  in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  the devil won&rsquo;t she prosecute?&rdquo; he muttered savagely to himself. &ldquo;Guess she  knows more about this robbery than she says, but even then&mdash;confound it, I&rsquo;m  mixed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having  come to this unsatisfactory conclusion, Mr Fenton went on with his work, and  dismissed all thoughts of the diamond robbery from his mind.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Naball was on his way down to Toorak, meditating over the revelation made to  him by Fenton about Caprice&rsquo;s sudden fit of generosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think she was so tender-hearted,&rdquo; murmured Naball, full of perplexity; &ldquo;she  must have had some strong reason for selling her diamonds. I wonder who the man  is?&mdash;and the wife called. Humph! this is quite a new game for Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he left the station, and walked to the house, instead of ringing the front-door  bell, he strolled round the corner to the verandah, on which the drawing-room  windows looked out. He did this because&mdash;wondering if Villiers was concerned in  the robbery&mdash;he wanted to see the window by which he entered the dining-room on  the night of the robbery. Soft-footed and stealthy in his motions, the  detective made no noise, and was just pausing on the edge of the verandah,  wondering whether he would go forward or return to the front door, when he  heard Kitty&rsquo;s voice in the drawing-room raised in a tone of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs  Malton!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;  said Naball to himself, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the name of Fenton&rsquo;s assistant manager. Now, I  wonder what his wife is calling here about? I&rsquo;ll wait and hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  the detective, filled with curiosity, took up his position close to one of the  windows, so that he could hear every word that was said, but, of course, was  unable to see anything going on inside. He commenced to listen, out of mere  curiosity, but soon the conversation took a turn which interested him greatly,  and, to his mind, threw a great deal of light on the diamond robbery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  have you called to see me again?&rdquo; asked Kitty, in a cold tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want to thank you for saving my husband,&rdquo; replied Mrs Malton. &ldquo;They told me  you were busy, but I have waited in the next room for half-an-hour to see you.  My husband is safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you &mdash; and him,&rdquo; answered Caprice, in an ironical tone. &ldquo;It is to  be hoped Mr Evan Malton won&rsquo;t embezzle any more money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball,  outside, could hardly refrain from giving a low whistle. So this was the man  mentioned by Fenton &mdash; his own familiar friend &mdash; and Kitty Marchurst had helped  him. In Heaven&rsquo;s name, why?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is due to your kindness that he is safe,&rdquo; said Mrs Malton, in a faltering tone;  &ldquo;you replaced the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; said Caprice; &ldquo;I never replaced a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you did, you did!&rdquo; said Mrs Malton vehemently, falling on her knees before  Kitty; &ldquo;every penny of the money has been paid back, and only you could have  done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not pay a penny, I tell you,&rdquo; said Caprice; &ldquo;still, I have had something to  do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; cried the poor wife, kissing the hand of the actress. &ldquo;May  God bless you for doing this good action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t have done it had it not been for the sake of your child,&rdquo; said Kitty  coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo;  thought the listener; &ldquo;Kitty Marchurst has a heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye,  good-bye!&rdquo; said Mrs Malton, rising to her feet. &ldquo;I may never see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt of that,&rdquo; replied Caprice, with a cynical laugh; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got all you  wanted, so now you leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; cried the other woman vehemently. &ldquo;I am not ungrateful. I will visit you  if you will let me. I am sorry for you. I pity you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  your pity and your visits for some one else&mdash;I want neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  heart is stone; it was hardened long, long ago. Leave me&mdash;I have done all I can  for you&mdash; now go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Malton made a step forward, and, catching Kitty in her arms, kissed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  bless you!&rdquo; she cried, in a low voice, and as she kissed her she felt a hot  tear fall on her hand. It was Caprice who wept, but, with a stifled sigh, she  pushed Mrs Malton away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a good woman,&rdquo; she said hoarsely. &ldquo;Go! go! and if you ever think of me, let  it be as one who, however bad her life, did at least one good action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  sank back into a chair, covering her face with her hands, while Mrs Malton,  with a look of pity on her face, and a low &ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; left the room.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the detective outside was smitten with a kind of remorse at having overheard  this pathetic scene,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  found out what Caprice wanted the money for,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry for  her&mdash;very sorry. I never knew before she was a woman&mdash;I thought she was a fiend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty,  drying her eyes, arose from her seat and dragged herself slowly across the room  to the window near which the detective was standing. He heard her coming and  tried to escape, and in another moment Kitty had opened the window, and they  were face to face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Naball,&rdquo; she cried, with a sudden, angry light in her eyes, &ldquo;you have heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  word,&rdquo; said Naball, looking straight at her wrathful face. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Naball Tells A Story</b></h2>
  <p>KITTY  looked at him in silence with flashing eyes, and then laughed bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how long is it since you added the spy business to your usual work?&rdquo; she asked,  with a sneer on her colourless face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  a few moments ago,&rdquo; replied Naball coolly. &ldquo;I came to see you on business, and,  hearing you in conversation with a lady, did not like to interrupt till you were  disengaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very much obliged to you for your courtesy,&rdquo; said Caprice scornfully; &ldquo;but now  you have satisfied your curiosity, M. le Mouchard, I&rsquo;ll trouble you to take  yourself off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  after I&rsquo;ve had a few moments&rsquo; conversation with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  decline to listen,&rdquo; said Kitty haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you had better,&rdquo; observed Naball significantly, &ldquo;as it&rsquo;s about the  robbery of your jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forbade you to go on any further with that matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did; but I disobeyed your injunction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I understand,&rdquo; replied Kitty indignantly; &ldquo;and may I ask if you have discovered  anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;this!&rdquo;  and he showed the diamond crescent to Caprice. She started violently, and her  pale face flushed a deep red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you get it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Randolph Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Villiers!&rdquo;  she echoed in surprise. &ldquo;How did it come into his possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I want to discover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you may save yourself the trouble, for you will never know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand that,&rdquo; said Naball quietly; &ldquo;nothing can be done unless you permit  me to go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forbid you to go on,&rdquo; she retorted angrily.</p>
  <p>Naball  bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;then there is nothing for me but to leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think there is,&rdquo; assented Kitty coldly, turning to re-enter the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  before I go,&rdquo; went on the detective, playing his great card, &ldquo;I will leave your  jewel with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  said Kitty, glancing over her shoulder at the crescent&mdash;&ldquo;that is not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Fenton says it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Fenton!&rdquo; echoed Caprice jeeringly; &ldquo;and how does Mr Fenton know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think he was the best person to know,&rdquo; retorted Naball, nettled at her  mockery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good many people think the same way,&rdquo; said Kitty disdainfully, &ldquo;but in this  case Mr Fenton is wrong&mdash;I never saw those diamonds before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did it come into Mr Villiers&rsquo; possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, not being in Mr Villiers&rsquo; confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Naball significantly, &ldquo;you are quite certain you are not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; replied Kitty coldly; &ldquo;explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you wish it,&rdquo; said the detective smoothly. &ldquo;I will tell it in the form of a  little story&mdash;have I your permission to be seated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded carelessly, whereupon Naball sat down on one of the lounging chairs,  and, crossing his legs, settled himself composedly, while Kitty, standing near  him with loosely-clasped hands, looked idly at the green lawn, with its  brilliant border of many-coloured flowers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was once a woman called Folly, who lived&mdash;let us say&mdash;in Cloudland&mdash;&rdquo; began Naball  airily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  said Kitty angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort,&rdquo; retorted Naball coolly, &ldquo;it is truth in disguise. I have been to  school &mdash;I have read Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faery Queen&rsquo;&mdash;if you please, we will consider  this story, though not in verse, as one of the lost cantos of the poem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  shrugged her shoulders with contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you&rsquo;re mad,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I am,&rdquo; retorted Naball sharply, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s method in my madness, as you will  soon find out&mdash;so, to go on with the lost canto of the &lsquo;Faery Queen.&rsquo; This  woman, Folly, was reputed to have a hard heart&mdash;no doubt she had, but there was  one soft spot in it&mdash;love for her child. Many men loved this charming Folly, and  paid dearly for the privilege. One man, misnamed Strength, loved her madly, and  gave her many jewels. Strength had a friend, called Weakness, and though they  were so dissimilar in character, they worked together. Weakness also loved  Folly, though he had a wife, and, to gain Folly&rsquo;s love, he stole a lot of  money. His wife discovered this, and going to Folly, implored her to help  Weakness, but in vain, till at last she gained her point by appealing to the  one soft spot in Folly&rsquo;s heart &mdash;love for her child. She was successful, and  Folly promised to save the husband by replacing the money, which she could do  through the agency of Strength, who was her lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Folly,  however, did not know where to get the money, so, in despair, determined to  part with her jewels. She dared not do so openly, lest the inhabitants of  Cloudland should find out what Weakness had done, so she enlisted the services  of a man called Vice. Here,&rdquo; said Naball gaily, &ldquo;we will leave the narrative  style, and finish the story dramatically.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty,  who had grown pale, made no sign, so Naball resumed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scene,  a supper-room, with a window open &mdash;time, night &mdash; supper ended&mdash;guests away&mdash;  enter Vice through open window&mdash;helps himself to champagne. Folly, informed of  presence of Vice, enters the room and orders him out&mdash; he refuses to leave till  he gets money&mdash;she refuses to give it to him. Suddenly an idea strikes her, and  she tells Vice she will give him money if he sells her jewels for her secretly&mdash;Vice  consents. Folly goes up to her room, gets jewels, gives them to Vice, who goes  away and breaks down shrubs under window, which is opened by Folly to show  every one that a burglar has stolen the jewels. Rumours of the theft get  about&mdash;Bloodhound goes on the track&mdash;traces Vice to his den&mdash; finds one  jewel&mdash;comes to show it to Folly&mdash; overhears wife of Weakness thanking Folly for  replacing money stolen by her husband&mdash;exit wife of Weakness&mdash;enter Bloodhound to  Folly, who denies having ever seen jewel before. Bloodhound tells a story to  Folly, which Folly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Denies,  yes, denies!&rdquo; broke in Kitty angrily: &ldquo;your story is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; said Naball, rising, &ldquo;allegorical.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can understand what you mean,&rdquo; said Kitty, after a pause; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all wrong.  I never paid this money for Malton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&mdash;Weakness,&rdquo; said Naball politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  why keep up this transparent deception? Your story is excellent, and I  understand all about Folly, Vice, and Strength, but you are wrong&mdash;that jewel is  not mine. I never paid the money, and I don&rsquo;t know anything about Malton&rsquo;s  business, so you can leave me at once, and never show your face again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the jewel?&rdquo; said the detective, holding it out.</p>
  <p>Kitty  snatched it out of his hand, and flung it across the lawn. It flashed  brilliantly in the sunlight, and fell just on the verge of the flowerbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can follow it,&mdash;Bloodhound,&rdquo; she said disdainfully, and, entering the house,  closed the window after her.</p>
  <p>Naball  stood for a moment smiling in a gratified manner to himself, then, sauntering  slowly across the lawn, picked up the jewel and replaced it in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew I was right,&rdquo; he murmured quietly, as he strolled to the gate; &ldquo;she stole  the diamonds to pay Malton&rsquo;s debt, and Villiers got this for payment as an  accomplice. I wish I could get on with the case, but she won&rsquo;t let me&mdash;what a  pity; dear, dear, what a pity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had by this time reached the gate, and was passing through it, when a hansom  drove up, from out which Fenton jumped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  he asked, when he saw Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Naball, dusting his varnished boots with a silk hankerchief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does she say?&rdquo; asked Fenton inquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a woman generally does say&mdash;everything but the truth. Going to see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Fenton, paying his cab fare; &ldquo;can I do anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  things,&rdquo; observed Naball quietly: &ldquo;in the first place, let me have your cab;  and in the second, give this to Caprice with my compliments,&rdquo; and he handed the  crescent of diamonds to Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you give it to her yourself?&rdquo; asked Fenton, taking it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she said it wasn&rsquo;t hers,&rdquo; replied Naball, getting into the cab. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do  anything more in the matter; it&rsquo;s a beautiful case spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  spoiled?&rdquo; asked Fenton, pausing at the gate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  there&rsquo;s a woman in it,&rdquo; replied Naball; &ldquo;good-bye!&rdquo; and the cab drove off in a  cloud of dust, leaving Fenton at the gate looking in a puzzled manner at the  diamond crescent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  the deuce did she deny this being hers?&rdquo; he asked himself as he opened the  gate. &ldquo;I know it well&mdash;I ought to, considering I paid for it&mdash; there&rsquo;s some game  in this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rang the bell, which was answered by Bliggings, who, in reply to his question  as to whether Kitty was at home, burst out into a volley of language.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  gracious an&rsquo; good &lsquo;eavens, missus &lsquo;ave bin talkin&rsquo; to a lady this mornin&rsquo;, and  is that upset as never was&mdash;chalk is black to her complexing, and penny hices &lsquo;ot  to&rsquo; the chill of her feets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Fenton, entering the house and leisurely taking off his hat, &ldquo;just tell  your mistress I want to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  gracious an&rsquo; good &lsquo;eavens!&rdquo; cried Bliggings, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a-lyin&rsquo; down in company  with a linseed poultase an&rsquo; a cup of tea, both bein&rsquo; good for removin&rsquo; &lsquo;eadaches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Scot!&rdquo; said Fenton impatiently, pushing the voluble Bliggings aside, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go  and see her straight off myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  went upstairs and knocked at the sitting-room door. Hearing a faint voice  telling him to come in, he entered the room, which he found in semi-darkness,  with the pungent aroma of<i> eau de cologne</i> pervading the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; asked Kitty fretfully, thinking it was the servant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see you,&rdquo; replied Fenton gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; cried Caprice, sitting up on the sofa, looking pale and wan in her  white dress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just seen that Naball, and he&rsquo;s been  accusing me of stealing my own jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  did you?&rdquo; asked Fenton complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted angrily; &ldquo;why should I? Naball thinks I did it  to replace the money Malton stole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did he find out that?&rdquo; asked Fenton, who knew quite well he had told him about  it himself</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  overheard Mrs Malton thanking me,&rdquo; retorted Kitty impatiently; &ldquo;the money his  been replaced, so I suppose, you did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did,&rdquo; said Fenton boldly, &ldquo;for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a good fellow, Fenton,&rdquo; said Kitty, in a softened tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did what  I asked you&mdash;now, go away, for I must get a sleep, or I&rsquo;ll never be able to act  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what about this jewel?&rdquo; asked Fenton, taking the crescent out of his pocket. &ldquo;Naball  said you denied it being yours.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I did,&rdquo; replied Caprice pettishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why? I gave it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you can give it to me again,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;Put it on the table, and go  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  thought a moment, then, going over to the table, placed the jewel thereon, and  turned once more to Caprice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Kitty,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;did you do anything with those diamonds&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I did, and perhaps I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Caprice enigmatically; &ldquo;at all events, I&rsquo;m  not going to have any more fuss made over them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  good-bye at present,&rdquo; said Fenton carelessly. &ldquo;I say, you might give me a kiss,  after fixing up Malton&rsquo;s affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I will&mdash;at the theatre to-night. Do leave me, my head is so bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so bad as you are, you little devil,&rdquo; murmured Fenton, closing the sitting-room  door softly after him. &ldquo;Well, I guess there&rsquo;ll be no more trouble about those  diamonds, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    The Gossip Of Clubs</b></h2>
  <p>It was  called &ldquo;The Skylarks&rsquo; Club,&rdquo; because, like those tuneful birds, the members  were up very early in the morning. Not that the aforesaid members were early  risers by any means&mdash;but because they never went to bed till three or four o&rsquo;clock.  To put it plainly, they stayed up nearly all night, and it seemed to be a point  of honour with them that, as long as a quorum were on the premises, the club  should be kept open.</p>
  <p>Most  of the members were dissipated and led fast lives, drank a good deal, gambled  away large sums, betted freely, and, to all appearances, were going to the dogs  as fast as they possibly could. The code of morality was not very strict, and  the &ldquo;Skylarks&rdquo; generally viewed each other&rsquo;s good or bad luck in a cynical  manner. Occasionally a member disappeared from his accustomed place, and it was  generally understood he had &ldquo;gone under,&rdquo; or, in other words, was vegetating on  some up-country station, doubtless cursing the &ldquo;Skylarks&rdquo; freely as the cause  of his ruin.</p>
  <p>Other  clubs in Melbourne were fast&mdash;not a doubt about that&mdash;but every one declared that  the &ldquo;Skylarks&rdquo; overstepped all bounds of decency. Whatever devilment was to be  done, they would do it, and, as they had no characters to lose, they generally  amused themselves by trying to destroy other people&rsquo;s good name, and generally  succeeded.</p>
  <p>It  was a Bohemian club, and among its members were stock-brokers, musicians,  journalists, and actors, so that, whatever the moral tone of the place, the  conversation was generally brilliant, albeit rather malicious. One way and  another, there was a good deal of money floating about, for if the members  worked hard at business during the day, they also worked hard at pleasure  during the night, so, systematically, burned the candle at both ends. &ldquo;<i>Fay ce que vouldras&rdquo;</i> was their motto,  and they certainly carried it out to the very last letter.</p>
  <p>Keith  Stewart was a member of this delectable fraternity, having been introduced by  Ezra Lazarus, and, thanks to his mysterious five hundred pounds, was able to  cut a very decent figure among the members. He was still in the pawnbroker&rsquo;s  office, although he very much wanted to leave it, but, having passed his word  to old Lazarus to stay six months, he was determined to do so.</p>
  <p>It  was now about three months since the diamond robbery, and, after being a nine  days&rsquo; wonder, it had passed out of the minds of every one. Nothing more was  heard of the theft, and, after a great number of surmises, more or less wrong,  the matter was allowed to drop, as a new divorce case of a novel character now  engrossed the public mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prince  Carnival&rdquo; had been withdrawn after a very successful run, and Kitty Marchurst  was now appearing in &ldquo;Eblis,&rdquo; which, as she expected, had turned out a failure.  Under these circumstances, &ldquo;Prince Carnival&rdquo; was revived, pending the  production of &ldquo;Faust Upset,&rdquo; a new burlesque by Messrs Stewart and Lazarus.</p>
  <p>Both  these young men had worked hard at the piece, and Mortimer, having approved of  the first act, had determined to put the play on the stage: first, because he  saw it was by no means a bad piece, and secondly, he had nothing else handy to  bring forward. If he could have obtained a new and successful opera-bouffe from  London, &ldquo;Faust Upset&rdquo; would have been ignominiously shelved, but, luckily for  Keith and his friends, all the late opera-bouffes had been failures, so  Mortimer made a virtue of necessity, and gave them a chance.</p>
  <p>It  was about eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, and the smoking-room of the &ldquo;Skylarks&rdquo; was  full. Some of the members had been there for some hours, others had dropped in  after the theatres were closed, and here and there could be seen a reporter  scribbling his notes for publication next day.</p>
  <p>A  luxurious apartment it was, with lounging chairs covered with crimson plush,  plenty of mirrors, and a number of marble-topped tables, which were now covered  with various beverages. Every one was talking loudly, and the waiters were  flitting about actively employed in ministering to the creature comforts of the  patrons of the club. What with the dusky atmosphere caused by the smoking, the  babel of voices, the jingle of glasses, and the constant moving about of the  restless crowd, it looked like some fantastic nightmare.</p>
  <p>Keith  was seated in a corner smoking a cigarette and waiting for Ezra, who had  promised to meet him there, and in the meantime was idly watching the crowd of  his friends, and listening to their gossip. Malton was also lounging about the  room, chatting to his friends on current topics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  going on in the House?&rdquo; asked Pelk, a theatrical critic, of Slingsby, who had  just entered.</p>
  <p>That  gentleman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  slanging match, as usual,&rdquo; he replied, taking a seat and ringing the bell. &ldquo;Some  members have got an idea that abuse is wit. I don&rsquo;t think much of the Victorian  Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  better than the New South Wales one, at all events,&rdquo; said Keith, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  not saying much,&rdquo; retorted Slingsby, lighting a cigar. &ldquo;The Sydney men are more  like fractious children than anything else, though to be sure that&rsquo;s only  proper, seeing our Parliaments are nurseries for sucking politicians.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  severe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  true&mdash;the truth is always disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  that&rsquo;s the reason so few people speak it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;truth  is a sour old maid whom nobody wants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  you, at all events, Slingsby&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s  a matter of choice&mdash;<i>Video meliora proboque  deteriora sequor.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be classical&mdash;it&rsquo;s out of place here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit,&rdquo; retorted Slingsby smoothly, looking round at the circle of grinning  faces, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s out of the dictionary, you know, foreign words and affixes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every  one roared at this candid confession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  wonder <i>The Penny Whistle</i> flourishes  when there&rsquo;s such men as you on the staff,&rdquo; said Toltby, with a sneer.</p>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve  no cause to complain,&rdquo; replied Slingsby; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been kind enough to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  they recognise good acting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slingsby  looked at him queerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  boy, I prefer the stage of the House to that of the theatre&mdash;the actors are much  more amusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Felix Rolleston, now looking much older since the Hansom Cab murder  case, but as lively as ever, entered the room and danced up to the coterie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  gentlemen,&rdquo; he said gaily, &ldquo;what is the news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  news, bad news, and such news as you&rsquo;ve never heard of,&rdquo; quoted Keith lazily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, my local Gratiano,&rdquo; replied Felix, quickly recognising the quotation as  from the &ldquo;Merchant of Venice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the way, there&rsquo;s a letter for you outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thanks,&rdquo; said Stewart rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get it,&rdquo; and he sauntered out  lazily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  ejaculated Felix, looking after him, &ldquo;our friend is the author of &lsquo;Faust Upset,&rsquo;  I understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Toltby; &ldquo;deuced good piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means you&rsquo;ve got an excellent part,&rdquo; struck in Slingsby mercilessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; retorted Toltby complacently; &ldquo;all the parts are good&mdash;especially  Caprice&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that goes without saying,&rdquo; said Pelk, with a grin; &ldquo;our friend is rather sweet  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  is she,&rdquo; said Felix significantly; &ldquo;case of reciprocity, dear boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  given Fenton the go-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and Meddlechip is elevated to the vacancy. Wonder how long it will be before  she breaks him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  even with her talents for squandering, Caprice can&rsquo;t burst up the richest man  in Victoria,&rdquo; said Slingsby vulgarly; &ldquo;when she does give him up, I suppose  Stewart will succeed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  enough cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  what is cash compared to love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  a good deal in this case, as Fenton found out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  of the devil,&rdquo; said Felix quickly; &ldquo;here comes the gentleman in question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton,  looking harassed and worn, entered the room, and glanced round. Seeing  Rolleston, he came over to him and began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  you look happy, boys,&rdquo; he said, in his nasal voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than you do,&rdquo; replied Rolleston, scanning him keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;ve overworked myself,&rdquo; said Fenton coolly, &ldquo;I need pulling up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  and see a doctor&mdash;try tonics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  bah! glass of champagne will fix me straight. Here, waiter, bring in a bottle  of Heidsieck. Any of you boys join?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the boys assenting to the hospitable proposition, Fenton ordered two bottles,  and lighted a huge cigar. When the waiter came back with the wine, Keith also  entered, with a soft look on his face which puzzled Rolleston. He had put on  his overcoat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said that astute gentleman, &ldquo;you look pleased&mdash;your letter was pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  very,&rdquo; replied Keith laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was from a woman,&rdquo; said Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  that&rsquo;s generally anything but pleasant,&rdquo; grunted Slingsby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, to such a Don Juan as you,&rdquo; said Pelk, amid a general laugh.</p>
  <p>The  waiter was opening the wine so slowly that Fenton lost patience, and snatched  one bottle up from the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess  we had better fix those two up at once,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any one got a knife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  put his hand in his pocket, and produced there from Meg&rsquo;s present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  Caesar, what a pig-sticker,&rdquo; said Fenton, holding it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you buy such a thing, Stewart?&rdquo; asked Felix, laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t buy it,&rdquo; replied Keith; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a present from a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very young lady, I should say,&rdquo; said Slingsby drily; &ldquo;not much idea of taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Matter  of opinion,&rdquo; said Keith serenely; &ldquo;I like the knife for the sake of the  donor&mdash;her name&rsquo;s on the handle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  by this time had opened the bottle, and laid the knife down on the table, from  whence Felix picked it up and examined it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;From  Meg,&rsquo; &rdquo; he read, in an amused tone; &ldquo;gad, Stewart, I thought it was the mother,  not the daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  shot a fiery glance at Keith, who laughed in rather an embarrassed manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was just the child&rsquo;s whim,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;I saved her from the tram-car,  so she gave me this as a souvenir;&rdquo; and, taking up the knife, he shut it with a  sharp click, and slipped it into his overcoat pocket.</p>
  <p>When  they had all finished the wine, Fenton said he had to see Mortimer about some  business.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half-past  ten,&rdquo; he said, looking at his watch; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll just be about through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got to see Mortimer to-night,&rdquo; observed Keith, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m waiting here for  Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the new play, I reckon,&rdquo; said Fenton; &ldquo;well, you&rsquo;d better walk up with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks; I must wait for Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  come and have a game of billiards in the meantime,&rdquo; said Felix, rising; &ldquo;take  off your coat, you&rsquo;ll find it hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; assented Keith readily &ldquo;Here, Alfred,&rdquo; and, slipping off his coat,  handed it to a waiter, who was just passing, &ldquo;hang this up for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  waiter took the coat, threw it over his arm, and vanished; while Keith and  Felix strolled leisurely away in the direction of the billiard-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  the deuce does Stewart run it?&rdquo; asked Fenton, looking after them; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t get  much salary at old Lazarus&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Case  of God tempering the wind to the shorn lamb,&rdquo; said Slingsby ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, I don&rsquo;t think he ought to be a member of the Club, a confounded pawnbroker&rsquo;s  clerk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is rather a topsy-turvy business, ain&rsquo;t it; but you see, in the colonies Jack&rsquo;s  as good as his master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  in some cases a deal better,&rdquo; said Pelk, referring to the relative positions of  Malton and Fenton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Particularly  when Jack&rsquo;s got a pretty wife,&rdquo; finished Toltby significantly</p>
  <p>Fenton  knew this was a hint at his penchant for Mrs Malton, but he did not very well  see how he could take it to himself, particularly when he saw every one  smiling, so he smiled back saturninely at the circle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  devilish witty, boys,&rdquo; he said coldly; &ldquo;guess the wine has sharpened your  brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he strolled away in his usual cool manner, Slingsby looked after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  friend&rsquo;s hard hit over Mrs Malton,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  one knows that,&rdquo; grinned Toltby, &ldquo;except the husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the husband is generally the last to find out these things,&rdquo; remarked Pelk  drily; and the conversation ended.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Rolleston and Keith were playing their game of billiards, a pastime in which  the former was an adept, and soon defeated Keith, who threw down his cue in  half anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  always win,&rdquo; he said pettishly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use playing with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is,&rdquo; said Felix cheerfully. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a good player, so if you play  with me it will improve you very much&mdash;that remark sounds conceited, but it&rsquo;s  true&mdash;come and have another game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to-night,&rdquo; replied Keith; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to keep my appointment with Mortimer&mdash;it&rsquo;s  no use waiting for Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is,&rdquo; cried a new voice, and Lazarus made his appearance at the door of  the billiard-room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for having kept you waiting, but it was  unavoidable. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it as we walk up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Keith, and turned to go, followed by Ezra, who nodded to  Rolleston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;  cried that gentleman, making a cannon. &ldquo;Good luck be with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;  responded Keith laughing, and disappeared with Ezra. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    A Struggle For Fame</b></h2>
  <p>THE  two young men walked slowly up the street in the direction of the Bon-Bon  Theatre, passing into Swanston Street just as the Town Hall clock struck  eleven. It was a beautiful moonlight night, but no breeze was blowing, and the  heat which the earth had drawn to her bosom during the day was now exhaled from  the warm ground in a faint humid vapour. Crowds of people were in the streets  sauntering idly along, evidently unwilling to go to bed. The great buildings  stood up white and spectral-like on the one side of the street, while on the  other they loomed out black against the clear sky. The garish flare of the  innumerable street lamps seemed out of place under the serene splendour of the  heavens, and the frequent cries of the street boys, and noisy rattling of  passing cabs, jarred on the ear. At least Keith thought so, for, after walking  in silence for some time, he turned with a gesture of irritation to his  companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  this noise disagreeable?&rdquo; he said impatiently; &ldquo;under such a perfect sky the  city ought to lie dead like a fantastic dream of the Arabian Nights, but the  gas lamps and incessant restlessness of Melbourne vulgarises the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poetical,  certainly,&rdquo; replied Ezra, rousing himself from his abstraction; &ldquo;but I should  not care to inhabit an enchanted city. To me there is something grand in this  restless crowd of people, all instinct with life and ambition&mdash;the gas lamps jar  on your dream, but they are evidences of civilisation, and the hoarse murmur of  the mob is like the mutterings of a distant storm, or white waves breaking on a  lonely coast. No, my friend, leave the enchanted cities to dreamland, and live  the busy life of the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  ideas and wishes are singularly at variance,&rdquo; said Keith smiling. &ldquo;The city  suggests poetical thoughts to you, but you reject them and lower yourself to  the narrow things of everyday&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a man, and must live as one,&rdquo; replied the Jew, with a sigh; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard  enough to do so&mdash; Heaven knows!&mdash;without creating Paradises at whose doors we  must ever stand like lost Peris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with you to-night?&rdquo; asked Keith abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  particular; only I&rsquo;ve had a quarrel with my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all? My dear Lazarus, your father lives in an atmosphere of quarrelling&mdash;it&rsquo;s  bread and meat to him&mdash;so you needn&rsquo;t fret over a few words. What was the  quarrel about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&mdash;generally  a fruitful cause of dissension. Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know how I love Rachel?&rdquo; said Lazarus quietly. &ldquo;Well, I am anxious to marry her  and have a home of my own. It&rsquo;s weary work living in tents like a Bedouin. I  get a good salary, it&rsquo;s true; but I asked my father to give me a sufficient sum  of ready money to buy a piece of land and a house. I might have saved myself  the trouble&mdash; he refused, and we had angry words, so parted in anger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t bother about it, if I were you,&rdquo; said Keith consolingly. &ldquo;Words break  no bones&mdash; besides, this burlesque may bring us a lot of money, and then you can  marry Rachel when you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t expect much money out of it,&rdquo; replied the Jew, with a frown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our  first piece, and Mortimer will drive a hard bargain with us&mdash;but you seem very  hopeful to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have cause to. Eug&eacute;nie has written me a letter, in which she says she is coming  to Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  good news, indeed. Is she going to stay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so,&rdquo; said Keith gaily. &ldquo;I told you she was a governess, so she has  replied to an advertisement in the <i>Argus</i>,  and hopes to get the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust she will,&rdquo; observed Ezra, smiling at Keith&rsquo;s delight. &ldquo;She will do you a  lot of good by her presence, and guard you from the spells of Armida,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alias  Caprice. Thanks for the warning, but I&rsquo;ve not been ensnared by the fair  enchantress yet, and never mean to; but here we are at the theatre. I hope we  get good terms from Mortimer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I, for Rachel&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are both <i>preux chevaliers</i>, anxious to  gain for our lady-loves not fame, but money. Oh, base desire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may be base, but it&rsquo;s very necessary,&rdquo; replied the prudent Jew, and they both  entered the stage-door of the theatre.</p>
  <p>Mortimer&rsquo;s  sanctum was a very well-furnished room, displaying considerable taste on the  part of the occupant, for the manager of the &ldquo;BonBon&rdquo; was sybaritic in his  ideas. The floor was covered with a heavy velvet carpet, and the walls adorned  with excellent pictures, while the furniture was all chosen for comfort as well  as for ornament. Mortimer was seated at his desk with a confused mass of papers  before him, and leaning back in a chair near him was Caprice, who looked rather  pale and worn.</p>
  <p>There  was a lamp on the table with a heavy shade, which concentrated all the light  into a circle, and Kitty&rsquo;s pale face, with its aureole of fair hair seen in the  powerful radiance, appeared strange and unreal. Dark circles under her heavy  eyes, faint lines round the small mouth, and the weary look now habitual to  her, all combined to give her face a wan and spiritual look which made even  Mortimer shiver as he looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, Kitty,&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look so dismal. You ought to see a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; she asked listlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I don&rsquo;t think so. You&rsquo;ve been going down the hill steadily the last few months.  Look how thin you are&mdash;a bag of bones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  was Rachel,&rdquo; replied Caprice, with a faint smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she didn&rsquo;t live very long. Besides, you ain&rsquo;t Rachel,&rdquo; growled Mortimer, &ldquo;and I  don&rsquo;t want you to get ill just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you could hardly supply my place,&rdquo; said Caprice, with a sneer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  bother yourself, Mortimer, I&rsquo;m not going to die yet. When I do I shan&rsquo;t be  sorry; life hasn&rsquo;t been so pleasant to me that I should wish to live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you want,&rdquo; grumbled the manager; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got all Melbourne at  your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say much for Melbourne&rsquo;s morality, then,&rdquo; retorted Caprice bitterly; &ldquo;circumstances  have made me what I am, but I&rsquo;m getting tired of the cakes and ale business. If  I could only secure the future of my child, I&rsquo;d turn religious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary  Magdalen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a case of history repeating itself, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she replied, with a harsh laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo;  said Mortimer, scrutinising her narrowly; &ldquo;the worse a woman is in her youth,  the more devout she becomes in her old age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the authority of M. de la Rochefoucauld, I suppose,&rdquo; answered Caprice; &ldquo;old age  gives good advice when it no longer can give bad example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man you never knew&mdash;Vandeloup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know that my not being acquainted with him was much to be regretted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t think it was,&rdquo; replied Caprice coolly; &ldquo;he had twice your brains&mdash;to  know him was a liberal education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  cheap cynicism, gad, you&rsquo;ve been an apt pupil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  laughed, and, rising from her seat, began to walk to and fro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish those boys would come,&rdquo; she said restlessly; &ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go,&rdquo; said Mortimer; &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I need,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I want to see that they get good terms for their  play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give them a fair price,&rdquo; said Mortimer; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going to be so liberal as  you expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you&rsquo;re sweet on that Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I am!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meddlechip  won&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!  I don&rsquo;t care two straws for Meddlechip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but you do for his money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; that goes without saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a hardened little devil, Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  knows I&rsquo;ve had enough to make me hard,&rdquo; she replied bitterly, throwing herself  down in her chair, with a frown.</p>
  <p>There  was a knock at the door at this moment? and, in reply to Mortimer&rsquo;s invitation  to &ldquo;come in,&rdquo; Ezra and Keith appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you two are late,&rdquo; said Mortimer, glancing at his watch; &ldquo;a quarter-past  eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  very sorry,&rdquo; said Ezra quietly; &ldquo;but it was my fault. I was telling Stewart  about some business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we won&rsquo;t take long to settle this affair,&rdquo; remarked Mortimer, looking over his  papers. &ldquo;Be seated, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  took off his overcoat and threw it over the back of a chair, on which Kitty&rsquo;s  fur-lined mantle was already resting.</p>
  <p>Caprice,  who had flushed up on the advance of Stewart, leaned back in her chair, while  Keith sat down near her, and Ezra took a position opposite, close to Mortimer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  then, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mortimer, playing with a paper-cutter, &ldquo;about this  burlesque&mdash;what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rather a curious question to ask an author,&rdquo; replied Keith gaily. &ldquo;We naturally  think it excellent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope the public will think the same,&rdquo; observed Mortimer drily; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t  mean that. I want to know your terms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; said Ezra, smoothly; &ldquo;but just tell us what you are prepared to give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  buyer, gentlemen, you are sellers,&rdquo; replied the manager shrewdly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take  up your position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  leaned back in her chair and bent over close to Keith&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  five pounds a night,&rdquo; she whispered. Stewart glanced at Ezra, and seeing he was  in doubt as to what to say, spoke out loudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speaking  for myself and partner, I think we&rsquo;ll take five pounds a night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ll agree to that,&rdquo; observed Ezra eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you will,&rdquo; rejoined  Mortimer, raising his eyebrows; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s thirty pounds a week, fifteen pounds  apiece&mdash;a very nice sum, gentlemen &mdash;if you get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what do you propose to give?&rdquo; asked Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  pound for every performance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you take us for born fools?&rdquo; he asked angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not,&rdquo; replied Mortimer, catching his chin between finger and thumb, and  looking critically at the two young men; &ldquo;I take you for very clever boys who  are just making a start, and I&rsquo;m willing to help you&mdash;at my own price&mdash;which is  one pound a night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  game&rsquo;s not worth the candle,&rdquo; said Ezra, in a disappointed tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, it is,&rdquo; retorted Mortimer; &ldquo;it gives you a chance. Now, look here, I&rsquo;ve no  desire to take advantage of my position, which, as you see, is a very strong  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; asked Caprice, elevating her eyebrows.</p>
  <p>Mortimer  explained in his slow voice as follows,&mdash; &ldquo;I can write home to London and get  successful plays with big reputations already made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and pay big prices for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be,&rdquo; replied the manager imperturbably; &ldquo;but if I give a good price I get a  good article that is sure to recoup me for my outlay. I don&rsquo;t say that &lsquo;Faust  Upset&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t good, but at the same time it&rsquo;s an experiment. Australians don&rsquo;t  like their own raw material.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  never get the chance of seeing it,&rdquo; said Keith bitterly; &ldquo;you of course look at  it from a business point of view, as is only proper, but seeing that you draw  all your money from Colonial pockets, why not give Colonial brains a chance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Colonial brains don&rsquo;t pay, Colonial pockets do,&rdquo; said Mortimer coolly; &ldquo;besides,  I am giving you a chance, and that at considerable risk to myself. I will put  on this burlesque in good style because Caprice is dead set on it; but business  is business, and I can&rsquo;t afford to lose money on an untried production.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  it turns out a great success,&rdquo; said Ezra, &ldquo;we, the authors, only make six  pounds a week, while you take all the profits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  retorted Mortimer; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  if we make a great success of this burlesque,&rdquo; said Keith, &ldquo;you will give us  better terms for the next thing we write?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes,&rdquo; said the manager, in a hesitating manner; &ldquo;but, of course, though your  position is improved, mine is still the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand; as long as you have the run of the London market, you can treat  Colonial playwrights as you choose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  stated the case exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an unfair advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, but business is business. I hold the trump card.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a bad lookout for the literary and musical future of Australia when such men as  you hold the cards,&rdquo; said Ezra gloomily; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use arguing the case. I&rsquo;ve  heard all this sort of thing before. The Australians are too busy making money  to trouble about such a contemptible thing as literary work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you what, Mortimer,&rdquo; broke in Caprice, &ldquo;give them two pounds a night for  the piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  you will, or I don&rsquo;t show at the Bon-Bon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget your engagement, my dear,&rdquo; said Mortimer complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Kitty, snapping her fingers; &ldquo;that for my engagement. I don&rsquo;t  care if I broke it to-morrow. You&rsquo;ve got your remedy, no doubt; try it, and see  what you&rsquo;ll make of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mortimer  looked uneasily at her. He knew he had the law on his side, but Caprice was so  reckless that she cared for nothing, and would do what she pleased in spite of  both him and the law. Besides, he could not afford to lose her, so he met her  half way.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  you what,&rdquo; he said genially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to be hard on you, boys&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give  you one pound a night for a week, and if the burlesque is a success, two  pounds&mdash;there, that&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose it&rsquo;s the best terms we can get,&rdquo; said Keith recklessly; &ldquo;anything for  the chance of having a play put on the stage. What do you say, Lazarus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accept,&rdquo; replied the Jew briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case,&rdquo; said Kitty, rising, &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t stay any longer. Mr Lazarus, will  you take me to my carriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow  me,&rdquo; said Keith advancing.</p>
  <p>Kitty  recoiled, and an angry light flashed in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; she said coldly, snatching up her cloak, &ldquo;Mr Lazarus will see me  down,&rdquo; and without another word she swept out of the room, followed by Ezra,  who was much astonished at the rebuff Keith had received.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that for?&rdquo; asked Mortimer looking up. &ldquo;I thought you were the white boy there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Keith, in a puzzled tone. &ldquo;She has been rather cold to  me for the last three months, but she never snubbed me till now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s never the same two minutes together,&rdquo; said Mortimer, turning once more to  his desk. &ldquo;Have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  nodded, whereupon Mortimer, who was the most hospitable of men, brought forth  whisky and seltzer. As he was filling the glasses, Ezra re-entered with Keith&rsquo;s  coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caprice  carried this downstairs with her by mistake,&rdquo; he said, giving it to Keith, &ldquo;and  called me back to return it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gad!  she went off in such a whirlwind of passion I don&rsquo;t wonder she took it. I&rsquo;m  glad she left the chair,&rdquo; said Mortimer coolly. &ldquo;Will you join us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thanks,&rdquo; replied Ezra, putting on his hat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go back to the office.  Good-night. See you to-morrow, Keith; you can settle with Mortimer about the  agreement,&rdquo; and thereupon he vanished.</p>
  <p>Keith  and Mortimer sat down, and the latter drafted out an agreement about the play  which he promised to send to his lawyer, and then, if the young men approved of  it, the whole affair could be settled right off.</p>
  <p>This  took a considerable time, and it was about half-past twelve when Keith, having  said goodnight to Mortimer, left the theatre. He walked down Collins Street,  smoking his cigarette, and thinking about his good luck and Eug&eacute;nie. How delighted  she would be at his success. He would make lots of money, and then he could  marry her. After wandering about for some considerable time, he turned  homeward. Walking up Bourke Street, he entered Russell Street, and went on  towards East Melbourne. Passing along in front of Lazarus&rsquo; shop, he saw a man  leaning against the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing there?&rdquo; asked Keith sharply, going up to him.</p>
  <p>The  man struck out feebly with his fists, and giving an indistinct growl, lurched  heavily against Keith, who promptly knocked him down, and had a tussel with  him. The moon was shining brightly, and, as the light fell on his face, Keith  recognised him instantly&mdash;it was Randolph Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better go home, Villiers,&rdquo; he said quickly, raising him to his feet, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be  getting into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  to devil,&rdquo; said Mr Villiers, in a husky voice, lurching into the centre of the  street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out on business. I know what I know, and if you knew what I knew,  you&rsquo;d know a lot&mdash; eh! wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and he leered at Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pah,  you&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; said Stewart in disgust, turning on his heel; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better get  home, or you&rsquo;ll get into some mischief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled Villiers, &ldquo;but I know some &lsquo;un as will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know&mdash;I know,&rdquo; retorted Villiers, and went lurching down the street, setting  the words to a popular tune,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="verse">&ldquo;I  know a thing or two,<br>
Yes I do&mdash;just a few.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  looked at the drunken man rolling heavily down the street&mdash;a black, misshapen  figure in the moonlight&mdash;and then, turning away with a laugh, walked thence to  East Melbourne thinking of Eug&eacute;nie. </p>

    The Russell Street Crime</b></h2>
  <p>THE  next morning a rumour crept through the city that a murder had been committed  in a house in Russell Street, and many people proceeded to the spot indicated  to find out if it were true. They discovered that for once rumour had not lied,  and Lazarus, the pawnbroker, one of the best known characters in the city, had  been found dead in his bed with his throat cut. The house being guarded by the  police, who were very reticent, no distinct information could be gained, and it  was not until <i>The Penny Whistle</i> came  out at four o&rsquo;clock that the true facts of the crime were ascertained. A  general rush was made by the public for copies of the paper, and by nightfall  nothing was talked of throughout Melbourne but the Russell Street crime. The  version given by <i>The Penny Whistle,</i> which was written by a highly imaginative reporter, was as follows, and headed  by attractive titles:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">TERRIBLE CRIME IN RUSSELL STREET<br>
    Lazarus has passed in his Checks.<br>
    AN UNKNOWN ASSASSIN<br>
    IS<br>
    IN OUR MIDST.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">It  is often said that truth is stranger than fiction, and we have now an excellent  illustration of this proverb. A crime has been committed before which the  marvellous romances of Gaboriau sink into insignificance, and the guilty wretch  who has stained his soul with murder is still at large. The bare facts of the  case are as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Early  this morning it was noticed by a policeman that the shop of Lazarus, a  well-known pawnbroker, was not opened, and knowing the methodical habits of the  old man, the policeman was much surprised. However, thinking that Lazarus might  have overslept himself, he passed on, and had gone but a few yards when a boy  called Isaiah Jacobs rushed into the street from an alley which led to the back  of the house. The lad was much terrified, and it was with considerable  difficulty that the policeman elicited from him the following story:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="newspaper">He  had come to his work as usual at eight o&rsquo;clock, and went round to the back door  in order to get into the house. This door was generally open, and Lazarus  waiting for him, but on this morning it was closed, and although the boy  knocked several times, no response was made. He then noticed that the window  which is on the left-hand side of the door going in, was wide open, and  becoming impatient, he climbed up to it, and looked in to see if the old man  was asleep. To his consternation he saw Lazarus lying on the floor in a pool of  blood, and, seized with a sudden terror, he dropped from the window and rushed  into the street.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">On  hearing this, the policeman sent him for Sergeant Mansard, who soon arrived on  the scene, with several other members of the force. They went round to the back  and found the door closed and the window open as the boy had described. Having  tried the door and found it locked, the police burst it open, and entered the  house to view a scene which baffles description.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">The  murdered man was lying nearly nude in the middle of the room in a pool of  blood. His throat was cut from ear to ear, and, judging from the bruises and  cuts on his hands and arms, there must have been a terrible struggle before the  murderer accomplished his act. The bed-clothes, all stained with blood, were  lying half on the bed and half on the floor, so that it is surmised that the deceased  must have been attacked while asleep, and woke suddenly to fight for his life.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">A  large iron safe which stood near the head of the bed was wide open, the keys  being in the lock, and all the drawers pulled out. A lot of papers which had  evidently been in the safe were lying on the floor, but in spite of a rigid  examination, no money could be found, so it is presumed that the murder was  effected for the sake of robbery. On one sheet of the bed were several stains  of blood, as if the assassin had wiped his hands thereon, but the weapon with  which the crime was committed cannot be found. A door looking into the shop was  closed and bolted, so the murderer must have made his entry through the window,  and, departing the same way, forgot to close it.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">The  body of the deceased has been removed to the Morgue, and an inquest will be  held to-day. The case has been placed in the hands of Detective Naball, who is  now on the spot taking such notes as he deems necessary for the elucidation of  this terrible mystery.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Hereunder  will be found a plan of the room in which the murder was committed, and also  the alley leading to the street. We wish our readers to take particular note of  this, as we wish to give our theory as to the way in which the murderer went  about his diabolical work.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700501h-images/page154.png" width="600" height="508"></p>
  <p class="newspaper">A. Door  leading into shop&mdash;found bolted.<br>
  B. Bed with clothes in disorder.<br>
  C. Safe found open, with all valuables abstracted.<br>
  D. Window found open by which assassin probably entered.<br>
  E. Door leading to alley&mdash;found locked.<br>
  F. Alley leading to street, by which entrance was gained to back of house.<br>
  G. Place where body of murdered man was discovered.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">In  the first place, there is no doubt that the motive of the crime was robbery, as  is proved by the open safe rifled of its contents. The murderer evidently knew  that Lazarus slept in the back room and had the keys of the safe&mdash;as we have  since ascertained&mdash;under his pillow. He must also have known the position of the  safe and bed, for had he groped about for them, he would have awakened the old  man, who would have instantly have given the alarm.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">The  window D is about five feet from the ground, and was fastened with an ordinary  catch, as it never seemed to have entered the old man&rsquo;s head that an attempt  would be made to rob him.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Our  theory is that the murderer is a man who knew the deceased, and had been  frequently in the back room, so as to assure himself of the position of things.  Last night he must have entered the alley&mdash;at what hour we are not prepared to  say, as the time of the murder can only be determined by medical evidence &mdash; and  opened the window by slipping the blade of his knife between the upper and  lower parts, and pushing back the latch.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">He  then climbed softly into the room, and going straight to the bed, found the  deceased asleep. Very likely he did not intend to kill him had he slept on, but  in trying to abstract the keys from under the pillow, Lazarus must have sprung  up and tried to give the alarm. Instantly the murderer&rsquo;s clutch was on his  throat; but the old man, struggling off the bed, fought with terrible strength  for his life. The struggle took them into the centre of the room, and there  Lazarus, becoming exhausted, must have fallen, and the murderer, with  diabolical coolness, must have cut his throat, so as to effectually silence  him.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Then,  taking the keys from under the pillow, he must have opened the safe, taken what  he wished, and made his escape through the window, and from thence into the  street. Probably no one was about, and he could slink away unperceived, for,  had he met any one, his clothes, spotted with the blood of his victim, would  have attracted attention.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">We  conclude he must have had a dark lantern in order to see the contents of the  safe, but, as none has been found, he must have taken it with him, together  with the knife with which the crime was committed.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">This  is all we can learn at the present time, but whether any sounds of a struggle  were heard, can only be discovered from the witnesses at the inquest to-morrow.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Of  one thing we are certain, the murderer cannot escape, as his blood-stained  clothes must necessarily have been noticed by even the most casual observer.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">We  will issue a special edition of <i>The Penny  Whistle</i> to-morrow, with a full account of the inquest and the witnesses  examined thereat. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    The Inquest</b></h2>
  <p>THERE  was naturally a great deal of excitement over the murder, as, apart from the  magnitude of the crime, Lazarus was a well-known character in Melbourne. He  knew more secrets than any priest, and many a person of apparently spotless  character felt a sensation of relief when they heard that the old Jew was dead.  Lazarus was not the sort of man to keep a diary, so to many people it was  fortunate that he had died unexpectedly, and carried a number of disagreeable  secrets with him to the grave.</p>
  <p>The  report of the inquest was followed with great interest, for though it was  generally thought that robbing was the motive for the crime, yet some hinted  that, considering the character of the old man, there might be more cogent  reasons for the committal of the murder. One of these sceptics was Naball, in  whose hands the case had been placed for elucidation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it was robbery,&rdquo; he said to a brother detective. &ldquo;Old Lazarus  knew a good many dangerous secrets, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised to find  that the murderer was some poor devil whom he had in his power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the open safe?&rdquo; said the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pish!  that can easily be accounted for; there may have been papers implicating the  murderer, or the robbery might have been a blind, or&mdash;oh, there&rsquo;s dozens of reasons&mdash;however,  we&rsquo;ll find it all out at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  opening the proceedings, the Coroner mentioned all the circumstances in  connection with the murder which had come to the knowledge of the police, and  said that as yet no clue had been found likely to lead to the detection of the  assassin, but without doubt the evidence of the witnesses about to be examined  would afford some starting point.</p>
  <p>The  first witness called was the policeman who had found the body, and he deposed  to the circumstances which led to the discovery. He was succeeded by Dr  Chisholm, who had examined the body of the deceased, and, having been sworn in  the usual manner, deposed as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a duly qualified medical practitioner. I have examined the body of the  deceased. It is that of an old man&mdash;I should say about seventy years of age &mdash;  very badly nourished; I found hardly any food in the stomach. There were many  bruises and excoriations on the body, which, I have no doubt, are due to the  struggle between the murderer and his victim. I examined the neck, back, and  limbs, but could find no fractures. The throat was cut evidently by some very  sharp instrument, as the windpipe was completely severed. I examined the body  about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning,&mdash;it was then warm, and, according to my  belief, the deceased must have been dead eight or nine hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Are you certain of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Dr Chisholm</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Not absolutely. It is a very difficult thing to  tell exactly, by the temperature of the body, what length of time has elapsed  since death. After a sudden and violent death, the body often parts with its  heat slowly, as I think it has done in this case. Besides, the night was very  hot, which would be an additional reason for the body cooling slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Was the body rigid when you examined it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Dr Chisholm</i>.&mdash;&rdquo;Yes; <i>rigor  mortis</i> had set in. It generally occurs within six hours of death, but it  might occur earlier if there had been violent muscular exertion, as there was  in this case. I think that the deceased was awakened from his sleep, and  struggled with his murderer till he became exhausted; then the murderer cut his  throat with a remarkably sharp knife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And, according to your theory, death took place  about midnight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Dr Chisholm</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think so; but, as I said, before, it is very  difficult to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next witness called was Isaiah Jacobs, who gave his evidence in an aggressively  shrill voice, but the Coroner was unable to elicit more from him than had  already been published in <i>The Penny  Whistle</i>.</p>
  <p>After  the echo of the young Israelite&rsquo;s shrill voice had died away, Keith Stewart was  sworn, and deposed as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was clerk to the deceased, and had occupied the position for some months. On  the day previous to the murder, I had received a hundred pounds, in twenty bank  notes of five pounds each, which I gave to the deceased, and saw him place them  in his safe. He always slept on the premises, and kept his keys under his  pillow. He told me that he always had a loaded revolver on the table beside his  bed. On the night, or rather morning, of the murder I was passing along Russell  Street on my way home. I saw a man standing near the shop. I knew him as  Randolph Villiers. I asked him what he was doing, but could get no very decided  answer&mdash;he was quite intoxicated, and went off down the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;About what time was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;You are certain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Quite&mdash;I heard it striking from the Town Hall tower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Was Villiers&rsquo; intoxication real or feigned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Real, as far as I could see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner.&mdash;&ldquo;It  was a moonlight night, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; the moon was very bright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Did you notice anything peculiar about Villiers?  Was he confused? Were his clothes in disorder? Any marks of blood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;No; I saw nothing extraordinary about him. He is  generally more or less drunk, so I did not notice him particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I believe, Mr Stewart, you belong to the Skylarks&rsquo;  Club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And yet you are a clerk in a pawnbroker&rsquo;s office &mdash;  aren&rsquo;t the two things rather incongruous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Stewart</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;No doubt; but I am in a position to be a member of  the Skylarks&rsquo; Club, and as to being a clerk to Lazarus, it&rsquo;s merely a matter of  honour. When he engaged me he stipulated that I should stay for six months, and  though I unexpectedly came in for some money, I felt myself bound in honour to  keep my agreement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Thank you, that will do, Mr Stewart. Call Mrs  Tibsey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  lady, large, red-faced, and energetic, was sworn and gave her evidence in a  voluble manner. She had evidently been drinking, as there was a strong odour of  gin in the air, and kept curtseying to the Coroner every time she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name&rsquo;s Tibsey, my lord&mdash;Maria Tibsey. I&rsquo;ve bin married twice, my first being  called Bliggings, and died of gunpowder&mdash;blowed up in a quarry explosion. My  second, also dead, sir, &lsquo;ad no lungs, and a corf which tored him to bits. Only  one child, sir, &lsquo;Tilda Bliggings, out in service, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, yes, Mrs Tibsey, we don&rsquo;t want to learn all  these domestic affairs. Come to the point.</p>
  <p><i>Mrs Tibsey</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;About Sating, sir?&mdash;I called &lsquo;im Sating, sir, &lsquo;cause  he were a robber of the widder and orfin&mdash;me, sir, and my darter. I was  a-talking to my darter on that night, your worships, she &lsquo;aving visited me. I  lives near old Sating, as it was &lsquo;andy to drop in to pop anything, and about  twelve I &lsquo;eard a scream&mdash;a &lsquo;orrid &lsquo;owl, as made my back h&rsquo;open and shut, so I  ses, &lsquo; &lsquo;Tilda,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;old Sating is &lsquo;avin&rsquo; a time of it, e&rsquo;s boozin&rsquo;,&rsquo; and  that&rsquo;s all, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;You never went to see what it was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Mrs Tibsey</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Me, my lord? no, your worship, it weren&rsquo;t my  bisiniss. I didn&rsquo;t think it were murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;You are quite sure it was twelve o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Mrs Tibsey</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I swears h&rsquo;it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Matilda Bliggings was then called, and deposed she also heard the scream, and  that her mother had said it must be old Lazarus. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>Ezra  Lazarus was then called, but could give no material evidence. He said he had  quarrelled with his father on the day preceding the murder, and had not seen  him since.</p>
  <p>The  next witness called caused a sensation, as it was none other than Mr Randolph  Villiers, who stated:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is Villiers. I do nothing. I know old Lazarus. I was passing through  Russell Street, and leaned up against the shop door&mdash;I was drunk &mdash;on my way to  Little Bourke Street. I remember meeting Mr Stewart&mdash;think it was two, but ain&rsquo;t  sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Where were you before you met Mr Stewart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Villiers</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;About the town somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Coroner</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>Villiers</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Sometimes I was, sometimes I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  ended all the evidence procurable, and the Coroner summed up.</p>
  <p>The  crime had evidently been committed for the purpose of robbery, as the hundred  pounds which Mr Stewart swore had been placed in the safe by the deceased were  gone; the knife with which the deed had been committed had not yet been found;  in fact, all the evidence was of the barest character. According to Dr Chisholm&rsquo;s  evidence, the deceased had been murdered about midnight, and as Mrs Tibsey and  her daughter heard a scream also at that time, all the evidence seemed to point  to that hour as having been the time of death. Mr Stewart met Villiers at two o&rsquo;clock,  and Villiers stated that he had only been in Russell Street a few minutes  before he met Mr Stewart. The jury would be kind enough to bring in a verdict  in accordance with the facts before them.</p>
  <p>The  jury had a long argument; some wanted to bring in a charge of murder against  Villiers, as he certainly had not accounted for his presence in Russell Street;  but the evidence altogether was so vague that they at length came to the  conclusion it would be best to leave the matter to the police, and brought in a  verdict that the deceased had met his death at the hands of some person or  persons unknown.</p>
  <p>Great  dissatisfaction was expressed by the public at this verdict, as, in the opinion  of most people, Villiers was the guilty man. A regular battle was fought in the  newspapers over the whole affair; but one man said nothing.</p>
  <p>That  man was Naball!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    A Council Of Three</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  the inquest was over, Naball went straight home, and carefully read all the  notes he had taken of the evidence given. After doing so, he came to the  conclusion that the person on whom most suspicion rested was Keith Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the first place,&rdquo; said Naball, thoughtfully eyeing his papers, &ldquo;Stewart was the  clerk of old Lazarus, and knew what was in the safe, and where the keys were  kept; he is a member of an expensive club, which be can&rsquo;t possibly afford to  pay for out of his salary as a clerk; as to his coming in for money, that&rsquo;s  bosh!&mdash;if he had, agreement or no agreement, he wouldn&rsquo;t have remained with old  Lazarus. He states that he left the theatre at half-past, twelve, and the  doctor says the death took place at midnight; but then he wasn&rsquo;t sure, and it  might have taken place at half-past one, which would give Stewart time to  commit the crime. He could not account for his time between leaving the theatre  and seeing Villiers except by saying be had been walking, which is a very weak  explanation. Humph! I think I&rsquo;ll see Mr Stewart and ask him a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Naball glanced at himself in the mirror, arranged the set of his tie, dusted  his varnished boots, and then sallied forth in search of Keith. Passing along  Swanston Street, he went into a florist&rsquo;s, and purchased himself a smart  buttonhole of white flowers, then held a short council of war with himself as  to where to find Stewart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder  where he lives?&rdquo; muttered the detective, in perplexity; &ldquo;let me see, what&rsquo;s the  time,&rdquo; glancing at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;nearly five; he&rsquo;s a great friend of Mr Lazarus,  and I know Lazarus is sub-editor of <i>The  Penny Whistle</i>; I&rsquo;ll go along and ask him&mdash;he&rsquo;s sure to be in just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  walked rapidly along to the newspaper office, and, being admitted to Ezra&rsquo;s  room, found that young man just putting on his coat preparatory to going away,  his labours for the day now being concluded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr Naball,&rdquo; asked Ezra, in his soft voice, &ldquo;what can I do for you&mdash;anything  about this unfortunate affair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Naball bluntly; &ldquo;I want to see Mr Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you do!&rdquo; broke in a new voice, and Stewart stepped out of an adjoining room,  where he had been waiting for his friend; &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  much,&rdquo; observed Naball, in a frank voice; &ldquo;but as this case has been put into  my hands, I want to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I in the way?&rdquo; asked Lazarus, taking up his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means,&rdquo; replied Naball politely; &ldquo;in fact, you may be of assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  fire away,&rdquo; said Keith, coolly lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to answer  anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  glanced keenly at both the young men before he began to talk, and noted their  appearance. Keith had a rather haggard look, as though he had been leading a  dissipated life; while Ezra&rsquo;s face looked careworn and pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  up over his father&rsquo;s death, I guess,&rdquo; said Naball to himself; &ldquo;poor chap!&mdash;but  as for the other, it looks like late hours and drink. I must find out all about  your private life, Mr Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  waiting,&rdquo; said Keith impatiently; &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep me very long; I&rsquo;ve  got to meet a train from the country to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  closed both doors of the room, and, resuming his seat, looked steadily at  Keith, who, seated astride a chair, leaned his elbows on the back, and smoked  nonchalantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you aware,&rdquo; asked Naball deliberately, &ldquo;if the late Mr Lazarus had any enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can answer that question best,&rdquo; said Ezra quickly, before Keith could speak. &ldquo;Yes,  he had plenty; my father, as you know, was a moneylender as well as a  pawnbroker, and, as he took advantage of his possession of money to extort high  interest, I know it made a lot of people feel bitter against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Considering  that you are his son, sir,&rdquo; said Naball, in a tone of rebuke, &ldquo;you do not speak  very well of the dead.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not much cause to,&rdquo; rejoined Ezra bitterly; &ldquo;he was father to me in name  only. But you need not make any comments&mdash;my duty to my father&rsquo;s memory is  between myself and my conscience. I have answered your question &mdash;he had many  enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I believe also,&rdquo; said Keith slowly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think any one was so hostile  as to desire his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; observed Naball sharply, &ldquo;I myself believe that the murder  was committed for the sake of robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  easily seen,&rdquo; said Ezra calmly, &ldquo;from the fact of the safe being open and the  money gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  might have been a blind,&rdquo; retorted Naball quickly, &ldquo;but you talk of money being  stolen; I think, Mr Stewart, in your evidence to-day you said they were bank  notes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  twenty ten-pound notes,&rdquo; replied Keith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know the numbers of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I never thought of taking the numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you handed them to Mr Lazarus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did; at half-past five&mdash;he put them in his safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  there any other valuables in the safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; retorted Keith coldly; &ldquo;I was not in the confidence of my employer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know?&rdquo; said Naball, turning to Ezra.</p>
  <p>The  young Jew smiled bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  also was not in my father&rsquo;s confidence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so know nothing.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was some gold and silver money also in the safe,&rdquo; said Keith to Naball,  knocking the ashes off his cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  that&rsquo;s not much guide,&rdquo; replied the detective; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the notes I want&mdash;if I  could only find the numbers of those notes&mdash;where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  man at Ballarat, called Forbes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I&rsquo;ll write to Mr Forbes of Ballarat,&rdquo; said Naball, making a note, &ldquo;but if those  notes are put in circulation, do you know of any means by which I can identify  them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  shook his head, then suddenly gave a cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I can tell you how to identify one of the notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  will be quite sufficient,&rdquo; said the detective eagerly. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  boy, Isaiah,&rdquo; said Stewart, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s great on backing horses, and frequently tells  me about racing. When I was making up my cash on that night, the notes were  lying on the desk, and as the door of Mr Lazarus&rsquo; room was open, Isaiah was  afraid to speak aloud about his tip, so he wrote it down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how can that identify the bank-note?&rdquo; asked the perplexed detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the young scamp wrote his tip, &lsquo;Back Flat-Iron,&rsquo; on the back of a ten-pound  note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  pencil?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  in ink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  one of the notes that were stolen has the inscription &lsquo;Back Flat-Iron&rsquo; on the  back of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  scribbled a line or two in his pocket-book, and shut it with a snap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  that note goes into circulation,&rdquo; he said, in a satisfied tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon  trace it to its original holder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; asked Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then,&rdquo; reiterated Naball quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay my hands on the man who killed  your father. And now, Mr Stewart, I want to ask you a few questions about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on!&rdquo; said Keith imperturbably; &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I killed Lazarus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; replied Naball quietly; &ldquo;I only want to find out as much as I  can. You were at the Bon-Bon Theatre on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  talking to Mr Mortimer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  one else with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Ezra, &ldquo;I was, and Caprice; we left about half-past, eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, Mr Stewart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  left at half-past twelve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you go then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was excited over some business I had done, and strolled about the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere  in particular?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I went along Collins Street, up William Street, round about the Law Courts, and  then came down Bourke Street, on my way home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long were you thus wandering about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think about an hour and a half, because as I turned into Russell Street the  clock struck two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you turn into Russell Street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo;  echoed Keith, in surprise, &ldquo;because I wanted to go home. I went through Russell  Street, down Flinders Street, and then walked to East Melbourne, past the  Fitzroy Gardens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and you saw Villiers standing; about the shop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  he was leaning against the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ordered him off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  rolled down the street towards Bourke Street, singing some song.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  noticed nothing peculiar about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the door of the alley leading to the back open or shut?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I never noticed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  Villiers disappeared, you went home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did&mdash;straight home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  pondered for a few moments. Stewart certainly told all he knew with perfect  frankness, but then was he telling the truth?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to ask me any more questions?&rdquo; asked Keith, rising.</p>
  <p>Naball  made up his mind, and spoke out roughly,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to know how you, with a small salary, can afford to belong to an expensive  club like the &ldquo;Skylarks?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith&rsquo;s  face grew as black as thunder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  the devil gave you permission to pry into my private affairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one except myself,&rdquo; retorted Naball boldly, for, though inferior to Stewart in  size, he by no means wanted pluck; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m engaged in a serious case, and it  will be best for you to speak out frankly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  surely don&rsquo;t suspect Stewart of the murder?&rdquo; interposed Ezra warmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suspect nobody,&rdquo; retorted Naball. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only asking him a question, and, if he&rsquo;s  wise, he&rsquo;ll answer it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  thought for a moment. He saw that, for some extraordinary reason or another,  Naball suspected him, so, in order to be on the safe side, resolved to take the  detective&rsquo;s advice and answer the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is, as you say, a serious matter,&rdquo; he observed quietly, &ldquo;and I am the last  person in the world not to give any assistance to the finding out of the  criminal; ask what you please, and I will answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  reply somewhat staggered Naball, but, as he had strong suspicions about Stewart&rsquo;s  innocence, he put down the apparent frankness of the answer to crafty  diplomacy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only want to know,&rdquo; he said mildly, &ldquo;how a gentleman in your position can  afford to belong to an expensive club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I can afford to do so,&rdquo; replied Keith calmly. &ldquo;When I first came to Melbourne,  I had no money, and was engaged by Mr Lazarus as his clerk, with the  understanding I should stay with him six months. To this I agreed, but shortly  afterwards a sum of five hundred pounds was placed to my credit, and afforded  me a chance of living in good style. I wished to leave the pawnshop, but Mr  Lazarus reminded me of my position, and I had to stay. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  placed this five hundred to your credit?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; echoed Naball, in surprise. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that a large sum  like that was placed to your credit by a person whom you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I can substantiate that statement,&rdquo; said Ezra quietly.</p>
  <p>Naball  looked from one to the other in perplexity, puzzled what to ask next. Then he  felt the only thing to be done was to go away and think the matter over. But he  did not intend to lose sight of Keith, and this absurd statement about the five  hundred only seemed to strengthen his suspicions, so he determined to have him  shadowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Mr Stewart,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I have nothing more to ask. What time did  you say you were going to meet a country train?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mentioned no time,&rdquo; replied Keith sharply.</p>
  <p>Baffled  by this answer, Naball tried another way</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you kindly give me your address?&rdquo; he asked, pulling out his pocket-book. &ldquo;I may  want to communicate with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vance&rsquo;s  boarding-house, Powlett Street, East Melbourne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Naball noted this in his book, and then, with a slight nod, took his leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn  him,&rdquo; cried Keith fiercely, &ldquo;he suspects me of this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; replied Ezra, as they went out, &ldquo;you can easily prove an  alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Keith, in a hard tone. &ldquo;From half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock till  two I was by myself, and no one saw me. I say I was wandering about the  streets, he thinks I was in Russell Street committing a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you need be a bit afraid of anyone suspecting you,&rdquo; said Ezra  bitterly. &ldquo;Why, they might as well think I killed my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I had a quarrel with him, and then he was murdered. Oh, I assure you they could  get up an excellent case against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you could prove an alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  just where it is,&rdquo; said Ezra coolly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  after leaving Kitty Marchurst, I went down the street to <i>The Penny Whistle</i> office, and found it closed. I then walked home  along Collins Street, through the Fitzroy Gardens. It was a beautiful night,  and, as I was thinking over my quarrel with my father, I sat down on one of the  seats for a time, so I did not get home till two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. No one  saw me, and I&rsquo;ve got quite as much difficulty in proving an alibi as you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think Naball suspects you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nor do I think he suspects you, but I&rsquo;ve got a suspicion that he suspects some  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that some one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  called Randolph Villiers.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    Circumstantial Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  Naball left the two young men, he went straight to the Detective Office in  order to get some one to look after Keith Stewart, and see that he did not leave  Melbourne. Naball did not believe that he was going to meet any one that night,  and wanted to find out why he was going to the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he wanted to give me the slip,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t have told me he was  going to the railway station&mdash;humph! can&rsquo;t make out what he&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gentleman who was to act as Mr Stewart&rsquo;s shadow was a short, red-nosed man with  a humbled appearance and a chronic sniffle. He was sparing of words, and  communicated with his fellow-man by a series of nods and winks which did duty  with him for conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tulch!&rdquo;  said Naball, when this extraordinary being appeared, &ldquo;I want you to go to  Vance&rsquo;s boarding-house, Powlett Street, East Melbourne, and keep your eye on a  man called Keith Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  interrogatory sniff from Tulch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  I forgot you don&rsquo;t know his personal appearance,&rdquo; said Naball thoughtfully; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  tall, with fair hair, wears a suit of home-spun&mdash;humph;&mdash;that won&rsquo;t do, there are  dozens of young men of that description. Here!&mdash;tell you what, I&rsquo;ll give you a note  to deliver to him personally; muffle yourself up in an ulster when you deliver  it, so that he won&rsquo;t know you&mdash;understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr  Tulck sniffed in the affirmative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Follow  him wherever he goes, and tell me what he&rsquo;s up to,&rdquo; said Naball, scribbling a  note to Stewart and handing it to Tulch. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all&mdash; clear out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  farewell sniffle, and Tulch was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo;  muttered Naball to himself, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;d like to know the meaning of all this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t  believe this cock-and-bull story about Stewart having money left him in this  mysterious manner &mdash;people don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing now-a-days&mdash; I believe he&rsquo;s  been robbing the old man for some time and was found out&mdash;so silenced him by  using his knife. Knife,&rdquo; repeated Naball, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not been found yet&mdash;I must see  about this&mdash;now there&rsquo;s Villiers&mdash;I wonder if he could help me? It was curious  that he should have been about the shop at that special time&mdash;he&rsquo;s a bad lot&mdash;  gad, I&rsquo;ll go and see what I can find out from him.&rdquo; Knowing Mr Villiers&rsquo;  habits, he had no difficulty in discovering his whereabouts. Ah Goon&rsquo;s was  where Villiers generally dwelt, so, after Naball had partaken of a nice little  dinner, he went off to Little Bourke Street.</p>
  <p>It  was now between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock, which was the time Villiers generally  dined, so, Naball not finding him at Ah Goon&rsquo;s, betook himself to a cook-shop  in the neighbourhood, to which he was directed by a solid-looking Chinaman.</p>
  <p>It  was a low-roofed place, consisting of a series of apartments all opening one  into the other by squat little door-ways. The atmosphere was dull and smoky,  and the acrid smell of burning wood saluted Naball&rsquo;s nostrils when he entered.  Near the door-way a Chinaman was rolling out rice bread to the thinness of  paper; then, cutting it into little squares, he wrapped each round a kind of  sausage meat, and placed the rolls thus prepared on a tray for cooking.</p>
  <p>In  the next apartment was a large boiler, with the lid off, filled with water, in  which ten or twelve turkeys, skewered and trussed, were bobbing up and down  amid the froth and scum of the boiling water. A crowd of Chinese, all  chattering in their high shrill voices, were moving about half seen in the  smoky atmosphere, through which candle and lamp light flamed feebly.</p>
  <p>Villiers,  in a kind of little cell apartment, was having his supper when the detective  entered. Before him was a large bowl filled with soup, and in this were squares  of thin rice bread, and portions of turkey and duck mixed up into a savoury  mess, and flavoured with the dark brown fluid which the Chinese use instead of  salt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; growled Villiers, looking up with a scowl, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  my friend,&rdquo; said Naball cheerfully, taking a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you?&rdquo; said Villiers, rubbing his bleared eyes, inflamed by the pungent smoke  of the wood-fire. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you think I killed old Lazarus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the detective, looking straight at him, &ldquo;but I think you  know more than you tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He!  he!&rdquo; grinned the other sardonically &ldquo;Perhaps I do&mdash;perhaps I don&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s my  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  mine also,&rdquo; said Naball, somewhat nettled. &ldquo;You forget the case is in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  care whose hands it&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; retorted Villiers, finishing his soup, &ldquo;t&rsquo;aint any  trouble of mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective bit his lip at the impenetrable way in which Villiers met his advances.  Suddenly a thought flashed across his mind, and he bent forward with a meaning  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  any more diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  pushed back his chair from the table, and stared at Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  diamonds?&rdquo; he asked, in a husky voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now,&rdquo; said Naball, with a wink, &ldquo;we know all about that&mdash;eh? Ah Goon is a good  pawnbroker, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  Goon!&rdquo; gasped Villiers, turning a little pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  though he did only lend twenty pounds on those diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mr Jack-o&rsquo;-Dandy,&rdquo; said Villiers, bringing his fist down on the table, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want no beating about the bush, I don&rsquo;t. What do you mean, curse you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that I know all about your little games,&rdquo; replied Naball, leaning over the  table. &ldquo;I know Caprice stole her own jewels for some purpose, and gave you some  of the swag to shut your mouth, and I know that you&rsquo;re going to tell me all you  know about this Russell Street business, or, by Jove, I&rsquo;ll have you arrested on  suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  gave a howl like a wild beast, and, flinging himself across the table, tried to  grapple with the detective, but recoiled with a shriek of wrath and alarm as he  saw the shining barrel of a revolver levelled at his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  do, Villiers,&rdquo; said Naball smoothly; &ldquo;try some other game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon  Villiers, seeing that the detective was too strong for him, sat down sulkily in  his chair, and after invoking a blessing on Naball&rsquo;s eyes, invited him to speak  out. The detective replaced the revolver in his pocket, whence it could be  easily seized if necessary, and smiled complacently at his sullen-faced friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  he said, producing a dainty cigarette, &ldquo;this is much better. Have you a light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  flung down a lucifer match with a husky curse, which Naball, quite  disregarding, took up the match and lighted his cigarette. Watching the blue  smoke curling from his lips for a few moments, he turned languidly to Villiers,  and began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, I know all about it,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;you were too drunk to remember  that night when you tried to take a diamond crescent off that woman, and I  expect Ah Goon never told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was you who took it, then,&rdquo; growled Villiers fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  your own words, perhaps it was, perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Naball, in an  irritating tone; &ldquo;at all events, it&rsquo;s quite safe. You had better answer all my  questions, because you bear too bad a character not to be suspected of the  crime, particularly as you were about Russell Street on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was,&rdquo; said Villiers angrily; &ldquo;and who saw me&mdash;Keith Stewart&mdash;a mighty fine  witness he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;  thought the astute Naball, &ldquo;he does know something, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could put a spoke in Stewart&rsquo;s wheel,&rdquo; grumbled the other viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the detective, fingering his cigarette, &ldquo;he is far  above you&mdash;he&rsquo;s got money, is going to make a name by a successful play,  and, if report speaks truly, Caprice loves him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care a farthing whether she does or not,&rdquo; said Villiers loudly; &ldquo;she&rsquo;d  love any one who has money. Stewart&rsquo;s got some, has he; where did he get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  you mind,&rdquo; said Villiers suspiciously. &ldquo;I know my own knowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember  what I said,&rdquo; observed Naball quietly, &ldquo;and tell me all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I tell you all, what will you do?&rdquo; asked Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  save your neck from the gallows,&rdquo; replied Naball smoothly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  good enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; said the detective rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no more to say. I&rsquo;m off to the  magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  fixed his keen eyes on the bloated face of the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  get a warrant for your arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  wait a bit,&rdquo; said Villiers in alarm; &ldquo;I can easily prove myself innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed;  then you&rsquo;d better do so now, before a warrant is out for your arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t give me any money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a cent&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a question of money with you, but life or death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  deliberated for a moment, and then apparently made up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; he said sullenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  resumed his seat, lighted a fresh cigarette, and prepared to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was rather drunk on the night of the murder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not so bad as  Stewart thought me. He saw me at the shop-door at two o&rsquo;clock, but I was there  a quarter of an hour before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw the gate which led into the alley open,&rdquo; replied Villiers. &ldquo;No one was  about, so I walked in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  for?&rdquo; asked Naball, glancing at him keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing,&rdquo; replied Villiers indifferently; &ldquo;the fact was, I saw a policeman  coming along, and though I was pretty drunk, I&rsquo;d sense enough to know I might  be run in, so I went into the alley and closed the gate till he passed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then you came out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t. I walked to the back of the house just to see where it led to. I saw  the window wide open, and looked in and saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  murdered man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the moonlight was streaming in at the window, and I could see quite plainly. I  was in a fright, as I thought, seeing I had no business on the premises, I  might be accused, so I got down from the window and went off, closing the gate of  the alley after me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t wise of you to stay about the premises,&rdquo; said Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; rejoined Villiers tartly; &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t get away, because I saw  Stewart coming up the street just as I was wondering where to go; I then  pretended to be drunk, so that I could get away without suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you run?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he was too close, and besides, he might have given chase, thinking I had been  robbing the shop; then, with the open window and the murdered man, it would have  been all up with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if it isn&rsquo;t all up with you now,&rdquo; said Naball drily. &ldquo;How do I know  you are innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I know who killed Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you do&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stewart  himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  that&rsquo;s what I thought; but what proof have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  put his hand in his pocket and brought out a large knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found this just under the window,&rdquo; he said, handing it to Naball. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see  there&rsquo;s blood on the handle, so I&rsquo;m sure it was with it the crime was  committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you know it&rsquo;s Stewart&rsquo;s knife?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>Villiers  placed his finger on one side of the handle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  that,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Meg,&rdquo; read Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  said Villiers. &ldquo;Meg is Kitty Marchurst&rsquo;s child, and she gave it to Keith  Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove, it looks suspicious,&rdquo; said Naball. &ldquo;He is in possession of a large sum of  money, and can&rsquo;t tell how he got it. He can&rsquo;t account for his time on the night  of the murder, and this knife with his name on it is found close to the window  through which the murderer entered&mdash; humph!&mdash;things look black against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you&rsquo;ll arrest him at once?&rdquo; said Villiers malignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you suppose wrong,&rdquo; retorted Naball. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him looked after so that he won&rsquo;t  escape; but I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue about this, and so will you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  I find out more about Stewart. I must discover if the knife was in his  possession on the night of the murder, and also if this story about his money  is true; again, I want to wait till some of these stolen bank notes are in circulation,  so as to get more evidence against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what am I to do?&rdquo; asked Villiers sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are to hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Naball, rising to his feet, &ldquo;or else I may make  things unpleasant for you&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good thing for your own sake you have told me  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told  you all,&rdquo; muttered Villiers, as Naball took his departure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure  about that.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    A Lovers&rsquo; Meeting</b></h2>
  <p>IT  is a great blessing that the future is hidden from our anxious eyes, otherwise,  to use a familiar expression, we would go out in a coach and four to meet our  troubles. If Keith Stewart had only known that the detective suspected him of  the murder of Lazarus, and was surely but slowly finding out strong evidence in  favour of such a presumption, he, no doubt, would have been much troubled. But  he thought that Naball&rsquo;s hints at the interview were not worth thinking about,  for, strong in the belief of his own innocence, such an idea of his being  accused of the crime never entered his mind.</p>
  <p>In  spite of the disagreeable event which had occurred, Keith felt very happy on  this night. He was young, he had a good sum of money in the bank, the gift of  some beneficent fairy, he was going to make his <i>d&eacute;but</i> as a dramatic author, and, above all, be was going to see Eug&eacute;nie  again. Therefore, as he sat at dinner, his heart was merry, and to him the  future looked bright and cheerful. Things seemed so pleasant that, with the  sanguine expectations of youth, he began to build castles in the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this burlesque&rsquo;s a success,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write a novel, and save every  penny I make; then I&rsquo;ll go to London, after marrying Eug&eacute;nie, and see if I can&rsquo;t  make a name there&mdash;with perseverance I&rsquo;m bound to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor  youth, he did not know the difficulty of making a name in London; he was quite  unaware that the literary market was overstocked, and that many criticisms  depend on the state of the critic&rsquo;s liver. He did not know any of these things,  so he went on eating his dinner and building castles in the air, all of which  buildings were inhabited by Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>From  these pleasant dreams he was aroused by the entrance of the housemaid, a fat  young person, who breathed hard, and rolled up to Keith, puffing and panting  like a locomotive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you please,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  man?&rdquo; asked Keith sharply</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  waiting to see you,&rdquo; returned the housemaid stolidly.</p>
  <p>From  experience Keith knew it was useless to expect sense from the housemaid, so he  got up from the table and went out to the front-door, where a bundle, with a  head at one end and a pair of boots at the other, held out a letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  me?&rdquo; asked Keith, taking it.</p>
  <p>The  bundle sniffed in an affirmative manner, so Stewart opened the letter and read  it quickly. It only contained a line from Naball that if he heard of any new  development of the case he would let Keith know, so that young gentleman,  wondering why the detective took the trouble to write to him slipped the letter  in his pocket, and nodded to the bundle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;no answer,&rdquo; and he shut the door in the bundle&rsquo;s  face, whereupon the bundle sniffed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know him now,&rdquo; said Mr Tulch to himself in a husky voice, as he walked away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d  know &lsquo;im if he was dooplicated twice h&rsquo;over.&rdquo; Having come to this satisfactory  conclusion, Mr Tulch took up his position a short distance away, and began his  dreary task of watching the house.</p>
  <p>And  it was dreary work. The long hot day was over, and the long hot night had  begun. It was just a quarter past seven, and the sky was a cloudless expanse of  darkish blue, blazing with stars; a soft wind was whispering among the leaves  of the trees, and making little whirls of white dust in the road. Every now and  then a gay party of men and women on their way to some amusement would pass the  spy, but he remained passively at his post, watching the sun-blistered  varnished door of Vance&rsquo;s boarding-house. At last his patience was rewarded,  for, somewhere about half-past seven, Keith came hurriedly out, and sped  rapidly down the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  he arter?&rdquo; sniffed Mr Tulch, stretching his cramped limbs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to ketch &lsquo;im  h&rsquo;up,&rdquo; and he rolled as quickly as he was able after the tall figure of the  young man.</p>
  <p>A  tram came along, and, without stopping it, Keith jumped on the dummy&mdash;the spy,  breathless with running, sprang on the step of the end car and got inside,  keeping his eye on Keith. The tramcar went rapidly along Flinders Street,  stopping every now and then to pick up or drop passengers, at which Keith  seemed impatient. At last Spencer Street station was reached, and Keith sprang  out; so did Tulch, keeping close to his heels.</p>
  <p>Stewart  walked impatiently up and down one of the long platforms, which shortly began  to fill with people expecting their friends. The shrill whistle of an  approaching engine was heard, a red light suddenly appeared, advancing rapidly,  and presently the long train, with its lighted carriages, drew up inside the  station.</p>
  <p>Such  a hurry-scurry; people jumping out of the train to meet those pressing forward  on the platform, porters calling to one another, boxes, rugs, portmanteaus,  bundles, all strewing the ground&mdash;a babel of voices, and at intervals the shrill  whistle of a departing train.</p>
  <p>Amid  all this confusion Tulch missed Keith, and was in a terrible state, for he knew  what Naball would say. He dived hither and thither among the crowd with  surprising activity, and at last came in sight of Stewart putting a young lady  into a cab, in front of which was the luggage. He tried to hear the address  given the cabman, but was unsuccessful, so he rapidly jumped into another cab  and told him to follow. The cabby obeyed at once, and whipping up his horse,  which was a remarkably good one, he easily kept the first cab in sight.</p>
  <p>The  front cab drove up Collins Street as far as the Treasury Buildings, and then  turned off to the left, going towards Fitzroy It stopped at the Buttercup  Hotel, in Gertrude Street, and, Stewart alighting, helped the young lady out;  then the luggage was taken care of by the porter of the hotel, and Keith, with  his charge, vanished through the swing doors of the private entrance.</p>
  <p>On  seeing this, Tulch dismissed his cab, went into the bar of an hotel on the  opposite side of the street, and, ordering a pint of beer, sat watching the  door of the Buttercup Hotel.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  Keith and Eug&eacute;nie had been shown into a private room, and the landlady, a  stout, buxom woman, in a silk dress and lace cap, made her appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Bainsford?&rdquo; she said interrogatively, advancing towards the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Eug&eacute;nie brightly. &ldquo;You are Mrs Scarth, I suppose. Did you get Mrs  Proggins&rsquo; letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied the landlady, nodding. &ldquo;Your room is ready, and  I will do anything I can for you. Mrs Proggins is an old friend of mine, and I&rsquo;m  only too happy to oblige her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, taking off her hat. &ldquo;Let me introduce Mr Stewart to you; he  kindly came to the station to meet me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Scarth nodded with a smile, for Mrs Proggins had informed her of the  relationship between the two young people, then observing she would go and  order some tea for Eug&eacute;nie, sailed majestically out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you introduce me to that old thing?&rdquo; asked Keith, in a discontented tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Policy,  my dear,&rdquo; replied Eug&eacute;nie mildly. &ldquo;Mrs Proggins wrote to her to look after me,  and I&rsquo;m very glad, otherwise a young lady with you as escort would hardly have  found shelter for the night in this place. I always like to be in favour with  the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  Rainsford was a tall, dark-complexioned girl, with clearly cut features and  coils of black hair twisted round the top of her well-shaped head. She was  dessed in a blue serge costume, with a red ribbon round her throat, and another  round her waist. A handsome girl with a pleasant smile, and there was a look in  her flashing dark eyes which showed that she had a will of her own. Keith stood  beside her, as fair as she was dark, and a handsomer couple could not have been  found in Melbourne.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  here I am at last, Keith,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, slipping her arm through his. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  you pleased to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  replied Stewart emphatically; &ldquo;let me look at you&mdash;ah, you are more beautiful  than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  delightful stories you do tell,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie with a blush. &ldquo;I wish I could  believe them; now, my friend, let me return the compliment by looking at you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  took his face between her hands and looked at it keenly beneath the searching  glare of the gas, then shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are much paler than you used to be,&rdquo; she said critically. &ldquo;There are dark  circles under your eyes, deep lines down the side of your mouth, and your face  looks haggard. Is it work, or&mdash;or the other thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean dissipation, Eug&eacute;nie?&rdquo; said Keith, with a smile, taking a seat. &ldquo;Well,  I expect I have been rather dissipated, but now you are here I&rsquo;ll be a good  boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you been worried?&rdquo; asked Miss Rainsford</p>
  <p>Keith  sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  very much worried over this terrible case. I suppose you&rsquo;ve seen all about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I&rsquo;ve read all about it in the papers. Now I suppose you&rsquo;ve nothing to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not  that I care much&mdash;you see I&rsquo;ve got this burlesque coming off, and then there&rsquo;s  that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  five hundred pounds,&rdquo; said Miss Rainsford reflectively. &ldquo;Have you found out who  sent you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I can&rsquo;t imagine who did so, unless it was Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caprice!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Keith hurriedly, flushing a little; &ldquo;the actress I told you about, who  is going to play the principal part in &lsquo;Faust Upset.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was all the comment Miss Rainsford made, but there was a world of meaning in  the ejaculation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what I&rsquo;ve heard of the lady, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  at all events, I suppose I&rsquo;d better use the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not very encouraging, Eug&eacute;nie,&rdquo; said her lover angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  observed the girl deliberately, &ldquo;if you think this money came from Caprice, I  certainly would not touch it. Why don&rsquo;t you ask her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s been so disagreeable to me lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  Rainsford was of a very jealous temperament, and she began to feel vaguely  jealous of this actress whom Keith seemed to know so well. She remained silent  for a few moments, during which Keith felt somewhat awkward. He was not in love  with Kitty, nor, as far as he knew, was she in love with him, yet he saw that  some instinct had warned Eug&eacute;nie against this woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  Eug&eacute;nie,&rdquo; said Keith, putting his arm round her slender waist; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t be  angry with me the first night we meet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not angry,&rdquo; said the girl, turning her face towards him; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to see  this Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you shall, dear&mdash;on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not in private?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Keith  frowned, and pulled his moustache in a perplexed manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she&rsquo;s hardly a fit person for a girl to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;  replied Eug&eacute;nie impatiently; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a girl, but a woman, and am not afraid of  anything like that, and besides&mdash;besides,&rdquo; with hesitation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Keith, abruptly withdrawing his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing;  only I saw an advertisement in the paper wanting a governess for a little girl.  I answered it, and found it was Miss Marchurst who wanted a governess. She engaged  me, and I&rsquo;m going there to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; cried Keith vehemently; &ldquo;you must not&mdash;you shall not go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  raised her eyes to his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any reason for wishing me not to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  every reason&mdash;she&rsquo;s a bad lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you knew her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I do, but men may know women of that class, and women like you may not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, rising; &ldquo;what is sauce for the goose is  sauce for the gander, and if you persist in wishing me not to go, I&rsquo;ll begin to  think you&rsquo;ve some reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have none except what I&rsquo;ve stated,&rdquo; said Keith doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll go to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Eug&eacute;nie quietly; &ldquo;at all events, I&rsquo;ve got the right  to have a personal interview, whether I take the situation or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  decides it,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie composedly; &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eug&eacute;nie,  don&rsquo;t go, or I&rsquo;ll begin to think you don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do, but&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve been so much with this Caprice lately, that I want to see  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care two straws about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that, but I wish to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  intend to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  snatched up his hat and stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll say good-bye,&rdquo; he said angrily; &ldquo;if you disregard my wishes so much,you  can&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I can!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are jealous of this confounded woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  looked at her angrily for a moment&mdash; then dashed out of the room, whereon Eug&eacute;nie  burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a dear old boy he is,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;he thinks I&rsquo;m jealous. Well,&rdquo; with  a frown, &ldquo;perhaps I am. I wonder, if he knew that I gave him the five hundred  pounds, what he&rsquo;d say? He doesn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m a rich woman now, so I can test  his love for me. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s as true as steel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  picked up her hat, and, going over to the mirror, leaned her elbows on the  mantelpiece, looked searchingly at her beautiful face. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you jealous, you foolish woman?&rdquo; she said, with a laugh. &ldquo;Yes, my dear, you  are; at all events, you&rsquo;ll see your rival to-morrow. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll make Keith  a dreadful wife,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh, turning away. &ldquo;For I think every woman  is in love with him. Poor Keith, how angry he was!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  burst out laughing, and left the room. </p>

    The Rivals</b></h2>
  <p>EUGENIE  RAINSFORD was a very clever young woman, much too clever to pass her life in  the up-country wilds of Australia, and no doubt she would have left her  solitude in some way even had not fortune favoured her. Luckily, however,  fortune did favour her and in a rather curious way, for a rich sharebroker  having seen her, fell in love with her, and wanted to marry her; she however refused,  telling him that she was engaged to marry Keith Stewart, whereupon he made  inquiries, and she told him the whole story.</p>
  <p>He  was so delighted with her fidelity to a poor man, that he made his will in her  favour, feeling sure that, as he had no relations, she would be the most  deserving person to leave it to. A carriage accident killed him six months  afterwards, and Eug&eacute;nie found herself a very rich woman, with as many thousands  as she had pence before.</p>
  <p>She  took her good fortune very calmly, telling no one about it, not even her  employers; but, after consultation with the lawyer, she sent five hundred  pounds to Keith, with instructions to the bank that he was not to know where it  came from. Then she set herself to work out a little scheme she had in her head,  to find out if he were true to her.</p>
  <p>In  many of the letters he had written, she had been struck with the frequent  mention of one name, Caprice, and on making inquiries, found out all about the  actress. She bought a photograph of her, and was struck with the pathetic face  of a woman who was said to lead so vile a life. Dreading lest Keith should have  fallen in love with this divinity of the stage, she determined to go down to  Melbourne and see for herself.</p>
  <p>By  chance, however, she found in a newspaper an advertisement that Kitty Marchurst  wanted a governess for her little girl, and seeing at once an excellent  opportunity of finding out if her suspicions were correct, wrote offering  herself for the situation.</p>
  <p>Kitty  on her side remembered the name of Eug&eacute;nie Rainsford as that of the girl to  whom Keith told her he was engaged, so, curious to see what she was like,  engaged her for a governess at once. Eug&eacute;nie was delighted when she received  this letter, and, still in the character of a poor and friendless girl, she  left Mr Chine, the lawyer, to manage her property, after binding him to  secrecy, and came down to take the situation.</p>
  <p>Keith&rsquo;s  evident desire that she should not accept the situation made her all the more determined  to do so, and twelve o&rsquo;clock the next day found her in the drawing-room of  Caprice&rsquo;s house, waiting for the entrance of her future mistress.</p>
  <p>When  Kitty entered the room she could not help admiring the handsome woman before  her, and on her part Eug&eacute;nie was astonished to see the bright vivacity of the  melancholy face, for Caprice&rsquo;s features were sad only when in repose.</p>
  <p>The  two women stood opposite to one another for a moment, mentally making up their  minds about each other. Kitty was the first to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Rainsford, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I came to see you about&mdash;about the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Governess  for my little girl,&rdquo; said Kitty, nodding her head. &ldquo;Yes, I want some one whom I  can trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will be able to trust me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caprice  looked keenly at her, and then burst out into a torrent of words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think I can trust you&mdash;but the question is, will you take care of my child&mdash;I  mean will you accept the trust? You have come from the country &mdash;you don&rsquo;t know  who I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do&mdash;Miss Marchurst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  not Miss Marchurst&mdash;Caprice!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  waited for a moment to see what effect this notorious name would have on her  visitor, but, to her surprise, Eug&eacute;nie simply bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know.&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>Caprice  arose and advanced towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know,&rdquo; she exclaimed vehemently, &ldquo;and yet can sit down in the same room with a  woman of my character. Are you not afraid I&rsquo;ll contaminate you&mdash;do you not  shrink from a pariah like me &mdash; no&mdash;you do not &mdash; great heavens!&rdquo; with a bitter  laugh, sitting down again; &ldquo;and I thought the age of miracles was past&mdash;ah, bah!  But you are only a girl, my dear, and don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  arose and crossed over to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do understand; I am a woman, and feel for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  caught her hand and gave a gasping cry. &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; she whispered, in a  husky voice. Then in a moment she had dashed the tears away from her eyes, and  sat up again in her bright, resolute manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  woman has spoken so kindly as you have for many years,&rdquo; she said quickly; &ldquo;and  I thank you. I can give you my child, and you will take care of her for me when  I am far away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean&mdash;that  I am not fit to live with my child, that I am going to send her to England with  you, that she may forget she ever had a mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why do this,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie in a pitying tone, &ldquo;when you can keep her with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot let her grow up in the atmosphere of sin I live in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why not leave this sinful life, and go to England with your child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  shook her head with a dreary smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible&mdash;to  leave off this life would kill me; besides, I saw a doctor some time ago, and  he told me I had not very long to live; there is something wrong with my heart.  I don&rsquo;t care if I do die so long as my child is safe&mdash;you will look after her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Eug&eacute;nie firmly; &ldquo;I will look after her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  approached her timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I kiss you?&rdquo; she said faintly, and seeing her answer in the girl&rsquo;s eyes, she  bent down and kissed her forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I must introduce you to your new pupil,&rdquo; she said, cheerfully overcoming her  momentary weakness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment.&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, as Caprice went to the bell-pull. &ldquo;I want to ask you  about Mr Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caprice  turned round quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what&mdash;about  him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caprice  came over to the fire and looked closely at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the girl he is engaged to&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  make your mind easy, my dear, he loves no one but you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  gave a sigh of relief, at which Kitty smiled a little scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you love him so much as that?&rdquo; she said half pathetically; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pity, my  dear, he&rsquo;s not worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be angry, Miss Rainsford,&rdquo; said Kitty, quietly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that he loves any  one else, but he&rsquo;s not the man I took him for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t try to, if I were you,&rdquo; replied Kitty significantly. &ldquo;I helped him when  I first met him, because he saved my child&rsquo;s life. He came down here, and I  liked him still more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  loved him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  love and I parted company long ago. I liked him, but though I do my best to  help him, I don&rsquo;t care for him so much as I did, my dear: he&rsquo;s not worthy of  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all very well, but I don&rsquo;t see the reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not, what woman in love ever does see reason; however, make your mind  easy, things are all right. I will tell you the reason some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want to know now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curiosity  is a woman&rsquo;s vice,&rdquo; said Kitty lightly &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself, Miss Rainsford,  whatever I know of Keith Stewart won&rsquo;t alter him in your eyes&mdash;now, don&rsquo;t say  anything more about it. I&rsquo;ll ring for Meg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  tried to get a more explicit answer out of her, but Kitty only laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be anything so very bad,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;or this woman would not  laugh at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg  came in quietly, a demure, pensive-faced little child, and after Kitty had  kissed her she presented her to Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is your new governess, Meg,&rdquo; she said, smoothing the child&rsquo;s hair, &ldquo;and I want  you to love her very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg  hung back for a few moments, with the awkward timidity of a child, but Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s  soft voice and caressing manner soon gained her confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like you very much,&rdquo; she said at length, nestling to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  much as mumsey, Meg?&rdquo; said Kitty, with a sad smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  never&mdash;never as much as mumsey,&rdquo; cried Meg, leaving her new-found friend for her  mother, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one so good and kind as mumsey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  kissed the child vehemently, and then bit her lips to stop the tears coming to  her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey,&rdquo;  said Meg at length, &ldquo;can I tell the lady a secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,  dear,&rdquo; replied Kitty smiling.</p>
  <p>Thereupon  Meg slipped off Kitty&rsquo;s lap and ran to Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this great secret?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie, bending down with a laugh.</p>
  <p>Meg  put her mouth to Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s ear, and whispered,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I grow up I&rsquo;m going to marry Keith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; said Kitty, overhearing the whisper, &ldquo;my daughter is your rival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a very dangerous one,&rdquo; replied Eug&eacute;nie with a sigh, touching the auburn hair.</p>
  <p>Meg  was sent off after this, and then Kitty arranged all about the salary with Eug&eacute;nie,  after which she accompanied her to the door to say good-bye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry I put any distrust into your heart about Mr Stewart,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t  trouble, my dear, get him to give up his dissipated habits, and you&rsquo;ll no doubt  find he&rsquo;ll make an excellent husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie to herself as she walked to the station, &ldquo;it was only dissipation  she meant&mdash;as if anything like that could hurt Keith in my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she began to think of the strange woman she had left&mdash;with her sudden changes of  temperament from laughter to tears&mdash;with her extraordinary nature, half-vice  half-virtue, of the love she bore for her child, and the strong will that could  send that child away for ever from her lonely life. </p>

    A First Night At The Bon-Bon</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;FAUST  Upset&rdquo; &nbsp;had been put into rehearsal at  once, and three weeks after the murder of Lazarus it was to be produced.  Mortimer had hurried on the production of the burlesque with the uttermost  speed, as &ldquo;Prince Carnival&rdquo; was now playing to empty houses. The Bon-Bon  company were kept hard at work, and, what with rehearsals during the day, the  performance of the opera-bouffe in the evening, and rehearsals afterwards till  two in the morning, they were all pretty well worn-out.</p>
  <p>In  spite of Kitty&rsquo;s indomitable spirit, she was looking haggard and ill, for the  incessant work was beginning to tell on her system. The doctor told her plainly  that she was killing herself, and that absolute rest was what she required; but  in spite of those warnings she never gave herself a moment&rsquo;s peace,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care two straws if I die,&rdquo; she said recklessly to Dr Chinston; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made  arrangements for the future of my child, and there&rsquo;s nothing else for me to  live for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was determined to make the burlesque a success, and worked hard at rehearsals  getting the author and composer to alter some things, and cut out others,  making several valuable suggestions as to stage-management, and in every way  doing her best. But though friendly towards Keith, yet he was conscious of a  kind of reserve in her manner towards him, and thought it was due to the  knowledge that he was engaged to Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>He  had become reconciled to his sweetheart, and she went down every day to teach  Meg at Toorak. It had been arranged that in three months she was to go to  England with Meg, and Kitty guaranteed to pay a certain sum annually for the  salary of the governess and the maintenance of the child. Of course Eug&eacute;nie  never meant to take any money, as she had become strongly attached to Meg, but  still kept up her semblance of poverty till such time as she judged it fit to  tell Keith. Meanwhile, in spite of Keith&rsquo;s opposition, she lived with Caprice,  and led a very quiet life, for what with the state of her health and constant  rehearsals, Kitty gave no Sunday receptions.</p>
  <p>But  while Stewart fumed and fretted over the fact of his sweetheart staying with a  woman of bad character like Caprice, and attended to all the rehearsals of the  burlesque, Naball was silently winding his net round him. The detective had  made inquiries at the Skylarks&rsquo; Club, and found that Keith had been there on  that night, in the company of Fenton. On discovering this, he went to Fenton  and discovered that Stewart had lent the American the knife with which the  crime had been committed, to cut the wires of a champagne bottle, and  afterwards slipped it into his coat pocket. From the club he went to the BonBon  Theatre, and, as the detective knew from Keith&rsquo;s own admission, had left there  at half-past twelve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then,&rdquo; said Naball to himself, &ldquo;he told me he wandered about the streets till  two o&rsquo;clock, and then saw Villiers&mdash;rubbish&mdash;he went straight to Russell Street  and committed the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  had taken Naball some time to collect the necessary evidence, and it was only  on the day previous to the production of &ldquo;Faust Upset&rdquo; that he was able to get  a warrant for Keith&rsquo;s arrest, so he determined to let the performance take  place before he arrested him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s a success,&rdquo; said Naball to himself, as he slipped the warrant in his  pocket, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have had one jolly hour to himself, and if it&rsquo;s a failure&mdash;well, he&rsquo;ll  be glad enough to go to gaol.&rdquo; So, with this philosophical conclusion, Mr  Naball settled in his own mind that he would go to the theatre.</p>
  <p>Keith  wanted Eug&eacute;nie to go to a box with him in order to see the play, but she said  she would rather go to the stalls by herself, in order to judge of the effect  the burlesque had on the audience. After a good deal of argument, Stewart gave  way; so on the momentous night she took her seat in the stalls, eager to see  the first bid her lover made for fame.</p>
  <p>Tulch  had been recalled from his task of watching Stewart, as Naball judged that the  vanity of an author seeing his work on the stage would be enough to keep the  young man in Melbourne; but Tulch, true to his instincts of finishing a job  properly, took his place in the gallery and kept his eye on Keith, who sat with  Ezra in a private box. The Jew was calm and placid, as having succeeded to his  father&rsquo;s fortune, he had not staked everything, like Keith, on the burlesque  being a success; still, for his partner&rsquo;s sake as well as his own, he was  anxious that it should go well.</p>
  <p>Such  a crowded house as it was&mdash;everybody in Melbourne was there&mdash;for a new play by a  colonial author was a rare thing, and a burlesque by a colonial author, with  original music by a colonial composer, was almost unheard of.</p>
  <p>The  critics who were present felt an unwonted sense of responsibility to-night, for  as this was the first production of the piece on any stage, they had to give an  opinion on their own responsibility. Hitherto the generality of plays produced  in Melbourne had their good and bad points settled long before by London  critics, so it was comparatively easy to give a verdict; but to-night it was  quite a different thing, therefore the gentlemen of the press intended to be  extra careful in their remarks.</p>
  <p>Although  &ldquo;Faust Upset&rdquo; was called a burlesque, it was more of an opera-bouffe, as there  was an absence of puns and rhyme about the dialogue, besides which, the lyrics  were really cleverly written, and the music brisk and sparkling. Keith had  taken the old mediaeval legend of Faust, and reversed it entirely&mdash;all the male  characters of the story he made female, and <i>vice  versa</i>. There was a good deal of satire in the piece about the higher  education of women, and the devotion of young men to athletics, to the  exclusion of brain work. In fact, the libretto was of a decidedly Gilbertian  flavour, albeit rather more frivolous, while the music was entirely of the  Offenbachian school, light, tuneful and rapid.</p>
  <p>After  a medley overture, containing a number of taking melodies in the piece, the  curtain rose on the study of Miss Faust, a blue-stocking of the deepest dye,  who, after devoting her life to acquiring knowledge, finds herself, at the age  of fifty, an old maid with no one to care for her. The character was played by  Toltby, who was a genuine humorist; and he succeeded in making a great deal out  of the part, without ever condescending to vulgarity. His appearance as a lank,  long maiden, in a dingy sage-green gown, with wan face and tousled hair, was  ludicrous in the extreme.</p>
  <p>The  opening chorus was sung by a number of pretty girls, in caps and gowns, and on  their going out to meet their lovers, Miss Faust, overcome with loneliness,  summons to her aid the powers of evil, and in response &ldquo;Miss Mephistopheles&rdquo;  appears.</p>
  <p>Kitty  looked charming as she stood in the centre of the red limelight. She was  arrayed in the traditional dress of red, but as a female demon wore a  petticoat, and her face was also left untouched. Miss Faust fainted in her  chair, and Miss Mephistopheles, with a bright light in her eyes, and a reckless  devil may-care look on her expressive face, whirled down to the footlights, and  dashed into a rattling galop song, &ldquo;Yes, this is I,&rdquo; which melody ran all  through the opera.</p>
  <p>With  the assistance of various cosmetics, new dress, and sundry other articles of  feminine toilet, which were brought in by a number of small imps, Miss  Mephistopheles succeeds in making Miss Faust young; shows her a vision of Mr  Marguerite, a young athlete; and finally changes the scene to the market-place,  where there was a chorus of young men in praise of athletic sports.</p>
  <p>It  would be useless to give the plot in detail, as Keith followed the lines of the  legend pretty closely. Miss Faust meets Mr Marguerite, who is beloved by Miss  Siebel, a sporting young woman. There was the garden scene, with a lawn tennis  ground; a vision on the Brocken, of the future of women, with grotesque ballets  and fantastic dresses; the scene of the duel, which was a quarrel scene between  Mrs Valentine and Miss Faust, after the style of Madame Angot; then Miss  Mephistopheles runs off with Mr Marguerite, having fallen in love with him; the  lovers are followed and thrown into a prison, which is changed by the magic  power of Miss Mephistopheles to a race-course, in which scene there is a  bewildering array of betting men, pugilists, pretty girls, and fortune-tellers.  Miss Mephistopheles then resigns Mr Marguerite to Miss Siebel, and wants to  carry off Miss Faust to the nether regions, when a flaw is discovered in the  deed, and everything is settled amicably, the whole play ending with the galop  chorus of the first number.</p>
  <p>When  the curtain fell on the first act, the audience were somewhat bewildered; it  was such an entirely new departure from the story of Faust, that they almost  resented it. But as the piece progressed, they saw the real cleverness of the  satire, and when the curtain came down they called loudly for the author and  composer, who came forward and bowed their acknowledgments.</p>
  <p>When  Mortimer heard the eulogies lavished on the piece, he drew a long breath of  relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jove!  I thought it was going to fail,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I believe it would have, if  Caprice hadn&rsquo;t pulled it out of the fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And,  indeed, Caprice, with her wonderful spirits and reckless <i>abandon</i>, had carried the whole play with her, and saved it at the  most critical moment. A young man sitting near Eug&eacute;nie summed up his idea of  the piece in a few words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a deuced clever play,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but Caprice makes it go&mdash;if any one else plays  her part, the theatre will be empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  turned angrily to look for the author of this remark, but could not see him.  Just as she was turning away, a shrill voice near her said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t  Caprice a stunner! I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;er lots oft times at old Lazarus&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speaker was a small, white-faced Jewish youth, being none other than Isaiah.</p>
  <p>Miss  Rainsford pondered over these words as she walked out of the theatre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goes  to old Lazarus&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;that was the old man who was killed. I  wonder why she went there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a crowd in the vestibule of the theatre, and she saw Keith standing in the  corner, looking as pale as death, talking to a man.</p>
  <p>She  went up to congratulate him on the success of the performance, but something in  his face made her afraid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, Keith?&rdquo; she asked, touching him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  he said in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;I&rsquo;m arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arrested!  What for?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
  <p>The  man standing next to Keith interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the murder of Jacob Lazarus,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  closed her eyes with a sensation of horror, and caught hold of the wall for  support. When she opened her eyes again, Keith and the detective had both  vanished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arrested  for the murder of Lazarus!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;My God! it can&rsquo;t be true!&rdquo; </p>

    Eug&eacute;nie V Naball</b></h2>
  <p>As  a rule first performances in Melbourne take place on Saturday night,  consequently the criticisms on &ldquo;Faust Upset&rdquo; were in Monday&rsquo;s papers.  Simultaneously with the notices of the burlesque, there appeared an  announcement that the author of the piece had been arrested for the murder of  Jacob Lazarus.</p>
  <p>Keith  was very little known in Melbourne, so his arrest personally caused little talk;  but the fact that a successful author and a murderer were one and the same  person caused a great sensation.</p>
  <p>The  criticisms on the burlesque were, as a rule, good, and though some of the  papers picked out faults, yet it was generally agreed that the piece had been a  wonderful success; but the sensation of a successful colonial production having  taken place was merged in the greater sensation of the discovery of the Russell  Street murderer.</p>
  <p>Keith  Stewart, protesting his innocence of the charge, had immediately been taken off  to gaol, and Eug&eacute;nie was unable to see him until she got the permission of the  proper authorities; but feeling certain that he had not committed the crime,  she called on Ezra at <i>The Penny Whistle</i> early on Monday morning.</p>
  <p>On  sending up her card, she was shown into Ezra&rsquo;s room, and there found that  Naball was present. The detective, who was fully convinced of Keith&rsquo;s guilt,  had called in order to find out for certain from Ezra all about the prisoner&rsquo;s  movements on the night in question.</p>
  <p>When  Eug&eacute;nie entered the room, Ezra, who looked pale and careworn, arose and greeted  her warmly. He then introduced her to Naball, who looked keenly at the sad face  of the woman who was engaged to the man he had hunted down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Naball,&rdquo; said Ezra, indicating the detective, &ldquo;has called upon me to find out  about Stewart&rsquo;s movements on the night my father was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied Naball, with a shrewd glance at the Jew</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie impatiently, &ldquo;surely you can explain them, for Keith told me you  were with him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  looked dismal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I wasn&rsquo;t with him all the time; I only met him at the Bon-Bon, and I left  before he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  interposed the detective smoothly; &ldquo;and, according to Mr Mortimer, Stewart left  there about half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then, I presume,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, with fine disdain, &ldquo;you think he went and  murdered Lazarus right off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  observed Naball, deliberately smoothing his gloves, &ldquo;according to the doctor&rsquo;s  evidence, the crime was committed about twelve o&rsquo;clock, or a little later. Now  Stewart can&rsquo;t say where he was between the time he left the theatre and the  time he met Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was wandering about the streets,&rdquo; explained Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>Naball  smiled cynically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  so he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so every one else says who knows Keith Stewart,&rdquo; retorted the girl. &ldquo;He is  incapable of such an act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that he had nothing to urge against  such an eminently feminine argument.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  looked angrily at the detective, and then turned in despair to the Jew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t believe him guilty?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  on my soul, I do not,&rdquo; he replied fervently; &ldquo;still appearances look black  against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Rainsford thought for a few moments, and at last bluntly asked Naball the same  question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe him guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  far as my experience goes,&rdquo; said the detective coolly, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  produced a little pocket-knife, and began to trim his nails.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  evidence is circumstantial,&rdquo; he said, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;but the  evidence is conclusive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind telling me what the evidence is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective shut his knife with a sharp click, slipped it into his waistcoat  pocket, and, leaning over the table, looked steadily at Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Rainsford,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;I admire you very much for the way you stand up  for Stewart, but, believe me, that though I would gladly see him free, yet the  proofs are too strong to suppose him innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  bent her head coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind telling me the evidence?&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>
  <p>Naball,  rather perplexed, looked at Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  tell her all you know,&rdquo; said that gentleman. &ldquo;I think, myself, Stewart is  innocent, and perhaps Miss Rainsford may throw some light on the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t call it a mystery,&rdquo; retorted Naball impatiently; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as clear as day. I&rsquo;m  willing to tell all I know; but as to Miss Rainsford throwing any light on the  subject, it&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  questioned him for the third time in the same words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind telling me the evidence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Naball sharply. &ldquo;Stewart was in employment of the deceased as his clerk.  He came to Melbourne with no money, and, according to his own account, given in  this very room, and in the presence of this gentleman, he becomes possessed of  a sum of five hundred pounds, which was mysteriously placed to his credit at  the Hibernian Bank. I went to the bank, and discovered from the manager that  such a sum had been placed to the prisoner&rsquo;s credit, but he refused to tell me  by whom, so, as was only natural, I concluded that Stewart had robbed his  employer of the money, and under a feigned name placed it to his credit. My  reasons for such a belief are this&mdash;he had full command of all the books, and  could cook the accounts as he liked. He did so, and obtained this money  Lazarus, however, who I know was a very sharp man, had suspicions, and  determined to examine the books; this, of course, meant ruin to Stewart, so he  made up his mind to kill his master. He was at the Skylarks&rsquo; Club on the night  of the murder, and gave Mr Fenton, the manager of The Never-say-die Insurance  Company, his knife to open a champagne bottle; that knife was one given to him  by the child of Kitty Marchurst, and has on it an inscription, &ldquo;From Meg.&rdquo; On  receiving it back, he placed it in the pocket of his overcoat, and walked to  the Bon-Bon. After an interview with Mr Mortimer, he left the Bon-Bon at  half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock, went up to Russell Street, and entering by the back  window (the position of which he knew thoroughly), killed the old man; then he  took the keys from under the pillow, and robbed the safe of various things,  including bank-notes to the amount of one hundred pounds, which he knew were  placed therein; while leaving the place, he dropped his knife outside the  window; he then wanders about the streets, perhaps goes home, but horror-struck  with the dread of being found out, returns to the scene of his crime, and there  sees Villiers, whom he questions, but getting no response from him, thinks  Villiers is drunk. Villiers, however, was only shamming, and tells me some time  afterwards that he picked up a knife under the open window, and was cognisant  of the murder. I obtain the knife, and it is the one Stewart had in the club,  with the inscription on it. I think, therefore, the evidence is very clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie quietly.</p>
  <p>The  detective became a little exasperated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; he said in an annoyed tone of voice, &ldquo;there are three strong proofs:  first, he is possessed of a large sum of money he can&rsquo;t account for; second, he  is unable to prove an <i>alibi</i>; and  third, his knife, covered with blood, is found on the scene of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far so good,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie ironically; &ldquo;your reasoning is excellent, Mr Naball,  but untrue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Untrue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  repeat untrue,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;With regard to the five hundred pounds&mdash;I paid  that into his credit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo;  said Ezra, while Naball stared at her thunder-struck, &ldquo;a poor girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not a poor girl,&rdquo; said Miss Rainsford coolly. &ldquo;On the contrary, I&rsquo;m worth fifty  thousand pounds left to me by a sharebroker in Sandhurst. I did not tell Keith  of my fortune as I wanted him to love me for myself. But as I knew he was poor,  I placed to his credit the sum of five hundred pounds; so that settles your  first proof, Mr Naball.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s certainly very curious,&rdquo; said Naball, after a pause. &ldquo;I hardly know what  to think&mdash; what about my second proof?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  that&rsquo;s more difficult to prove,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie; &ldquo;but I quite believe he did  wander about. He&rsquo;s rather absent-minded, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  answer to my second proof is weak,&rdquo; replied Naball sardonically. &ldquo;And the  third&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the knife? Well,&rdquo; said Miss Rainsford, knitting her brows, &ldquo;he had it at the  club, you say, and slipped it into his overcoat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he went to the Bon-Bon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what happened to his overcoat there?&rsquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you,&rdquo; replied Ezra. &ldquo;He took it off, and in mistake Caprice carried it  downstairs with her fur mantle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  did she take it away with her?&rdquo; asked Naball quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Ezra quietly, &ldquo;she found out she had it when she was putting on her mantle  in the carriage, and called me back to return it. I took it upstairs again, and  gave it to Keith, who put it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the knife was still in the pocket?&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so,&rdquo; replied Ezra, rather confused. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know the knife was  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think?&rdquo; asked Miss Rainsford, turning to Naball.</p>
  <p>That  astute young man wrinkled his brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you are driving at,&rdquo; he said rapidly. &ldquo;You think that Caprice took the  knife out of the pocket, saw the whole chance in a flash, and committed the  crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no!&rdquo; cried Eug&eacute;nie, horror struck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t believe she could be  guilty of a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I don&rsquo;t know so much about that,&rdquo; said Naball disbelievingly</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  nonsense,&rdquo; broke in Ezra angrily; &ldquo;she could not have done such a thing&mdash;she had  no motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  did not reply to this remark, but rising from his seat, walked hurriedly up and  down the room in a state of great excitement. He had been fully convinced of  the guilt of Stewart, but the conversation of Eug&eacute;nie had shaken his belief,  and he began to puzzle over the new aspect of the case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if Caprice ever had any dealings with Lazarus?&rdquo; he said to himself,  thinking of the diamond robbery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  broke in Eug&eacute;nie sharply, &ldquo;she had&mdash;at least,&rdquo; in answer to Naball&rsquo;s questioning  look, &ldquo;when I was at the theatre on Saturday night a boy near me said he had  seen her at Lazarus&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  boy,&rdquo; asked Ezra sharply, &ldquo;what boy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;a thin, pale-faced Jewish-looking boy, with a shrill  voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isaiah,&rdquo;  said Naball and Ezra with one voice, and then looked at one another, amazed at  this new discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove!&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;this is becoming exciting. You are sure you heard  the boy say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;quite sure,&rdquo; answered Eug&eacute;nie firmly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think that could  prove Caprice guilty. Much as I wish to serve Keith, I don&rsquo;t want to ruin her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  glanced at her keenly, then turned to Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send  for the boy,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll find out all about Caprice&rsquo;s visits  to your father&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  mightn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the murder,&rdquo; said Ezra, ringing the bell for  the messenger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo;  replied Naball, &ldquo;but, on the other hand, it might have a good deal to do with  the diamond robbery.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    The Cypher</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  the messenger had been despatched, Naball drew his seat up to the table, and  began to make some notes, after which he turned to Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was firmly convinced of Stewart&rsquo;s guilt,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;but what you have  told me throws a new light on the subject, I said you could not do that&mdash;I beg  your pardon&mdash;you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  bowed her head in acknowledgment of the apology, and asked him a question in a  hesitating manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think Caprice is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think nothing at present,&rdquo; he replied evasively; &ldquo;not even that Stewart is  innocent. When I see the boy, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  talked on together for a few minutes, and then there came a knock at the door.  In reply to Ezra&rsquo;s permisssion to enter, the door opened, and Isaiah appeared  on the threshold, holding some papers in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; said Ezra, as the boy shut the door after him. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  did you want me?&rdquo; demanded Isaiah in a jerky manner, &ldquo; &lsquo;cos I never knowed you  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you meet a messenger?&rdquo; asked Naball, turning his head round.</p>
  <p>Isaiah  deposited the papers he carried on Ezra&rsquo;s desk, and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I never met any one, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Mr Ezra asked me to bring all  letters that came to the old &lsquo;un, so as these came, I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right,&rdquo; said Lazarus, looking through the letters. &ldquo;By-the-way, Isaiah, this  gentleman wants to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Mr Naball?&rdquo; said Isaiah in alarm. &ldquo;Oh, sir, I never had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  no! that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said good-naturedly. &ldquo;It would take a bigger man than  a sprat like you to commit such a crime; but, tell me, do you know Caprice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isaiah  leered significantly &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her on the stage, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drivin&rsquo;  about the streets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere  else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isaiah  glanced uneasily at Ezra, who laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, Isaiah; it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ve seen her at the old &lsquo;un&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed,&rdquo; said Naball quickly. &ldquo;Often?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;lots  of times&mdash;at night&mdash;came to do business, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you see her last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  not for a long time,&rdquo; replied Isaiah; &ldquo;but do you remember the week them  diamonds were stolen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; said Naball eagerly.</p>
  <p>Isaiah  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she came to see the old &lsquo;un, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  suppressed his exultation with difficulty, and asked Isaiah another question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say&mdash;those bank-notes that were stolen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never stole &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one said you did,&rdquo; retorted Naball tartly; &ldquo;but you wrote something on the back  of one of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isaiah  turned scarlet, and shifted from one leg to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you see,&rdquo; he murmured apologetically, &ldquo;Mr Stewart wanted to know a good &lsquo;un to  back for the Cup, so I was afraid of the old &lsquo;un hearing, and as there wasn&rsquo;t  no paper, I wrote on the back of one of &lsquo;em, &lsquo;Back Flat-Iron.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  pencil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  in ink. Mr Stewart, he laughs and nods, then puts the notes in the cash box,  and puts &lsquo;em in the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; said Naball, dismissing him; &ldquo;you can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isaiah  put on his hat, put his hands in his pockets, and departed, whistling a tune.  When the door closed on him, Naball turned to his two companions with an  exulting light in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think now, Mr Naball?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think.  I think as I&rsquo;ve done all along,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Caprice stole those jewels  herself, and sold them to old Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what&rsquo;s that got to do with the death of my father?&rdquo; asked Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  nothing&mdash;perhaps a lot,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but that boy&rsquo;s  evidence has given me a clue. Suppose&mdash;I&rsquo;m only supposing, mind you&mdash;Caprice  stole her own diamonds, with Villiers as an accomplice. Suppose she took them  to old Lazarus and sold &lsquo;em. Suppose Villiers, thinking the old man has them in  his safe, goes to rob him, and commits the murder to do so. Suppose all that&mdash;I  should think there would be a very pretty case against Villiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but Keith&rsquo;s knife?&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  now you have me,&rdquo; answered Naball, puzzled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless Villiers  managed to get it while Stewart was fighting with him on that night, and  covered it in blood in order to throw suspicion on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  your ideas are theoretical,&rdquo; said Ezra, drily. &ldquo;Perhaps Caprice never stole her  own jewels, or sold them to my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she did, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; retorted Naball decisively. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she prosecute?  why did I find Villiers with one of the jewels? You bet, she stole them for  some freak, and I daresay Villiers committed the murder to get them back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think my father would have kept such valuable jewels as that about the  premises.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he&rsquo;d put &lsquo;em in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Ezra; &ldquo;he sent all his jewels to Amsterdam. And here,&rdquo;  holding up a letter, &ldquo;is an envelope with the Dutch postmark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove!&rdquo; ejaculated Naball, under his breath, &ldquo;what a queer thing if it should  turn out to be those diamonds of Caprice&rsquo;s. Open the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  it does turn out to be the diamonds,&rdquo; said Ezra, slowly tearing the envelope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Naball  drew a long breath&mdash;&ldquo;it will be the beginning of the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it will end in Keith&rsquo;s being released,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, looking at Ezra with  intense anxiety.</p>
  <p>That  gentleman took out the letter, and glancing at it for a moment, gave vent to an  ejaculation of disgust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie and Naball together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  letter is in cypher,&rdquo; said Lazarus, tossing it over to the detective. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think we&rsquo;ll be able to read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;ll have a try,&rdquo; said Naball, quickly spreading out the letter. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a  look at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dsidanmo  seaf utnes teh ssteon ryiks sgenlil gto teher tdhnoaus sgennid it lses teher  hduenrd bneiertns.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the deuce does it mean?&rdquo; asked Naball in a puzzled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a cypher, evidently, of which my father alone possesses the key,&rdquo; said Ezra. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have a look among his papers, and if I find it, it will soon make sense of this  jumble of words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like a Chinese puzzle,&rdquo; observed Naball, glancing at it. &ldquo;I never could find  out these things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me look,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, taking the letter. &ldquo;I used to be rather good at  puzzles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  find this one out,&rdquo; said Naball significantly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll do some good for  Stewart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think it&rsquo;s about Caprice&rsquo;s diamonds?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it&rsquo;s about Caprice&rsquo;s diamonds,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think the words have been written backwards,&rdquo; said Ezra, looking over her  shoulder.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she replied, scanning the letter closely. &ldquo;If so, the word &lsquo;it&rsquo;  would have been written &lsquo;ti.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try  a word of three letters, if there&rsquo;s one,&rdquo; suggested Naball, &ldquo;and you can see  how the letters are placed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  one spelt &lsquo; g-t-o.&rsquo; What word can be made out of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got,&rdquo;  said Ezra eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if so, in the cypher it reads, the first letter &lsquo;g,&rsquo; the last letter &lsquo;t,&rsquo; and  the middle letter at the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of that?&rdquo; asked Naball bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  the sender of this has taken the first and last letters of a word, and written  them in rotation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Naball in a puzzled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I do,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie quickly. &ldquo;Let us take another word, and instead of  guessing it, try my idea. Here is a word, &lsquo;teher.&rsquo; Now, Mr Naball, take a sheet  of paper and write down what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  got some paper and a pencil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie, &ldquo;this word &lsquo;teher.&rsquo; The first letter is &lsquo;t,&rsquo; now the second  letter, which, I think, is the end one of the proper word, is &lsquo;e&rsquo;&mdash; place that  at the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  wrote &ldquo;t&mdash;e.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  third letter of the cypher, and the second of the proper word, is &lsquo;h&rsquo;&mdash;put that  next the &lsquo;t;&rsquo; and the fourth letter of the cypher, and third of the proper  word, is &lsquo;e&rsquo;&mdash;place that at the end also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  added two letters as instructed, &ldquo;t,h&mdash;e,e.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one letter left, which must naturally be in the  middle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  finished his writing thus: t-h-r-e-e.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is three,&rdquo; he said, with a cry of triumph. &ldquo;By Jove! Miss Rainsford, you are  clever; let&rsquo;s make certain, by trying another letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  &lsquo;s-s-t-e-o-n,&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested Ezra.</p>
  <p>Naball  wrote the letters as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">s &mdash; s<br>
    t &mdash; e<br>
    o &mdash; n</p>
  <p>Then  he wrote them in a line, down the first column and up the second, which made  the word &ldquo;stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad  we&rsquo;ve got it right, after all,&rdquo; he said delightedly, and then the whole three  of them went to work on the same system, with the result that the letter read  thus:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Diamonds  safe, unset the stones, risky selling, got three thousand, sending it less  three hundred, bernstein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Naball when he read this, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I think,&rdquo; said Ezra sadly; &ldquo;my father evidently bought the jewels from her, and  sent them to Amsterdam to be sold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie impatiently, &ldquo;this does not clear up the mystery of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think Caprice did it?&rdquo; said Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the detective; &ldquo;but Villiers might have done it in order to recover the  jewels. But I tell you what, there&rsquo;s only one thing to be done, we&rsquo;ll go down  and see Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was agreed to, and without losing a moment they started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may be wrong, as I was before,&rdquo; said Naball when they were in the train, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll  lay any money that Villiers has seen Caprice since the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s an accomplice?&rdquo; cried Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think nothing,&rdquo; retorted Naball, &ldquo;till I see Caprice.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    What Kitty Knew</b></h2>
  <p>THE  trio soon arrived at Kitty&rsquo;s house, and Ezra was just about to ring the  front-door bell, when suddenly Naball touched his arm to stop him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo;  he said in a quick whisper; &ldquo;listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  woman&rsquo;s voice, talking in a high key, and then the deep tones of a man&rsquo;s voice,  like the growl of an angry beast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did I tell you?&rdquo; whispered Naball again. &ldquo;Villiers and Caprice, both in the  drawing-room; wait a moment, count twenty, and then ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stepped round the corner of the porch, stepped stealthily on to the verandah, and  then stole softly towards one of the French windows in order to listen. He was  correct in his surmise; the two speakers were Kitty Marchurst and Randolph  Villiers. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better give me what I ask,&rdquo; growled Villiers in a threatening tone, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll go  straight and tell how you were at Lazarus&rsquo;s on the night of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you&rsquo;ll tell I killed him?&rdquo; said Caprice, with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I will,&rdquo; retorted Villiers; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no knowing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  this much knowing,&rdquo; said Kitty deliberately, &ldquo;that I won&rsquo;t give you a single  penny. If I am called on to explain my movements, I can&rsquo;t do so; but it will be  the worse for you, it will place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment the bell rang, and Caprice started in alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo;  she cried, advancing towards Villiers; &ldquo;come to me again. I must not be seen  talking with you here. Go away&mdash;not by the door,&rdquo; she said, with an angry stamp  of her foot as Villiers went towards the door; &ldquo;by the window&mdash;no one will see  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Villiers  moved towards the French window, opened it, and was just about to step out when  Naball stepped forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid some one will,&rdquo; he said serenely, pushing Villiers back into the room,  and closing the window</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naball!&rdquo;  cried Kitty and Villiers in a breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  replied that gentleman, taking a chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to have a talk with you  both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you force your way into my house?&rdquo; cried Kitty angrily, while Villiers  stood looking sullenly at the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about the diamond robbery,&rdquo; went on Naball, as if he never heard her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  the house,&rdquo; she cried, stamping her foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  about the murder,&rdquo; he finished off, looking from one to the other.</p>
  <p>Kitty  glanced at Villiers, who looked at her with a scowl, and sank into a chair.  Just as he did so, the drawing-room door opened, and Eug&eacute;nie entered, followed  by Ezra Lazarus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand the meaning of all this,&rdquo; said Caprice, with a sneer; &ldquo;but you  seem to have a good idea of dramatic effect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  so,&rdquo; replied Naball lazily.</p>
  <p>Kitty  shrugged her shoulders and turned to Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you can explain all this, Miss Rainsford?&rdquo; she said coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Eugeuie slowly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about Mr Stewart. You know he has been arrested  for this murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know,&rdquo;  repeated Kitty impatiently, &ldquo;of course, I know. I&rsquo;m sure I ought to&mdash;morn, noon  and night I&rsquo;ve heard nothing else. I don&rsquo;t know how it will affect the piece, I&rsquo;m  sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the piece,&rdquo; said Ezra, a trifle sternly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that, as long as I  save my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will,&rdquo; said Caprice heartily. &ldquo;I am certain he never committed the  crime. What do you say?&rdquo; turning to the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  beginning to be of your opinion,&rdquo; replied Naball candidly &ldquo;I did think him  guilty once,&rdquo; fixing his eyes on Villiers, &ldquo;but now I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the knife I gave you?&rdquo; asked Villiers abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Naball musingly, &ldquo;what, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found it on the scene of the crime,&rdquo; said Villiers in a defiant manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you believe me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this ambiguous murmur Villiers gave a savage growl, and would have replied, but  Kitty stopped him by waving her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no good talking like this,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;There is some reason for you all  coming here; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you,&rdquo; said Naball in a sharp official tone. &ldquo;Do you remember the diamond  robbery at this place! Well, those diamonds were sold to old Lazarus, and he  sent them to Amsterdam for sale. The person who stole those diamonds thought  they were still in the safe of Jacob Lazarus; and the person who stole those  diamonds murdered Jacob Lazarus to recover them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  finished triumphantly, and then waited to see what effect his accusation would  have on Kitty. To his astonishment, however, she never moved a muscle of her  face, but asked calmly,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who is the thief and the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I want to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally;  but why come to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo;  she cried, rising to her feet in anger. &ldquo;I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you do, and so does Villiers there,&rdquo; persisted Naball.</p>
  <p>Villiers  glanced strangely at Kitty, and growled sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here Miss Marchurst,&rdquo; said Naball rapidly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use beating about the  bush&mdash;I know more than you think. You denied that you stole your own jewels, but  I know you did, in order to pay the money embezzled by Malton. Lazarus&rsquo;s boy  saw you go to his place during the week of the robbery, late at night. You did  so in order to dispose of the jewels. The crescent I took from Villiers down  Bourke Street was given to him by you as an accomplice; and I listened at that  window to-day and heard Villiers say you were on the Russell Street premises on  the night of the murder. Now, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty,  still on her feet, was deadly pale, but looked rapidly at Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have made up a very clever case,&rdquo; she said quietly; &ldquo;but entirely wrong&mdash;yes,  entirely. I did not take my own jewels, as I told you before, therefore I was  unable to pay the money for Mr Malton. I did go to see Lazarus one night during  the week of the robbery, in order to get some money, but was unable to do so. I  never gave the crescent to Villiers, as he will tell you; and lastly, as you  overheard him state, I was at Lazarus&rsquo;s on the night of the murder, but did not  think it necessary to state so. I went there after I left the Bon-Bon, and made  no secret of my doing so, as my coachman can inform you. I found the door locked,  and no light inside, so thinking the old man had gone to bed, I came away, and  went home; so, you see, your very clever case means nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this true?&rdquo; asked Naball, turning to Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  what true?&rdquo; asked that gentleman angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  she says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of it. Well, yes, most of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better go a little further,&rdquo; said Kitty quietly, &ldquo;and say all of it. Did I give  you the diamond crescent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  who did?&rdquo; asked Naball pertinaciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t  tell you,&rdquo; growled Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you will,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;because if you know who stole the  diamonds, you know the murderer of Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Villiers savagely. &ldquo;I tell you I saw her round about the  place on that night, and I picked up the knife I gave you; that&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  we&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure that the person who stole the diamonds committed the crime?&rdquo; asked  Caprice, with a strange smile on her pale lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m pretty sure; it looks uncommon like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you think I stole the diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  retorted Naball bluntly; &ldquo;I believe you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case, by your own reasoning, I&rsquo;m a murderess,&rdquo; said Caprice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said the detective; &ldquo;but I believe you know who did it,&rdquo;  looking significantly at Villiers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid your reasonings and your assertions are at variance,&rdquo; said Kitty  quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who committed the murder, but I do know who stole my  diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  asked Ezra, in an excited tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keith  Stewart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keith  Stewart!&rdquo; echoed all; &ldquo;impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  stepped forward with a frown on her pale face, and looked at Kitty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you are a wicked woman to say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,  it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; replied Caprice, with a sigh. &ldquo;I have kept the secret as long as I  could, but now it&rsquo;s impossible to do so any longer. Keith Stewart was at my  place on the night of the robbery, and heard me say where my diamonds were. He  was coming to the drawing-room, and saw my child descending the stairs, having  got out of bed. He picked her up, and put her in bed again. The temptation was  too strong to resist, I suppose, and he opened the drawer of the mirror, and  took the jewels. He then got out of the window, and came round by the front of  the house so as to enter by the front-door. Meg was awake all the time, and  told it to me in her childish way, how he had gone to the window and got out of  it. I told her not to speak of it, and kept silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you keep silence?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  cried Kitty, her face flushing with anger, &ldquo;because he saved my child from  death. He might have stolen anything of mine, but I would have kept silent, nor  would I have betrayed him now but that you accuse me of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a dead silence in the room, as every one was touched by the way in which  Kitty spoke. Then Villiers gave a coarse laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  ha!&rdquo; he said harshly; &ldquo;you said, Naball, that the person who stole the diamonds  committed the murder also, so you&rsquo;ve got the right man in gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  cast a look of commiseration at Eug&eacute;nie, and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; cried Ezra, stepping forward, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to find the stolen  bank-notes first. I don&rsquo;t believe Keith Stewart committed such a base crime; he  is no murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  cried Eug&eacute;nie, springing to her feet; &ldquo;nor is he a thief. I will prove his  innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid that&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; said Naball reflectively; &ldquo;things look black against  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they do,&rdquo; said Villiers coarsely. &ldquo;Who knows he is innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  stepped in front of the ruffian, and raised her hand to the ceiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is One who knows he is innocent&mdash; God.&rdquo; </p>

    The Evidence Of A Bank-Note</b></h2>
  <p>ALL  this time while his friends were trying to prove his innocence, Keith was mewed  up in prison, having now been there a week. The disgrace of being arrested on such  a charge had aged him considerably, and his face had changed from a healthy  bronzed colour to a waxen paleness, while the circles under his eyes, and the  deep lines furrowing his brow, showed how deeply he was affected by the  position in which he found himself.</p>
  <p>He  steadily denied that he committed the crime imputed to him, and regarding the  knife found by Villiers, could only say that, after putting it in his pocket at  the club, he thought no more of it till next morning, when, having occasion to  use it, he found it had disappeared.</p>
  <p>Some  time after the interview with Kitty, when she told how Keith had stolen the  diamonds, Eug&eacute;nie was admitted to the presence of her unfortunate lover. She  had tried to see him before, but had always been refused; so when she did gain  her object at last, and they stood face to face, both were so overcome with  emotion that they could hardly speak. Keith held out his arms to her, with a  smile on his wan face, and with an inarticulate cry she flung herself on his breast,  weeping bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  cry, dear,&rdquo; he said soothingly, making her sit down on the bed. &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo;  and he quieted her as if she had been a little child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she said, drying her eyes; &ldquo;it seems so terrible to see you  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt,&rdquo; replied Keith quietly; &ldquo;but I know I am innocent, and that robs the  disgrace of a good deal of its sting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you are innocent,&rdquo; answered Eug&eacute;nie, &ldquo;but how to prove it; I thought  things would have turned out all right; but when we saw Kitty Marchurst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  said I had stolen her diamonds,&rdquo; finished Stewart, with a satirical laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  no doubt she fully believes it, and I thank her for having held her tongue so  long; but she was never more mistaken in her life. I did put Meg back to bed,  but I came down the stairs again, and did not leave the room by the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how is it the child saw you? Of course, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know everything. Yes. Naball told me all. Meg says she saw a man she thought  was me getting out of the window. I&rsquo;ve no doubt she did see a man, but not me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should she think it you?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie, puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simply  in this way. I put her to bed when she was half-asleep, and she knew I was in  the room with her. When I left, she fell asleep, and as her slumber was fitful,  as I am sure it was, seeing she came downstairs, she no doubt woke up at the  sound of the window being opened, and saw a man getting out. You know how an  hour&rsquo;s sleep passes as a moment when one wakes, so I&rsquo;ve no doubt Meg thought  she&rsquo;d just closed her eyes, and opened them again to see me getting out of the  window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie; &ldquo;but who could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe it was Villiers,&rdquo; observed Keith thoughtfully. &ldquo;He was about the house  on that night; he was in want of money, so no doubt when Caprice left him in  the supper-room, he walked upstairs to the bedroom, stole the diamonds, and  left by the window. He could easily do this, as every one was in the  drawing-room. Then Naball found that diamond clasp in his possession, or, at  least, in the possession of the Chinaman to whom he sold it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if he sold all those diamonds to old Lazarus, he must have got a good deal of  money for them. Why did he not leave the country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know. It seems all so mysterious,&rdquo; he said dismally. &ldquo;What do you  think should be done, Eug&eacute;nie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ll see Naball again, or some other detective, and sift the whole affair  to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Keith  looked at her with a pitying smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear child, that will cost a lot of money, and you have not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  gave a laugh. She was not going to tell him just yet, so she gave an evasive  answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got my salary,&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;Some of it was paid to me the other day. See!&rdquo;  And taking out her purse, she emptied it into his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  what a lot of money,&rdquo; said Keith smiling. &ldquo;A five-pound note, three sovereigns,  and two one-pound notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  makes exactly ten pounds,&rdquo; remarked Eug&eacute;nie, with a smile; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to  pay it all away to Naball, to get you out of this trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stewart  kissed her, and smoothed out the notes one after the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  no use, Eug&eacute;nie,&rdquo; he said, offering her the notes back; &ldquo;it will take more than  that to help me; besides, you forget I have five hundred pounds in the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said, turning away her face; &ldquo;five hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&rsquo;ll have it&mdash;if&mdash;if I die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned to him, and threw her arms round his neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my darling! my darling!&rdquo; she cried vehemently, &ldquo;why do you say such things? You  will not die. You will live to be happy and famous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Famous!&rdquo;  he said bitterly, &ldquo;no; I&rsquo;m not famous yet, but notorious enough. There&rsquo;s only  one chance of escape for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  trace those notes that were stolen&mdash;twenty five-pound notes like this,&rdquo; taking  up the five-pound note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you haven&rsquo;t got the numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  but, as I told Naball, that boy wrote something on the back of one of them.&rdquo;  Here Keith turned over the five-pound note; and then, giving a cry of surprise,  sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Eugeuie, look, look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  snatched the note from him, and there on the back were traced in ink the words,  &ldquo;Back Flat-iron.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the notes,&rdquo; said Keith hoarsely. &ldquo;One of the notes stolen on that night by  the person who murdered Jacob Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  had also risen to her feet and her face wore a look of horror. She looked at  her lover, and he looked back again, with the same name in their thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kitty  Marchurst!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God!&rdquo; said Stewart, moisteniug his dry lips with his tongue, &ldquo;can she be  guilty, after all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie determinedly, &ldquo;though Naball says he thinks she  did it. But I certainly got this note from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may have received it from some one else,&rdquo; cried Keith eagerly. &ldquo;God knows, I  don&rsquo;t want to die myself, but to put the rope round the neck of that unhappy  woman&mdash;horrible,&rdquo; and he covered his face with his hands.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  put on her gloves, and then touched his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going,&rdquo; she said in a quiet voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo;  he repeated, springing to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  to see Naball, and show him the note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Kitty Marchurst?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  trouble about her,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, a trifle coldly. &ldquo;She is all right, and I&rsquo;ve  no doubt can explain where she got this note. Wherever it was, you can depend  it was not from the dead man&rsquo;s safe. Good-bye, Keith,&rdquo; kissing him. &ldquo;This note  gives us the clue, and before many days are over you will be free, and the  murderer of Jacob Lazarus will be in this cell.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    On The Track</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN  Eug&eacute;nie left the prison, she went straight to Naball&rsquo;s office, and finding him  in, told all about the wonderful discovery of the veritable five-pound note  endorsed in Isaiah&rsquo;s writing. To say that Naball was astonished would be a mild  way to state his feelings on receipt of this intelligence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an uncommon piece of luck,&rdquo; he said, looking at the note; &ldquo;we might have  searched for a twelve-month, and never come across this piece of evidence. I  think we&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of things this time. You got it from Kitty  Marchurst?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I got it yesterday in payment of my salary&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  whistled softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things  look uncommon black against that young woman,&rdquo; he observed thoughtfully. &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t half believe that story of hers about Stewart&rsquo;s stealing the diamonds,  and now this note turning up in her possession&mdash;humph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s guilty?&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, clasping her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; replied Naball savagely, for the difficulties of this case  were beginning to irritate him. &ldquo;I only say things look black against  Caprice&mdash;she&rsquo;s as deep as a well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do now?&rdquo; asked Miss Rainsford in a trembling voice, as she  rose to go.</p>
  <p>The  detective placed his hat jauntily on one side of his head, drew on his gloves,  then taking his cane, walked to the door of the office, which he held open for Eug&eacute;nie  to pass through.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do now?&rdquo; she repeated when they were standing in the street,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going down to Toorak,&rdquo; said Naball quietly, &ldquo;to trace this note, beginning with  Kitty Marchurst as the last holder of it; she&rsquo;ll tell lies, but whether she  does or not, I&rsquo;ll get to the bottom of this affair. Good-day, Miss Rainsford,&rdquo;  and taking off his hat with a flourish, be left her abruptly, and strolled  leisurely down the street.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  watched him with eager eyes until he was out of sight, and then turned round to  walk home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear! my dear!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;if I can only save you from this terrible  danger&mdash;but not at the cost of that poor woman&rsquo;s life&mdash;oh, not that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective, on his way down to Toorak, went over the case in his own mind, in  order to see against whom the evidence was strongest. At last, after  considerable cogitation, he came to the conclusion that, after all, Villiers  must be the guilty man, and that Kitty knew more about the crime than she chose  to tell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t get over Villiers having had that diamond crescent.&rdquo; he thought, looking  out of the carriage windows. &ldquo;She denied it was hers, and then Fenton told me  he gave it to her. I wonder if he had anything to do with the affair&mdash;humph!&mdash;not  likely. If she thought it was him, she&rsquo;d tell at once. Perhaps she really  thinks Stewart stole the diamonds. Pish! I don&rsquo;t believe it. She&rsquo;s had a finger  in the pie, whoever did it, and this murder is the outcome of the robbery.  Well, I&rsquo;ll see if she can account for her possession of this five-pound  note&mdash;that&rsquo;s the main thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  Marchurst was at home, and sent a message to the detective that she would see  him in a few minutes, so Naball walked up and down the long drawing-room with  some impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she&rsquo;ll only tell the truth,&rdquo; he muttered restlessly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m getting to doubt  her, so that I can&rsquo;t be sure. There&rsquo;s one thing, Keith Stewart&rsquo;s fate rests  entirely with her now, so if he saved her child&rsquo;s life, as she says he did,  this is the time to prove her gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment the door opened, and Caprice entered. She looked pale and weary, for  the trials of the last few months had not been endured without leaving some  mark of their passage. Naball did not know whether this haggard-looking woman  was guilty or innocent, but he could not help pitying her, so worn-out did she  seem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not well,&rdquo; he said when she seated herself.</p>
  <p>Kitty  sighed wearily, and pushed the loose hair off her forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she replied listlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting worn-out over this trouble. It&rsquo;s no good  my telling you anything, because you don&rsquo;t believe me. What is the matter now?  Have you got further proof of my guilt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Naball, coolly producing the five-pound note; &ldquo;unless you  call this proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  five-pound note,&rdquo; she said contemptuously. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It  is a five-pound note,&rdquo; explained Naball smoothly; &ldquo;but not an ordinary one&mdash;in  fact, it is one of the notes stolen from Lazarus&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  a very curious thing. One of the notes placed in the safe on the night of&rsquo; the  murder was endorsed by the office-boy with the words &lsquo;Back Flat-iron,&rsquo; and  strange to say the endorsed note has turned up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  Now, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand that you have secured an excellent piece of evidence, nothing more.  Where did you get the note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Miss Rainsford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  Miss Rainsford!&rdquo; repeated Kitty in surprise; &ldquo;but you surely don&rsquo;t suspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interposed the detective; &ldquo;because she was able to tell me where she  got the note from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I presume she got it from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Naball, rather surprised at this cool admission. &ldquo;She received it  yesterday from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  then, you think I&rsquo;m guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if you can tell me where you got the note from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  I can&mdash;from Mortimer&mdash;paid to me the day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  salary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly,&rdquo; answered Kitty; &ldquo;if it had been, you&rsquo;d never be able to trace the  note further back. No; I was at the theatre in the morning, and found myself  short of money, so I asked Mortimer for some. He gave me that five-pound note,  and, as he took it from his waistcoat pocket, I&rsquo;ve no doubt he&rsquo;ll be able to  recollect from whom he received it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Mortimer doesn&rsquo;t carry fivers in his waistcoat pocket generally,&rdquo; said Caprice  impatiently, &ldquo;so he must have put that note there for some special reason. You&rsquo;d  better go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Naball, and arose to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t think me guilty?&rdquo; asked Kitty, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my word, I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; said the detective dismally. &ldquo;The whole  case seems mixed up. I&rsquo;ll tell you when I find the man who can&rsquo;t account for  the possession of this fiver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  smiled, and then Naball took his leave, going straight from Toorak to the  Bon-Bon Theatre, where he found Mortimer in his sanctum, up to the ears in  business, as usual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Naball,&rdquo; said the manager, looking up sharply, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up? Look sharp, I&rsquo;m  awfully busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only want to know where you got this?&rdquo; asked Naball, giving him the five-pound  note.</p>
  <p>Mortimer  took it up, and looked perplexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  the deuce should I know; I get so many. Why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing. I just want to trace the note. Caprice said you gave it to her the day  before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  did I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You took it from your waistcoat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; to be sure, she wanted some money. Yes; I kept it apart because it was  made money&mdash;won it off Malton at euchre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Malton!&rdquo;  repeated Naball in amazement; &ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  quite. You know I&rsquo;m generally unlucky at cards, and this is about the first  fiver I&rsquo;ve made, so I kept it just to bring me luck; but Caprice wanted money,  so I handed over my luck to her. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear, no,&rdquo; replied Naball; &ldquo;not the slightest&mdash;only some professional business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I shouldn&rsquo;t like to get any poor devil into a row,&rdquo; said Mortimer. &ldquo;Now, be off  with you, I&rsquo;m busy. Good-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day,  good-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  departed, curiously perplexed in his feelings. He had never thought of Malton  in the light of a possible criminal, and yet it was so very strange that this  note should have been traced back to him. Then he remembered the conversation  he had overheard between Mrs Malton and Kitty concerning the embezzlement, when  Kitty denied that she had paid the money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Jove!&rdquo; said Naball, a sudden thought striking him, &ldquo;he was present at that  supper, and was in a regular hole for want of money. I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit  surprised if he stole those diamonds to replace the money, and his wife&rsquo;s  thanking Caprice was all a blind, and then this note &mdash; humph! &mdash; things look  rather fishy, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he arrived at the Never-say-die Insurance Company Office, he sent in his card  to the assistant manager, and in a few minutes was shown into Malton&rsquo;s room,  where that individual received him with visible uneasiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Naball, and what brings you here?&rdquo; he asked, watching the detective&rsquo;s face  stealthily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  a little business, in which I want your help,&rdquo; said Naball, taking the note out  of his pocket-book. &ldquo;Can you tell me where you got that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton&rsquo;s  pink-and-white complexion grew a little pale, but he laughed in a forced manner  as he glanced at the note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got  this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. Was it ever in my possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was,&rdquo; asserted Naball. &ldquo;You gave it to Mortimer the day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I remember now,&rdquo; said Malton quickly. &ldquo;He won it off me at cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  Where did you get the note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton  shifted uueasily in his seat, and his nether lip twitched uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I can hardly remember,&rdquo; he murmured, pushing back his chair.</p>
  <p>Naball&rsquo;s  suspicions were now rapidly ripening to certainties. If Malton were innocent,  why these signs of agitation? He wriggled and twisted about like an eel, yet  never once met the keen eye of the detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better remember,&rdquo; said Naball mercilessly, &ldquo;or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Malton, trying to appear composed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  explained Naball, in a low voice, &ldquo;that note is one of those stolen by the man  who murdered Jacob Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton,  with a smothered exclamation, started to his feet, and then, shaking in every  limb, sat down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s absurd. It can&rsquo;t be&mdash;I tell you, it can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but it can be, and it is. I tell you, the note is endorsed &lsquo;Back Flat-iron,&rsquo;  which was done by the office-boy a few moments before the notes were put in the  safe by Stewart. They were gone after the murder, so there is no doubt they  were taken by the man who committed the crime. I got this note from Miss Rainsford,  who received it from Caprice; she, in her turn, got it from Mortimer, and he  has referred us to you. Now, where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton  drummed nervously on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t  tell you,&rdquo; he said in a tremulous voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what, sir,&rdquo; said Naball coolly, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t tell, it means trouble  for you and the other man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  other man?&rdquo; asked Malton shakily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man you got this note from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton  thought for a moment, and then apparently made up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw I was taken aback?&rdquo; he asked Naball curiously.</p>
  <p>The  detective nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  because I&rsquo;m sorry for what I have to tell you&mdash;the man I got the note from was  Ezra Lazarus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  jumped to his feet with a cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dead man&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the dead man&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; replied Malton slowly.</p>
  <p>Naball  stood for a few minutes, then putting the note in his pocket-book, once more  took up his hat, and moved to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going?&rdquo; asked Malton, rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see Mr Ezra Lazarus,&rdquo; said Naball, pausing a moment. &ldquo;In the meantime, till I  have certain proof of his guilt, you hold your tongue.&rdquo; And he walked out,  leaving Malton standing at his desk as if turned into stone.</p>
  <p>Naball,  on his way to the newspaper office, rapidly ran over in his own mind all the  details of the case against Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  father wouldn&rsquo;t give him any money, and he wanted to get married to that girl;  father and son had a quarrel on the day preceding the murder; he was at the  Bon-Bon on that night, and took Caprice downstairs to her carriage; she gave  him Stewart&rsquo;s coat to take back to him again; in that coat was the knife found  by Villiers under the window; she left the theatre long before Stewart, &mdash; where  did he go? to his office, or&mdash;good heavens! if it should turn out to be true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  received him, looking rather knocked up, but his face, though pale, was quite  placid, and Naball wondered how a man guilty of such a terrible crime as  parricide could be so calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look tired,&rdquo; he said, taking a seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am tired,&rdquo; admitted Ezra wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy with my father&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  thought Naball; &ldquo;counting his gains, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any  fresh development of the case?&rdquo; asked Ezra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Naball solemnly. &ldquo;I received this note to-day, and traced it back to  Malton; he says it was given to him by you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ezra  examined the note with great interest, and on turning it over saw the fatal  words endorsed. He looked up quickly to Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is one of the notes that were stolen?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Naball; &ldquo;and Malton said it was given to him by you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  me!&rdquo; repeated Ezra in amazement. &ldquo;How on earth could I come across this note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I want to find out,&rdquo; said Naball. Ezra looked at him for a moment, then  the whole situation seemed to burst on him, and with a stifled groan the  unhappy young man fell back into his chair, burying his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suspect me of killing my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are innocent, you can explain where you got the note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot&mdash;I cannot,&rdquo; cried Ezra feverishly. &ldquo;I had to pay some money to Malton,  and did so last week. There were some five-pound notes among that money, but I  cannot tell where this particular one came from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you get the money?&rdquo; asked Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the Hibernian Bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but if you had to pay Malton money, why did you not do so by cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I wanted some money myself, and did not care about drawing two cheques, so I  drew one, covering what I owed to him and a little over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  Naball thought a moment. &ldquo;You are sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  it&rsquo;s the only way I can account for having the note. Whoever killed my father,  must have paid it into the bank, and it came round to me by some fatality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you on the night of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the Bon-Bon Theatre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  this office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can prove an <i>alibi</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid I can&rsquo;t. I was all alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mr Lazarus,&rdquo; said Naball in a kind tone, &ldquo;I must say things look black  against you; but I&rsquo;m not satisfied yet about the real criminal. To-day is  Saturday, so I&rsquo;ll go to the bank the first thing on Monday, and find out what I  can. There&rsquo;s so many suspected of this business, that one more or less don&rsquo;t  matter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Ezra  groaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m guilty?&rdquo; he asked imploringly.</p>
  <p>Naball  looked keenly at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I believe you innocent,&rdquo; he replied abruptly. </p>

    Meg Proves Useful</b></h2>
  <p>THE  next day was Sunday, and Caprice, quite worn-out with the excitement of the  week and the strain of the performances of &ldquo;Faust Upset,&rdquo; was lying in bed. The  burlesque had become a great success, but the papers, with their usual kindly  generosity towards authors, declared that it was due not so much to the  intrinsic merit of the work, as to the wonderfully clever acting of Caprice.  Last night, however, she had acted badly, going through her part with  mechanical precision, but without that dash which usually characterised her  performance. The worry of this murder case, anxiety for the future of her  child, and pity for the unfortunate young man now in prison, had all wrought on  her nerves, so that she felt overcome with extreme lassitude, and lay supinely  in bed, with half-closed eyes, incapable of the slightest exertion.</p>
  <p>From  this state of tranquillity she was aroused by the entrance of Eug&eacute;nie, who was  also looking pale and worn. She had learned all about the tracing of the  five-pound note to Ezra, and had now come to tell Kitty about it.</p>
  <p>The  room was in a kind of semi-darkness, as all the blinds had been pulled down to  keep out the dazzling sunlight, and the atmosphere was permeated by the smell  of some pungent scent which Kitty had been using to bathe her aching head. Eug&eacute;nie  came straight to the bed, and bent over it, on which Kitty opened her eyes and  smiled faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  is it you, Miss Rainsford?&rdquo; she said drowsily. &ldquo;I did not expect you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied Eug&eacute;nie. &ldquo;I came to tell you all about that five-pound note; but I&rsquo;m  sorry to find you so ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  worn-out,&rdquo; said Kitty fretfully. &ldquo;All the worry and trouble of my earlier years  are beginning to tell on me, and the anxiety of this case is the climax. I  believe I&rsquo;ll die soon, and I don&rsquo;t much care, for I have your promise about the  child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have!&mdash;my solemn promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. I don&rsquo;t mind when I die. My life has been a very unhappy one. I&rsquo;ve had  more than my share of sorrow, and now I would like to go to sleep, and slumber  on&mdash;on for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  finished the sentence in a sleepy tone, then suddenly recollecting why Eug&eacute;nie  had come down, she opened her eyes wide, and spoke briskly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what about this five-pound note? To whom did it originally belong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  better go through the whole history,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie slowly. &ldquo;I received it from  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  interrupted Caprice, raising herself on her elbow; &ldquo;and I got it from Mortimer.  Who gave it to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr  Malton, for a gambling debt,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Malton,&rdquo;  repeated Kitty vivaciously. &ldquo;Why, is he&mdash;did they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suspect  him of the murder. No; because he says he got the note from Ezra Lazarus, and  he cannot tell from whom he received it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  was wide awake by this time, and sitting up in bed, pushed the fair curls off  her forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  my dear,&rdquo; she said rapidly, &ldquo;surely they don&rsquo;t suspect that poor young man of  murdering his father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly suspect him,&rdquo; observed Eug&eacute;nie; &ldquo;but, you see, Mr Lazarus cannot  account for the possession of that particular note, so that makes things look  bad against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  see why,&rdquo; said Caprice impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t account for every  individual five-pound note I receive&mdash;it&rsquo;s absurd;&mdash;is that all the case they  have against him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so; but Mr Naball says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Says!&rdquo;  interrupted Kitty impatiently; &ldquo;Naball&rsquo;s a fool. I often heard what a clever  detective he was, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t see it. He&rsquo;s mismanaged the whole of  this case shamefully. Why he suspects every one all round on the slightest  suspicion: first he thought it was me, because I was at Lazarus&rsquo;s place on that  night; then he swore it was Villiers, because he found the knife Meg gave Mr  Stewart; then poor Mr Stewart is arrested simply because he cannot prove an  alibi. I daresay, when he found Malton had the note, he suspected him, and now,  I&rsquo;ll be bound, he has firmly settled in his own mind that Ezra Lazarus killed  his own father&mdash; pish! My dear, I tell you again Naball&rsquo;s a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be,&rdquo; observed the other woman bitterly; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s a fool on whose folly  Keith&rsquo;s life depends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; said Caprice cheerfully; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find some way to save him yet.  The only evidence against him is that knife, and I don&rsquo;t believe it was in his  possession at the Bon-Bon Theatre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  no one could have taken it out of his overcoat pocket there. I took the coat  downstairs by mistake, but I&rsquo;m sure I never abstracted the knife. Ezra Lazarus  took it back, and I&rsquo;ll swear, in spite of Mr Naball, he didn&rsquo;t take it. It&rsquo;s  not likely Mortimer would go fiddling in another man&rsquo;s pockets, so I believe  the knife was taken from the coat pocket, without his knowledge, at the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who took it, and how?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie, with great interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; replied Kitty, with a shrug, &ldquo;how do I know. Perhaps, after receiving  back the knife from Fenton, and putting it in his pocket, he hung his coat up  again; in that case, anyone who saw him put the knife away could have stolen  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who would do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what our clever Naball ought to find out,&rdquo; said Caprice, with a disdainful  smile, &ldquo;only he&rsquo;s such an idiot. I tell you whom I suspect&mdash; mind you, it&rsquo;s only  suspicion&mdash;and yet appearances are quite as black against him as any one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Malton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Malton!&rdquo;  repeated Eug&eacute;nie, starting up. &ldquo;None other,&rdquo; said Kitty coolly. &ldquo;He was at the  club, and I know was hard up for money. His wife came to me one day, and told  me he had embezzled a lot of money at his office. Then, after the crime, she  came to me, and thanked me for paying it. I never did so. Fenton said he did,  but I doubt it, as there isn&rsquo;t much of the philanthropist about him, so the  only one who could have replaced the money was Malton himself. How? Well,  easily enough. He was at the club&mdash; saw Keith&rsquo;s knife, and, knowing he was  Lazarus&rsquo;s clerk, the idea flashed across his mind of murdering the old man with  the knife, and dropping it about, so as to throw suspicion on Stewart. So, by  some means, I don&rsquo;t know how, he obtains the knife before Stewart leaves the  club, commits the crime, gets the money, circulates the notes, and when taxed  with the possession of a marked one, says he got it from Ezra Lazarus&mdash;very  weak, my dear, very weak indeed. Ezra says he paid him some money, so naturally  doesn&rsquo;t know each individual note; so such a thing favours Mr Malton&rsquo;s little  plan. So there you are, my dear. I&rsquo;ve made up a complete case against Malton,  and quite as feasible as any of Naball&rsquo;s theories. Upon my word,&rdquo; said Kitty  gaily, &ldquo;I ought to have been a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  was walking to and fro hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this is so, he ought to be arrested,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  go and tell Naball, my dear,&rdquo; said Kitty in a mocking voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll arrest any  one on suspicion. I wonder half the population of Melbourne aren&rsquo;t in jail,  charged with the murder. Oh, Naball&rsquo;s a brilliant man! He says the man who committed  the murder stole my diamonds &mdash;pish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you say Keith stole them,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie reproachfully, &ldquo;therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore  the lesser crime includes the greater,&rdquo; finished Kitty coolly. &ldquo;No, my dear, I  don&rsquo;t believe he is a murderer; but as to the diamonds, what am I to think  after what Meg told me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg!  Meg!&rdquo; said that young person, dancing into the room, holding a disreputable  doll in her arms, &ldquo;mumsey want Meg?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Kitty, as Meg came to the bedside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  up here, dear, and tell mumsey how you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg  is quite well, and so is Meg&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; holding out the doll for Kitty to  kiss; &ldquo;but, mumsey, why is the lady so sad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie,  who had remained silent since Kitty&rsquo;s speech, now came forward and kissed the  child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sad, dear,&rdquo; she said quietly, taking her seat by the bed, &ldquo;only I want Meg  to tell me something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fairy tale?&rdquo; she asked sedately.</p>
  <p>Kitty  laughed, though she looked anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my dear, not a fairy tale,&rdquo; she said, smoothing the child&rsquo;s hair; &ldquo;mumsey wants  you to tell the story of the man who got out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  Mr Keith,&rdquo; said Meg at once.</p>
  <p>Kitty  glanced at Eug&eacute;nie, who sat with bowed head, gazing steadfastly at her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; she observed with a sigh, &ldquo;the child says it was Mr Keith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Rainsford re-echoed the sigh, then looked at Meg.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg,  dear,&rdquo; she said in her soft, persuasive voice, &ldquo;come here, dear, and sit on my  knee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meg,  nothing loth, scrambled down off the bed, and soon established herself on Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s  lap, where she sat shaking her auburn curls. Kitty glanced affectionately at  the serious little face, and picked up her doll, which was lying on the  counterpane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Meg,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;you tell Miss Rainsford the story of the man and the  window. I&rsquo;ll play with this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg&rsquo;s  daughter,&rdquo; observed Meg reprovingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Meg&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; repeated Kitty with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  Meg,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie, smoothing the child&rsquo;s hair, &ldquo;tell me all about the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was my Mr Keith, you know,&rdquo; began Meg, resting her cheek against Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s breast.  &ldquo;He took me upstairs&mdash;&rsquo;cause I was so sleepy&mdash;an&rsquo; he put me to bed, an&rsquo; then I  sleeped right off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how long did you sleep, dear?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a minute,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;just a minute; then I didn&rsquo;t feel sleepy, and opened my  eyes wide&mdash; quite wide&mdash;as wide as this,&rdquo; lifting up her face in confirmation, &ldquo;and  Mr Keith, he was getting out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know it was Mr Keith!&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie quickly,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause  he put me in bed,&rdquo; said Meg wisely, &ldquo;and he was there all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t speak to you when he was near the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he got out, and tumbled. I laughed when he tumbled,&rdquo; finished Meg triumphantly;  &ldquo;then I sleeped again, right off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  put the girl down off her knee, and turned to Kitty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe Keith did put the child to bed,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;but I think she  must have slept for some time, and that the man she saw getting out of the  window was some one else; of course, being awakened by the noise, she would  only think she had slept a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  minute, a minute,&rdquo; repeated Meg, who had climbed back on to the bed, and was  jumping the doll up and down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  who could the second man have been?&rdquo; asked Kitty, perplexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know Naball&rsquo;s theory that the man who stole the diamonds committed the murder,&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie. &ldquo;You think Malton is guilty of the murder, why not of the robbery  also? He was present at the supper-party, and knew where the jewels were kept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  drew her brows together and was about to speak, when Meg held up her doll for  inspection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at the locket,&rdquo; she said triumphantly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like Bliggings&rsquo;s locket&mdash;all gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  smiled, and touched the so-called locket, which was in reality part of a gold  sleeve-link, and was tied round the neck of the doll with a bit of cotton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  gave you this?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bliggings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Meg found it herself, here, after the man had got out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  gave a cry, and started up, but Kitty in a moment had seized the doll, and  wrenched off the gold link which Meg called the locket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did you find this, Meg?&rdquo; she asked the child in a tone of suppressed  excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  the man went out of the window,&rdquo; said Meg proudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the dark?&rdquo; asked her mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  when Meg was dressed, and the sun was shining,&rdquo; said Meg, trying to get back  the locket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, dear,&rdquo; said Kitty, pushing the child away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Rainsford, do you know what this link means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  half guess,&rdquo; faltered Eug&eacute;nie, clasping her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you guess right,&rdquo; cried Kitty, raising herself on her elbow. &ldquo;It means that the  man who stole the jewels dropped this link, and I know who he is, because I  gave it to him myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keith?&rdquo;  said Eug&eacute;nie faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keith!&rdquo;  repeated Caprice in a tone of scorn. &ldquo;No; not Keith, whom I have suspected  wrongfully all these months, but my very good friend, Hiram J. Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fenton!&rdquo;  echoed Eug&eacute;nie in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  he must have committed the crime,&rdquo; said Kitty in anger, grinding her teeth. &ldquo;The  coward, he knew I suspected Keith, and let another man bear the stigma of his  crime. I spared Keith when I thought him guilty, because he saved my child&rsquo;s  life; but I&rsquo;ll not spare Fenton now I know he is a thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will you do?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will I do!&rdquo; cried Caprice, with a devilish light shining in her beautiful eyes.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put him in prison&mdash;ring the bell for pen, ink, and paper&mdash; I&rsquo;ll write him  to come down here to-night to see me; and when he comes, I&rsquo;ll have Naball  waiting to arrest him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Keith?&rdquo; faltered Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  for Keith,&rdquo; said Caprice, throwing herself back in the bed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll soon  be free, for it&rsquo;s my belief that Fenton stole the diamonds, but was too  cowardly to commit a murder. No; he did not do it himself, but he got some one  else to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that some one?&rdquo; cried Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Evan Malton,&rdquo; said Caprice solemnly. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
    Malton Makes A Discovery</b></h2>
  <p>EVAN  MALTON had a house in Carlton, not a very fashionable locality certainly, but  the residence of the assistant manager was a comfortable one. His wife and  child were invariably to be found at home, but Malton himself was always away&mdash;  either at his club, the theatre, or at some dance. He was one of those weak men  who can deny themselves nothing, and kept his wife and child stinted for money,  while he spent his income on himself. But with such tastes as he possessed, his  income did not go very far, so in a moment of weakness he embezzled money in  order to gratify his desires.</p>
  <p>When  he told his wife what he had done, the news came like a thunder-clap on her.  She knew her husband was weak, pleasure-loving and idle, but she never dreamt  he could be a criminal. With the desire of a woman to find excuses for the  conduct of a man she loved, Mrs Malton thought that his crime was due to the  evil influence of Kitty Marchurst; hence her visit and appeal to the actress.  It seemed to have been successful, for the money had been replaced, though  Kitty denied having paid it, and Mrs Malton breathed freely.</p>
  <p>Her  husband loved her in a kind of a way; he did not mind being unfaithful himself,  but he would have been bitterly angered had he found her following his example.  This type of husband is not uncommon; he likes to be a butterfly abroad, to  lead a man-of-the-world existence, neglecting his home; yet he always expects  on his return to find a hearty welcome and a loving wife.</p>
  <p>Of  course, as Mrs Malton was a handsome woman, with a neglectful husband, the  inevitable event happened, and Fenton, the bosom friend of the husband, fell in  love with the solitary wife. She repelled his advances proudly, as she really  loved her husband; but the effect of long months of neglect were beginning to  tell on her, and she asked herself bitterly if it was worth while for her to  remain faithful to a husband who neglected her.</p>
  <p>On  the Sunday afternoon following the interview Malton had with Naball, she sat  down in her drawing-room, idly watching the child playing at her feet. Malton  had come home in a fearful temper the night before, and had been in bed all  Sunday. Dinner had been early, and she had left him in the dining-room, with a  scowling face, evidently drinking more than was good for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the use of trying to make his life happy?&rdquo; she said to herself, with a  sneer. &ldquo;He cares no more for me than he does for the child. If I were to allow  his dearest friend to betray me, I don&rsquo;t believe he would care a fig about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  she was thus talking, the door opened, and her husband came into the room, with  a sullen look on his face. He was, as she saw, in a temper, and ready for a  domestic battle; but, determined not to give him a chance, she sat in her chair  in silent disdain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, throwing himself on the sofa, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you got a word to say for  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I say?&rdquo; she replied listlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything!  Don&rsquo;t sit there like a cursed sphynx. How do you expect a man to come home when  he finds things so disagreeable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked at him scornfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  find things disagreeable,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;You, who have neglected me ever  since our marriage; who have passed your time with actresses and betting men;  you, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  to the devil,&rdquo; said Malton sulkily, cutting short her catalogue of his vices. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want you to preach. I&rsquo;ll go where I like, and do what I like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you deny me the right to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean!&rdquo;  she cried, rising to her feet; &ldquo;mean that I&rsquo;m tired of this sordid way of  living. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing you at the beck and call of every woman except your  wife. I have tried to do my duty by you and the child, yet you neglect me for  others. You squander your honestly earned money, and then embezzle thousands of  pounds. I tell you, I&rsquo;m sick of this life, Evan Malton; and if you don&rsquo;t take  care, I&rsquo;ll make a change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  listened in amazement to this tirade coming from his meek wife, then, with a  coarse laugh, flung himself back on the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  make a change!&rdquo; he said, with a sneer. &ldquo;You&mdash;I suppose that means bolting with  another man&mdash;you do, my lady, and I&rsquo;ll kill you and your lover as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  lover, as you call him, could break your neck easily,&rdquo; she said contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have a lover!&rdquo; he cried, starting to his feet in a transport of fury. &ldquo;You  tell me that &mdash;you a wife and a mother&mdash;in the presence of our child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word, she touched the bell, and a maid-servant appeared. Mrs Malton pointed  to the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  her away,&rdquo; she said coldly, and when the door closed again, she turned once  more to her husband. &ldquo;Now that the child is away,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;I do tell  you I have a would-be lover. Stay,&rdquo; she cried, holding up her hand, &ldquo;I said a  would-be lover. Had I been as careless of your honour as you have been of mine,  I would not now be living with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evan  Malton listened in dogged silence, and then burst out into a torrent of words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I knew it would be so&mdash;curse you! What woman was ever satisfied with a husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and such a husband as you have been,&rdquo; she said sarcastically.</p>
  <p>He  stepped forward, with an oath, to strike her, then restraining himself by an  effort, said in a harsh voice,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs  Malton walked over to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and taking from thence a  bundle of letters, flung them on the floor before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find all about him there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malton  bent down, picked up the letters, and staggered back, with a cry, as he  recognised the writing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God! Fenton!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  she said coolly. &ldquo;Your dear friend Fenton, who came to me with words of love on  his lips, and lies in his heart, to get me to elope with him&mdash;in the last  letter, you see, he asked me to go with him to Valparaiso.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  did he?&rdquo; muttered Malton vindictively; &ldquo;and you were going, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had been going,&rdquo; she replied, with grave scorn, &ldquo;I would not now be here, for  he leaves for Valparaiso to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I presume he&rsquo;s followed your example, and embezzled money. At all events, I  refused his offer, and left him as I now leave you, Evan Malton, with the hope  that this discovery may teach you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, as she moved towards the door.</p>
  <p>She  turned with a cold smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to our child; and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I,&rdquo; he said vindictively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Hiram Fenton&rsquo;s house, to give him back  those letters. He&rsquo;ll go to Valparaiso will he? No, he won&rsquo;t. To-night, the  police shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  what?&rdquo; his wife cried in sudden terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about the diamond robbery and the Russell Street murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shrank back from him with a cry; but he came straight to the door, and taking  her by the arm, flung her brutally on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lie there,&rdquo; he hissed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with him first, and afterwards with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  heard the door close, and knew that he had left the house: then, gathering  herself up slowly and painfully, she went to the chamber of her child, and sank  on her knees beside the cot.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Malton, with his brain on fire, his heart beating with jealous rage, and the  bundle of letters in his breast-pocket, was rapidly walking down the hill,  intending to go to Fenton&rsquo;s rooms and tax him with his treachery. It was partly  on this account that he wished to see him; but there was also a more serious  cause, for in the event of Fenton bolting, as he intended to do, things would  be very awkward for his assistant manager.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  him!&rdquo; muttered Malton as he hailed a hansom, and told the man to drive to East  Melbourne. &ldquo;Does he think I&rsquo;m such a fool as to let him go now? No, no, my boy;  we&rsquo;ve floated together for a good time, and, by Jove! we&rsquo;ll sink together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like  all weak men, he was unable to restrain his temper, and was now working himself  up into a state of fury which boded ill for the peace of Mr Fenton. Fast as the  cab was rolling along, it seemed hours to the impatient man, and it was with a  cry of joy that he jumped out at Fenton&rsquo;s door, keeping the hansom waiting in  case he should find the American absent.</p>
  <p>The  woman who opened the door told him that Mr Fenton had gone out about  half-an-hour ago, with a black bag in his hand, and had told her he was going  to see some friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  the man,&rdquo; groaned Malton, who saw what this meant at once, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s off; I must  follow&mdash;but where? I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;d leave his address in his room, but I&rsquo;ll  see if I can find anything there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I give him any message, sir?&rdquo; asked the woman, who was still holding the door  open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  that is, I&rsquo;ll write him a note; show me up to his sitting-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; and in a few minutes Malton found himself alone in the room so lately  occupied by his enemy. He sat down at the writing-table till the woman closed  the door, then springing to his feet, began to examine the desk with feverish  energy to see if Mr Fenton had left any trace as to his whereabouts.</p>
  <p>There  was a newspaper lying on a small table near, and Malton, seizing this, looked  at the shipping announcements to see by what boat Fenton intended to go to  South America.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  certain to go there,&rdquo; he said, as he ran his finger eagerly down the column, &ldquo;or  he wouldn&rsquo;t have told my wife. Here, oh, here it is&mdash;The &lsquo;Don Pedro,&rsquo; for  Valparaiso, at eight, Monday morning. He&rsquo;s going by that boat, now,&rdquo; he went  on, putting down the paper, and pulling out his watch; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about six o&rsquo;clock&mdash;why  did he leave tonight, eh? I suppose he means to go on board, so as to avoid  suspicion by going so early in the morning. He can&rsquo;t have gone back to see my  wife, or she would have told me, for I&rsquo;ll swear she&rsquo;s true. Confound him, where  can he have gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned over the papers on the desk in feverish eagerness, as if he expected to  find an address left for him, when suddenly, slipped in between the sheets of  the blotting-pad, he found a note in Caprice&rsquo;s handwriting asking Fenton to  come down to Toorak on that night. Melton struck a blow on the desk with his  fist when he read this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  gone there, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; he cried, putting the letter in his pocket. &ldquo;It was  only because Caprice laughed at him that he made love to my wife. Now she&rsquo;s  whistled him back, he&rsquo;ll try and get her to go off with him to Valparaiso. Ah,  Hiram Fenton, you&rsquo;re not off yet, and never will be&mdash;sink or swim together, my  boy&mdash;sink or swim together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  called the woman, gave her a short note for Fenton, in order to avert  suspicion, then getting into the cab once more, told the man to drive to Toorak  as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I don&rsquo;t find you there, my friend,&rdquo; he muttered angrily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go straight down  to the &lsquo;Don Pedro&rsquo; at Sandridge. You won&rsquo;t escape me &mdash; sink or swim together,  sink or swim together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  evening sky was overcast with gloomy clouds, between the rifts of which could  be seen the sharp, clear light of the sky, and then it began to rain, a  tropical downpour which flooded the streets and turned the gutters to miniature  torrents; a vivid flash of lightning flare in the sky, and the white face of  the man in the hansom could be seen for a moment; then sounded a deep roll of  thunder, as if warning Hiram Fenton that his friend and victim was on his  track. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
    Light At Last</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was certainly a remarkable thing that when Kitty had prepared her trap for  Fenton just on the eve of his going away, by having Naball in hiding to arrest  him, that Malton, the only man who could effectually accuse the American,  should also have come down to Toorak in the nick of time. But, then,  coincidences do happen in real life as well as in novels; and had Kitty  carefully constructed the whole scene with an eye to dramatic effect, it could  hardly have turned out better.</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  sat with the actress in the drawing room, waiting for the arrival of Fenton,  and talking to Naball, who was seated near them. The detective had listened to  all with the keenest interest, but, much to Kitty&rsquo;s disgust, seemed doubtful of  the American&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were quick enough in accusing other people,&rdquo; she said angrily, &ldquo;myself among  the number, and now, when I show you plain proof, you disbelieve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think the proof is strong enough, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied Naball drily. &ldquo;We  have only the word of a child that she picked up the link in the bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg  never tells falsehoods,&rdquo; interposed Eug&eacute;nie quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay not,&rdquo; he replied coolly. &ldquo;However, Fenton may have lost this link  before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Caprice decisively. &ldquo;He had the links on when he was at  supper. I saw them, and I ought to know, because I gave them to him myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should Fenton steal your diamonds? He&rsquo;s got lots of money,&rdquo; argued Naball,  who was rather annoyed at Kitty finding out more than he had.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know why he should,&rdquo; retorted the actress; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my business or yours  to discover motives&mdash;all I know is, he did it, and I&rsquo;m going to have him  arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he&rsquo;ll be suspicious, and won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, he will. He thinks I believe Stewart to be the thief, and as to coming, I  can whistle him back at any moment. Hark!&rdquo; as a ring came at the door. &ldquo;There  he is; get behind that screen. Miss Rainsford, you go into the next room till I  call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  promptly did as he was told, so did Eug&eacute;nie, and when Fenton entered the room,  he only found Kitty, calmly seated beside a little table, reading a book.</p>
  <p>Fenton  was looking wonderfully well, but with a watchful look on his face, as if he  feared discovery. He had a good sum of money with him, his passage to  Valparaiso, and never for a moment thought that he was on the edge of an abyss.  Of course, Kitty did not know he was about to abscond, and never thought how  near her prey had escaped. She received him quietly, with friendly interest,  and Fenton, pulling a chair next to hers, began to talk eagerly, never dreaming  that an officer of the law was listening to every word.</p>
  <p>Not  only that, but outside, crouching on the verandah, was a dark figure, with a  livid face, listening to what the man inside was saying. Hiram Fenton, utterly  unconscious, was surrounded on all sides by his enemies, and went on telling  all his plans to Kitty, never thinking how near he was to the felon&rsquo;s dock from  which he was flying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did you want to see me about?&rdquo; asked Fenton, taking Caprice&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  in particular,&rdquo; she replied carelessly; &ldquo;the fact is, I haven&rsquo;t seen you for  such a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you do care for me a little!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caprice  shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  much as I do for any man; but I didn&rsquo;t ask you to come here to make love. I  want to talk seriously about giving up the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was leading him on so that he should betray himself to the detective, and he  walked straight into the trap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;re tired of acting,&rdquo; said Fenton thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and of Melbourne. I want to go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  started, and wondered if she knew he was going away also. He thought for a  moment, and then replied,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  why not come with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  you!&rdquo; cried Kitty derisively. &ldquo;What about Mrs Malton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you, I don&rsquo;t care two straws about Mrs Malton,&rdquo; he rejoined angrily. &ldquo;I  was only amusing myself with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Amusing  himself! The man outside ground his teeth together in anger, and clutched the  packet of letters fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about your dear friend&mdash;her husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Malton,&rdquo; said Fenton carelessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, nor do I care; he was a very useful  man to me for a time. But, now, I&rsquo;m off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Off!&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Valparaiso. Yes, I&rsquo;m sick of Australia, so I sail to-morrow morning for South  America. Will you come with me, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  looked doubtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. We have no money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have plenty. I&rsquo;ve arranged all that, and if there&rsquo;s a row, my dear friend  Malton will have to bear it. But now, Kitty, I&rsquo;ve told you all, you must come  with me. We can live a delightful life in South America. I know it well, and  some of the places are Paradises. Come, say you&rsquo;ll come to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  put his arms round her, and pressed a kiss on her lips. She shuddered at the  impure caress, then pushing him away, arose to her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  touch me,&rdquo; she said harshly, &ldquo;you&mdash; you thief!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a moment Fenton was on his feet, with an apprehensive look on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thief!  thief!&rdquo; he cried fiercely; &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean,&rdquo;  she said, turning on him like a tiger, &ldquo;that I know now who stole my diamonds,  Mr Hiram Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you accuse me?&rdquo; he asked, with a pale face, gripping her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do,&rdquo; said Kitty, wrenching her wrist away, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got a proof&mdash;this broken  sleeve-link, dropped by you in my room on the night of the robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  true! I accuse you of stealing my diamonds. Detective Naball, arrest that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton  started as Naball stepped out from behind the screen, and then folded his arms,  with an evil smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo;  he said coolly, &ldquo;this is a trap, I see; but I&rsquo;m not to be caught in it. You say  I stole your diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said Kitty boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your proof is that you picked up a broken sleeve-link?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  Mr Detective,&rdquo; said Fenton, holding out both his wrists to Naball, &ldquo;if you  examine these, you will see neither of the links are broken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball,  with an ejaculation of surprise, examined both the links, and found what he  said was correct &mdash;neither of the sleeve-links were broken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you not made a mistake?&rdquo; he said to Caprice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I have not,&rdquo; she replied coolly. &ldquo;When he found he had lost a sleeve-link, he  got another made, in order to avert suspicion. I say Hiram Fenton stole my  diamonds, and I give him in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  stepped forward, but the American, who was now uneasy at the turn affairs had  taken, waved him back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;I deny the charge, and will prove it false  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  laughed derisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  which time you will be on your way to Valparaiso. No, I&rsquo;m not going to let you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  am I,&rdquo; said Naball decisively. &ldquo;I arrest you on this charge of robbery now,&rdquo;  and he laid his hand on the shoulder of the American.</p>
  <p>In  a moment Fenton twisted himself away, and dexterously throwing Naball on the  ground, darted towards one of the French windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so fast, my friend,&rdquo; he said sneeringly, while Naball, half-stunned, was  picking himself up; &ldquo;guess I&rsquo;ll beat you this time. I care nothing for you nor  that she-devil there. You can prove nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naball  made a bound forward, but with a mocking laugh Fenton was about to step lightly  through the window, when he was dashed violently back into Naball&rsquo;s arms, and  Malton, pale as death sprang into the room</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  him,&rdquo; he cried, clutching Fenton, who was too much astonished to make any  resistance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him go. He&rsquo;s guilty&mdash;I can prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie  had hurried into the room, attracted by the noise, and Kitty was standing near  her, the two women clinging together for protection. Naball held Fenton firmly,  while Malton, in a frenzy of rage, spoke rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is guilty of the robbery,&rdquo; he shrieked, menacing Fenton with his fists. &ldquo;He  embezzled money with me, and had it been found out, we would both have been put  in prison. He stole the diamonds on the night of the supper, by going upstairs  to your room, and then leaving by the window, so as to make people think it was  a burglary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  cursed lie!&rdquo; growled Fenton, making an effort to shake Naball off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Malton furiously. &ldquo;Villiers can prove it. You met him as you  were coming round the house, and gave him some diamonds to make him hold his  tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the crescent!&rdquo; cried Naball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; and then he sold the diamonds to old Lazarus, and afterwards murdered him.  Yes, he killed Jacob Lazarus!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fenton&rsquo;s  nostrils dilated, he drew a deep breath, and gave a cry of anger; but Malton  went on speaking rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got that note not from Ezra Lazarus, but from Fenton, and lied to shield him;  but now, when I find out he makes love to my wife, I&rsquo;ll do anything to hang  him. See, these letters&mdash;your cursed letters,&rdquo; flinging them on the ground  before Fenton. &ldquo;You liar, thief, murderer, you&rsquo;re done for at last!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet!&rdquo; yelled Fenton, and with a sudden effort he flung Naball off, and dashed  for the window, but Malton sprang on him like a wild cat, and they both rolled  on the floor. Naball jumped up, and went to Malton&rsquo;s help, when suddenly the  American, with a supreme effort, wrenched himself clear of them, and ran once  more for the window.</p>
  <p>Seeing  this, Kitty, who had remained a passive spectator, tried to stop him, but with  an oath he hurled her from him, and she, falling against a table, knocked it  over, and fell senseless on the ground. Fenton, with a cry of anger, dashed  through the window, and disappeared into the darkness. But, quick as he was,  Malton was quicker; for seeing his enemy escape him, he also sprang through the  window, and gave chase.</p>
  <p>Naball,  breathless, and covered in blood, was about to go also, when a cry from Eug&eacute;nie  stopped him. The girl was kneeling down beside Kitty, while the frightened  servants crowded in at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she is dead! dead!&rdquo; cried Eug&eacute;nie, looking down at the still face. &ldquo;No; she can&rsquo;t  be. Brandy&mdash;bring some brandy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  servant entered with the brandy, and Eug&eacute;nie, filling a glass, forced some of  the liquid between Kitty&rsquo;s clenched teeth. Naball also took a glass, as he was  worn-out with the struggle, then, hastily putting on his hat, went out, leaving  Kitty lying, to all appearances dead, in Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Malton was close on the heels of the American, who had cleared out by the gate,  and was making for the railway station. There were few people about; but the  spectacle of two men racing bare-headed soon brought a crowd around. Fenton,  with deep curses, sped on through the driving rain, and at last flew on to the  platform, followed by Malton, who gasped out,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seize  him! Murderer! murderer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  station-master, a porter, and some passengers who were waiting, all sprang  forward at this; so Fenton, seeing himself surrounded, gave one yell of rage,  and, jumping on the line, ran along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; cried the station-master, &ldquo;the train is coming down; he will be killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  tried to hold Malton, who was mad with anger at seeing his prey escape him,  and, foaming with anger, wrenched himself away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  be killed!&rdquo; cried the porter; but Malton, with a hoarse cry, sprang on to the  line, and sped after Fenton through the driving rain.</p>
  <p>It  was pitch dark, and the rain swept along in slanting sheets, through which  gleamed the red and green of the signals. Malton, only actuated by a mad desire  to seize Fenton, staggered blindly over the sleepers, stumbling at every step.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he heard the hard breathing of the man he was pursuing, and the foremost figure  loomed up dark and misshapen in the thick night. They were now near the railway  bridge which crosses the Yarra-Yarra at this point, and the steady sweep of the  river could be heard as it flowed against the iron girders.</p>
  <p>Fenton,  hearing some one close behind him, made a bound forwards, then fell on the  line, with a shriek of despair. In a moment Malton was on him, and the two men  rolled on the line, fighting like devils.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse  you!&rdquo; hissed Malton, putting his knee on Fenton&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  kill you!&rdquo; And he dashed Fenton&rsquo;s head against the iron rails.</p>
  <p>The  American, in despair, flung up his hands, and caught Malton round the neck.  Once more they fought, wrapped in a deadly embrace, when suddenly they felt the  bridge vibrate, and, even in their struggle, saw rapidly approaching, through  the darkness the light of the down train.</p>
  <p>Malton,  with a cry of horror, tried to release himself from Fenton&rsquo;s grip, but the American  held him tight, and in another moment the train, with a roar, was on the  bridge, and over their bodies.</p>
  <p>One  hoarse yell, and all was over. Evan Malton and Hiram Fenton were torn to pieces  under the cruel wheels. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
    Exit Kitty Marchurst</b></h2>
  <p>So  this was the end of it all. The criminal, guilty of the two crimes which had  agitated Melbourne for so many months, turned out to be the respected manager  of The Never-say-die Insurance Company. After the discovery of his guilt, the  affairs of the company were examined, and found to be in a terrible state of  confusion. Fenton, aided by Malton, had embezzled large sums of money, and so  carefully manipulated the accounts that their defalcations had never been  noticed.</p>
  <p>It  was true that once they were on the verge of discovery unless some of the money  was paid back, and this had been accomplished by the robbery of Kitty Marchurst&rsquo;s  diamonds. As the two guilty men were dead, the only man who knew anything about  the affair was Mr Villiers, who soon found things made so warm for him that he  confessed all he knew about the crime.</p>
  <p>It  appeared that, on the night of the supper, Fenton was in great straits for want  of money to replace that embezzled by himself and Malton. Hearing Kitty state  where she kept her diamonds, he determined to steal them if he could do so with  safety. In going to the drawing-room, he saw Stewart descending the stairs,  and, as the young man told him he had been in Kitty&rsquo;s room putting the child to  bed, he thought he could steal the jewels on that night, and let Stewart bear  the blame.</p>
  <p>With  this idea, he went upstairs, took the diamonds from their place, and, in order  to make things doubly secure, should his idea of implicating Stewart fail, he  got out of the window, and clambered down, so as to show that the house had  been burglariously entered.</p>
  <p>In  stealing round to the front of the house, he met Villiers, who had seen all,  and, in order to make him hold his tongue, had given him the small diamond  crescent which Naball secured in Little Bourke Street. Of course, Kitty would  not prosecute Keith, as he had saved her child&rsquo;s life; and it was his security  in this belief that caused Fenton to urge on the detective.</p>
  <p>About  the murder, Villiers, as a matter of fact, knew very little; but when Naball  said that the man who stole the diamonds also committed the crime, he went to  Fenton, and taxed him with it. Fenton, at first, indignantly denied the  accusation, but ultimately confessed to Villiers that he had done so. After  giving back Keith his knife at the club, he had seen him hang up his coat, and  dexterously extracted the weapon therefrom unknown to the owner. Then he went  to Russell Street and committed the crime, in reality to gain possession of the  diamonds, thinking they were in the safe, as he did not know that Lazarus had  sent them to Amsterdam.</p>
  <p>Therefore,  the whole mystery was cleared up; and after making his confession, Villiers  found public opinion so much against him, that he left the colony, and  disappeared, no one knew where.</p>
  <p>The  dead bodies of the American and Malton were found on the railway line, and,  after an inquiry had been made, were duly buried. Mrs Malton went back to live  with her father, and shortly afterwards married again.</p>
  <p>Stewart  was released from prison and became quite the hero of the hour, as every one  sympathised with him for the way in which he had been treated. Eug&eacute;nie told him  all about her accession to fortune, and they agreed to get married and go to  Europe. Ezra, also, now that he was wealthy, turned Benedict, and was united to  Rachel a short time after his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faust  Upset&rdquo; ran for some time, but was ultimately withdrawn, as the part of Miss  Mephistopheles was taken by another woman, and she failed to draw the public.</p>
  <p>But  Caprice?</p>
  <p>Ah!  poor woman, she was dying. In the struggle with Fenton, she had fallen in a  perilous position, and had so injured her spine, that there was no hope of  recovery.</p>
  <p>It  was on a Tuesday evening, and poor, wicked Kitty was lying in bed, with her  weary eyes fixed on Meg, who was seated on Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s lap, rather puzzled by the  whole affair. Keith and Ezra were also present, in deference to Kitty&rsquo;s desire,  as she wanted to formally give Meg over to Eug&eacute;nie to bring her up. All the  legal formalities had been gone through, and now they were waiting for the  end&mdash;alas! it was not very far off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you feel easier, dear?&rdquo; asked Eug&eacute;nie, gently bending over the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Kitty in a slow, tired voice. &ldquo;Better now; it will soon be over.  You&mdash;you will look after my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  promise you, I will,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie fervently. &ldquo;Would you like to see a minister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kitty  smiled with a touch of her old cynicism, and then her eyes filled with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  minister, yes,&rdquo; she said in a faltering voice. &ldquo;God help me! and I was a  minister&rsquo;s daughter. Look at me now, fallen and degraded, dying, with my life  before me, and glad &mdash; yes, glad to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  obedience to a sign from Eug&eacute;nie, Keith had slipped out of the room in order to  bring the clergyman, and Kitty lay quiet, with the clear light of the evening  shining on her pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  me my child,&rdquo; she said at length, and then, as she took Meg to her breast and  kissed her, she wept bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  bless you, my darling,&rdquo; she sobbed; &ldquo;think of me with pity. Eug&eacute;nie,  never&mdash;never let her know what I was. Let her believe me to have been a good  woman. If I have sinned, see how I was tempted&mdash;see how I have suffered &mdash;let my  child think her mother was a good woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eug&eacute;nie,  crying bitterly, promised this, and then tried to take Meg away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mumsey,&rdquo;  said Meg, clinging to her mother, &ldquo;why do you cry? Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  dying, Meg, darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dying!&rdquo;  said Meg, to whom the word conveyed no idea, &ldquo;dying!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear; going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  dear, no. You must stay here, and be a good girl. Mumsey is going far away&mdash;to  the sky,&rdquo; finished poor Kitty, in a faltering voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the sky&mdash;then you&rsquo;ll see God,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
  <p>At  this Kitty could bear no more, but burst into tears, and Meg was taken out of  the room, being pacified with difficulty. Then Keith entered with the clergyman,  who was left alone with the dying woman for some time.</p>
  <p>When  they all returned, they saw she was sinking rapidly, but she smiled faintly as Eug&eacute;nie  approached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  told him all,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;and he says God will forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure He will, dear,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie in a faltering voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange,&rsquo;&rdquo;  said the dying woman, in a dreamy voice, &ldquo;I, who never cared for religion,  should want it now. I&rsquo;m glad to die, for there was nothing to live for; but  this terrible Death&mdash;I fear it. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going&mdash;where am I going?&rdquo;  she asked piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Heaven, dear,&rdquo; said Eug&eacute;nie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo;  repeated Kitty, her memory going-back to her childhood; &ldquo;that is where there is  neither sun nor moon&mdash;the glory of God is there. Oh, I&rsquo;ll never go there&mdash;never&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  room was now filled with floating shadows, and all present were kneeling by the  bed. Meg, who had been brought back, and held by Eug&eacute;nie, was beside her  mother, awed by the solemnity of the scene. A pale shaft of clear light came  through the window, and shone on the disordered white clothes of the bed and  the still face of the dying woman.</p>
  <p>No  sound save the sighing of the wind outside, the sobs of Eug&eacute;nie, and the grave  tones of the clergyman&rsquo;s voice, reading the Sermon on the Mount, which in  former days had been a great favourite with Kitty.</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they  shall see God.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>Poor  soul, she that had not been pure was now dying, and dreaded lest her impurity  should be brought up against her.</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they  shall obtain mercy.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>Ah,  Kitty Marchurst, what mercy did you ever show? The inward voice came to her  like an accusing spirit, and she shrank back in the bed. Then she opened her  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would have been a good woman,&rdquo; she said pathetically; &ldquo;but I&mdash;I was so young  when I met Gaston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  voice became inarticulate, and with an effort she kissed her child, while the  clergyman said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;Our Father which art in Heaven.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meg,  Meg,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Meg&mdash;God bless my little child!&rdquo; And those were the last  words of Kitty Marchurst, for when the prayer was ended she was lying back,  with her pure, childlike face stilled in death.</p>
  <p>So  she went into the outer darkness laden with sins, but surely God in His mercy  pardoned this woman, whose impurity was more the result of circumstances than  anything else.</p>
  <p>Let  us not deny to others the mercy which we ourselves will need some day. Kitty  was dead, with all her frailties and passions; and as the clergyman arose from  his knees, he repeated reverently the words of his Master,&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;He that is without sin among you, let  him first cast a stone at her.&rdquo;</i></p>
