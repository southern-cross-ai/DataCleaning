  <p>So  incredible is this tale that I expect few to believe it. Nevertheless, it is  not only true, but happened within the last decade. The names of the places and  the characters are changed, it is true; I write, too, under a nom-de-plume; but  the incidents are set down just as they took place. I can vouch for their  truth, for I was an eye-witness of many. The rest I heard from the chief actor  in this drama&mdash;or perhaps I should say melodrama, if not tragedy&mdash;for it is as  moving as the most sensational play. And true! Do not forget that&mdash;absolutely  true. That is the horror of the thing.</p>
  <p>As  a busy London physician, I have a great deal of hard work to get through; and  it is always a pleasure when I can take an occasional holiday for the  recuperation of body and mind. Being a bachelor and well-to-do, I have less  difficulty than I otherwise would have in making extended trips, so that  frequently I go far afield in search of enjoyment and relaxation.</p>
  <p>One  night in June I was seated in my study, turning over the leaves of a  Continental Bradshaw, and wondering what country I should explore on my coming  holiday, when the door opened and Hugh Tancred entered hurriedly. Tancred is my  cousin, and as we were at school and college together has been free of my house  these many years. I was surprised to see him just then, as two months before he  had gone to Spain, and I had no idea that he was back in town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow,&rdquo; I cried, jumping up with outstretched hands, &ldquo;I am glad to&mdash;. Good  God, man, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  indeed it was no wonder I was startled, for his appearance was such as to  dismay a person much less nervous than myself. The ruddy-faced hale young man I  had known was as white as any ghost, and every whit as spare. His cheeks were  wan, his eyes had in them a startled expression, and the clothes hung loosely  on his once stalwart figure. Two months before, when he had started for Spain,  he had been the very picture of health; now he might have been, if not a  spectre, a patient convalescent from the nearest hospital. He was in a sad  state of fright, too &mdash;I saw that at once; for his breath came and went in quick  gasps, and he hastened to lock the door. Then he flung himself into my arms and  gripped me in a mortal terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo;  he gasped, glancing back at the door, &ldquo;Dick, save me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hell  has broken loose!&rdquo; was his extraordinary reply. &ldquo;Do you hear the guitar? Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, but no sound broke the stillness. With a sob of relief he pitched  forward into the nearest chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  have missed me!&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stared at the shaking figure in bewilderment. The sudden appearance of Tancred,  his inexplicable agitation and his sickly appearance, amazed me beyond measure.  When I was able to collect my scattered wits sufficiently for action, the  professional habit came uppermost. I must calm him. Going to my medicine chest,  I mixed a stiff dose of valerian and bromide, and handed it to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drink  this, Hugh. Tut! tut! you are spilling it man.&rdquo; And so he was; for his hand  shook so with nervousness that I had to hold the glass to his lips. When he had  got it down I fingered his pulse, and found it leaping and throbbing in the  most extraordinary way. His whole body trembled, and his teeth were chattering.  I saw well enough that the man had not been drinking, yet from his appearance  and behaviour he might have been recovering from a prolonged debauch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  take care of me, Dick,&rdquo; he whispered, with a scared look at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; no one shall hurt you here. Lie down for a few moments,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hugh  nodded, and leaning on my arm staggered to the sofa. Then, as I expected, came  a nerve storm which shook him to the very core of his being. He cried and  choked hysterically, trembled in every limb, gripped at the cushions, and swung  his head from side to side with his teeth rattling like castanets. It was a  terrible sight even to a hardened doctor like myself. Hugh had always been  highly strung and prone to nervous attacks, yet I had never seen him quite so  bad as he was on this night.</p>
  <p>In  time the drug did its work, and he became sufficiently calm to explain the  cause of his agitation. He told me the story in whispers, clutching my hand the  while; and the matter of his narrative was so extraordinary that I was  half-inclined to put a good deal of it down hallucination. Nevertheless, what  was credible sufficiently accounted for his terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six  weeks ago, I was in Seville,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;all alone. I did not want any chattering  companion to spoil my pleasure. I put up at a good hotel, and hired a guide to  show me the sights of the city. I saw them all&mdash;the Cathedral, the tobacco  factories, the Giralda and the famous Torre del Oro of Don Pedro. Then I was  anxious to see the gipsy quarter, as I had heard so much of the beautiful women  to be found there. My guide was willing to take me, but mentioned that I had  better not be too attentive to any of the girls, as the Gitane are excessively  jealous of strangers, and as likely as not I should get into trouble. I  promised to be careful. But you know Dick how inflammable I am where a woman is  concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; so you got into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  the worst.&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;Trouble which has made me the wreck you see; trouble  which is not yet over.&rdquo; He put his lips to my ear. &ldquo;They mean to murder me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gipsies? Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true. The Mosaic law, Dick: &lsquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&rsquo; &rdquo; After  a pause, Hugh added slowly, &ldquo;I killed a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;killed&mdash;a&mdash;man?&rdquo;  I cried, horrified. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was this way, Dick,&rdquo; continued my unfortunate cousin, rapidly. &ldquo;In the gipsy quarter,  I went to a kind of open-air theatre. A girl was dancing&mdash;a beautiful Gitana  with large black eyes and a most wonderful figure. She was dressed in red&mdash;red  as blood. I should have been warned by the colour.&rdquo; He wiped the perspiration  from his forehead, and panted. &ldquo;But I was foolish. She smiled on me, and I&mdash;well  I lost my head, I suppose. I never saw so beautiful a woman. She had some kind  of mesmeric influence over me. When she smiled I took a flower out of my coat,  and cast it at her feet. There was a man near me, handsome, but savage in his  looks and bearing. He said something under his breath, and looked angrily at  me. The guide laid his hand on my arm, and tried to get me away. I shook him  off, as I wished to speak with Lola before going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  her name Lola?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  Fajardo. The audience called out her name as she danced. I called it out, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have been mad or drunk, Hugh.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  latter, I think. It was after dinner, and I am not used to fiery Spanish wines.  Yet I can carry a good deal, as you know. I was merely excited, but the beauty  and alluring glances of Lola threw me into a kind of intoxicated state. For the  time I could see no one but her. She swam before me in her strange dance, like  Salome before Herod.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish.  I want prose, not poetry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am telling you facts!&rdquo; cried Tancred, vehemently. &ldquo;She danced with a dried  human head in her hands. It was the dance of Salome&mdash;the daughter of Herodias.  And she juggled with the head as she swung and swayed to the music. Ah!&rdquo; he  uttered a sharp cry&mdash;&ldquo;the music! That&rsquo;s what haunts me. There were words to  it&mdash;horrible words. I got the guide to translate them to me. I have made a verse  of them in English. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hugh  rose from the sofa, and balancing the cushion in his hands, danced about the  room to his own singing. The music he sang was weird enough; the words as he  sang them nothing short of horrible! </p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  in the dance pass, repass,<br>
    My hands, my feet, my garments red;<br>
    The daughter of Herodias,<br>
    And this my John the Baptist&rsquo;s head;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hugh!  Hugh!&rdquo; I stopped the terrible performance, and pulled him down on to the sofa. &ldquo;Be  calm, man,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you will make yourself thoroughly ill. Tell me how the  trouble occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  caused it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She finished her dance, and stepped down to collect money.  As she held out her tambourine to me she looked into my face with an alluring  smile. I dropped a gold piece into it. Then&mdash;I was mad, I think&mdash;I kissed her  arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  such a place! You fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  drew it away angrily, and the young man bounded forward. He had a knife in his  hand&mdash;a navaja. Lola shrieked, and the crowd shouted. I don&rsquo;t know how it  happened, but I got possession of the navaja, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I killed him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  God! You killed him!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  the knife pierced his heart, Dick. I remember as in a dream the shouting,  swaying crowd, the yellow lights, and the man lying dead there, with the blood  spurting in jets from his breast. Lola flung herself on his body, and my guide  catching me by the arm hurried me away. Some one extinguished the lights, and  so we escaped. The police came, and there was a terrible riot, but I was safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  not your guide deliver you up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  paid him a hundred pounds not to do so. He made me leave Seville that night,  and took me to Gibraltar. But the gipsies found me out, and followed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I heard the music&mdash;the music of the dance. It haunted me all the time. I caught  a P. and O. steamer for Malta, and on board I heard that infernal guitar. Then  again in Malta I heard it. Thence I crossed to Sicily&mdash;to Italy&mdash;went to Germany,  to Switzerland, to Paris, but go where I would, the sound of that music still  rang in my ears. To-night, as I was getting my luggage at Victoria, there it  was again. I could see no one in the crowd, but I heard the music. I&mdash;I came on  here, and&mdash;the music; Hark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  voice leaped to an alto, and he fell back into my arms. As I am a living man, I  heard the notes of a guitar in the street. The music was like that which Hugo  sang&mdash;wild, strange and fascinating. I tried to get to the window, but Tancred  clutched me. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open it, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; His voice died away  in his throat, and he rolled limply on the floor in a faint. There was no time  to waste. I sprang to the window. As I opened it the guitar ceased; and when I  looked down into the moonlit street, no one was about. Unstrung and puzzled I  returned to the unconscious man.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>For  three weeks Hugh lay in my house, hovering between life and death. The  excitement consequent on his crime, and the haunting of the guitarist brought  on brain fever. I called in another medical man, and we did all in our power to  save him. In the end we succeeded; yet it was almost a pity we took the trouble  to drag him back from the grave. Others, more powerful and unscrupulous than  we, were bent on his death. All we did was to retard the fatal moment. It was  bound to come, as the guitar had warned us.</p>
  <p>There  was no hallucination about that music. I heard it distinctly. So did my confr&egrave;re.  But by placing Hugh in a back room we managed to keep it from his ears. The  sound of it would have killed him. I tried to catch the player. Knowing that  Hugh had murdered a man, I did not think it wise to seek the aid of the police.  It is best to let sleeping dogs lie; and since Tancred had managed to escape  from Spain, I did not care to risk the chance of his being extradited back  again, to answer for his crime. I felt terribly worried by my position. It is  no light matter, first to have to save a man&rsquo;s life and thereafter to have to  protect it.</p>
  <p>I  never saw the player. At times, both by night and day, I heard the strum,  strum, strum of that infernal tune, until I knew it every note backwards. Once  I even caught myself whistling it. Whenever it struck my ear I would rush out  into the street and make a search for the musician. But it was always in vain.  Once or twice I asked a policeman, and was informed that the guitar was played  by a hunchback accompanied by a very beautiful woman. I had no doubt but that  this latter was Lola, and that she was on the track of her lover&rsquo;s murderer.  Hugh had told me that the dead man had been her lover. That she was not here  without design I felt certain, though it was impossible exactly to surmise what  it might be. When later on I learned it I marvelled at its cruelty.</p>
  <p>In  due time Hugh recovered, and with his returning health and reason came the  thought of his sin in Seville. In answer to his questions about the guitar  music, I swore, God forgive me, that I had never heard it since the night he  was taken ill. I was apprehensive that if he remained in England and in my  house he would certainly hear it, and then I feared lest he might lose his  reason permanently. Such a situation required very strong measures, so I took  two passages to the Cape and arranged to accompany Hugh there on a long  holiday. So that he should not by any chance hear the thing, I drugged him  before we left the house, and it was in a quasi insensible condition that he  was taken on board the steamer. And it was as well I had taken this precaution,  for sure enough, as we drove round the corner of Harley Street there came the  sound of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  we are safe!&rdquo; said I, as the liner breasted the waves of the Channel. &ldquo;Here at  least your gipsy friends cannot follow us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope not!&rdquo; murmured Hugh, anxiously, &ldquo;God grant indeed they may give it up and  go back to Spain. Why does Lola persecute me so, I wonder! It was a pure  accident I killed her lover. He attacked me first; he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old  man,&rdquo; I said seriously, &ldquo;I want you not to talk about this at all. Try and  forget; get the thing out of your mind altogether if you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  I believe he did try his best, but I am pretty sure he did not succeed.  However, knowing it vexed me, he did not refer to it at all, and when we  arrived in South Africa, the novelty of the country and the surrounding life  gave him other interests. His wasted form filled out well, and again his face  became ruddy, and he began to show every sign of recovered health. There were  times even when he was quite merry, and laughed like he used to do. At the end  of six months he was completely restored; and although not infrequently a dark  shadow rested on his face, he was for the most part cheerful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now, Hugh,&rdquo; said I to him one day, &ldquo;it is about time I returned to my patients,  whom I think I have neglected long enough. But you take my advice and remain  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  he said obstinately. &ldquo;I have quite got over all that folly. The death of that  gipsy was due to pure accident; and even if Lola haunts me with that music, I  can laugh at it and her now. I am sane again. I expect she has long since given  up her pursuit of revenge, and returned to Spain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  thought so, too, and said as much. Still I suggested that Hugh should not  remain in London on his return. His fever had left him even more excitable than  he had been before, and I thought it best in every way that he should live in  the country.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, Dick,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;I shall go down to &lsquo;The Cage.&rsquo; This was a  lonely mansion placed amidst the Essex fens at no great distance from the sea,  and which descended to Hugh from an ancestor. It was a dreary and desolate  dwelling, and this I remarked to Hugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not cheerful,&rdquo; replied Hugh, indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it is quiet, and far from civilisation; so I don&rsquo;t think Lola, even if she be  still in England, which I doubt, will follow me there. I can ride and read, and  use my camera. Peace is what I require, and at &lsquo;The Cage&rsquo; I shall secure it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Tancred was now well, and strong, and sane, I made no further opposition. We  returned to England, and he remained a week in my house. Then he went down to  Essex; and I am glad to say that in spite of my apprehensions not a note of  that cursed guitar was heard. Evidently Hugh was right. Lola had given up her  vengeance.</p>
  <p>Within  a month I was undeceived on this point. A hastily scrawled letter from Hugh  informed me that he had heard the guitar music. &ldquo;Not only that&rdquo; went on the  note, &ldquo;but I have seen the red dancer&mdash;seen Lola&mdash;with a head in her hands. It is  the head of the man I killed. Come down, for God&rsquo;s sake. I am going mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  this despairing appeal there was but one answer possible for me. I hastily  packed a portmanteau, slipped a revolver into my pocket, and caught the first  train. My cousin&rsquo;s factotum, Jabez Crane, met me at the station with the  dogcart, and forthwith we started upon the twelve-mile drive to &ldquo;The Cage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  never could bring myself to like Jabez. He was the man who looked after the  Essex property, and with his hag of a wife, lived at &ldquo;The Cage.&rdquo; They were a  couple of ogres&mdash;misanthropes&mdash;savages. They resembled strongly those atrocious  characters in that remarkable book &ldquo;Wuthering Heights.&rdquo; There was little of  humanity about either of them; and they both hated Hugh on account of some  fancied injury which his father had done them. Often and often I had advised  Hugh to discharge them, but he continued to employ them, which was surprising,  considering their malice and stupidity. I think it was sheer indolence on his  part. Embedded like toads in a rock they had vegetated at &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; for twenty  years or more. Only when it was too late did I know what I had done in sending  Tancred to keep company with these ourangoutangs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mr. Tancred ill?&rdquo; I asked Jabez, as the cart swung out of the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ees,  he be!&rdquo; grunted the creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen any gipsies about &ldquo;The Cage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,  I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  hunchback and a woman, for instance?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seed nowt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you heard any music?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ees,  I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have seen no one? Nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seed nowt!&rdquo; repeated Jabez, who all through this conversation had replied in  three words. Clearly there was nothing to be got out of the sulky brute. It may  be he knew more than he chose to confess. I was aware that he bore no goodwill  towards his master. On the other hand, he might be as ignorant as he professed  to be. I could catch no glimpse of Tancred&rsquo;s persecutor in London, so why  should Jabez be more fortunate in Essex. All the same, on glancing at the  animal face of the man, on recollecting the lonely position of &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; and  the invisible presence of the gipsies, I congratulated myself on the possession  of my revolver. That at least was useful defence against the perils amid which  I was about to enter.</p>
  <p>The  first glance assured me that Tancred had slipped back into his old state of  half-insane fear. His white and haggard face, his shifting, glittering eyes, betrayed  the torture of his mind, and as we sat over the fire after dinner he told me  about the coming of the gipsy devils.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  mean to drive me mad!&rdquo; he whispered, huddling in abject fear to my side. &ldquo;Lola  no doubt deems death too light a punishment for my crime. It is her intention  to wreck me body and soul. Oh, that music&mdash;that music!&rdquo; And he began to sing:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;See  in the dance I pass, repass,<br>
    My hands, my feet, my&mdash;&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  it Hugh,&rdquo; I interrupted, throwing my arm round his shoulder. The poor fellow  was shaking like a leaf. &ldquo;Tell me; have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  in the long gallery, under the painted window. At midnight last week the music  drew me out of bed. I followed it to the gallery, and in the moonlight Lola  danced, with that head in her hands. I saw the face; it was that of the man I  killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could you recognise the face in the moonlight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  rolled the head towards me like a ball. It bounded and spun along the gallery,  and twirled like a top at my feet. The moon showed me the features of the dead.  I fainted, and when I came to myself it was gone. She was gone; the music was  gone,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hugh,  you must get away from here in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I shall stay. I&rsquo;ve had enough of this torture. Here I shall await my doom.  These devils have cornered me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  show fight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tancred  whimpered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t show fight,&rdquo; he cried fretfully. &ldquo;I am worn out&mdash;done for. The end is  coming, and I shall await it here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  this determination I couldn&rsquo;t move him. Terrified and ill as he was, he refused  to leave &ldquo;The Cage.&rdquo; Had I possessed the power, I would have removed him by  force; but Jabez and his wife would do nothing, and I could not leave him, to  get assistance. My absence even for a day would only have precipitated the end,  and that was to come soon enough. </p>
  <p>Constantly  that weird music buzzed and hummed about the house. It was here, and there, and  everywhere; and in spite of all my searching the musician eluded me. &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo;  was a rambling ruinous mansion, full of secret doors and passages and hiding  holes. Jabez knew them all; and seeing that the gipsies contrived to remain  invisible, I strongly suspected him of being in league with them. He denied the  charge when I made it, and I had no means of proving my words. So here I was  shut up in a half-furnished lonely barrack of a house, with a terrified  creature who would not leave it, with invisible foes to combat on his behalf,  and with the knowledge of a devilish conspiracy against the reason of an  unfortunate man. The situation was uncanny enough to shake even my hardened  nerves.</p>
  <p>I  did the best I could with Hugh. I dosed him with sedatives, kept him from over  indulgence in drink, made him eat well, and forced him to take plenty of  exercise. In his company I explored the neighbourhood, in the hope of coming  upon Lola and her hunchback accomplice, but all in vain. The dreary fens, the  sandy dunes, were bare of humanity. Once or twice on the beach of a little bay  I found the marks of tiny feet, and again the indentation of a boat&rsquo;s keel  driven into the slushy sand. Evidently these demons came from the sea to pursue  their nefarious work; but they never appeared in the day-time, and I could not  discover where they lurked. It was no use asking Jabez. He gave no sign, either  by word or deed, of his knowledge of these things. Neither did his wife; yet I  had a firm conviction that the pair had been bought over to lend their aid to  the accomplishment of Lola&rsquo;s vengeance.</p>
  <p>After  a week of fruitless search and constant music-hauntings, I resolved to inveigle  Hugh over those twelve miles to the railway station, and carry him back to  London&mdash;by force, if needs be. To this end I announced one night at dinner that  I intended to return to town. As I anticipated, Tancred objected, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s  sake do not leave me, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Hugh, I cannot remain here for an indefinite period. My practice makes it  imperative that I return to London, but I will come down again shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  find me dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Crane was waiting at the table, and I fancied the old witch chuckled at these  words. However, when I looked round sharply, her face was as devoid of  expression as the wall. So thinking that I was mistaken, I resumed my  conversation with her master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you&rsquo;re afraid of dying, Hugh, come with me to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; I&rsquo;ll face death here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least you will see me off to-morrow at the station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tancred  seemed to wince at this. &ldquo;Then you are bent on going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go. Man alive! Think of my patients. I have done what I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, I know. You have been very good, very kind; but you will return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; in ten days or so I will come down for a spell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I don&rsquo;t mind so much being left now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  come and see me off to-morrow, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  That is a small thing to ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way the matter was settled, much to my relief; for I had determined that  when I got Hugh to the station I would do everything in my power to induce him  to come to London. If necessary I would use force. Anything rather than that he  should remain here at the peril of his reason and his life.</p>
  <p>That  night a great storm came up from the sea. The wind roared and moaned round the  empty shell of the house, the rain whipped the streaming panes, and the moon  was obscured by a rack of ragged clouds.</p>
  <p>Hugh&rsquo;s  room was next to mine, and about midnight I entered, to find him sleeping  peacefully. The man&rsquo;s nerves were worn out. His slumber was that of sheer  exhaustion. Nevertheless I was glad that nature had come to his relief at so  critical a moment. I turned away to seek my bed again. In the dark passage I  could hear the weird music of the guitar, and the sound, coming as it did in  the lull of the storm, struck at my heart.</p>
  <p>Determined  to find and face the gipsies, I hastily threw on some clothes, grasped my  revolver, and with a small lamp proceeded to explore the house. Overhead the  storm again began to shriek and whistle; then, occasionally, came the pad, pad,  pad of bare feet. Like Ferdinand in &ldquo;the Tempest,&rdquo; I followed the strain that  mocked and sang in the darkness ahead.</p>
  <p>The  invisible musician knew the house better than I, for he or she eluded me at  every turn. At times the strain would die away in the distance, again it would  sound so close to my ear as to make me jump, and then I would hear a hard  chuckle. Round and round the house I followed it&mdash;downstairs to the hall,  through the empty drawing-room, up the vacant attics, but never did I get any  closer to it. It twanged and hummed that devilish melody till my nerves ached  with reiteration of it. I stole along cautiously in its wake; I ran into dark  corners, hoping to seize the player, but in vain. It might have been a thing of  air that played. I heard, but I could not see.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  with the twang as of a snapped string, it ceased, and the silence closed in.  Even the wind had ceased to roar, and was now moaning round the gables as a  thing in pain. With sudden resolution I flew down to the quarters of Jabez and  hammered at the door. Both he and his wife came to it in their nightdresses,  just as they had sprung out of bed. My suspicions of the pair vanished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear the music?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;I  heard &lsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  with me then, to look for these gipsies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nowt o&rsquo; gipsies. They be devils I tell &lsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same you must help me to find them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jabez  grumbled, but my tone was peremptory, so he shuffled on his trousers and came  with me. For a time there was silence; then the thrumming of the guitar  recommenced overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  in the gall&rsquo;ry!&rdquo;whispered Jabez, and grasped more tightly the stick he carried.</p>
  <p>Without  answering, I ran up the stairs, with the man at my heels. We burst into the  long gallery, and there we saw a sight of dread. The moon clear of clouds,  poured in floods of silver light through the windows, making the gallery like  day. At the far end, where the radiance was strongest, a tall figure leaped and  spun to music, coming from I know not where. I crept near enough to see that  the dancer was a beautiful girl in red garments. She was grasping a human head  by the hair, and juggled with it as with a ball.</p>
  <p>The  sight of that ghastly dance made my heart sick. To add to the horror of it the  woman began to sing, in a low sweet voice. I could bear it no longer, and with  a shout I ran forward, raising my revolver as I ran. In a moment, as it seemed,  the woman vanished, and my bullet smashed the glass of the window beneath which  she had spun and leaped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maister,  maister,&rdquo; roared Jabez, grasping my arm, &ldquo;she be pixy for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  go my arm, you fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he held on, his face grey with terror, urging me to retreat. I shook him off. I  ran forward, and at the end of the gallery I found an open door. Through this I  sprang, hurled myself down some stone steps, and emerged into the garden. Two  figures leaped and ran, making for the beach. I tried to follow; but clad as I  was, the stones and brambles cut my feet and I stumbled and fell at the hedge.  When I got up again the two figures had dipped behind the sandhill, and were  beyond reach. But I had no doubt that I had seen Lola and her hunchback  accomplice at their devilish work.</p>
  <p>The  thought recalled Hugh, and I ran back. Jabez was waiting for me at the door  with the lamp, and his face wore an expression of abject fear. I was afraid of  the effect this midnight alarm would have on Hugh, and snatching the lamp from  the man&rsquo;s shaking hand I hurried into the house and up the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hugh,  Hugh, are you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  figure on the bed gave no answer, made no movement. I thought that he had  fainted perhaps, and I held the lamp to his face. There was no face; no head.  The man had been decapitated.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Two  years after the death of Tancred I was in Spain for the second time. My first  visit had been made with the object of discovering Lola Fajado, and bringing  her to book for the murder of my cousin. But although I had taken an English  detective with me, and although every assistance had been afforded me by the  Spanish Government, she could not be found. I fancy she must have gone to the  gipsies of Hungary or Russia, or lost herself somewhere beyond the Balkans. At  all events my search was in vain, and for the time being she escaped the  penalty of her crime.</p>
  <p>The  Cranes likewise got off free. I was certain that Jabez had been bribed by Lola  to show her the secret passages and exits of &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; but he swore, and his  wife swore, that they had neither of them ever set eyes upon the gipsies. I  must say that, although I believed it was the misanthropical hatred Jabez had  for Hugh that led him to play into Lola&rsquo;s hands in order to frighten him, as  well as the factotum&rsquo;s desire to get his master away from the house, yet I  believe he was horrified as was I myself at the terrible tragedy. But whatever  the two of them had had to do with the matter they had been wise enough to hold  their tongues, and were discharged, as the saying is, without a stain upon  their characters. I heard afterwards that they had gone to America; but whether  this was true or not, I could not be certain. However, as by the death of Hugh  I became the owner of &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; I did not permit them to return there, being  satisfied in my own mind that they were indirectly concerned in the crime. They  vanished into the darkness best suited to their brutish natures, and I never  saw them again. </p>
  <p>As  was afterwards discovered by detectives, Lola and her hunchback companion had  made a fishing village some miles away their headquarters. Thence they came  round in a boat at night to the little bay, on the sands of which I had found  their footmarks. How they discovered &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; or how they carried on their  horrible conspiracy, I did not know then. But I learned the truth during my  second visit to Spain.</p>
  <p>It  was a vague idea that Lola might return to Seville that drew me there. I knew  that Spanish justice was lax, and that the Gitane were more or less independent  of the law, so it was not unlikely that when the affair was forgotten the woman  might venture back among her kinsfolk. I wished to see her, both to bring home  the crime, and to recover Tancred&rsquo;s head, which she had taken with her on that  fatal night. For all I knew, she might be using it for her dance. She had  certainly juggled with it in the long gallery. But I did not know that until it  was too late.</p>
  <p>On  arriving in Seville I sent for the guide who had been with Hugh on the evening  Lola&rsquo;s lover was killed. He came immediately, and was very frightened when I  told him the object of my second visit. As luck would have it, Lola had stolen  back, and was in the gipsy quarter at that time; but her accomplice had died in  Hungary. The woman, with characteristic insolence, had changed neither her name  nor her dance; and as all memory of the affair had died out, no attempt was  made to arrest her. Moreover, I strongly suspected that the police had been  bribed; but, of course, on this point I could not be certain. At all events she  was free, and in Seville; and nightly danced her John the Baptist ballet, with  whose head I trembled to think.</p>
  <p>Manuel  the guide implored me not to see Lola, as she was powerful in the gipsy quarter  and there would be trouble. But I compromised the matter by agreeing to go in  the character of a tourist, and to make no disturbance. The fact is I wished to  see the woman for myself, and be quite certain as to her identity. I determined,  too, that when I next went it would be with a posse of police to arrest her.  However, with the second visit, Manuel, as I assured him, would have nothing to  do.</p>
  <p>Thus  persuaded, and somewhat heavily bribed, Manuel one night escorted me to the  gipsy quarter, and to a small open-air theatre. The seats were ranged in the  form of a semi-circle, facing a low platform which was lit with flaring oil  lamps. I placed myself directly in front of this, as close as I could get There  was no fear of recognition. Lola had never seen me really.</p>
  <p>The  theatre was filled with gipsies&mdash;a most picturesque-looking lot they were&mdash;they  were drinking, laughing, singing, and smoking the eternal cigarette. What with  the colours of their ragged dresses, the yellow lustre of the lamps, and the  purple arch of the starry sky roofing in the theatre, the scene was fascinating  in the extreme. But I was too intent upon seeing my cousin&rsquo;s murderess to take  much interest in my surroundings, novel as they were.</p>
  <p>There  was first of all some singing of love ballads, which was followed by dancing  with castanets. A gipsy violinist played like an angel and looked like a devil,  and there was a famous Tziganda orcshetra from Buda-Pesth. About nine o&rsquo;clock I  heard the thrum of the guitar, and I had considerable difficulty in concealing  my agitation. It played the weird music I knew so well&mdash;the music of that  accursed dance.</p>
  <p>To  the sound of tumultuous applause Lola Fajardo glided on to the stage. She was a  tall and beautiful woman, with large black eyes and a brown complexion. Her  figure was superb, and she was lithe as a serpent in her movements. From head  to foot she was swathed in a gauzy red garment, with a shawl of crimson silk  floating from her shoulders. Golden sequins shone round her neck, her waist,  and jingled in her streaming black hair, and at every movement she sparkled  like a stream at noon-day. I never saw a more lovely and dangerous woman, and I  no longer wondered that poor hot-blooded Hugh had lost his heart on that night.</p>
  <p>Standing  well to the front of the stage, she began to sway and swing to the music  without moving her feet. This part of the dance was not unlike the Indian  nautch. First she moved her head, then her body; her arms began to wave, and  after a time her feet took part in these graceful movements. Quicker and  quicker rang the music as the violins added their sweetness to the more mellow  notes of the guitars, and with swift bounds and extraordinary twistings of her  agile body Lola threw herself about the stage. Suddenly she came spinning down  to the footlights in a circle; and with the glare full on her excited face and  red garments, she snatched a head from under her shawl. As she held it up by  the fair hair, and the light struck on its appaling whiteness, I sprang to my  feet with a cry. It was the head of Hugh Tancred.</p>
  <p>Lola,  taking my cry as a tribute to her dramatic action, looking down on me with a  gratified smile. But the smile died away in a look of horror; she dropped the  head with a shriek, and rolled forward across the oil lamps. Before the  audience could grasp the situation, a tongue of flame shot up the red dress,  and in another moment she was reeling round the little stage, a pillar of live  flame. Shriek after shriek pealed from her throat as the fire bit into her  beautiful body. She fell prone and blazing like a funeral pyre: the audience  surged forward on to the stage, and Manuel, grasping my arm, hurried me out of  the theatre. He was terrified out of his wits at the danger we had escaped, so  was I; but my terror was due to being an eye-witness of the horrible doom which  had befallen that cruel woman.</p>
  <p>The  next morning a gipsy carrying a bag came to my hotel. On being shown into my  room, he shook Hugh&rsquo;s head out of the bag, and most earnestly advised me to  leave Seville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  life is not safe here, Senor,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;Lola bade me bring you this.  She has paid for her wickedness&mdash;she is dead. If our people knew you were the  cause of her accident they would surely kill you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  she died at six o&rsquo;clock this morning. She bade me urge you to fly. She was  unwilling to have another man&rsquo;s death upon her soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did she recognise me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  saw you with the man she killed, both in London and in the English country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did she torture my cousin so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  punish him for having slain her lover. She and Pep&eacute; the hunchback followed him  to Gibraltar, to Malta, to Italy, to England. When you went away with the Senor  whom they killed they waited in London and watched your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; I know. But how did they gain admission to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  paying much money to those who looked after it, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  I was right after all. Jabez and his wife had been concerned in the matter, and  no doubt had paid their own passages to America with the money they had  received from Lola. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  people showed Lola and Pep&eacute; all the secret places of the house; and so, Senor,  they were able to watch you and yet remain hidden themselves. Lola grew tired  of torturing the Senor. She was told by the woman that you would take him to  London; so she made Pep&eacute; play you over the house while she cut off the Senor&rsquo;s  head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she kill him in his sleep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  gipsy looked at me with an ambiguous smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  Senor; how should I know? Lola was cruel; it may be that she woke him to taunt  him before she cut his throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible!  horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lola  Fajardo was a terrible woman, Senor, and she is beyond your English law. Leave  Seville, Senor, or you also will die. I go, Senor; good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  took his advice. There was nothing more to detain me in Seville. There was one  question, though that I wished now I had asked; I had quite forgotten it: Why  did Lola dance in the long gallery on that night? It may have been nothing but  sheer devilry.</p>
  <p>I  wished now most fervently that I had shot her there and then. But that was not  to be. She was preserved for a more terrible death even than that. She died in  agony in the prime of her beauty, and all I can say is that she richly deserved  her fiery doom. I took back Hugh&rsquo;s head to England, and placed it in his  coffin, poor soul. And then I did my best to forget the Red Dancer and her  devilries. But, as this story is sufficient to show, I have not yet succeeded. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostinBrocade"></a>The Ghost in  Brocade</b></h2>
  <p>On  hoardings, in fields, on the covers of magazines, on the back sheets of  newspapers, an advertisement headed &ldquo;S.S.S.&rdquo; appears with the regularity of the  sun. Additional information is accorded to the curious by the expansion of these  mystic signs into the words, &ldquo;Sarah&rsquo;s Salutary Sauce&rdquo;&mdash;a condiment invented by  Sarah Brag to tickle the palates of the epicures.</p>
  <p>Her  husband, a compositor in the office of a provincial journal, made a fortune out  of it for both of them. He commenced quite in a small way by advertising it in  the columns he set up, while Sarah, renting suitable premises in the town,  personally manufactured her invention. The advertisements were read, the sauce  was approved of, and as circles on the water its fame widened round the world.  In twenty years Mr. and Mrs. Brag were almost millionaires, and having turned  their concern into a limited liability company, retired to enjoy an old age of  well-earned ease and comfort at Alliston Hall. &ldquo;S.S.S.&rdquo; did its work well, and  for once fortune bestowed her favours on the deserving.</p>
  <p>They  were wholly unlike the millionaires of commerce or of fiction, these two. For  they were neither anxious to get into society nor desirous of displaying their  wealth with ostentation. Mr. Brag, indeed, had rubbed off some of his natural  roughness whilst shouldering his way through the world, but Sarah his wife was  as much a cook as she had been when she presided over the kitchen of Alliston  Hall. Now she sat in the drawing-room, and could without doubt have set up as a  fine lady had she so desired. But her heart was ever in the back premises, and  her visits there were by no means infrequent. She remained always the  uneducated, rough, warm-hearted woman, devoted to her home and to her husband.  I knew her value better than anyone, save perhaps Helen; and both of us were  extremely fond of her, and indeed of Mr. Brag also. They were a typical Mr. and  Mrs. Boffin.</p>
  <p>But  who am I, you will ask&mdash;and who is Helen, too? Well, I who tell you this story  am Geoffrey Beauchamp, an idle Oxonian and private secretary to Mr. Brag.</p>
  <p>When  I left Balliol, my father, failing in business, took his loss of money and  reputation so seriously that he died of a broken heart, and joined my mother in  the next world, whither she had long preceded him. Finding myself an orphan,  penniless, and without a profession, I cast about for employment. I answered an  advertisement for a secretary. In this way it was that I became acquainted with  Mr. Brag. For three years past I have looked after his affairs&mdash;that is to say,  I have written his letters, advised him as best I could, and have stood between  his too kindly soul and the hungry horde of money-hunters. And he on his part  has treated me more like a son than a paid servant, which I have not failed to  appreciate. So comfortable a position and so kindly a friend come not to every  man.</p>
  <p>Then  there is Helen. She is looked upon as the daughter of the house, as indeed she  is, seeing that she was born at the Hall.</p>
  <p>When  Sir Ralph Alliston died after a spendthrift career, he left his only child  without a penny. The Hall was sold, and the proceeds went to pay off the  mortgages and the rest of the debts. So Helen, poor helpless girl, had no  choice but to go out as a governess. But Sarah Brag soon changed all that. She  remembered Helen as a child, and when the Hall was purchased by the money made  out of &ldquo;S.S.S.&rdquo; she sought out the orphan and insisted upon her returning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  my own child.&rdquo; explained the good soul; &ldquo;seen&rsquo; that &lsquo;J&rsquo; and me ain&rsquo;t bin bless&rsquo;d  with babies. Not that I&rsquo;m a lady, my dear, nor could ever have a daughter like  you. But we&rsquo;ll put it like that to satisfy the &lsquo;conveniences&rsquo; of society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  could Helen do but accept an offer so kindly and so liberally made. So she came  back to her ancestral home, and found existence made as pleasant for her as Mr.  and Mrs. Brag could make it. Then it came about that as I was young and Helen  altogether charming we fell in love with each other, much to the delight, be it  said, of our patrons. Eventually it was arranged that I should be Helen&rsquo;s  husband, and that she should expect to inherit the substantial profits from &ldquo;S.S.S.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I might advise Mr. Beauchamp,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brag, beaming, &ldquo;you should take the  name and arms of Alliston, by right of &lsquo;Elen here; so that when we are dead and  gone the old family will still be in the old place where they have been for  Lord knows what number of years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think,&rdquo;  cried Mrs. Brag, jubilantly, &ldquo;of the ancestors you&rsquo;ll have. Why there&rsquo;s a  church chock full of &lsquo;em&mdash;all knights and bar&rsquo;nites. Fine, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I agreed  that it was &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; and with Helen&rsquo;s consent, indeed at her express wish, I  promised the worthy couple to take the name of Alliston when I should lead the  last scion of the family to the altar. And this was the position of affairs  when the ghost came; and I do not think there were four happier people in the  whole world up to that time. Lady Marian spoilt it all.</p>
  <p>Lady  Marian was the ghost&rsquo;s name. She had been a Georgian beauty a couple of hundred  years ago&mdash;had rustled in silken brocade in the midst of Jacobite conspiracies.  Her husband had preferred King George to King James, and desirous of keeping  his head and property had given her to understand as much. But it would seem  that excitement was the breath of Lady Marian&rsquo;s nostrils and she made the Hall  a centre of intrigue, which included the midnight visits of Jesuit priests, of  French emissaries from his Majesty over the water, and of sulky Squires who  cursed the Hanoverian in their cups.</p>
  <p>Sir  Walter Alliston, being a jealous husband as well as a loyal subject,  disapproved of his wife&rsquo;s pranks, and accused her of using politics for the  masking of intrigues against his honour and her own. The lady, being of high  spirit, denied the accusation, and swore never again to speak to her husband.  He, more furious than ever, kept a close watch upon her, and one evening found  a masked gallant leaving her apartments. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he ran  the intruder through with his rapier. When he tore off the vizor he found to  his horror that the victim was Lady Marian herself, disguised for some  excursion. Dying, she cursed him and his, and declared that she would haunt him  and his descendants evermore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she&rsquo;s kept her word!&rdquo; said Mrs. Brag, who told me the story, &ldquo;for when Sir Walter  died she walked down the picture gallery the night before. She always comes to  tell when one of the family is to die. I &lsquo;eard as she was seen just before &lsquo;Elen&rsquo;s  father went off, and when Lady Alliston died in giving birth to that dear girl I  saw the ghost myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  Mrs. Brag! The are no such things as ghosts,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ain&rsquo;t there, but there is. I tell you, as I&rsquo;m a livin&rsquo; breathin&rsquo; woman I saw  the Lady Marian gliding along the picture gallery in brocade and &lsquo;igh-&rsquo;eeled shoes,  just as she wore when alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen the ghost since you bought the Hall, Mrs. Brag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  forbid, my dear; for if Lady Marian comes again it will only be to take away &lsquo;Elen,  seein&rsquo; as she&rsquo;s the last of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Mrs. Brag, with the superstition of an uneducated person, firmly believed in  the warning apparition. I was not surprised on returning from a month&rsquo;s holiday  in Switzerland shortly before Christmas, to find her in a state of great alarm  at the reappearance of her bugbear. Two weeks before my return Lady Marian,  brocade, high-heeled shoes, cane and all, had twice been seen in the picture  gallery&mdash;on each occasion at the midnight hour.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Brag was certain that it meant Helen&rsquo;s death, and unable utterly to keep  feeling of any kind to herself, had succeeded in infecting the whole house with  her fears. Not a servant would enter the Long Gallery, as it was called, after  dark; and even Mr. Brag, sceptic as he was, became uneasy when he came to think  of what it might mean.</p>
  <p>The  girl herself did not look so well as when I had left for my holiday. She was  pale and thin, and singularly silent. Her eyes, too, seemed unnaturally bright.  After Mrs. Brag had delivered herself of the story, and had stated her  intention of calling in the vicar to exorcise the ghost, I was left alone in  the drawing-room with Helen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  darling, you look ill,&rdquo; I said, clasping her in my arms; &ldquo;surely you do not  believe in all this nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shivered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, nervously. &ldquo;Both the housekeeper and the  butler have seen the ghost. Mrs. Brag is always talking about it, and really I  am beginning to think there must be some truth in it&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  nonsense! All this talk and fuss has made you nervous and ill; hasn&rsquo;t it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Geoffrey; I was quite well until the ghost came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  saw very plainly how matters stood. Helen was sensitive and highly strung, and  Mrs. Brag&rsquo;s foolish talk had wrought her up to such a pitch that the tortured  nerves reacted on her delicate body. She was never a strong girl, but she was  always very healthy. Worry was evidently what had made her ill. I no longer  wondered that the Allistons had died when Lady Marian was rumoured to have  appeared. They were a nervous race. I realised therefore that if I did not do  something to excorcise this spirit, if such it were, Helen would become  seriously ill, and might even die.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a good thing I returned,&rdquo; I said to Mr. Brag, when Helen retired to dress  for dinner. &ldquo;That girl will die if this sort of thing goes on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dessay, I dessay, Geoffrey; but how do you propose to stop it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  out the trick, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how do you know it&rsquo;s a trick, Geoffrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure of it. Tell me, have you seen the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;  no. I ain&rsquo;t a coward, Geoffrey, but wild &lsquo;orses wouldn&rsquo;t drag me to that  gallery at night. I ain&rsquo;t seen it, but Parsons and Mrs. Jackson &lsquo;ave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  think they have. What they have seen is some one dressed up as Lady Marian,  mark me. Or else they suffer from hallucination. Parsons is sober, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; and even if he ain&rsquo;t, Mrs. Jackson is. She never touches a drop to my  knowledge. No, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t drink, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  they both declare that they have seen the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;,  yes. They take their oaths they have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it must be a trick. And if I catch the person who is playing it I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll  make the false ghost a real one. Will you let me take charge of this matter,  Mr. Brag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, Geoffrey. I was just waitin&rsquo; for you to come back. Find out what&rsquo;s  wrong, and knock all this stuff out of my old woman&rsquo;s head. She&rsquo;s mostly in hysterics  o&rsquo; nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no wonder when Helen looks so ill. Believe me, ghosts went out when gas came  in. I think I shall manage to prove to you that this spectral Lady Marian is  very substantial flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she may not be,&rdquo; urged Mr. Brag, somewhat dubiously. &ldquo;Lots of these &lsquo;igh  families &lsquo;ave their ghosts to see &lsquo;em into the next world, I believe. Besides,  who could be playin&rsquo; this wild trick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s just what we have to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  it was not so easy to find out. I questioned Mrs. Jackson and Parsons in the  most exhaustive manner. They corroborated each other&rsquo;s story with such  verisimilitude and wealth of detail as to leave no doubt in my mind of their  good faith. Evidently they had seen a brocaded lady in the picture gallery;  but, of course, it could be no such thing as a visitant from the other world.  That was where they went wrong. I was certain it was someone playing a trick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you may laugh, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jackson. She was such a stiff old dame. &ldquo;But I  do assure you that I saw the ghost with my own eyes. I was coming through the  long gallery from Miss Alliston&rsquo;s room and in the moonlight it came on, clack,  clack, clack, in high-heeled shoes. I could hear distinctly the rustle of the  dress, and as it swept past me I smelt a perfume like that of dried roseleaves.  It was Lady Marian sure enough, as I saw from the portrait in the gallery. I  fainted dead away, Mr. Beauchamp, sir; and when I came to myself it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  confess to feeling a trifle uncomfortable at all this. Then Parsons took up the  story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t faint, sir, not bein&rsquo; a woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but my flesh was mighty creepy  as it went past. I stared at it like a stuck pig, though it was plain enough in  the moonlight. It vanished all of a sudden by the painted winder at the end of  the gallery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were you doing in the Long Gallery at that hour, Parsons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo;  from master, sir. He&rsquo;d a bad cold, and I took him up some &lsquo;ot rum and water. I  wouldn&rsquo;t go to that there gallery again, sir, for all the crown jewels. It was  a ghost, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  was it!&rdquo; said I, showing plainly by my tone that I did not think it was. &ldquo;Call  the servants Parsons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes all the domestics in the house were assembled, and a very  white-faced crowd they were. Many of them would have been frightened away from  the Hall had it not been that the place was such a good one. I suppose, too, it  was a case in which they felt there was comfort in numbers. I harangued them  pretty freely for what I termed their nonsensical fears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men  and women come to years of sense,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;well&mdash;I&rsquo;m surprised. How can you  believe such rubbish. Some one of you is playing a trick; and who it is I shall  find out, so beware all of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of  course they protested vehemently. But that was to be expected. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; I  said, &ldquo;you can take this warning from me. I shall watch in the gallery myself  with a straight-shooting revolver, and if that ghost appears it shall have a  taste of it. I am not going to have your master and mistress and Miss Alliston  frightened by this silly trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  they all protested. But I sent the lot of them away with more blood in their  cheeks. Then I turned upstairs to dress for dinner. As I did so I noticed a  pretty, timid-looking young woman whose face I did not recognise. She glanced  at me uneasily, and was evidently disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; I asked, abruptly, pausing before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jane  Roirdan, sir,&rdquo; she replied with a curtsey. &ldquo; I am new here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under-housemaid,  sir. Oh, please, sir, do you really think there is a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you silly girl. The dead never return to this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,  sir, what about the Witch of Endor and Samuel, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are a theologian, I see. Well we won&rsquo;t discuss that apparition. You must  just look upon that as a miracle and not be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shuddered, and looked over her shoulder apprehensively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am terribly afraid, sir, it&rsquo;s no use my denying it. I shall ask mistress to let  me go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will ask nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said I in my most peremptory manner. &ldquo;Your going  would only be the signal for general flight. You&rsquo;ll stay here like a sensible  girl, until all this mystery is cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir, but will it be cleared up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course it will, and by a very substantial leaden bullet, too. Now get on with  your work and don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I saw  that there was only one way to deal with the thing, so that I spoke more  brusquely to the girl than I would have otherwise done. Besides, she irritated  me; she seemed so absolutely terrified with fear. She was calculated to infect  the rest of them, though they seemed bad enough as it was. I went off to dress  in no very good humour.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brag&rsquo;s want of common sense over this affair amazed me. Usually he was a cool  headed and logical man as was conclusively proved by the position to which he  had attained. Yet apparently he was as nervous and distaught now, as any of the  women. The ghost seemed to have been too much for him; to have knocked the grit  out of him, so to speak. He was no more fit than a baby to deal with the  situation. I put down his short-coming at this juncture in no small degree to  his lack of education.</p>
  <p>Then  there was the constant chatter of his wife, of whom this element of the  supernatural had taken firm hold. She never ceased talking about it, and I  suppose the strongest mind is in the end influenced by reiteration. It seemed  as if Mr. Brag&rsquo;s were becoming unhinged.</p>
  <p>I  was glad that I returned so opportunely. At least if I could throw no light on  the subject I could go to work with a cool head and an unprejudiced mind to  clear it up.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Brag continued to talk of little else but the ghost, whose appearance she  seemed to think was quite in keeping with the season. It was astounding the  numbers of legends she seemed to have accumulated. Headless phantoms,  churchyard apparitions, ghosts in armour, and clanking chains and &ldquo;presences,&rdquo;  who she said could not be seen but only felt in the most horrific way&mdash;upon all  these she descanted in the most appalling manner. Helen shuddered, Mr. Brag  shook his head portentously, and I must confess that even I felt uncomfortable.  The old lady seemed so to environ us with the atmosphere of the supernatural  that when a coal dropped from the fire we all jumped, and she shrieked. It was  really a most terrible state of things especially for Christmas.</p>
  <p>I  asked her about Jane Riordan. My question fortunately turned the subject, for  it seemed that Mrs. Brag had a good deal to say about this young woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;hers is a sad history, my dear. Her father and mother were  fellow-servants of mine when I was cook here. The name wasn&rsquo;t Riordan, for that&rsquo;s  Jane&rsquo;s married name. Craik&rsquo;s what we called &lsquo;em&mdash;&rsquo;Enry and Liza Craik, butler  and housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen  looked up with interest. &ldquo;Henry Craik?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why that was the man who  stole my mother&rsquo;s jewels!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same, my dear. Oh, he was a bad one he was; but yet you&rsquo;d think butter wouldn&rsquo;t  melt in &lsquo;is mouth to look at &lsquo;im. Liza was always sayin&rsquo; as &lsquo;e &lsquo;d die in goal  and disgrace &lsquo;er, and &lsquo;e did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  the jewels recovered Mrs. Brag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Geoffrey, they weren&rsquo;t. My Lady missed &lsquo;em one morning after a ball &lsquo;ere, when  the &lsquo;ouse was full of guests. The whole box was stolen&mdash;five or six thousand  pounds&rsquo; worth, no less; and she only saved what she wore at the ball. All kinds  of people were suspected of &lsquo;aving gone to &lsquo;er room and taken &lsquo;em, but no one  thought as Craik had done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard something of the story myself,&rdquo; observed Mr. Brag. &ldquo;He was caught selling  a bracelet, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  J., he was. He got leave to visit a dying friend in London, the old fox; and  the friend was a pawnbroker, and &lsquo;e told the police, seein&rsquo; as &lsquo;e recognised  the bracelet from the &lsquo;and bills put about. Craik was arrested and sent to goal  for years. He died there, and they never got anything out of &lsquo;im. Where he hid  the jewels no one knows, and no one ever will, my dears; for twenty years &lsquo;ave  gone by since they were stolen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how does Jane Riordan come to be here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  mother died the other day and sent her to me, my dear. &lsquo;Liza and I were born in  the village and lived here for years as &lsquo;ousekeeper and cook. I can&rsquo;t say as I  liked &lsquo;er over much, she was sly and deceitful; but I don&rsquo;t think she had  anything to do with Craik stealing the jewels. He was bad enough to do that by  himself. When he died in goal Liza wrote to me, and I sent her money to bring  up Jane. Then Jane married a bad husband, who left &lsquo;er and when Liza died she  came &lsquo;ere and asked me to &lsquo;elp &lsquo;er for &lsquo;er mother&rsquo;s sake. So I made &lsquo;er under-&lsquo;ousemaid.  I think she&rsquo;s a fool, Geoffrey, but honest enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  appeared to be nervous, however.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no wonder with this &lsquo;orrid ghost,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Brag, looking round. &ldquo;I tell you  what, J., if you don&rsquo;t get the parson to exorcise that thing, I&rsquo;ll leave the &lsquo;ouse,  that I will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steady,  old lady, we must see what Geoffrey can do first. He&rsquo;s watching in the Long  Gallery tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh,  Geoffrey, the ghost &lsquo;ll &lsquo;ave you for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  ghost will have a dose of lead, Mrs. Brag. If you hear a shot, don&rsquo;t be  alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t shoot ghosts, Geoffrey, they&rsquo;re shadows, my dear. You can see through  &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. I never saw one myself. But this ghost is pretty substantial I&rsquo;ll be  bound. But tell me, Mrs. Brag; was anything ever found out about the jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Helen, before the old lady could answer. &ldquo;I remember my father searched  everywhere for them and offered a big reward. He saw Craik, too: but he refused  to say what he had done with them, and Mrs. Craik protested she knew nothing  about it. They have been lost for years now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m  I wonder if Jane Riordan knows anything about them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brag, with energy. &ldquo;Liza was an honest woman I know; and  the gal seems straight enough. If they&rsquo;d &lsquo;ad the jewels they wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ave  lived in poverty so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  Craik might have told his wife where he concealed them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  Geoffrey, dear. She&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave come to my Lady or Sir Ralph about them, and got  paid for bringing &lsquo;em back. If she knew anything she&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave told for &lsquo;er own  sake: for she was as poor as poor. Jane told me the most &lsquo;arrowing tales of &lsquo;ardship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  question Jane myself,&rdquo; said I, after some thought. &ldquo;If these jewels could be  recovered they would suit Helen very well.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Helen  laughed and Mrs. Brag beamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  its jewels she wants I will give &lsquo;er &lsquo;eaps. Won&rsquo;t I, J.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  only to ask and to &lsquo;ave,&rdquo; said Mr. Brag; &ldquo;but I wish I saw you more rosy and &lsquo;ealthy,  my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid this ghost is upsetting my nerves terribly,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;do what I will  I can&rsquo;t help thinking about it&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  J., can&rsquo;t we &lsquo;ave some &lsquo;oly water and get it away?&rdquo; implored Mrs. Brag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oly  water, no. I won&rsquo;t have no popery here, Sarah. S.S.S. shall never go to fatten  the priests if I can &lsquo;elp it. I&rsquo;m surprised at you, I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is over-wrought, Mr. Brag,&rdquo; said Helen, rising. &ldquo;Indeed, I think we all are,  with this horrid Lady Marian about. Come along to bed, Mrs. Brag. I&rsquo;ll come up  with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have to stay with me all night, my dear,&rdquo; whimpered the old lady, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t  know as Geoffrey firin&rsquo; off pistols won&rsquo;t be as bad as the ghost. Are you goin&rsquo;  to stay up too, J.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no necessity,&rdquo; I interposed. &ldquo;I can watch quite well alone. When Mr. Brag  hears a shot he can come to me if he likes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll come fast enough,&rdquo; said the old man, sturdily; &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t flesh and blood I&rsquo;m  scared of, though I don&rsquo;t like the other thing. However, if the blessed thing  belongs to this world or the next it&rsquo;s quite certain we&rsquo;ve got to put a stop to  its goin&rsquo;s on &lsquo;ere. If you don&rsquo;t catch it, Geoffrey, we&rsquo;ll shut up the house  and go abroad. I&rsquo;m getting quite skeery myself, and I ain&rsquo;t got over much nerve  to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let me try my hand at exorcising the thing, Mr. Brag. If I can&rsquo;t manage it we&rsquo;ll  do what you say. Helen will die if this sort of thing goes on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord,  you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s come for &lsquo;er?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t. It is some trick, I tell you. Leave me to find it out,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brag shook his head doubtfully and retired to bed in his turn. Left alone I  started on an exploration of the house with a lamp in one hand and a revolver  in the other. I examined all the doors and windows, and found them securely  bolted and barred. I looked into what rooms I could, from cellar to attic, and  found them empty. It was quite clear that beyond the inmates of the house there  was no one. Then I made for the happy hunting ground of the ghost.</p>
  <p>It  had lately been snowing, but now the night was frosty and clear. A bright moon  dispelled the darkness and the white world without was as clear as day.</p>
  <p>The  Long Gallery stretched the whole length of the west wing. On one side a row of  tall windows admitted a good light on to the pictures on the opposite wall.  There was a fair collection of these, but the Allistons had never been  sufficiently artistic in their tastes, or sufficiently acute in their judgment,  to acquire masterpieces.</p>
  <p>The  portraits of Helen&rsquo;s ancestors were of most interest to me. There was a long  series of them, dating from the Tudor time and representing some of the best  work of the masters. These were let into the oak panelling with their gilded  frames, and could not be detached from the wall. At the further end of the gallery  was an ornate window of stained glass, and through this the moonlight fell, now  weaving coloured arabesques of the floor and portraits. Here I paused before  the picture of Lady Marian Alliston.</p>
  <p>She  must have been a supremely beautiful woman, this Jacobite conspirator, with the  high spirit and strong will. Here she was portrayed as tall and stately of  figure. A proud expression was on her almost swarthy face, and in the  slenderest of white hands she gripped a walking-cane. In a dress of rich  brocade, with jewels on neck and arms, red-heeled shoes, and the towering  head-dress of the period, she looked every inch a queen, and in her day must  surely have moved and ruled as one. I could imagine those imperious brows  frowning at the mention of the Elector! I could fancy those firm lips speaking  the curse on her too hasty husband. There was something about this fair dead  woman which reminded me of Beatrix Esmond; filled with the joy of life and born  to dominate by the power of beauty and intellect. Yet she failed as Thackeray&rsquo;s  heroine failed; but died more nobly, in the prime of loveliness without  withering out into sad old age. Had Sir Walter&rsquo;s rapier not struck through the  proud heart she might have been a Sarah Jennings. As it was she was thwarted by  Fate; and it was her sad destiny to appear as a bird of ill-omen to those who  sat in her seat of pride. Yet I could imagine her wrath when alive at the idea  that her fair phantom would descend to scaring an old cook and her plebian  husband. How ironical a fate!</p>
  <p>But  all this preamble leads to nothing. Although I watched in the gallery until  dawn I saw no ghost. It was bitterly cold; and the vigil was uncomfortable and  in vain. Lady Marian did not appear. I did not even hear the rustle of her  skirts, much less set eyes on her face; and when I descended to breakfast,  after an hour or so of sleep, it was to laugh at the superstitions of my  friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is as I thought,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Parsons and Mrs. Jackson both dreamed they saw the  phantom. Lady Marian is too wise to revisit the scene of her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but she don&rsquo;t appear every night,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Brag, wisely. &ldquo;You wait,  Geoffrey. She&rsquo;ll freeze your blood yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  while she knows that an armed watcher has his eye on her, Mrs. Brag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  still believe it is a trick, Geoffrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Lady Marian&rsquo;s phantom is not merely the creation of Parson&rsquo;s and Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s  dreams, I still believe it is a trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  trick or no trick, all my vigils were in vain. Night after night for quite two  weeks I watched in that infernal gallery for the ghost which never came. Yet  notwithstanding my disappointment I could not rid myself of the feeling that  there was some mystery about the apparition. It was possible that my public  announcement to shoot the so-called ghost had scared the person who, I truly  believed, represented it. With this idea I went on a new tack, and once more  assembled the household.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have watched for fourteen nights, more or less,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and no ghost has come  to scare me. Therefore, I believe Mr. Parsons and Mrs. Jackson have been deceived  in thinking they saw one. There is no phantom here, so you can all set your  minds at rest. For my part,&rdquo; and this was the most important point of my  speech, &ldquo;I intend to watch no more. If Lady Marian comes again she must go  without an audience. Now all of you go away, and let me have no more of this  rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Butler  and housekeeper were both indignant at my aspersions, but they knew better than  to protest openly, and went away with the rest of the servants to grumble in  secret. An air of calm pervaded the table, and Mrs. Brag began to pluck up  courage. Also Helen, to prove what was undermining her health, became more  cheerful and less hysterical. My common sense had exorcised the ghost so far,  but it had not solved the mystery. Determined to fathom this I still continued  to watch in the gallery. But no one knew of my vigils, not even Helen; so if  the trickster came, he or she, whatsoever it might be, would find me waiting.</p>
  <p>For  two or three nights the gallery was empty as the palm of my hand. But on the  fourth night my chance came, and with it the ghost.</p>
  <p>It  was about midnight, and the moon shining through the clear glass of the side  windows and reflecting her light from an expanse of snow made the gallery  almost as brilliant as day. I was hidden behind a curtain, midway along the  gallery, and half drowsily was looking out into the maze of shadow and silver  radiance. Suddenly in the absolute stillness I heard a faint sound. It was a  tapping of heels, the rustle of silk skirts, and in a moment under the painted  window I saw the ghost. It appeared from nowhere, and I must confess it  startled me very considerably.</p>
  <p>It  was Lady Marian sure enough. I was sufficiently close to it to see that. There  she stood, with the tall head-dress and cane, and rich brocaded gown, exactly  as she was represented in her portrait. I caught just a glimpse of her face,  but it was not sufficient for me to say with certainty whether it was identical  with that in the picture. But the figure was certainly the same. I sat quite  still and watched, and waited, one finger ready on the trigger of my revolver.</p>
  <p>With  the clacking sound described by Mrs. Jackson it came down the gallery. The  stick tapped, and the long train rustled, and the moonlight played upon the  rich hues of the brocade. It did not come near me, but kept close by the range  of the family pictures, fingering the frames and passing its white hand over  the surfaces. At times it stopped, and with bent head scrutinised more closely  the faces of the portraits. Then it began to glide back more swiftly than it  had come. I rose, perhaps too incautiously, and I must have made some noise,  for before I could raise my revolver to take aim the ghost started, retreated  rapidly towards the painted window, and vanished.</p>
  <p>Yes,  before my very eyes it vanished. I hurried to the spot where I had last seen  it, but not a trace of anything could I find. Unless it had dropped through the  floor or had passed through a solid wall I could not see for the life of me how  it had got away. Could it be a true phantom after all? No, my reason wouldn&rsquo;t allow  such a supposition. Beyond doubt it was flesh and blood&mdash;some member of the  household got up to resemble Lady Marian. I was more than ever perplexed.</p>
  <p>I  related everything to Mr. Brag next morning. But he kept my story carefully  from his wife and Helen. They were recovering their spirits somewhat, and it  would not do to damp them again by saying that I had seen the thing myself. Mr.  Brag, indeed, was considerably agitated at this seeming confirmation of the  apparition, and it was as much as ever I could do to talk him out of the  conviction that spiritual it was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what on earth can it be, man?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  I replied, &ldquo;I have some sort of idea, but at present I won&rsquo;t state it lest I  should prove to be wrong. I propose that you watch with me to-night, Mr. Brag,  and together we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t unmask the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  do you think it will come again tonight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. Perhaps not. It may be that the trickster, whoever it may be, has  had a fright and will delay further operations for a while. It is someone in  the house, I am convinced of that. When I announced that I would watch nothing  was seen of it. But directly I said I would give up watching, Lady Marian  appears. What we must do is to watch regularly, Mr. Brag; even should it not  appear for a week or more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  turned out that I was right. Night after night we concealed ourselves behind  the curtain, I with my revolver, Brag with a large dinner bell, with which he  intended alarming the house when Lady Marian was captured. This went on for no  less than ten nights. Then I took Mrs. Brag and Helen into confidence and  arranged a pretended departure from the house. I went off to London with great  fuss and ceremony. But I got out of the train at the first station and returned  to the hall by road secretly. And at eleven o&rsquo;clock that night Brag and I were  in our hiding place once more. And it was Christmas Eve, the very time when  ghosts should be abroad, according to legend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  I whispered, &ldquo;the ghost is off its guard; take my word for it he or she,  whichever it is, will come.&rdquo; Brag said nothing, but gripped viciously at the  handle of his dinner-bell.</p>
  <p>It  fell out as I had anticipated. Shortly after midnight Lady Marian reappeared in  the same guise as before. I could hear Brag&rsquo;s teeth chattering as he saw the  apparition. The moonlight was as strong as it had been on the previous  occasion, and Lady Marian, clacking and tapping as before, moved through it in  precisely the same way. She glided along by the pictures and fingered the  frames. Suddenly we heard her give a joyous exclamation, and there was a  sliding sound as of something pushed back. A portrait vanished, and a black  cavity was seen in its place.</p>
  <p>Now  was the time. I jumped up, and poising my revolver fired as truly as I could,  and at the same moment Brag&rsquo;s bell clanged out vigorously. There &nbsp;was a shriek and a hurried scamper. Then as  before the ghost of Lady Marian vanished before we could reach the spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  the deuce has she gone?&rdquo; cried Brag, who was still ringing his bell hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Through  a sliding panel,&rdquo; I replied, guessing the means of exit was through the cavity.</p>
  <p>As  I lighted the lamp there was more noise and pattering of feet, and the  half-dressed servants in all stages of d&eacute;shabille and alarm came crowding into  the gallery. Some carried lights, others pokers and sticks, but one and all  were as frightened as they well could be.</p>
  <p>And  no wonder; for the clamour of Brag&rsquo;s bell was enough to wake the dead. Then  came Helen and Mrs. Brag fully dressed, for they both had waited up to witness  the success of my scheme.</p>
  <p>And  it was a success&mdash;greater than I had dared to dream. As I said, a picture&mdash;that  of Lady Marian had vanished&mdash;that is it had slid back into the wall, leaving a cavity  which we proceeded to examine.</p>
  <p>Therein  we found an iron box fast locked. But Brag soon had it torn open, to find that  it contained velvet-lined drawers and trays all heaped with the most splendid  jewellery. Gold, diamonds, rubies, emeralds &mdash;the mass glittered like a rainbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,  Helen, your mother&rsquo;s long lost jewels. So this is what the ghost of Lady Marian  came for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  gracious!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Brag, dropping on her knees. &ldquo;Look, my dear, all my Lady&rsquo;s  jewels! You&rsquo;ll wear them at your wedding after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Helen did not look at them. She just stared at me, nervous and shaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Geoffery,  who is the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  you guess? Jane Riordan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!  Isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  miss,&rdquo; said Parsons, glancing round at the servants, &ldquo;she ain&rsquo;t with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Geoffrey, I hope you haven&rsquo;t shot her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serve  &lsquo;er right if &lsquo;e &lsquo;as,&rdquo; cried Brag. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t cry, my pretty, she went through  another sliding panel. Come, Geoffrey, let us look.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  spring is in the frame, Mr. Brag. I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  a dozen hands were busy with the frames, and we soon came upon a spring in that  of a picture at the far end of the gallery. It opened noiselessly, and I  stepped into the open space, followed by Brag bearing the lamp. We proceeded  along a narrow passage, ascended a flight of stone steps and finally emerged  through another sliding panel into the back part of the house. On our way we  picked up the tall cane, the grey wig and head-dress and the brocade skirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  stripped herself to get away,&rdquo; said Brag, nodding. &ldquo;Let us go to her room. She  has one to herself, you know. Asked my old woman to give her one as a special  favour; and for Eliza Craik&rsquo;s sake she got it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  room was reached and we found it empty, with the last remnants of the disguise  on the floor. On going to the back door we discovered that it was open, and  through it Jane Riordan had vanished into the night never to return.</p>
  <p>So  it was that I exorcised the ghost of Lady Marian. On Christmas Day at breakfast  we discussed thoroughly the stirring events of the night. Mrs. Brag was filled  with anger at the way in which Jane Riordan had tricked her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder how she knew about my Lady&rsquo;s jewels,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s no difficulty in guessing that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The father must have told  his wife where he had hidden them. I daresay he intended to fetch them himself  when he came out of goal. But he died before his sentence expired. However, he  let his wife know, and she, of course, told Jane, who came here and tried to  get them by masquerading as Lady Marian&rsquo;s ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Eliza must have told her that story, Geoffrey. We often talked of the ghost.  Oh, what a wicked woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I wonder why Mrs. Craik, being poor, did not try to get the jewels for herself.  She would hardly wait twenty years before doing so.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>It  was Helen who said this, and I who replied. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I expect Mrs. Craik was either afraid, or did not learn from her husband behind  which picture the jewels were hidden. I expect her reason was the last; for  Jane, as I told you, went up and down the wall fingering the frames in order to  find the right one. That was why she appeared so often in the gallery. Had she  known the true hiding-place one appearance and visit would have done. I see now  that she feigned fear to me in order to ward off suspicion. From her looks I  never thought she would be so clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brag, &ldquo;she married a scamp, and I daresay, after hearing  the story from &lsquo;Liza&rsquo; he put her up to the trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  brought the dress with her, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have; and it was to carry on her wicked pranks that she made such a point  of having a separate room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder how she knew of the secret passage,&rdquo; said Brag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liza  again,&rdquo; cried his wife. &ldquo;She was years here before I came, and so was Craik. I  daresay they found the secret passage together and made use of it when they  stole the jewels. And now I come to think of it, my dears, it was an actor Jane  Riordan married. Oh, I&rsquo;m well quit of her, I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes,  thank goodness she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Brag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t want no row about the thing. We&rsquo;ve got the jewels, and Helen shall wear  them on her wedding day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;ve got rid of the ghost,&rdquo; said I, smiling. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you  can ever believe in ghosts again after this, eh, Mrs. Brag?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Geoffery, I can&rsquo;t. I daresay the ghost of Lady Marian that I saw myself was  either Craik or his wife dressed up. No, I&rsquo;ll never believe in ghosts again.&rdquo;  Nor did she.</p>
  <p>So  this was our Christmas ghost, which was no ghost. But true or false it was a  very seasonable apparition; and brought to Helen the Christmas gift of her  mother&rsquo;s jewels. She wore them at her wedding with me shortly afterwards; for  next Christmas there was no Miss Alliston, but a pretty Mrs. Beauchamp. Nor was  there any ghost. Lady Marian, in the person of Jane Riordan, had fulfilled her  mission, and we never saw her again. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRedStar"></a>The Red Star</b></h2>
  <p>There  are some memories so terrible, that when they recur to the unthinking brain,  they have the power to make one retrace its steps, and return once more to the  moment when the events of which they are the tragic shadows took place.</p>
  <p>They  are portions of a man&rsquo;s life, and when he least suspects their presence, they  suddenly display themselves to his shuddering gaze.</p>
  <p>Every  son of Adam, be his life ever so blameless, has, in his time, visited Hell, and  brought from thence a memory which, filling the visionary scope of his mind&rsquo;s  eye, haunts him for evermore. He shrinks back appalled, he would fain shut out  the horrible phantom; but look he must, for by his side it remains, mocking his  futile efforts to exorcise its ghastly being. At times it fades into the  unseen, only to return at some untoward moment with troublous persistence.</p>
  <p>My  haunting memory is of a red star,&mdash;nay, no planetary splendour do I indicate by  such a term, neither Mars nor Aldebaran, nor fiery Sirius, but an  earth-begotten star which nightly burned from the topmost window of a tall  tower. Behind, a clear evening sky; in front, a sombre mass of turret, and  gable and battlement, clustering round the base of a lean minaret, which from  its height gave forth a crimson gleam of angry seeming.</p>
  <p>On  the black waters of the morass encircling the building it flared with baleful  savagery, piercing the sullen darkness of the night. Seated at the window of  the inn, I could mark it dominating the whole scene with its malign influence.  I saw it then, I see it now, and under its malevolence a man lying prone on the  quaking surface of the marsh, gazing palid-faced wild-eyed at the ebon pool, on  whose breast float traitor bubbles, telling of horror and of death. </p>
  <p>The  window of a chemist&rsquo;s shop, the commonplace signals of a great railway station,  or the starboard lights of a channel steamer, each brings to my mind the memory  of that red star. Then do I turn cold with fear. Then do I seek in theatre, in  dance, in travel, a forgetfulness of that tall tower with its scarlet eye. In  vain my quest for oblivion; for the horror thrusts itself unannounced before my  mental gaze. I leave the present, I return to the past, there to find the red  star burning like an unquenchable witch-light.</p>
  <p>This  bizarre episode of my life occurred some years since, when I was on a walking  tour in Essex. An artist by profession I combined business with pleasure by  sketching a great deal during my desultory wanderings, so when I arrived at the  little village of E&mdash;I was rejoiced that I had a good record to show to Hadrian.</p>
  <p>He  was an author. One whose pen (more graphic than my pencil) had brought him  fame. I was delighted when he proposed that we should, in partnership, write  and illustrate a small book of English strollings. Hitherto my ambition had  been confined to mere dilettantism, but now the offer of Hadrian inspired me  with the desire for a certain notoriety (scarcely to be called fame), and I  impatiently awaited his arrival at our appointed meeting-place, the Golden  Plover Inn.</p>
  <p>Business  had detained him in town, else had we journeyed in company; but as it was, I  sauntered for a whole fortnight through the pleasant English counties, in the  hope that he would join me ere I reached E&mdash;. No such overtaking occurred, and  at The Golden Plover I awaited his coming.</p>
  <p>The  landlord was an oddity, with a twist of originality in his character, and  showed himself, notwithstanding a certain stateliness of demeanour, disposed to  be companionable. At the conclusion of my supper I sat by the casement of the  parlour with a consoling pipe, while the host&mdash;John Ruth was his name&mdash;stalked  stiff as Malvolio about the room. This hinting at sociability being at the  moment much to my taste, I invited him to crack a bottle of port in my company.  Nothing loth he accepted the invitation. Thus having mutually arranged for a  pleasant evening Ruth went off to his cellar, and I, in a pleasing state of  weariness, begotten by a long day on my legs, viewed the landscape from the  parlour window.</p>
  <p>A  prospect more wild, dreary and eloquent of desolation, could scarcely be  conceived. In the uncertain light&mdash;for it was now the twilight hour&mdash;it took on  an unwholesome look which struck a chill into my being. The village was not far  from the sea, and the uncanny seeming of the outlook was the more accentuated  by the hollow boom of unseen waves. I could hear but could not see these  complaining breakers, and this hidden presence, betraying itself only by dreary  moanings, seemed a fitting type of the intangible horror which environed The  Grange.</p>
  <p>The  inn being at the end of the village, there was no dwelling beyond save this  cumbrous mass rising portentously against the luminous sky. Past my window ran  the hard line of the high road, beyond this a stretch of sullen marsh spreading  like a witch garden in front of the mansion. On a slight rise it bulked  disproportionately in the landscape, and from its blackness a tall, lean tower  shot upward, as though the house were lifting a warning finger. As is the case  with some faces, a history is suggested by some houses, and I felt sure that a  gruesome story was attached to this sullen mansion lying betwixt marsh and sea.  The dull roar of the waves might have told the story, or I might have gained some  legendary fragments from the sighing wind, but unversed in nature&rsquo;s voices I  could translate neither boom nor sigh, and was therefore compelled to apply for  information to the landlord. At this period of my reflections he entered the  room, with the port and candles, much to my relief, for the influence of that  lonely house was depressing in the extreme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the name of the place?&rdquo; I asked abruptly, as he set down his burden on the  table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  sir,&rdquo; replied Ruthy with stately slowness, &ldquo;is called The Grange, where Lady  Selwyn dwells.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Is anyone bold enough to live in that tomb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a tomb!&rdquo; assented the landlord with a certain apprehension. &ldquo;I only trust it  is nothing worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  shook his head significantly, poured out two glasses of wine, and pushed one  towards my end of the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a God-forsaken place, sir, and they do say haunted. I am not superstitious  myself, Mr. Faloise, but I feel the horror of that house. Something in that  house,&rdquo; he added earnestly, &ldquo;cries bitterly at night. It is neither of earth  nor of heaven, and it moans &mdash; moans in the darkness like a lost spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  words chilled me with a feeling of vague horror. I would have spoken but that  he reflectively sipped his wine and pursued his speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should a rich and beautiful lady shut herself up in that dreary house? Why  should she live in solitude and only come out at night-time? She is young, she  is beautiful; but long years of horror have aged her face and cursed her soul.  What is the Thing that moans in the darkness? I have asked her when she has  come here but she has made no reply. Yet, Mr. Faloise, at every visit I can see  a fresh mark of hell on the beauty of her face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  comes out at night, you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  at night! When the red star shines!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  red star?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;  he cried, clutching my arm with one hand, and pointing through the window with  the other.</p>
  <p>I  felt a certain qualm of horror, and mechanically turned my eyes towards the  Grange. There, from the height of the tower, burned a fierce red light, which  in the gathering darkness did indeed look like an evil star.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  night it shines,&rdquo; resumed Ruth, wiping his brow. &ldquo;Every night the Thing moans.  No ones live there, save Lady Selwyn and her old servant, yet when they come to  this place the red star shines, the Thing cries. Hark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  faint wailing cry swept past the house and died away in the distance. We looked  at one another in silent dread, and once more Ruth wiped his brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  goes on like that,&rdquo; he said, hastily finishing his wine, &ldquo;constantly. For two  years it has been going on. I will never get used to it, Mr. Faloise. I wish  the whole of that accursed house would sink deep in the morass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  morass?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay!  Facing the mansion is no firm land, but merely a quaking bog, the crossing of  which means death to the unwary. Behind is the sea, in front is the marsh; so  you see, Mr. Faloise, those who dwell in that house are well defended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Defended!&rdquo;  I echoed, puzzled, at the strangely chosen word. &ldquo;Why should the house be  defended?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  now know as much as I do,&rdquo; replied Ruth obstinately; &ldquo;you have seen the red  star, you have heard the Thing crying. There is some hellish secret about The  Grange, Mr. Faloise, but no one can reveal it save Lady Selwyn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  what is that?&rdquo; I cried, with a thrill of fear, as a dark figure flitted past  the window, followed by the dancing light of a swinging lantern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is Lady Selwyn and her servant,&rdquo; said the landlord, laying aside his pipe; &ldquo;they  come nightly for provisions&mdash;wine and such like. Excuse me for a moment, Mr.  Faloise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this he vanished, and I was left alone to ruminate over the strange history he  had told me&mdash;no history either, but rather a suggestion of mystery, of infinite  dread. I looked at the menacing tower, at the red star flaring in the windy  night. This hinting of nameless horrors was too much for my nerves. Suddenly,  overcome by an overwhelming curiosity I left the window, I left the room, and  sought the keeper of the secret&mdash;Lady Selwyn.</p>
  <p>Draped  in a long black cloak, she was standing in the porch with the lantern bearer,  an old woman who I guessed was her servant. The yellow light of the candle held  by the landlord struck full on her face. Beautiful exceedingly was that  countenance, but on the lovely face and in the eyes lurked the apprehensive  look of a hunted beast. Ruth hearing my steps, turned suddenly, thereby  throwing the light on to my features. The next instant, with a strange cry,  Lady Selwyn darted forward like a madwoman. Laying her thin hands on my  shoulders, she devoured my face with her eyes. I felt her shaking through the  whole length of her body, but so thunderstruck was I that the Medusa beauty of  her face turned me, as it were, to stone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; she asked, in a low, fierce voice, pressing hardly on my shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hugh  Faloise&mdash;an artist,&rdquo; I stammered, thinking it best to humour her caprice. &ldquo;I am  here on a walking tour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away at once,&rdquo; hissed Lady Selwyn, shaking me like a reed. &ldquo;Do you hear me? Go  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  uttering these words she faced round abruptly as to depart, then snatching the  light from Ruth held it to my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  hair! his eyes! his mouth!&rdquo; she muttered eagerly. &ldquo;So like him once. Heavens!  to think what he is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  convulsive shudder shook her from head to foot. Dropping the candle, she drew  the hood of her cloak over her face and fled away into the night, followed by  the woman with the lantern. We were left in darkness (for the candle had been  extinguished), thunderstruck at the episode. Then past the house floated that  moaning cry, and with one accord we dashed back into the parlour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t stay here another week,&rdquo; said Ruth with an oath; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s killing work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  whole affair was so weird, that I could not blame him for his fear. Indeed I  also was trembling, and it took two glasses of wine to restore my courage.</p>
  <p>On  recovering my nerve I pulled out my sketchbook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do, sir?&rdquo; asked Ruth, observing my action curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Draw  Lady Selwyn&rsquo;s face from memory.&rdquo; While I did so, he looked over my shoulder,  seemingly disinclined to leave my company. Two years had not reconciled him to  the evil atmosphere of the place. I did not wonder at that, but I did wonder  how it was he was not in a lunatic asylum. Two days would have been enough for  me, not to speak of two years. I have no relish for devildom. Lady Selwyn&rsquo;s  eccentric conduct had upset me thoroughly. I could hardly draw the portrait;  not that I had forgotten the face, but because my hand was shaking. This sort  of thing in a lone inn slackens a man&rsquo;s nerve and renders him incapable of  doing justice to his profession. Mine was that of an artist, but no one would  have thought so had they seen the portrait, drawn from memory, of Lady Selwyn.  When I say no one I mean no cultured person, for Ruth said it was a speaking  likeness. But then he was not an artist and I was; whereby I saw the faults and  he did not. However, horrors considering, it was passable and pleased me  mightily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo;  said I, signing my name to the drawing &ldquo;I am going to stay here and  investigate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Investigate  what, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  mystery. Light, voice, and woman. A most unholy trinity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  find nothing, sir,&rdquo; said the landlord, emphatically. &ldquo;I have tried for a year  and failed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  well, I will try for a year also and shall not fail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ruth  pointed towards the red star.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like a danger signal,&rdquo; he said, solemnly. &ldquo;Better leave it alone, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  wish I had taken his advice&mdash;now.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>I  made a discovery that night; one which surprised me largely. When a man has  reached the age of thirty years without knowing the inner meaning of the word &ldquo;love&rdquo;  he has a right to feel surprised on acquiring that knowledge without study. I  did not seek love, on the contrary love&mdash;in the person of Lady Selwyn&mdash;hunted me  out: consequently I was not a free agent in the matter. At the time I hardly  analysed the affair in this fashion for the discovery was somewhat  overwhelming. I tossed on an uneasy pillow all night wondering what disease had  seized me, and matters were hardly improved by my lighting the candle at  intervals to look at the picture. All the horror of red star and wailing voice  was forgotten by me, my brain being fully occupied by the thought that Lady  Selwyn was a beautiful woman whom I adored. I offer no opinion on this matter,  but simply set down the existing facts.</p>
  <p>Being  in this dazed condition I was naturally anxious to confide my troubles to  someone. Ruth was scarcely an inviting repository. I knew nobody in the  neighbourhood, and self-communion was unsatisfactory; therefore the most  obvious course was to await the coming of Hadrian. Somewhere about noon he duly  arrived, without any apologies for his tardiness; but this omission on his part  I waived, being only too thankful to see his dour countenance.</p>
  <p>By  dour I do not mean exactly ill-natured, for Hadrian had some geniality in his  disposition, though it did not show itself in his face. Fortunately I knew that  this index to his mind was a bad one, else I had not made him my confidant. As  it turned out, he did not receive my story so well as I had expected, but this  I put down to his jealousy in the matter of friendship.</p>
  <p>Hadrian  was a good physiognomist, and anxious for his unbiased opinion I said nothing  about Lady Selwyn, but slipped the portrait in with the rest of the sketches.  In a few minutes Hadrian, as I expected he would, asked to see what work I had  done, so I placed the whole lot before him and waited the result in silence. He  went to work in his usual ungracious manner, making remarks complimentary and  otherwise&mdash;mostly otherwise. In due course he came across the portrait and to my  astonishment shewed an unexpected acquaintance with the original.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  Faloise,&rdquo; he said, turning towards me, sketch in hand, &ldquo;where have you seen  Lady Selwyn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know her, Hadrian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excellently  well! She was the heroine of that queer story of two seasons ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  queer story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I forgot. You were in India at the time,&rdquo; said Hadrian, replacing the sketch in  the portfolio. &ldquo;However, I can tell you the whole history&mdash; but first let me  hear how you came to make her acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  would rather have heard the London history first, and then narrated the sequel;  but Hadrian, as I knew of old, was as obstinate as a mule. Unless I gratified  his curiosity he certainly would not gratify mine, so with quick dispatch I  told him all that had taken place on the previous night. The important detail  of my falling in love I withheld for the present. I might as well have told it  at once, for I saw Hadrian guessed the truth from my tell-tale cheeks. However,  he made no sign of such knowledge, but, when I had finished the story, looked  out at the Grange intently through the window.</p>
  <p>Naturally  I expected to be directly addressed, but in place of this Hadrian began a  monologue as though he were alone. At first I felt indignant, but as his  soliloquy seemed pertinent to the subject, I listened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo;  observed Hadrian, to himself, &ldquo;she saw the likeness between Varst and Faloise.  That accounts for her emotion. She loved Varst deeply, and when he died buried  herself in this tomb. Now a ghost in the person of Faloise has revived that  love given to a dead man; so it is not unlikely she will transfer her  affections to the living. Faloise resembles the non-existing Varst greatly.  Doubtless she will love him. The question is&mdash;will Faloise love her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faloise  does love her,&rdquo; I broke in impetuously, whereupon Hadrian, contrary to his  usual gravity, burst out laughing. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!  I have caught you in a trap, Faloise. Yes, I am aware that you love this woman.  Your cheeks, your eyes were eloquent Now your tongue betrays you. Faloise,&rdquo; he  added, touching my breast with an emphatic forefinger, &ldquo;had I not tricked you  into this confession you would have held your peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  you are wrong. I intended to tell you as soon as you arrived.&rdquo; Hadrian, taking  out his watch, glanced at the dial with a mocking smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been with you close on an hour and you have told me&mdash;nothing. So much for  your intention. You love this woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you would marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she would have me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  talk like a child!&rdquo; said Hadrian, roughly, &ldquo;marry a woman of whom you know  nothing,&mdash;whose face you have hardly seen! A woman who, as you can see for  yourself, conceals some shameful secret in that house. Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Faloise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Calling  me names will not alter my determination!&rdquo; I rejoined, a trifle nettled; &ldquo;tell  me what you know about her and I will judge for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hadrian  bit his fingers&mdash;a trick with him when annoyed&mdash;then, without further preamble,  burst out into the story of Lady Selwyn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is a young widow!&rdquo; he began with a jerk of his head, by which I knew how angry  he was. &ldquo;A young widow not without attractions, as you know, nor without money,  as you don&rsquo;t know. More than two years ago&mdash;I may say three&mdash;when I was in town,  and you were in the East, she buried her first husband and fell in love with  Paul Varst, artist. It was said she had been in love with him before she  married Sir Peter Selwyn&rsquo;s title and fortune, but at all events, no sooner was  the old man buried than she became engaged to Varst. He resembled you greatly,  and like you, was an artist, which I think you must admit is a curious  coincidence. During Lady Selwyn&rsquo;s period of mourning he went to the East as you  did. Unlike you &mdash;and this is the first point of difference between you &mdash;he  returned from thence afflicted with some disease.</p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t know the name of the disease, but it killed him, and may be said to have  killed her, seeing how she has shut herself up in yonder tomb to mourn him.  You, my friend, are very like Varst, so I should not feel surprised if she fell  in love with you. In her eyes, remember, you are Varst <i>redivivus</i>. My advice to you is to escape her snares by immediate  flight. As to your red star, I cannot divine its meaning, nor do I think it  worth troubling about. All I know for certain is that Lady Selwyn loved Varst,  and as you resemble Varst she will assuredly love you. So there you have the  story. Sufficiently common-place, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  and sufficiently reputable also,&rdquo; I interrupted hotly. &ldquo;I see nothing to  condemn in her conduct and much to praise. She must be a loving woman to mourn  so truly for the dead. By your own showing my resemblance to Varst gives me a  chance of success, and as I love her, I see no reason why I should not become  her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust you will not be so foolish, Faloise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  do not argue further. My mind is made up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so is mine,&rdquo; he rejoined, angrily springing from his chair. &ldquo;If you intend to  make a fool of yourself, I wash my hands of the whole business. Give up this  idea, Faloise, or I leave you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you please,&rdquo; I answered, cutting short the discussion, and with that left the  room.</p>
  <p>When  I returned Ruth informed me that Hadrian had gone.</p>
  <p>Presumably  it was jealousy which caused him to act in this foolish way. He could not bear  to think that a woman should come between us; but as a woman had done so, he  considered himself affronted, and departed in anger. It would be useless to  deny that I was sorry for this breach between us. I do not make friends easily,  and Hadrian was my closest companion. Notwithstanding my regret, I was too much  in love to brood long over this severance, and dismissing Hadrian&rsquo;s folly from  my mind, addressed myself to the task of solving the red star mystery.</p>
  <p>I  wonder if there is a perverse fate who ever makes things go contrary to what we  wish. In my case I was inclined to take this view of Providence, for I wanted  Lady Selwyn to visit the Golden Plover as usual, but she never made her  appearance. The old woman came for such necessaries as were required, but Lady  Selwyn remained in seclusion, I spent my days in walking up and down the high  road in front of the morass and my nights in the parlour waiting for her  coming, but neither by day nor by night did I see her. Ruth informed me that  before my arrival she nightly paid a visit to the inn. Seeing that she did so  no longer I was forced to blame either that suppositious fate, or my likeness  to Paul Varst, deceased.</p>
  <p>Each  day I haunted the high road, watching that detestable house, each night I sat  in the parlour eyeing that red star and listening to the Thing wailing. I got  used to both in the end, showing that even horrors can become stale. Ruth  usually kept me company, and we talked of many things&mdash;of Lady Selwyn among  others&mdash;but I learned no more than I had been told on the first night. And all  this time I was in a perfect fever of excitement</p>
  <p>This  unsatisfactory life went on for about a week. At the end of that time the old  woman brought a letter in which Lady Selwyn implored me to go away. I took no  notice of this, but haunted the high road as usual, whereupon the next night  brought me another letter ordering me to depart. I heeded the command as little  as I had done the entreaty. Then there ensued a perfect deluge of notes,  imploring, ordering, requesting, beseeching. Lady Selwyn ran through the whole  gamut of a woman&rsquo;s arts in wheedling a man to do her bidding.</p>
  <p>It  was all of no avail. I was as obstinate in staying, as she was in hiding.  Neither of us would give in. At last she did. Towards the end of the second  week she unexpectedly made her appearance in the parlour, ordered John Ruth out  of the room, and gave me a warm quarter of an hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are a gentleman, Mr. Faloise, you will leave this place,&rdquo; she said  indignantly. &ldquo;I have written you at least a dozen letters, of none of which you  have taken any notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,  Lady Selwyn, I do not see why I should leave this place,&rdquo; I answered mildly. &ldquo;Is  it reasonable to expect me to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are driving me mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer she covered her face with her hands, and burst into tears. I advanced to  soothe her, but on touching her shoulder she sprang up with a terrified  gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! Do not touch me. I cannot bear it. Oh! if you only knew my story!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do know your story. That you loved Paul Varst, who is dead, and that I resemble  Paul Varst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  told you this?&rdquo; she asked with a quick intake of the breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  learned it inadvertently. Is it because I resemble Paul Varst that you wish me  to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes! You are so like him. You have his eyes, his voice. To me you are as a  spectre. Paul Varst was like you, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is dead, and you mourn his loss in that dreary mansion. Surely you have  suffered enough and can forget the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shivered, spreading out her hands with a gesture of despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I can never forget the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me teach you to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Mr. Faloise?&rdquo; she cried, shrinking back from my outstretched arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  God&rsquo;s sake say no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  caught her to my breast before she could avoid me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must speak, Lady Selwyn. I love you! I love you! The moment I beheld your face  in the porch yonder I loved you. I drew your picture from memory&mdash;from the  memory of my heart. I resemble Paul Varst. Love me for his sake if not for my  own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  thrust me back with such violence that I reeled against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you insult me!&rdquo; she panted, clenching her hands. &ldquo;You are a stranger. I  know nothing of you and yet&mdash;and yet you dare to speak of love to me &mdash;to me,&rdquo;  striking her breast with closed fist, &ldquo;who am vowed to the dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot help myself. I am a coward, acting as I do; but blame the lover, not the  man. I should go away when you bid me! I cannot! I dare not! The sight of your  face has ruined my life! If I leave you I die! You are killing me&mdash;yes, killing  me. Can you not see how I suffer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  angry light in her eyes softened to the mild radiance of pity. Crossing the  room she laid her hand on my bowed head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  fellow! You suffer. I also suffer. But we must both suffer in silence. I am  under the ban of hell. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean? That house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare tell you no more. The red light warns me to hold my peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo; I said, again grasping her poor thin hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means the tortures of hell,&rdquo; she whispered with slow terror. &ldquo;I have seen a  soul writhing in the grip of fiends. Pray to God you may never look upon such  sights as sear my eyes. We must meet no more, Mr. Faloise. Let me bear my curse  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,  I will help you to bear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cannot. It is too horrible! Let me go, Mr. Faloise. I cannot! I dare not love  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  you do love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word she bent forward and kissed my cheek. At that moment we heard the  wailing of the accursed thing, whereupon, with a burst of hysterical laughter,  she fled from the room. I followed with speed, but she had already vanished in  the darkness, nor could my implorings call her back to my arms. </p>
  <p>The  next night she failed to appear, but the old woman brought me another letter. &ldquo;Pity  my weakness, and go,&rdquo; were the contents, and the paper was stained with tears. Those  tears decided my course. Nothing now would induce me to leave the place without  soothing this sorrow. I swore to enter the Grange, to enter that room from  whence shone the red light, to discover what it was that wailed so horribly. I  sacrificed my soul to keep that oath, but I kept it.</p>
  <p>After  a haggard night I walked up the road at dawn to examine the morass. If possible  I desired to cross it and enter the Grange, but as I stood hesitating on the  verge of the unsteady ground a woman cried aloud. On looking up I saw Lady  Selwyn balanced above the black water, and in less than a minute she was by my  side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  away, Mr. Faloise,&rdquo; she panted, pushing me backward. &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  enter the Grange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.  It is death to enter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless  I will enter.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  whispered my reply in her ear, as though it were too awesome to be spoken  aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to marry you. That house holds some horrible secret, which is blighting  your life. Let me in. Tell me what it is, and I will free you from its  influence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no secret,&rdquo; she denied, with downcast eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is! I am determined to find out its mystery. Why does that red star shine from  the tower at dusk? What is it that moans in the darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are killing me,&rdquo; she gasped, pressing her hand to her side. &ldquo;Go away, I implore  you, Mr. Faloise. I dare not tell you anything.&rdquo; Then, with sudden defiance, &ldquo;I  shall not tell you anything, nor will I see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  would have folded her in my arms, but with a sudden spring she placed a portion  of the morass between us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will sink!&rdquo; I cried, sick with horror, as the ground quivered under her light  weight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I guide myself by the white stones!&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Faloise.  Do not come here again. It means death to you and to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this she vanished into the house, and daunted by that horrible marsh I dared  not follow her. Slowly I returned to the inn. The east was red with the dawn,  but redder than the east burned the star from the tall tower.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I determined  to force my way into the Grange that night. Devoured alike by love and  curiosity, my state of mind was favourable to the enterprise. That it was a  desperate one I gathered from the hints thrown out by Lady Selwyn. The half  hysterical life of the past two weeks, in place of destroying my nerve, had  screwed up my courage to a point of reckless daring. I knew that such  artificiality would sooner or later collapse, but before the collapse came I  swore to discover the secret of the red star. Of such resolve I told no one,  not even Ruth, but making some trivial excuse for talking a walk, strolled up  to that morass which formed so effective a defence to the Grange.</p>
  <p>In  the soft June twilight the sullen marsh spread its sliminess before me. The  inky pools of black water, the unhealthy green of the vegetation, the grave-yard  richness of the mould, all filled me with repugnance. It was like a grave, and  for aught I knew might be mine, seeing that I was ignorant of the secret  crossing. Lady Selwyn had guided her course by the white stones, so for such  land marks I looked. They dotted the blackness irregularly, but by following  their eccentric curvings I made sure to arrive safely on the other side. I am  not religious, but as I shivered on the edge of that possible grave, and noted  the evil gleam of the red star, I put up a hurried prayer for protection. Then  I set a cautious foot on the spot indicated by the first stone.</p>
  <p>The  treacherous ground quivered like a jelly as the black bog water oozed  sluggishly round my feet. Prudently trying every resting-place in advance with my  stick, I sprang from one stone to another, ever feeling the quaking of the  quagmire. There was no sign of life about the house, and though I half expected  Lady Selwyn to issue forth with warning cries, she did not make her appearance.  Several times my heart was in my mouth as I slipped on the spongy soil; but in  the end I was safely across, and found myself on firm ground. I now stood  fairly committed to the adventure, for the morass was my rubicon, yet for the  moment I felt qualmish. My body counselled retreat but my soul inclined to  pushing forward in the teeth of danger. Urged on by this desire, I marched  boldly towards the low brick wall of the house.</p>
  <p>It  ran the whole length of the facade, and the rusty iron gate in the centre was  closely barred. By looking through the narrow railings I could catch a glimpse  of the front door. It stood wide open, as though Lady Selwyn deemed the morass  a sufficient protection from the outside world; so seeing that there was but  one obstacle to overcome, I plucked up heart. One portion of the dilapidated  wall afforded perilous foothold. Of this I took advantage, and not without some  abrasions of the knees, managed to clamber over. I then found myself directly  under the red eye of the tower. It seemed to my distempered fancy to follow my  movements in a stealthy manner, but undaunted by the bogey of superstition, I  hurried forward to the open door.</p>
  <p>Within  was a mighty hall, with a wide staircase ascending into upper glooms, and so  ghostly did it look that for the moment my spirit quailed. On recollecting,  however, that the house was but tenanted by two weak women, I felt ashamed of  my momentary panic, and stole to the foot of the staircase. I did not know in  which portion of this vast place Lady Selwyn resided, but judging that she  would live above the unwholesome miasma of the morass, I decided to seek her on  the first floor.</p>
  <p>Just  as I placed my foot on the stair, I heard the noise of descending feet and had  barely time to draw back into the shadow, when a woman appeared on the landing.  It was not Lady Selwyn, but her servant, going, as I judged from the basket on  her arm, to the inn for provisions. She glided past me like a ghost, and having  unlocked the iron gate, crossed the morass with an air of confidence which  showed her to be thoroughly conversant with the dangerous way. The gate was  left wide open; so here, if I chose to take it, was my chance of retreat; but I  was bent on accomplishing my desire, and, giving myself no time for coward  reflection, rapidly mounted the stairs.</p>
  <p>Through  the dingy windows filtered the doubtful light, creating within an atmosphere  rather less luminous than was without. Still when my eyes became accustomed to  the semi-gloom I managed to get about with considerable ease, but where I went  I do not know to this day. My sole idea was to find Lady Selwyn; therefore I  took no stock of my surroundings, but hunted blindly through room and echoing  corridor. I descended stairs here, I went up others there, down long passages I  ran, and hesitated in rooms bare of furniture, but I saw nothing. Up to this  period of my life I had never felt the horror of loneliness, having been always  within hail of my fellow creatures. I felt it now. Seated, through weariness,  on the floor of an empty apartment, I was seized with a deadly feeling to which  I can put no name. It made me shiver and turn sick. I felt myself environed by  empty space. Methought there was no man in the world save I.</p>
  <p>Then  the Thing came. I can put no name to that either. It did not show itself  visibly, but there it was, not at any particular spot but all round me. A faint  sickly odour corrupted the atmosphere. My mouth was parched with nervous heat,  and the perspiration rolled down my back. The twilight had condensed into a  thick darkness, and I in the midst thereof was seated forlorn, forgotten of God  and man. I could see nothing, I could hear nothing, but it was there, whatever  it was, on all sides. I clutched my knees and shivered, while it moved  invisibly around. Then I knew the sufferings of lost souls.</p>
  <p>How  long I was under this malign influence I cannot tell, but it seemed to me that  I sat for hours shivering in the clinging darkness. The climax came when it  began to whimper. I felt my flesh creep. At the second whimper I shrieked with  horror.</p>
  <p>Scarcely  had my voice died away when I heard the sound of someone approaching, and Lady  Selwyn entered the room bearing a lighted candle. The nerve of the woman was  astonishing. Schooled, I suppose, by the horrors constantly surrounding her,  she showed no fear, but moved swiftly towards me. I looked up, shaking like a  leaf, and the light revealed my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Faloise!&rdquo; she cried, falling back a pace. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name how did you enter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Paying  no attention to her question, I clutched her dress in a paroxysm of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it that cries in the darkness? Hark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I heard that indescribable sound, and she heard it also, for her white face  blanched still whiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go!  go!&rdquo; she whispered, dragging me to my feet. &ldquo;Ask nothing. Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will know your secret!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sound again, but this time in angry tone, like the snarl of a dog. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t go I cannot protect you,&rdquo; she cried in alarm, and seizing my arm  hurried me from the room.</p>
  <p>In  her presence I recovered my courage, and would have spoken, but she shook her  head for me to keep silent. Leading me through the lonely passages, she made no  pause until we found ourselves in the entrance hall. It did not follow us, for  when we arrived at the foot of the staircase I felt a certain sense of relief,  as though the invisible presence had departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  door and the gate are both open,&rdquo; said Lady Selwyn rapidly, &ldquo;go at once and  re-cross the marsh by the white stones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me what it all means!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  you know so much, you may as well know all, Mr. Faloise, but you will regret  your curiosity to your dying day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too late now for regrets. Tell me all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I do, swear that you will leave this village at once and keep silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much for your love,&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;I see your curiosity has overpowered  that feeling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Selwyn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  speak no more on that subject. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s!&rdquo;  I whispered, looking apprehensively around: &ldquo;it is here again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; she replied composedly, &ldquo;but you will not see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the thing that cries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul  Varst!&rdquo; said Lady Selwyn, putting her hand to her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he is not dead. He lives here. Shut out from the world for ever. The living  dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  put her lips to my ear and whispered one word. It curdled my blood with horror  and I cried out.</p>
  <p>Again  I heard the Thing moan, but this time its moaning shaped itself into human  speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul  Varst! Paul Varst!&rdquo; It wailed pitifully. &ldquo;Once he was like you. Pray God you  may never become like him. A leper! A leper! An outcast! Oh, my punishment! My  punishment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  voice died away in a heart-breaking sigh. Fear staying my speech, I  interrogated Lady Selwyn with a look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  you know the truth,&rdquo; she said, weeping bitterly. &ldquo;He was my lover, but  contracted this frightful disease in the East. On his return to England it  manifested itself. I loved him too well to leave him. Spreading a report of his  death I brought him secretly to this place and condemned myself to share his  living death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the red star?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  cannot bear the light of heaven to reveal his deformity, even to himself. The  windows of his room are of red glass, through which the lamplight shines at  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my punishment! My punishment!&rdquo; moaned the invisible thing. &ldquo;I suffer in life  what others suffer after death. Away! away! or you will become even as that  which was once Paul Varst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  clutched Lady Selwyn&rsquo;s arm, and tried to drag her to the open door. &ldquo;Come away!  come away from this accursed house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  thing whimpered angrily, and a look of alarm overspread her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot! I dare not! Go! Go! There is danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave  that living corpse, I beg of you. It is accursed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Ah! Ah!&rdquo; moaned the voice, &ldquo;do not leave me&mdash;do not leave me. You loved me  once&mdash;do not leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  horror beat against the wall, and fearing lest it should reveal itself I  dragged Lady Selwyn nearer the door by main force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind it. Come away! Quick! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare not,&rdquo; she gasped, hanging back. &ldquo;I dare not. He would kill me, and I loved  him.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once,  but not now. Paul Varst is dead. You love Hugh Faloise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  thing overheard my remark, and its voice arose in a howl of fury. With a cry of  fear Lady Selwyn fell half fainting into my arms. In another moment I was out  of the gate with my burden, trying to cross the morass.</p>
  <p>I  heard the whimpering of the Thing in pursuit but dared not turn my head. The  cool air revived Lady Selwyn, and midway in the marsh she began to struggle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me go! Let me go! He wants me. Paul! Paul!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  answered with the roar of a wild animal, and before I knew of its proximity  Lady Selwyn was wrenched from my arms. She made a horrible noise, scarcely  human, and I turned. Its face was looking straight at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Heavens!&rdquo; I screamed, and fell face downward on the quaking earth.</p>
  <p>I  must have fainted, but as my head had fallen partially into the water, I  speedily recovered. All was still. A few bubbles on the near pool showed where  it had sunk with its living burden. Wrapped in each other&rsquo;s arms the dead and  the living had gone down into that loathsome quagmire.</p>
  <p>I  looked up with an ashen face. The Red Star was shining over their grave.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheProfessorsMummy"></a>The  Professor&rsquo;s Mummy</b></h2>
  <p>Gossip  consists commonly of lies; yet occasionally, by acute observers grains of truth  may be discerned in the untrustworthy mass. As a specimen of how iron of fact  intermingles with clay of falsehood, may be instanced the rumours relative to  Professor Carberry, his wife, and young Mr. Vale. It was said &mdash;and with good  reason&mdash;that Carberry coveted Vale&rsquo;s celebrated mummy of the XX. Dynasty, while  Vale envied the professor his wife.</p>
  <p>The  Camford cynics suggested an exchange as conducive to the happiness of all  parties. A sale, and the Professor would gain possession of the desired mummy;  a divorce, and Mrs. Carberry would be free to become Mrs. Vale. But to the  proposed course there was one objection: Vale was a poor man, and could better  support a dried-up corpse, which had no needs, than extravagant Mrs. Carberry,  who was said to have many. Into the ostensible truth of this latter assertion  creeps falsehood.</p>
  <p>Despite  outward evidence to the contrary, Lucy Carberry was not extravagant. She had no  chance of being so; for her husband kept the purse, and was niggardly in doling  out its contents. He allowed a meagre sum for household expenses, a still  smaller amount for clothes befitting the wife of a Camford University  Professor, and not a single penny for pleasure or relaxation. Out of means  barely sufficient for necessaries, Mrs. Carberry was supposed to provide the  miracle of a lavish table, and achieve the impossible of a fashionable  appearance. If the meals were not dainty and plentiful, if the wife was not  dressed with taste and refinement, Carberry made it his business to be  disagreeable, and became so to the point of ill-treatment. It was a life of  blows in private, smiles in public; and poor pretty Lucy had a wholesome dread  of her domestic tyrant.</p>
  <p>Why,  when, or where she married him no one knew. One day the newly-wedded pair  unexpectedly took up their abode in Camford&mdash;of which scholastic town Carberry  was an old resident, and a professor of Michael&rsquo;s College&mdash;and so great was the  contrast of her fair loveliness and his dour blackness that they speedily  became known as Beauty and the Beast. Carberry himself was a wizen little man  with a large head and a lined yellow face, suggestive of evil instincts kept  under by force of will. He had malicious black eyes, a wisp of black moustache  straggling over thin lips, and a lean small-waisted figure, straight and  nervously alert. His smile and speech were cynical, his dress scrupulously  neat, and in every way he was the antithesis of his pretty soft girl-bride.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She,  poor soul, was one of those delicate timid women who require attention and  kindness to bring out their good qualities. Lucy was a flower which bloomed  best in sunshine; a tender blossom susceptible to the least chill in the  atmosphere. Pink and white in complexion, blue-eyed and golden-haired, she was  emotional and charming; at once angel and martyr. Carberry, grim realist as he  was, did not understand her in the least. He termed her a sentimental fool, and  crushed her innocent aspirations with sneering cynicism, so that within a few  months of her marriage Lucy lost her angelic wings, and became a domestic  martyr, whose daily life was one of torture and silent endurance. She had not  even a child to comfort her bruised heart, and the Carberry household  represented a sort of domestic hell, wherein the wife was the damned, the  husband the devil. And alas, alas! God was deaf to the prayers of this tortured  woman.</p>
  <p>The  professor and his victim&mdash;a more appropriate name than wife&mdash;kept silent as to  their meeting, and wooing, and subsequent marriage. Only John Vale knew the  truth, and he gained his knowledge first hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was sold,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Carberry to him. &ldquo;Sold by my mother like any slave in  the East, and into a worse bondage. We lived at Bournemouth, mother and I.  Father had been dead three years, and we supported ourselves by keeping a  boarding-house. Mr. Carberry came to stay there one summer and took a fancy to  me. I can&rsquo;t say that it was love,&rdquo; interpolated Mrs. Carberry, &ldquo;for my husband  does not know what that word means. I hated him from the first and refused his  offer, but mother was talked over by him, and she forced me into the marriage.  I was sold as a slave to this learned Pasha, and a slave he makes of me. Oh, I  wish I were dead! I do! I do!&rdquo; And the wretched little woman concluded the  miserable story with a burst of tears.</p>
  <p>It  can be seen from this outburst that to the unhappy wife Vale was more than an  acquaintance. He was a friend, and if the truth must be stated, his friendship  showed signs of developing into yet closer relationship. Vale had no idea to  what lengths this intimacy might go, but without intending anything definite,  he had permitted himself&mdash;in the most innocent manner, be it said&mdash;to drift into  a somewhat anomalous position. Friendship between a young man and a pretty  woman is the most dangerous of all relationships, and Vale was aware that Mrs.  Carberry claimed more of his time and thoughts than was consistent with the  attitude&mdash;morally and socially&mdash;he ought to preserve towards her. Moreover the  miserable life she led with an exacting and tyrannous husband aroused his pity,  and that passion, according to Shakespeare, is akin to love. One false step and  the result might be dangerous.</p>
  <p>John  Vale was the son of an enthusiastic Egyptologist, who had squandered a large  fortune upon an archaeological collection. He had educated his son to succeed  to his treasures and labours, but to his disgust John evinced distaste for  mummies, coins, tombs, papri, and such-like. Also he cherished literary  ambitions, and wished to make his mark as a novelist. Vale senior censured,  urged, implored, commanded Vale junior to have done with such trifling: but the  son was as obstinate as the father, and the breach widened between them.  Finally John took up journalism in London, and Mr. Vale remained at Camford  sulking amid his antiquities. In due time the Egyptologist died, and the  journalist returned to learn that beyond the house, and a mummy of the XX.  Dynasty, he was heir to&mdash;nothing. Vale had left his collection to the Camford  Museum, and John found himself a pauper. He had been cut off with a mummy instead  of the proverbial shilling, &ldquo;in the hope,&rdquo; said the will, &ldquo;the sight of this  marvellously embalmed Princess of the XX. Dynasty may induce my son John to  devote his attention to the civilisation of Ancient Egypt.&rdquo; Needless to say  John declined to violate his taste by adopting this posthumous advice. However,  he retained possession of his ironical legacy.</p>
  <p>Professor  Carberry, who long had coveted this special mummy, desired to purchase it, but  to his surprise John refused the most advantageous offers. He was quite  determined, he said to live in the house, and earn his livelihood by literary  work; also to keep the famous mummy which, in itself, represented the fortune  he should have inherited. Being a reserved young man he refused further  information, and Carberry marvelled at what seemed to him to be the ridiculous  decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  me, Vale!&rdquo; said he with acerbity, &ldquo;why should you adopt this dog-in-the-manger  attitude? You don&rsquo;t care for the mummy and I do: you require money and I offer  it to you. Why not then consult your own interest and sell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Professsor. I shall keep the mummy to remind me that my father squandered  twenty thousand pounds on such-like rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  disparage those whose tastes differ from your own,&rdquo; retorted Carberry with some  dryness; &ldquo;in my eyes your mummy is worth two hundred pounds. Come, I&rsquo;ll let you  have that sum for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I have made up my mind not to sell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Obstinate  man! I&rsquo;ll increase my offer to guineas. It&rsquo;s worth consideration!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  dare say: and worth more than the mummy,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;However, I can only thank  you, and decline your proposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Carberry  was vexed and showed it by frowning. Then he smiled and held out his hand. &ldquo;Well,  Vale, if you won&rsquo;t sell you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if you should change your  mind, let me know. My offer will remain open. And Vale,&rdquo; added the Professor,  with a backward glance, &ldquo;come and see us when you have nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>John  did not accept this cordial invitation at once, as he had no great love for  Carberry and his whims. But one afternoon at a garden party he saw a pale and  delicate face which fixed his wandering attention. Forthwith he begged his  hostess for an introduction, and shortly found himself walking and talking with  Mrs. Carberry. The Professor was not present, otherwise he would have resented  the long conversation which took place between the pair. Both Vale and Lucy  were mutually attracted to one another; and after a few moments they were  chatting confidentially together as though they were friends of years standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know why I tell you these things,&rdquo; said Lucy, stopping in the middle of a  description of her taste in books. &ldquo;I am sure they do not interest you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Indeed they do, Mrs. Carberry. I am enjoying our conversation more than I dare  tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is because you are what the Italians call &lsquo;simpatica.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the first time such a term has been applied to me,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;I am not  what you term a ladies&rsquo; man. The Professor is, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he? That is news to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  said this so bitterly that Vale was surprised, and glanced sideways at her  charming face. The rosy colour induced by the pleasant conversation had died  out, the soft eyes had hardened, and the mobile lips were firmly set in a thin  line of scarlet. When Carberry was mentioned Lucy could govern her speech by  limiting it to a few cold and careless words, but the expression of her face  was beyond her control; and the opinion she entertained of her husband could be  read thereon without difficulty. John saw dread and hate in every line of the  pretty countenance; and also he deduced fear from the nervous and hurried way  in which her eyes travelled round the sunlit lawn. He concluded from such  evidence that Mrs. Carberry both feared and hated her husband. And in this  conclusion he was absolutely right.</p>
  <p>With  considerable tact he turned the conversation into another channel, and soon he  was confirmed in his opinion of her matrimonial feelings by seeing the face  relax and the eyes soften. When Carberry came to take his wife away&mdash;which he  did in a particularly gracious and smiling manner&mdash; Vale noted the Medusa-like  transformation once more. When speaking to him Lucy&rsquo;s face had been full of  change and colour and charm, when leaving with her husband it was a mask of  stone, hard and colourless. Only the expression of the eyes betrayed how  terrified was the soul hidden in that slender body. These things afforded Vale  food for much reflection on his way home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew that Carberry was a brute,&rdquo; he mused, taking the most extreme view of the  Professor&rsquo;s character. &ldquo;He tyrannises over that poor little woman. She looked  like a dove caught in a snare when her husband appeared. It is a case of joy  abroad and grief at home I suspect; but a few enquiries will soon enlighten me  on that point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this supposition he was wrong, for his few enquiries did nothing of the sort.  To all the gossips of Camford he applied artfully for information and from all  the gossips&mdash;on the best authority&mdash;he heard the same story. Professor Carberry  was an amiable genius married to a brainless doll. He was the most delightful  companion in the world, but he required a clever woman to understand and  appreciate him; and Mrs. Carberry&mdash;by unanimous opinion&mdash;was not a clever women.  She was pretty, in a washed-out way, she had a few social tricks like a  well-bred poodle, and a feeble stream of parrot-like chatter. But brains? Where  was Mr. Vale&rsquo;s talent for character-reading to look for brains in that Dresden  china nonentity? On the whole the verdict of Camford womanhood was dead against  Lucy.</p>
  <p>John,  in his own mind, declined to accept this verdict as final. He saw that the  Camford ladies grudged Lucy her acquisition of an eligible bachelor, and in  revenge were determined to deny her possession of all feminine graces likely to  account for the marriage. To learn the other side of the question Vale  determined to use the invitation he had received from the Professor, and in  pursuance of this idea he called forthwith on Mrs. Carberry. Again the mutual  attraction declared itself between the pair, and they spent a most delightful  hour together, notwithstanding the inconvenient presence of Carberry himself.  In response to an appealing glance from Lucy&mdash;she did not dare to put her wish  into words&mdash;John again repeated his visit. Ultimately, as controlled by some  irresistible fate, the young man fell into the habit of passing the greater  part of his spare time in the company of Mrs. Carberry. Busy bodies noted the  fact, and informed the Professor, who merely shrugged his shoulders, and said  that his wife liked to be amused. Nevertheless he thought sufficient of the  hint to keep a close watch on the progress of this new acquaintanceship. It was  at this point that Camford cynics suggested exchange of wife for mummy.</p>
  <p>Ignorant  of gossip and espionage the lovers&mdash;as they tacitly were&mdash;drifted into a  knowledge that they could not live without one another. For a considerable time  Lucy shrank from revealing her domestic misery, but finally she spoke out, and  the indignation with which Vale received her confession drew them still closer  together. Carberry made no attempt to end their friendship, but blinking like  some sly beast of prey, he kept himself informed of all that was going on. At  length the inevitable happened; a look too much, a sigh too long, and John declared  his passion. Lucy listened, hesitated, and was lost.</p>
  <p>How  Carberry learned the actual truth&mdash;which at the present time was innocent  enough&mdash;it is impossible to say. But learn it he did, and then cast about for  some means whereby to punish the rebellion of his white slave and the  presumption of her lover. The Spanish blood in his veins&mdash;his mother was from Catalonia&mdash;incited  him to frenzy, and without considering that it was his own brutality which had  alienated his wife, he determined upon revenge, and that of the most merciless.  To accomplish this he feigned ignorance of the stolen glances and secret  interviews of the pair; yet he noted the former, and knew when, where, and at  what time the latter took place. Indeed he was actually present at one in the role  of eavesdropper; and, in accordance with the proverb, he heard little good of  himself.</p>
  <p>John  was drinking afternoon tea with Lucy, and the short November twilight was  drawing to night, so that the room was almost in darkness. Mrs. Carberry was  seated before the small tea-table, and Vale, cup in hand, was leaning against  the mantel-piece, while the fire diffused a coppery glow upon scene and actors.  Hidden like a tiger in a jungle, Carberry crouched behind the half-closed  folding door, which opened into the inner drawing-room, and drank in every  word. He heard sufficient to convince him that as yet the relationship between  the pair was one of ardent friendship merely; but the discovery that they were  innocent of offence only added fuel to his wrath. Nor was this allayed by  hearing what the two determined upon at the interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you what, Lucy,&rdquo; said John, enraged by the recital of fresh brutality, &ldquo;you  can&rsquo;t live any longer with this slave-driver. Come with me to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the world!&rdquo; said Lucy, piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the world; it is of ourselves and of our happiness that we must think. As  soon as you can get a divorce we will be married, and then we can defy the  world. I am poor, it is true, but I have brains, and no doubt will be able to  earn sufficient for our support. I love you&mdash;you love me; and you will be  happier with me than with this reptile of a Carberry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  listening reptile repaid with a silent curse this plain speaking, and settled  himself more comfortably to listen. It was to his advantage to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must arrange the matter at once,&rdquo; John was saying when the listener again  caught the drift of the conversation. &ldquo;You know how I love you, my poor  darling. I cannot bear to think of your remaining in this wretch&rsquo;s power. Say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;  and we will go to London this week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Mr. Carberry will pursue us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  of that? I&rsquo;m not afraid of the rat!&rdquo; said John, with a contemptous memory of  the Professor&rsquo;s stature. &ldquo;A dozen Carberrys can&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no money!&rdquo; objected Lucy. &ldquo;Nor have you, John.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a plan to get sufficient,&rdquo; said her lover, by this time on his knees. &ldquo;Leave  it all in my hands, dearest. You love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better  than all the world, darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  leave Carberry, and come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  John! John!&rdquo; She threw her arms round his neck. &ldquo;You will never leave me, you  will be good to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always!  always! I shall devote my life to making you happy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  the pair fell to castle-building, and talking of a golden future, while  Carberry crept away maddened with wrath and shame. Determined upon revenge, he  saw as yet no mode to accomplish it befittingly. Ordering John Vale out of the  house was too contemptible a means, beating Lucy had staled by repetition, and  Carberry was as anxious to devise some new punishment sufficiently cruel, as  Xerxes was to discover a new pleasure. Chance put a weapon into his hand the  next day, when he received a letter from Vale offering to sell the mummy for  two hundred pounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  this is how the money is to be obtained,&rdquo; sneered Carberry, taking in the  situation. &ldquo;The kid is to be seethed in its mother&rsquo;s milk. I am to supply funds  for my own dishonour. Very good! Vale has suggested a trap into which he will  fall himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly,  morally speaking, the Professor had right on his side. Vale had no business to  take his wife off him, and to trap him into supplying funds for the purpose of  the elopement. But morality must at times give way to the law of humanity.  Carberry treated his wife like a brute, and&mdash;so cunning he was in his  attitude&mdash;the wretched woman had no redress by law; indeed, she had not the  spirit to apply for redress even if it had been obtainable. Vale could only  rescue her from a state of bondage and misery by breaking the law of morality,  and there was something grimly just in his obtaining money from the husband to  save the wife from further brutality. Both Lucy and John were acting  wrongly&mdash;but look at the provocation. The rule anent the casting of stones may  be applied in this instance.</p>
  <p>However,  Carberry esteeming himself a wronged man, proceeded with his plans for revenge.  He wrote a polite note to Vale, intimating that he would call with a cheque  that evening, and would bring back with him the case containing the mummy. Upon  receipt of this John saw Lucy, and arranged with her to leave for London the  next day, meeting her at the railway station for that purpose. Carberry lurking  in the garden overheard what was determined upon, and chuckled to think what  might happen&mdash;should his plans prove successful&mdash;before the elopement took place.  He even taunted and tortured his unhappy wife, whom he had driven into sin, by  a reference to the sale of the mummy before he left to keep the seven o&rsquo;clock  appointment &ldquo;I wonder why Vale sold me his mummy after all?&rdquo; he said artfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he wants money,&rdquo; suggested Lucy, faintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt,&rdquo; said Carberry, grimly. &ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I!  no&mdash;no! how&mdash;how should I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  nothing! Only I thought that Vale told you everything. Well, I must go,&rdquo; added  the Professor, going to the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be back in an hour, mummy and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in  an hour?&rdquo; murmured Lucy,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I want you to see the mummy, my&mdash;my love. It is a wonderful example of  embalming, and will probably surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grinning  like a monkey, yet with an undercurrent of ferocity, Carberry took his departure,  leaving his wife in a half-fainting condition. She could not understand his  endearing expressions, his gentle voice and significant smiles; they all seemed  to be so many signals of danger. Of old she knew them as precursors to shameful  treatment, and she shuddered to think of what she might undergo before she fled  to the shelter of Vale&rsquo;s broad breast. Yet no idea of Carberry&rsquo;s intentions  crossed her mind, and she was perfectly unaware that he was employed in  checkmating Vale&rsquo;s plans. When she gained a knowledge of the truth, it was too  late.</p>
  <p>Outside  it was raining heavily, and Mrs. Carberry walked restlessly about the room,  listening to the downpour. Occasionally a flicker of blue lightening flared  through the room, and a sullen roll of thunder passed over the house. The  disturbance of the elements, the ominous behaviour of her tyrant, the  expectation of the change in her life&mdash;all made Lucy uneasy, and she wished  again and again that the morrow, with its hope of release, would come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  John, John!&rdquo; she whispered, with hands clasped to a beating heart, &ldquo;I wish you  were here&mdash;I wish we were away. I am afraid&mdash;afraid!&mdash;terribly afraid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  would have gone to bed had she dared, but the fear of punishment lay heavily  upon her; so she sat by a dying fire, listening for the sound of footsteps  through the storm. At nine she heard the door open, the trampling of many feet,  and the bumping of a heavy case being dragged into Carberry&rsquo;s study. With a  sudden start she woke to the fact that the mummy had arrived, that her vigil  was over; and she went out to speak with her husband as he was paying and  dismissing the men who had brought the case. Then they departed, the sound of  wheels died heavily away, and Carberry looked steadily at his pale-faced wife.  There was danger in his regard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I go to bed now?&rdquo; asked Lucy, submissively, keeping her eyes fixed on the  floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I wish you to see my new treasure,&rdquo; Something in his voice, hoarse and broken,  made her look up, and she started back with a low cry.</p>
  <p>The  light of the candle he was holding revealed a white and distorted countenance;  there was a frown on the forehead and a look of menace in the eyes, while the  cruel expression lurking about the line of his thin lips terrified her into a  shriek. At her ejaculation he gripped her savagely by the hand, and smiled  grimly. It was not a pleasant smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you look so?&rdquo; he demanded quietly. &ldquo;Why do you cry out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your&mdash;your  face!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind my face, woman; mind your actions. If I wasn&rsquo;t in the best of tempers at  getting that mummy I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo; He raised his fist, but as she shrank away terrified,  he dropped it again, and continued his speech. &ldquo;I have paid a long price for  what is in that case. Come and look at it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  mummy! I don&rsquo;t like looking on such horrors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same, you must look,&rdquo; growled Carberry, pushing her into the study. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d  rather look upon Vale, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lucy  made no reply to this taunt, lest she should betray herself, but sat down and  stared nervously at the rough deal case which leaned against the wall. Carberry  was already unscrewing it, and the poor woman braced herself up to see the  remains of the ancient Princess who had lived, and loved and sinned so many  years ago. To get a good working light the Professor had placed a lamp on the  near table, adjusting the shade so that the glare should fall directly upon the  square face of the case. The rest of the room was in semi-darkness, and Lucy&rsquo;s  emotions &mdash;which were those of nervous dread&mdash;were veiled by shadow. There was  something grim and gruesome and terrible about the scene.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the loosened lid of the case fell outward Carberry&rsquo;s feet; and the glare of the  lamp revealed what lay within. It was not the mummy. Lucy rose slowly to her  feet; and like a bird fascinated by a snake she moved slowly across the room.  She looked at her husband, and again at the contents of the case. Then a  whisper issued softly from out her pale lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  assented Carberry, cruelly. &ldquo;Your lover John Vale. Dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  I killed him. Ah! you jade, you and he thought to trick me. You laid your plans  well, but I laid mine better. I knew that the money for which the mummy was  sold was to be used for your flight. Do you think I took a cheque, or gold or  notes in my pocket when I went to see John Vale this evening? No! I took a  knife; and that knife,&rdquo; he pointed a lean finger at the wound in the dead man&rsquo;s  breast, &ldquo;that knife,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;found his false heart. There is no flight  for him or you. To him a dishonoured grave; to me revenge; to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused in his furious speech to listen to the laughter which was rippling from  Lucy&rsquo;s lips. She smiled and laughed, and bent forward to kiss the cold lips of  dead John Vale. At the repetition of this ghastly merriment Carberry laughed  also.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo;  said he, grimly, &ldquo;your punishment has begun already. Your lover will go to the  cemetery, you to an asylum. I&rsquo;m sorry, my dear, I can&rsquo;t stay to take you there,  but I must provide for my own safety. In half an hour I leave Camford station  for London, and then&mdash;the world is before me. As for you,&rdquo; he added brutally, &ldquo;Stay  with your lover!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lucy  again kissed the dead man, and when Carberry, leaving the room, cast a backward  glance she was again laughing. Next morning the servants found Carberry absent;  in the study a corpse, and a madwoman. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostsTouch"></a>The Ghost&rsquo;s  Touch</b></h2>
  <p>I  shall never forget the terrible Christmas I spent at Ringshaw Grange in the  year &lsquo;93. As an army doctor I have met with strange adventures in far lands,  and have seen some gruesome sights in the little wars which are constantly  being waged on the frontiers of our empire; but it was reserved for an old  country house in Hants to be the scene of the most noteworthy episode in my  life. The experience was a painful one, and I hope it may never be repeated;  but indeed so ghastly an event is not likely to occur again. If my story reads  more like fiction than truth, I can only quote the well-worn saying, of the  latter being stranger than the former. Many a time in my wandering life have I  proved the truth of this proverb. </p>
  <p>The  whole affair rose out of the invitation which Frank Ringan sent me to spend  Christmas with himself and his cousin Percy at the family seat near  Christchurch. At that time I was home on leave from India; and shortly after my  arrival I chanced to meet with Percy Ringan in Piccadilly. He was an Australian  with whom I had been intimate some years before in Melbourne: a dapper little  man with sleek fair hair and a transparent complexion: looking as fragile as a  Dresden china image, yet with plenty of pluck and spirits. He suffered from  heart disease; and was liable to faint on occasions; yet he fought against his  mortal weakness with silent courage; and with certain precautions against  over-excitement, he managed to enjoy life fairly well.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  his pronounced effeminacy, and somewhat truckling subserviency to rank and high  birth, I liked the little man very well for his many good qualities. On the  present occasion I was glad to see him, and expressed my pleasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Although  I did not expect to see you in England,&rdquo; said I, after the first greetings had  passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have been in London these nine months, my dear Lascelles,&rdquo; he said, in his  usual mincing way, &ldquo;partly by way of a change and partly to see my cousin  Frank,&mdash;who indeed invited me to come over from Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that the rich cousin you were always speaking about in Melbourne?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But Frank is not rich. I am the wealthy Ringan, but he is the head of the  family. You see, doctor,&rdquo; continued Percy, taking my arm and pursuing the  subject in a conversational manner, &ldquo;my father, being a younger son, emigrated  to Melbourne in the gold-digging days, and made his fortune out there. His  brother remained at home on the estates, with very little money to keep up the  dignity of the family; so my father helped the head of his house from time to  time. Five years ago both my uncle and father died, leaving Frank and me as  heirs, the one to the family estate, the other to the Australian wealth. So&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you assist your cousin to keep up the dignity of the family as your father did  before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  yes, I do,&rdquo; admitted Percy, frankly. &ldquo;You see, we Ringans think a great deal of  our birth and position. So much so, that we have made our wills in one another&rsquo;s  favour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  if I die Frank inherits my money; and if he dies, I become heir to the Ringan  estates. It seems strange that I should tell you all this, Lascelles; but you  were so intimate with me in the old days that you can understand my apparent  rashness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could not forbear a chuckle at the reason assigned by Percy for his confidence,  especially as it was such a weak one. The little man had a tongue like a town-crier,  and could no more keep his private affairs to himself than a woman could guard  a secret. Besides I saw very well that with his inherent snobbishness he  desired to impress me with the position and antiquity of his family, and with  the fact&mdash;undoubtedly true &mdash;that it ranked amongst the landed gentry of the  kingdom.</p>
  <p>However,  the weakness, though in bad taste, was harmless enough, and I had no scorn for  the confession of it. Still, I felt a trifle bored, as I took little interest  in the chronicling of such small beer, and shortly parted from Percy after  promising to dine with him the following week.</p>
  <p>At  this dinner, which took place at the Athenian Club, I met with the head of the  Ringan family; or, to put it plainer, with Percy&rsquo;s cousin Frank. Like the  Australian he was small and neat, but enjoyed much better health and lacked the  effeminacy of the other. Yet on the whole I liked Percy the best, as there was  a sly cast about Frank&rsquo;s countenance which I did not relish; and he patronised  his colonial cousin in rather an offensive manner.</p>
  <p>The  latter looked up to his English kinsman with all deference, and would, I am  sure, have willingly given his gold to regild the somewhat tarnished escutcheon  of the Ringans. Outwardly, the two cousins were so alike as to remind one of  Tweddledum and Tweddledee; but after due consideration I decided that Percy was  the better-natured and more honourable of the two.</p>
  <p>For  some reason Frank Ringan seemed desirous of cultivating my acquaintance; and in  one way and another I saw a good deal of him during my stay in London. Finally,  when I was departing on a visit to some relatives in Norfolk he invited me to  spend Christmas at Ringshaw Grange&mdash;not, as it afterwards appeared, without an  ulterior motive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can take no refusal,&rdquo; said he, with a heartiness which sat ill on him. &ldquo;Percy,  as an old friend of yours, has set his heart on my having you down; and &mdash;if I  may say so&mdash;I have set my heart on the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you really must come, Lascelles,&rdquo; cried Percy, eagerly. &ldquo;We are going to keep  Christmas in the real old English fashion. Washington Irving&rsquo;s style, you know;  holly, wassail-bowl, games, and mistletoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  perhaps a ghost or so,&rdquo; finished Frank, laughing, yet with a side glance at his  eager little cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said I. &ldquo;So your Grange is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so,&rdquo; said Percy, before his cousin could speak, &ldquo;and with a good  old Queen Anne ghost. Come down, Doctor, and Frank shall put you in the haunted  chamber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  cried Frank, with a sharpness which rather surprised me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put no one in  the Blue Room; the consequences might be fatal. You smile, Lascelles, but I  assure you our ghost has been proved to exist!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a paradox; a ghost can&rsquo;t exist. But the story of your ghost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  too long to tell now,&rdquo; said Frank, laughing. &ldquo;Come down to the Grange and you&rsquo;ll  hear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; I replied, rather attracted by the idea of a haunted house, &ldquo;you can  count upon me for Christmas. But I warn you, Ringan, that I don&rsquo;t believe in  spirits. Ghosts went out with gas.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  they must have come in again with electric light,&rdquo; retorted Frank Ringan, &ldquo;for  Lady Joan undoubtedly haunts the Grange. I don&rsquo;t mind; as it adds distinction  to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  old families have a ghost,&rdquo; said Percy, importantly. &ldquo;It is very natural when  one has ancestors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no more said on the subject for the time being, but the upshot of this  conversation was that I presented myself at Ringshaw Grange two or three days  before Christmas. To speak the truth, I came more on Percy&rsquo;s account than my  own, as I knew the little man suffered from heart disease, and a sudden shock  might prove fatal. If, in the unhealthy atmosphere of an old house, the inmates  got talking of ghosts and goblins, it might be that the consequences would be  dangerous to so highly strung and delicate a man as Percy Ringan.</p>
  <p>For  this reason, joined to a sneaking desire to see the ghost, I found myself a  guest at Ringshaw Grange. In one way I regret the visit; yet in another I  regard it as providential that I was on the spot. Had I been absent the  catastrophe might have been greater, although it could scarcely have been more  terrible.</p>
  <p>Ringshaw  Grange was a quaint Elizabethan house, all gables and diamond casements, and  oriel windows, and quaint terraces, looking like an illustration out of an old  Christmas number. It was embowered in a large park, the trees of which came up  almost to the doors, and when I saw it first in the moonlight&mdash;for it was by a  late train that I came from London&mdash;it struck me as the very place for a ghost.</p>
  <p>Here  was a haunted house of the right quality if ever there was one, and I only  hoped when I crossed the threshold that the local spectre would be worthy of  its environment. In such an interesting house I did not think to pass a dull  Christmas; but&mdash;God help me&mdash;I did not anticipate so tragic a Yule-tide as I spent.</p>
  <p>As  our host was a bachelor and had no female relative to do the honours of his house  the guests were all of the masculine gender. It is true that there was a  housekeeper&mdash;a distant cousin I understood&mdash;who was rather elderly but very  juvenile as to dress and manner. She went by the name of Miss Laura, but no one  saw much of her as, otherwise than attending to her duties, she remained mostly  in her own rooms.</p>
  <p>So  our party was composed of young men&mdash;none save myself being over the age of  thirty, and few being gifted with much intelligence. The talk was mostly of  sport, of horse racings big game shooting and yacht-sailing: so that I grew  tired at times of these subjects and retired to the library to read and write.  The day after I arrived Frank showed me over the house.</p>
  <p>It  was a wonderful old barrack of a place, with broad passages, twisting interminably  like the labyrinth of Daedalus; small bedrooms furnished in an old-fashioned  manner, and vast reception apartments with polished floors and painted  ceilings. Also there were the customary number of family portraits frowning  from the walls; suits of tarnished armour; and ancient tapestries embroidered  with grim and ghastly legends of the past.</p>
  <p>The  old house was crammed with treasures, rare enough to drive an antiquarian  crazy; and filled with the flotsam and jetsam of many centuries, mellowed by time  into one soft hue, which put them all in keeping with one another. I must say  that I was charmed with Ringshaw Grange, and no longer wondered at the pride  taken by Percy Ringan in his family and their past glories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all very well,&rdquo; said Frank, to whom I remarked as much; &ldquo;Percy is rich, and had  he this place could keep it up in proper style; but I am as poor as a rat, and  unless I can make a rich marriage, or inherit a comfortable legacy, house and  furniture park and timber may all come to the hammer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked gloomy as he spoke; and, feeling that I had touched on a somewhat  delicate matter, I hastened to change the subject, by asking to be shown the  famous Blue Chamber, which was said to be haunted. This was the true Mecca of  my pilgrimage into Hants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is along this passage,&rdquo; said Frank, leading the way, &ldquo;and not very far from  your own quarters. There is nothing in its looks likely to hint at the ghost&mdash;at  all events by day&mdash;but it is haunted for all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  speaking he led me into a large room with a low ceiling, and a broad casement  looking out on to the untrimmed park, where the woodland was most sylvan. The  walls were hung with blue cloth embroidered with grotesque figures in black  braid or thread, I know not which. There was a large old-fashioned bed with  tester and figured curtains and a quantity of cumbersome furniture of the early  Georgian epoch. Not having been inhabited for many years the room had a  desolate and silent look &mdash;if one may use such an expression&mdash;and to my mind  looked gruesome enough to conjure up a battalion of ghosts, let alone one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you!&rdquo; said I, in reply to my host&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;To my mind this  is the very model of a haunted chamber. What is the legend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell it to you on Christmas Eve,&rdquo; replied Rigan, as we left the room. &ldquo;It is  rather a bloodcurdling tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you believe it?&rdquo; said I, struck by the solemn air of the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have had evidence to make me credulous,&rdquo; he replied dryly, and closed the  subject for the time being.</p>
  <p>It  was renewed on Christmas Eve when all our company were gathered round a huge  wood fire in the library. Outside, the snow lay thick on the ground, and the  gaunt trees stood up black and leafless out of the white expanse. The sky was  of a frosty blue with sharply-twinkling stars, and a hard-looking moon. On the  snow the shadows of interlacing boughs were traced blackly as in Indian ink,  and the cold was of Arctic severity.</p>
  <p>But  seated in the holly-decked apartment before a noble fire which roared bravely  up the wide chimney we cared nothing for the frozen world out of doors. We  laughed and talked, sang songs and recalled adventures, until somewhere about  ten o&rsquo;clock we fell into a ghostly vein quite in keeping with the  goblin-haunted season. It was then that Frank Ringan was called upon to chill  our blood with his local legend. This he did without much pressing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the reign of good Queen Anne,&rdquo; said he, with a gravity befitting the subject, &ldquo;my  ancestor Hugh Ringan, was the owner of this house. He was a silent misanthropic  man, having been soured early in life by the treachery of a woman. Mistrusting  the sex he refused to marry for many years; and it was not until he was fifty  years of age that he was beguiled by the arts of a pretty girl into the toils  of matrimony. The lady was Joan Challoner, the daughter of the Earl of  Branscourt; and she was esteemed one of the beauties of Queen Anne&rsquo;s court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was in London that Hugh met her, and thinking from her innocent and child-like  appearance that she would make him a true-hearted wife, he married her after a  six months&rsquo; courtship and brought her with all honour to Ringshaw Grange. After  his marriage he became more cheerful and less distrustful of his  fellow-creatures. Lady Joan was all to him that a wife could be, and seemed devoted  to her husband and child&mdash;for she early became a mother&mdash; when one Christmas Eve  all this happiness came to an end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said I, rather cynically. &ldquo;So Lady Joan proved to be no better than the rest of  her sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Hugh Ringan thought, Doctor; but he was as mistaken as you are. Lady Joan  occupied the Blue Room, which I showed you the other day; and on Christmas Eve,  when riding home late, Hugh saw a man descend from the window. Thunderstruck by  the sight, he galloped after the man and caught him before he could mount a  horse which was waiting for him. The cavalier was a handsome young fellow of  twenty-five, who refused to answer Hugh&rsquo;s questions. Thinking, naturally  enough, that he had to do with a lover of his wife&rsquo;s, Hugh fought a duel with  the stranger and killed him after a hard fight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaving  him dead on the snow he rode back to the Grange, and burst in on his wife to  accuse her of perfidy. It was in vain that Lady Joan tried to defend herself by  stating that the visitor was her brother, who was engaged in plots for the  restoration of James II., and on that account wished to keep secret the fact of  his presence in England. Hugh did not believe her, and told her plainly that he  had killed her lover; whereupon Lady Joan burst out into a volley of reproaches  and cursed her husband. Furious at what he deemed was her boldness Hugh at  first attempted to kill her, but not thinking the punishment sufficient, he cut  off her right hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked everyone, quite unprepared for this information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  in the first place Lady Joan was very proud of her beautiful white hands, and  in the second Hugh had seen the stranger kiss her hand&mdash;her right hand&mdash;before he  descended from the window. For these reasons he mutilated her thus terribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  a week after her hand was cut off. And she swore that she would come back to  touch all those in the Blue Room&mdash;that is who slept in it&mdash;who were foredoomed to  death. She kept her promise, for many people who have slept in that fatal room  have been touched by the dead hand of Lady Joan, and have subsequently died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Hugh find out that his wife was innocent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did,&rdquo; replied Ringan, &ldquo;and within a month after her death. The stranger was  really her brother, plotting for James II., as she had stated. Hugh was not  punished by man for his crime, but within a year he slept in the Blue Chamber  and was found dead next morning with the mark of three fingers on his right  wrist. It was thought that in his remorse he had courted death by sleeping in  the room cursed by his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  there was a mark on him?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  his right wrist red marks like a burn; the impression of three fingers. Since  that time the room has been haunted,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  everyone who sleeps in it die?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Many people have risen well and hearty in the morning. Only those who are  doomed to an early death are thus touched!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did the last case occur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  years ago,&rdquo; was Frank&rsquo;s unexpected reply. &ldquo;A friend of mine called Herbert  Spencer would sleep in that room. He saw the ghost and was touched. He showed  me the marks next morning&mdash; three red finger marks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  the omen hold good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Spencer died three months afterwards. He was thrown from his horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was  about to put further questions in a sceptical vein, when we heard shouts  outside, and we all sprang to our feet as the door was thrown open to admit  Miss Laura in a state of excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire!  fire!&rdquo; she cried, almost distracted. &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Ringan,&rdquo; addressing herself to  Percy, &ldquo;your room is on fire! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  waited to hear no more, but in a body rushed up to Percy&rsquo;s room. Volumes of  smoke were rolling out of the door, and flames were flashing within. Frank  Ringan, however, was prompt and coolheaded. He had the alarm bell rung,  summoned the servants, grooms, and stable hands, and in twenty minutes the fire  was extinguished.</p>
  <p>On  asking how the fire had started, Miss Laura, with much hysterical sobbing,  stated that she had gone into Percy&rsquo;s room to see that all was ready and  comfortable for the night. Unfortunately the wind wafted one of the bed-curtains  towards the candle she was carrying, and in a moment the room was in a blaze.  After pacifying Miss Laura, who could not help the accident, Frank turned to  his cousin. By this time we were back again in the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your room is swimming in water, and is charred with  fire. I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t stay there to-night; but I don&rsquo;t know where to put  you unless you take the Blue Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Blue Room!&rdquo; we all cried. &ldquo;What! the haunted chamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  all the other rooms are full. Still, if Percy is afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo;  cried Percy indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid at all. I&rsquo;ll sleep in the Blue Room  with the greatest of pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the ghost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care for the ghost,&rdquo; interrupted the Australian, with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;We  have no ghosts in our part of the world, and as I have not seen one, I do not  believe there is such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all tried to dissuade him from sleeping in the haunted room, and several of us  offered to give up our apartments for the night&mdash;Frank among the number. But  Percy&rsquo;s dignity was touched, and he was resolute to keep his word. He had  plenty of pluck, as I said before, and the fancy that we might think him a  coward spurred him on to resist our entreaties. </p>
  <p>The  end of it was that shortly before midnight he went off to the Blue Room, and  declared his intention of sleeping in it. There was nothing more to be said in  the face of such obstinacy, so one by one we retired, quite unaware of the  events to happen before the morning. So on that Christmas Eve the Blue Room had  an unexpected tenant.</p>
  <p>On  going to my bedroom I could not sleep. The tale told by Frank Ringan haunted my  fancy, and the idea of Percy sleeping in that ill-omened room made me nervous.  I did not believe in ghosts myself, nor, so far as I knew, did Percy, but the  little man suffered from heart disease&mdash;he was strung up to a high nervous pitch  by our ghost stories&mdash;and if anything out of the common&mdash;even from natural  causes&mdash;happened in that room, the shock might be fatal to its occupant.</p>
  <p>I  knew well enough that Percy, out of pride, would refuse to give up the room,  yet I was determined that he should not sleep in it; so, failing persuasion, I  employed stratagem. I had my medicine chest with me, and taking it from my  portmanteau I prepared a powerful narcotic. I left this on the table and went  along to the Blue Room, which, as I have said before, was not very far from  mine.</p>
  <p>A  knock brought Percy to the door, clothed in pyjamas, and at a glance I could  see that the ghostly atmosphere of the place was already telling on his nerves.  He looked pale and disturbed, but his mouth was firmly set with an obstinate  expression likely to resist my proposals. However, out of diplomacy, I made  none, but blandly stated my errand, with more roughness, indeed, than was necessary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to my room, Percy,&rdquo; I said, when he appeared, &ldquo;and let me give you something to  calm your nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not afraid!&rdquo; he said, defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  said you were?&rdquo; I rejoined, tartly. &ldquo;You believe in ghosts no more than I do,  so why should you be afraid? But after the alarm of fire your nerves are upset,  and I want to give you something to put them right. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll get no  sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t mind a composing draught, certainly,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;Have you  it here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it&rsquo;s in my room, a few yards off. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quite  deluded by my speech and manner, Percy followed me into my bedroom, and  obediently enough swallowed the medicine. Then I made him sit down in a  comfortable arm-chair, on the plea that he must not walk immediately after the  draught. The result of my experiment was justified, for in less than ten  minutes the poor little man was fast asleep under the influence of the  narcotic. When thus helpless, I placed him on my bed, quite satisfied that he  would not awaken until late the next day. My task accomplished, I extinguished  the light, and went off myself to the Blue Room, intending to remain there for  the night.</p>
  <p>It  may be asked why I did so, as I could easily have taken my rest on the sofa in  my own room; but the fact is, I was anxious to sleep in a haunted chamber. I  did not believe in ghosts, as I had never seen one, but as there was a chance  of meeting here with an authentic phantom I did not wish to lose the  opportunity.</p>
  <p>Therefore  when I saw that Percy was safe for the night, I took up my quarters in the  ghostly territory, with much curiosity, but&mdash;as I can safely aver&mdash;no fear. All  the same, in case of practical jokes on the part of the feather-headed young  men in the house, I took my revolver with me. Thus prepared, I locked the door  of the Blue Room and slipped into bed, leaving the light burning. The revolver  I kept under my pillow ready to my hand in case of necessity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said I grimly, as I made myself comfortable, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for ghosts, or goblins,  or practical jokers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  lay awake for a long time, staring at the queer figures on the blue draperies  of the apartment. In the pale flame of the candle they looked ghostly enough to  disturb the nerves of anyone: and when the draught fluttered the tapestries the  figures seemed to move as though alive. For this sight alone I was glad that  Percy had not slept in that room. I could fancy the poor man lying in that vast  bed with blanched face and beating heart, listening to every creak, and  watching the fantastic embroideries waving on the walls. Brave as he was, I am  sure the sounds and sights of that room would have shaken his nerves, I did not  feel very comfortable myself, sceptic as I was.</p>
  <p>When  the candle had burned down pretty low I fell asleep. How long I slumbered I  know not: but I woke up with the impression that something or some one was in  the room. The candle had wasted nearly to the socket and the flame was  flickering and leaping fitfully, so as to display the room one moment and leave  it almost in darkness the next. I heard a soft step crossing the room, and as  it drew near a sudden spurt of flame from the candle showed me a little woman  standing by the side of the bed. She was dressed in a gown of flowered brocade,  and wore the towering head dress of the Queen Anne epoch. Her face I could  scarcely see, as the flash of flame was only momentary; but I felt what the  Scotch call a deadly grue as I realized that this was the veritable phantom of  Lady Joan.</p>
  <p>For  the moment the natural dread of the supernatural quite overpowered me, and with  my hands and arms lying outside the counterpane I rested inert and chilled with  fear. This sensation of helplessness in the presence of evil, was like what one  experiences in a nightmare of the worst kind.</p>
  <p>When  again the flame of the expiring candle shot up, I beheld the ghost close at  hand, and&mdash;as I felt rather than saw&mdash;knew that it was bending over me. A faint  odour of musk was in the air, and I heard the soft rustle of the brocaded  skirts echo through the semi-darkness. The next moment I felt my right wrist  gripped in a burning grasp, and the sudden pain roused my nerves from their  paralysis.</p>
  <p>With  a yell I rolled over, away from the ghost, wrenching my wrist from that  horrible clasp, and, almost mad with pain I groped with my left hand for the revolver.  As I seized it the candle flared up for the last time, and I saw the ghost  gliding back towards the tapestries. In a second I raised the revolver and  fired. The next moment there was a wild cry of terror and agony, the fall of a  heavy body on the floor, and almost before I knew where I was I found myself  outside the door of the haunted room. To attract attention I fired another shot  from my revolver, while the Thing on the floor moaned in the darkness most  horribly.</p>
  <p>In  a few moments guests and servants, all in various stages of undress, came  rushing along the passage bearing lights. A babel of voices arose, and I managed  to babble some incoherent explanation, and led the way into the room. There on  the floor lay the ghost, and we lowered the candles to look at its face. I  sprang up with a cry on recognising who it was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frank  Ringan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was indeed Frank Ringan disguised as a woman in wig and brocades. He looked at  me with a ghostly face, his mouth working nervously. With an effort he raised  himself on his hands and tried to speak&mdash;whether in confession or exculpation, I  know not. But the attempt was too much for him, a choking cry escaped his lips,  a jet of blood burst from his mouth, and he fell back dead.</p>
  <p>Over  the rest of the events of that terrible night I draw a veil. There are some  things it is as well not to speak of. Only I may state that all through the  horror and confusion Percy Ringan, thanks to my strong sleeping draught,  slumbered as peacefully as a child, thereby saving his life.</p>
  <p>With  the morning&rsquo;s light came discoveries and explanations. We found one of the  panels behind the tapestry of the Blue Room open, and it gave admittance into a  passage which on examination proved to lead into Frank Ringan&rsquo;s bedroom. On the  floor we discovered a delicate hand formed of steel, and which bore marks of  having been in the fire. On my right wrist were three distinct burns, which I  have no hesitation in declaring, were caused by the mechanical hand which we  picked up near the dead man. And the explanation of these things came from Miss  Laura, who was wild with terror at the death of her master, and said in her  first outburst of grief and fear, what I am sure she regretted in her calmer  moments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all Frank&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; she wept. &ldquo;He was poor and wished to be rich. He got Percy  to make his will in his favour, and wanted to kill him by a shock. He knew that  Percy had heart disease and that a shock might prove fatal; so he contrived  that his cousin should sleep in the Blue Room on Christmas Eve; and he himself  played the ghost of Lady Joan with the burning hand. It was a steel hand, which  he heated in his own room so as to mark with a scar those it touched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose  idea was this?&rdquo; I asked, horrified by the devilish ingenuity of the scheme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frank&rsquo;s!&rdquo;  said Miss Laura, candidly. &ldquo;He promised to marry me if I helped him to get the  money by Percy&rsquo;s death. We found that there was a secret passage leading to the  Blue Room; so some years ago we invented the story that it was haunted.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  in God&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Frank was always poor. He knew that his cousin in Australia had heart disease,  and invited him home to kill him with fright. To make things safe he was always  talking about the haunted room and telling the story so that everything should  be ready for Percy on his arrival. Our plans were all carried out. Percy  arrived and Frank got him to make the will in his favour. Then he was told the  story of Lady Joan and her hand, and by setting fire to Percy&rsquo;s room last night  I got him to sleep in the Blue Chamber without any suspicion being aroused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;  You wicked woman!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Did you fire Percy&rsquo;s room on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Frank promised to marry me if I helped him. We had to get Percy to sleep in the  Blue Chamber, and I managed it by setting fire to his bedroom. He would have  died with fright when Frank, as Lady Joan, touched him with the steel hand, and  no one would have been the wiser. Your sleeping in that haunted room saved  Percy&rsquo;s life, Dr. Lascelles: yet Frank invited you down as part of his scheme,  that you might examine the body: and declare the death to be a natural one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it Frank who burnt the wrist of Herbert Spence some years ago?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  replied Miss Laura, wiping her red eyes. &ldquo;We thought if the ghost appeared to a  few other people, that Percy&rsquo;s death might seem more natural. It was a mere  coincidence that Mr. Spence died three months after the ghost touched him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know you are a very wicked woman, Miss Laura?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a very unhappy one,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I have lost the only man I ever loved;  and his miserable cousin survives to step into his shoes as the master of  Ringshaw Grange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  was the sole conversation I had with the wretched woman, for shortly afterwards  she disappeared, and I fancy must have gone abroad, as she was never more heard  of. At the inquest held on the body of Frank the whole strange story came out, and  was reported at full length by the London press to the dismay of ghost-seers:  for the fame of Ringshaw Grange as a haunted mansion had been great in the  land.</p>
  <p>I  was afraid lest the jury should bring in a verdict of manslaughter against me,  but the peculiar features of the case being taken into consideration I was  acquitted of blame, and shortly afterwards returned to India with an  unblemished character. Percy Ringan was terribly distressed on hearing of his  cousin&rsquo;s death, and shocked by the discovery of his treachery. However, he was  consoled by becoming the head of the family, and as he lives a quiet life at  Ringshaw Grange there is not much chance of his early death from heart  disease&mdash;at all events from a ghostly point of view.</p>
  <p>The  blue chamber is shut up, for it is haunted now by a worse spectre than that of  Lady Joan, whose legend (purely fictitious) was so ingeniously set forth by  Frank. It is haunted by the ghost of the coldblooded scoundrel who fell into  his own trap; and who met with his death in the very moment he was contriving  that of another man. As to myself, I have given up ghost-hunting and sleeping  in haunted rooms. Nothing will ever tempt me to experiment in that way again.  One adventure of that sort is enough to last me a lifetime. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASpiritInMyFeet"></a>A Spirit In  My Feet</b></h2>
  <p>If  the members of Psychical Society choose to theorise on this story, they are at  liberty to do so. It is authentic, and, so far as I can see, inexplicable, save  by the admission of spiritual influence. Always excepting the present instance,  I am unacquainted with the unseen world, and therefore do not profess to  account for the unaccountable. Those connected with the Society aforesaid,  which is, I understand, familiar with the laws governing spiritism, may perhaps  place the matter in a more reasonable light, and if thus fortunate I trust they  will furnish me with the explanation, as at present I dare not even hazard an  opinion. &ldquo;There are more things in heaven and earth,&rdquo;&mdash;but that saying has been used  many times as an excuse for ignorance.</p>
  <p>I  confess to being a doctor and sceptical as regards the supernatural&mdash;that is, I  was sceptical, but this one intervention of the unseen has shaken my disbelief  in the influence of the invisible. Nevertheless, I am not yet prepared to go to  the other extreme and assume the existence of a hierarchy of ghostly presences  ruling mortals from beyond the grave. My position is entirely neutral. I  neither believe nor disbelieve, uphold nor condemn; but on the strength of my  exorcism of the Marrit Grange ghost I admit a decided leaning to Hamlet&rsquo;s view  above quoted.</p>
  <p>Taken  in bulk medical men are decidedly sceptical.</p>
  <p>They  believe in nothing but what they can see, handle, or explain away. As a  watchmaker does a watch, they can take the human frame to pieces and determine  the necessity and function of each component part. The heart, reservoir of the  blood; the veins, so many pipes conducting the nutritious fluid to all parts of  the body; the brain, seat of the intelligence and register of internal and  external happenings; the muscles, a network of elastic bands expanding and  contracting with the desire of the controlling power. Of all these they have  determined the existence, and the reason for such existence; but not having  discovered a tangible soul in any portion of the body, they, in many cases,  deny existence. The case argued syllogistically stands thus:&mdash; &ldquo;A soul is  necessary to an incorporeal existence.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no soul discoverable.&rdquo; Ergo, &ldquo;there  can be no incorporeal existence.&rdquo; Thus in one sweep do these learned men  dispose of ghosts and ghostdom.</p>
  <p>If  their view be the right one, then my experience at Marrit Grange is not to be  explained by natural laws; if wrong, and the existence of the supernatural be  assumed, then I may claim to have been utilised by spiritual influence for the  furtherance of human justice. I decline to commit myself to any opinion in so  delicate a matter, for the gratification of the public curiosity I set forth  clearly all that took place at the Grange. Those who run can read; those who read  can expound&mdash;if they can.</p>
  <p>When  my aunt Selina died, I was twenty-six years of age, and a duly qualified  M.R.C.P. without a practice, without money, and without influence in high  places to further me in my profession. I as her sole relative inherited her  blessing, and the sum of two thousand pounds, with which nest-egg I proposed to  improve my position. My friends advised the purchase of a practice in London,  but I had no notion of sinking my all in so risky a speculation. Patients do  not care to be sold like a flock of sheep, and naturally enough prefer to use  their own judgment in selecting a doctor: consequently the purchaser of a  practice is by no means sure of enjoying that for which he has paid. Some  patients object to the new doctor, and decline his visits; others get well or  die, in either of which cases they do not require him; and it generally ends in  the unlucky interloper having to build up a new practice on the ruins of an old  one. With these ideas I scouted the well meant advice and resolved to start &ldquo;ab  ovum.&rdquo; Also as I did not like London it was my intention to leave the  metropolis, and set up my tent in the wholesome country air.</p>
  <p>I  therefore banked my legacy, and travelled through southern England in search of  a fairly unhealthy neighbourhood, where I might hope to find a sufficiency of  sickly folks to physic in return for their guineas. After many weary weeks and  still more weary railway journeys, I came to Denhampton, on the Sussex coast,  where, attracted by the beauty of the neighbourhood, I resolved to make an end  of my wanderings.</p>
  <p>It  was a rising watering-place but being yet in its infancy, had only one doctor  to look after those who resorted to its breezy downs, and sandy beaches. There  was ample room for another practitioner, and after exploring the locality, and  making use of certain introductions, and asking innumerable questions, I came  to the conclusions that here if anywhere, I would find opportunity of utilising  my small fortune, and medical experience.</p>
  <p>Absence  from London was no exile to me, for country born and bred as I was, the smoky  atmosphere of Bloomsbury was abhorrent to my lungs and &nbsp;the lack of green fields a weariness to my  eyes. I infinitely preferred Denhampton, with its undulating downs, its chalky  cliffs fretted by the Channel waves; and between the two that quaint little  village expanded on three sides into rows of pleasant villas and desirable  mansions facing the sharp sea breeze on windy heights. Moreover, Denhampton was  growing rapidly, and I hoped to improve my fortunes at the same pace; so having  decided my course, I sought for a residence with a sufficiently imposing door,  whereon to affix my newly-graven brass plate.</p>
  <p>Midway  between old and new Denhampton stretched a broad road of no great length  connecting the ancient village with the more modem town. On one side grassy  fields sloped to the crumbling edges of the cliffs, on the other on a slight  rise, some distance back from the highway, stood Marrit Grange. It was one of  the oldest houses in that part of the country, a squat building of grey stone,  fronted by a terrace, and girdled by lawns dotted with many trees, heavy  boughed, and gnarled. From the iron gates giving on the road aforesaid, a  winding drive led to the front door, which was placed immediately beside the  terrace, and a truncated tower rising above this to no very great height,  commanded a fine view of the Channel.</p>
  <p>Neglected  as were the grounds, and desolate as was the mansion&mdash;for it had been  uninhabited for some considerable period&mdash;I conceived a fancy for the place.</p>
  <p>It  stood in its own grounds, it was quiet and retired; it suited my studious  leanings, yet occupied an excellent position for one of my profession. Living  here I would be equally placed between village and watering place, so could  attend to possible patients in both without much trouble. All things  considering, I did not hope to find a place offering more advantages, so went  in search of the agent in whose hands, as I was informed by a board in the  grounds, it was placed for letting.</p>
  <p>Darver,  the agent, was a solemn-looking creature, more like an undertaker than anything  else and, welcomed my intimation that I proposed to practise in the town with a  dry smile. Small as was this evidence of pleasure, it vanished altogether when  I spoke of Marrit Grange, and he started at the mention of the name. Then his  desire to do business swamped all other considerations, and he resumed his dry  smile and buckram civilities. For some time he kept up this fine affectation of  carelessness, but in the end an inborn love of gossip got the better of his  desire to gain a tenant, and he warned me solemnly against the house. But that  came later in our conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish to take Marrit Grange, I understand,&rdquo; said he, eyeing me with some  curiosity. &ldquo;Aye, aye. It&rsquo;s a fine place for a doctor that Midway between the  two towns, you can physic your patients at your will. A healthy situation, too,  dry and salubrious, with five acres of good land, and an orchard. A very  desirable residence indeed,&rdquo; he concluded with his dry smile, &ldquo;and to be let  furnished for ten years at a moderate rental!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had not thought of taking it furnished,&rdquo; I answered, after a pause, &ldquo;but that  will not stand in the way: always supposing that the furniture is decent&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the furniture is as solid and plentiful as can be desired, Dr. Phelps,&rdquo; he  answered with a nod. &ldquo;The last tenant left the house two years back, but I have  had the place well looked after in case anyone took a fancy to living there.  You&rsquo;ll find it as spruce as a new pin and uncommonly comfortable. Maybe it is  in your mind to look over the house?&rdquo; he concluded with a glance, dubious and  inquiring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  I should not think of making an offer without a thorough examination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sensible  enough,&rdquo; said he, selecting a bunch of keys from several dangling from the  wall. &ldquo;If you are not engaged we will walk over now. Just so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  proposition falling in with my views, I readily accepted the same, and in a few  minutes we were on our road to the Grange. Darver, lean and lank, and wondrous  grim, expatiated on the comfort of the house, the excellence of the position,  and the moderation of the rent. When he informed me of this last I was a trifle  surprised at the smallness of the sum demanded for so well-furnished and large  a mansion.</p>
  <p>We  were then standing in the drawing-room, beside one of three French windows  which overlooked a stone-flagged terrace, beyond which spread the lawn, girded  by laurel trees. A sun-dial stood in the centre of the greenness, and broad  shallow steps led from the terrace to the gravelled paths. On the other side of  the laurels ran the road, and to right and left I could catch a glimpse of red  roofs and lean chimneys. All this with the leaping waves of the Channel  whitening in the distance, looked extremely cheerful under a bright sky filled  with sunshine, and more than ever was I determined to secure the house. But the  ridiculously small rent at once surprised me, and raised my suspicions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  the drains all right, Mr. Darver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,  Doctor, in perfect order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m;  the situation is healthy, the house comfortable,&rdquo; said I dubiously; &ldquo;why has it  not been let before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been let several times,&rdquo; said Mr. Darver; &ldquo;but the tenants left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  they were fools,&rdquo; said he scoffingly &ldquo;Not one of them stayed over the month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rent you ask is very small considering the advantages you offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so, Doctor. It&rsquo;s a bargain not to be met with every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much of a bargain that I think there must be some drawback!&rdquo; said I, dryly; &ldquo;come,  now, Mr. Darver, is there anything wrong about this place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Doctor,&rdquo; said he, jingling the keys; &ldquo;it has been in my mind to tell you, so I&rsquo;ll  make a clean breast of it. This house is said to be haunted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  burst out laughing at this communication. The mountain had only produced a  mouse after all. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  Ghosts went out with gas; you can&rsquo;t frighten me with an old woman&rsquo;s tale of  that sort&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Darver, grimly; &ldquo;several of the tenants were of the same  way of thinking, but they left, bag and baggage, for all that&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is becoming interesting,&rdquo; I said, with a scorn which I took no pains to  conceal. &ldquo;Do you believe in the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. I never slept there,&rdquo; was the laconic answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prevention  is better than cure? Eh? Well, Mr. Darver, in what form does the ghost make its  appearance&mdash;winding sheet, rusty armour, brocaded gown, or what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an invisible ghost,&rdquo; replied Darver; &ldquo;nothing is seen&mdash;nothing is heard&mdash;but  something is felt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  explanation was so ridiculous that I made no further objection to concluding  the bargain. This nonsense about supernatural influence was more than balanced  by the advantages to be gained. Indeed, thinking of my lean purse, I mentally  thanked the ghost for having reduced the rent to such small proportions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Mr. Darver,&rdquo; said I, promptly, &ldquo;if no one else will take the house I am not  afraid to do so. Let us walk back to your office and discuss the matter. On the  way you can tell me the story, whence originated this belief that the Grange is  haunted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you really intend to take this house,&rdquo; exclaimed Darver, with considerable  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  once. As soon as the lease is signed I shall move in and commence practice. I  hope to exorcise the ghost, and if I do the rent will, of course, remain at the  same figure. The lease will place all that on a proper footing. Well, Mr.  Darver, tell me the story and let me hear what I have to expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has to do with a disappearance,&rdquo; said Darver promptly. &ldquo;A Mrs. Brunei lived  here ten years ago. She was a wealthy old widow with a distrust of banks and  investments, and so kept a large portion of her wealth in the house. Being of a  miserly disposition, she kept only two servants,&mdash;a woman nearly as old, and  quite as avaricious as herself, and a man who was considerably younger than  either. They grubbed on here in a sparse fashion, and&mdash;well, to make along story  short, the three of them disappeared one week and were never heard of again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is certainly strange that three people should disappear at one and the same  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  everybody remarked,&rdquo; replied Darver, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;But whether the  man murdered the two women, or they killed him and fled, it is hard to say. The  heirs of Mrs. Brunei found no money in the house, so no doubt there was robbery  mixed up in the affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very unsatisfactory story,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;those three people could not have been  murdered, or evidence of the crime would have been found. On the other hand,  there was no reason as far as I can see, why they should disappear. However, I  accept the tale for what it is worth, though I do not see the connection  between this disappearance of three people and your ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is simple enough. The heirs of Mrs. Brunei let the house furnished, and it was  speedily taken, being as you see in an excellent position. In less than a month  the tenants cleared out, because they said an Influence pervaded the house, and  made them get out of their beds and wander about the house. Moreover, they  insisted that something or someone was invariably looking over their shoulders,  when they talked, or ate, or read. In short, they declared that the house was  haunted, and made them uncomfortable, so they cleared out. The next tenants  told the same story, and acted in the same manner; so did the third lot till  the belief became general that the Grange was haunted. Of course, the rumour  depreciated the value of the place, as no tenant would lease the property. You  are the first person for twelve months who has made up his mind to brave the  superstition. That is,&rdquo; added Darver, significantly, &ldquo;if you are still of the  same mind.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I a child to be frightened by a bogey?&rdquo; I retorted smartly, &ldquo;of course I am of  the same mind. If this influence or ghost, or whatever you call it, can make a  hardworked doctor keep midnight vigils, I may become a convert to spiritualism.  However, as such a thing is not likely to happen, I accept the situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having  come to this decision, I lost no time in acting in accordance therewith, and  within a fortnight was installed at the Grange. My experience of the first  night forced me to recognised that the former tenants had some excuse for  leaving so ill-omened a mansion.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The  drawing-room, as I have said, was lighted by three French windows, which opened  on to the terrace. A large and lofty apartment it was, sparsely furnished in an  old-fashioned manner, and pervaded by a chilly atmosphere, highly suggestive of  ghosts. Here, if anywhere, the Influence was most likely to exercise its  powers, and, anxious to test the truth of Darver&rsquo;s extraordinary story, I  waited in that apartment the whole of the first evening, expectant of the  supernatural.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding  the heat of June the room, long uninhabited, was so cold that I lighted the  fire, and drawing my chair close to its cheerful blaze, meditated over a new  medical work which had lately made its appearance. My nerves were strong, my  scepticism confirmed, so I was quite prepared to face the power which had made  exiles of the former tenants. Twice or thrice I glanced at the closed door  expecting it to open, and admit the ghostly forms of Mrs. Brunei and her  servants; but, needless to say, nothing of the sort happened, and it was close  on eleven o&rsquo;clock before I felt the first manifestation of the unseen. Then I  became aware that someone was looking over my shoulder as I read. Turning  suddenly round I saw nothing, as I expected; and, in the revulsion of feeling, I  laughed at myself for the momentary panic which had seized me.</p>
  <p>The  same feeling occurred in ten minutes, and again I beheld nothing. Then the idea  that there was something or someone in the room became rooted in my mind, and  laying down my book, I paced slowly up and down the polished floor. One shaded  lamp placed on a small table by the fire alone gave light to the vast  apartment, and merely hollowed out a tiny gulf of light in the surrounding  gloom. More lights were necessary for the adequate illumination of so large a  space, but was I resolved on giving the ghost every chance, and judged it would  find the semi darkness more congenial to its visitation. As the minute hand  drew past eleven I became nervous.</p>
  <p>My  three servants were in a distant part of the mansion, and worn out by unpacking  and arranging furniture, were doubtless sound asleep. In all that desolate  place I was the only wakeful being, and, isolated in the chilly drawing-room in  company with some invisible being, I own frankly that my nerves were rather  shaken. In vain I reminded myself of my confirmed scepticism; that there were  no such things as spirits, that I entirely disbelieved in the existence of the  supernatural; it was all of no use, for the feeling that someone walked beside  me grew stronger and stronger, till I was quite panic-stricken.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said I aloud, and the sound of my own voice somewhat restored my courage, &ldquo;now  I am in a frame of mind likely to admit of apparitions appearing. If there is  any spectre here, let him or her, or it appear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ghost did not accept my invitation, and the silence seemed to deepen, though  occasionally it was broken by the splutter of the fire. So strongly did the  memory of that story and my present isolation from human intercourse work on my  nerves that I unexpectedly found myself standing in the centre of the room,  straining my ears to hear, straining my eyes to see. Of course, I neither saw  nor heard anything to occasion me the least alarm; yet all the same I found a  cold sweat on my forehead, and my hand trembled as I drew out my handkerchief.</p>
  <p>Suddenly,  and without the least warning, I heard a light footstep on the flagged terrace.  It passed the first window, the second, and paused irresolutely at the third,  which was furthest away from where I was standing. In that instant I pictured  to myself an eye looking into the room through a chink in the Venetian blind,  and surveying a solitary man struck motionless with panic in the semi-darkness.  Never till that moment did I experience fear, for I can safely say that I am  not a coward; but all my nerve and scepticism were not proof against that  deadly qualm which gripped me at the moment. It lengthened to a century of  agonised fear, and then by a strong effort I recovered the use of my limbs, and  darted towards the third window. With inconceivable rapidity I whirled up the  blind and flung open the window only to behold&mdash; nothing. Before me stretched  the broad expanse of the terrace, the shallow steps, the green lawn with its  central sun-dial, and the laurel hedges dark and sombre. Over all lay the cold  moonlight still and white, but no sign could I see of any one, no sound could I  catch of breathing or of footstep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  I am a child,&rdquo; said I, reclosing the window, but leaving the blind up so as to  watch for a possible visitor; &ldquo;my nerves are unstrung by this isolation. I  shall go to bed, and to-morrow take steps to investigate the cause of these  silly fears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  footsteps echoed no more, and curiously enough the feeling of a presence in the  room passed away. I recovered my nerve, and having banked up the fire, took  book and lamp and retired to bed. So far as I was concerned the ghostly  visitation was over for that night. I was not sorry to leave the uncanny  atmosphere of the drawing-room.</p>
  <p>Safely  in bed, I laughed at my fears and wondered how it was that my boasted  scepticism had not been able to sustain me in the hour of trial. Yet I could  not but admit that there was something about the drawing-room not to be  explained by the ordinary laws of nature. The feeling of an invisible presence,  the echoing footsteps, the deadly qualms, and consequent paralysis of  action&mdash;all these hinted at the supernatural; I did not believe in ghosts; I  laughed to scorn the tales of haunted houses; yet now that I was in one  credited with possessing a spectre I felt uncommonly doubtful about my previous  scepticism. With these thoughts in my mind I fell into an easy slumber.</p>
  <p>At  what time I woke I know not; as in putting out my hand for the matches I swept  them on to the floor, and could not find them again. In the darkness I could  not see the time, and so lay there wondering why I had so unexpectedly been  aroused from sleep. It had not been a gradual awaking, but in the instant, I  had opened my eyes and sat up in bed in full possession of my senses. Every  nerve was tingling, every muscle was braced, every faculty was on the alert&mdash;for  what I know not. The thick darkness was cold and heavy as I sat there qualmish  and fearful; apparently forgotten of God, and given over to the powers of the  air, in whose existence I had previously been a firm disbeliever.</p>
  <p>In  thought-reading the idea of what he is to do is impressed on the mind of the  subject, by the person who wills the act. The thought grows and grows until the  mind controls the body, and the individual so willed moves towards the desired  goal as by an overpowering impulse, At this moment my feelings were precisely  the same. Into my mind flashed a thought&mdash;whence I know not&mdash;which impelled me to  rise, so, mechanically obeying the impulse which, I solemnly declare I was  unable to resist, I sprang out of bed and threw my dressing gown over my  shoulders. Thus scantily attired, with my bare feet taking a chill from the  floor, I stood in the thick darkness; a mere instrument, my intelligence  powerless in the grip of some unseen force. It was not a trance for I knew what  I was doing, nor somnambulism, for my brain was quite open to external  impressions. Here I, Edward Phelps, medical practitioner, sceptic, man of  science, stood awaiting like a child the order of a power of which I saw  nothing, knew nothing, heard nothing.</p>
  <p>I  had no time to think of Darver&rsquo;s story, or of the Influence mentioned therein;  for all my thoughts were directed to obeying the orders which seemed to steal  imperceptibly into my mind. But a moment I paused by the bed, when in obedience  to the over-conquering impulse&mdash;just like thought-reading&mdash;I moved towards the  door. Out into the dark corridor I glided like a ghost. I turned to the right,  descended the stairs, walked to the left and paused before the drawing-room  door. As in Shelley&rsquo;s poem, a spirit in my feet drew me onward, though to what  end I could not conceive. All my efforts were powerless to shake off the  imperious spell, and though I hesitated at the door (to struggle with the  impulse) in the end I was compelled to obey.</p>
  <p>I  entered the drawing-room and saw the red glow of the fire shine on the polished  floor. With an almost devilish dexterity I evaded the furniture&mdash;this seemed to  be extraordinary in that I was not familiarly acquainted with its  disposition&mdash;and moved towards the third window. The blind yet remained up, and  I looked out on a white, cold world, still and weird. Again I struggled with  the Influence; again it overmastered my reason, and I raised my hand to the  latch of the window. Thence I walked on to the terrace, down the shallow steps,  across the wet grass, and &nbsp;finally laid  my hands on the cold stone of the dial. The impulse ceased, and I looked round  in a bewildered fashion wondering what I was doing outside at that hour of the  morning.</p>
  <p>At  that moment the moon threw the shadow of a man on the grass beside me. I turned  with a cry and he leaped at my throat. Over and over he rolled on the sward,  and I tried to save myself from his cruel fingers. Strong as I was, he was  stronger, and at length he gained the mastery. Forcing me under he gripped my  throat so that I could not cry out; then I lost all consciousness. The  Influence had led me to my death.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I awoke  to a consciousness of the external some three weeks later shorn, shaven,  hollow-eyed, and weak. My memory stopped short at that struggle beside the  sun-dial, the reason of which I was unable to conjecture, and I wondered how it  was I was confined to a sick bed. Darver, who daily visited me soon enlightened  me on that point, </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you better, Dr. Phelps,&rdquo; said he, with his dry smile. &ldquo;It was  touch and go with you. Had not some passer-by on the high road been attracted  by your cries and the sounds of your fighting, that man would have strangled  you to a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was the man, Darver, and why did he wish to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  now, Doctor, that is the queer part of the whole aflair. That man is none other  than Mrs. Brunei&rsquo;s servant, who killed her nine years ago, for the sake of her  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;  I gasped, utterly bewildered by this remarkable statement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all; he has made a full confession of his crime. It appears that the female  servant of whom I told you, was his mother. They both knew that Mrs. Brunei  kept large sums in the house, and they resolved to rob her. Unfortunately for  herself, she caught the pair red-handed, so to hide their guilt the son killed  the old lady, and assisted by his hag of a mother, buried the body under the  sun dial. Then they fled with their spoils to America, and there lived in  comfort. Remorse haunted both, and the mother died while the son, always  anticipating that his crime would be discovered, returned to Denhampton, and  kept a close watch on the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see if the body of his victim would be discovered, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  He saw the tenants take the house and leave it, so deemed that his secret was  safe. Then you took the place, and on your first night the murderer watched the  drawing-room from the shadow of the laurels. He stole on to the terrace, and  saw you standing in the centre of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said I, suddenly, recollecting the footstep. &ldquo;I heard him stealing along the  terrace on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did, and came to the window, but by that time he had regained his hiding place.  He confessed this amongst other things. Then when you walked out of the house  in the early hours of the morning, and went straight to the sun-dial, he  thought that you had in some manner discovered his secret. You stood over the  grave of Mrs. Brunei.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he tried to kill me in order to hide his former crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but as I told you, some passers-by arrived on the scene, captured him, and  saved you. He confessed, and we dug under the dial, where we found the skeleton  of Mrs. Brunei. You have been ill for three weeks, but now will soon be well  enough to appear in court and give evidence as to how you knew that the body  was under the dial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know that&mdash;I knew nothing. That influence you spoke of, took me out of  my bed and led me to the dial. I cannot account for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you believe my story,&rdquo; said Darver, with a nod of satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am forced to; sceptical as I am, there was something that led me to seek the  grave of the murdered woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt it was her spirit that led you to avenge her death.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps;  I am not now so sceptical as I was. However, of one thing I am certain: now  that the crime is discovered and there is a prospect of the criminal being  punished, the ghost of Mrs. Brunei will no longer trouble Marrit Grange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  do you intend still to remain in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do.  I have exorcised the ghost, and now intend to reap the benefit of my work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  in the end I did. Recovering from my sickness, I gave evidence which taken in  conjunction with the murderer&rsquo;s confession, put a rope round his neck. My story  of the Influence which led me to the sundial was laughed at, and I have no  doubt both judge and jury deemed my brain still weak from the effects of my  illness. When the criminal was hanged I returned to Marrit Grange, and began my  practice. Since that terrible first night I have never had occasion to complain  of ghosts haunting the house. The spirit of the murdered woman was appeased by  the punishment of her murderer. So ends my story. I cannot account for the  matter, which is to be explained on no natural grounds. Perhaps the Psychical  Society may help me to an understanding.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AColonialBanshee"></a>A Colonial  Banshee</b></h2>
  <p>The  average person does not credit the existence of ghosts. He prides himself on  believing nothing but his own eyes, and if these deceive him into beholding a  genuine ghost he excuses their so doing on the score of hallucination. You  cannot convince the average person that there is anything beyond the  actualities of this world. Certainly he professes a vague belief in  immortality, but his conception is so shadowy, that he never faces it with any  degree of confidence. He classes such credulity in the category of &ldquo;things we  are not meant to understand,&rdquo; which hazy remark to his mind accounts for all  matters in the way of religion. Take away this respectable theological view of  the supernatural, and he scoffs at the idea of a phantom world.</p>
  <p>I  am an average person, a gross, fleshly, stolid, disbelieving St. Thomas of the  present generation, and in accordance with the fitness of things, should  subscribe to the comfortable creed above set forth. I don&rsquo;t. Certainly I was  once as materialistic as the average person could desire, but since I saw, and  conversed with a bona-fide spectre, I have modified my views regarding  psychology. She was so convincing that she left me no option, but to believe.  There was no getting round her insistence.</p>
  <p>It  was a female ghost of the Banshee type, and I met her under the most prosaic  circumstances. Priding herself on the verity of her ghostly being she needed  neither moated grange, nor blue lights to compass her appearance, in fact she  somewhat scornfully dispensed with such old-time accessories, and simply  convinced me by a short conversation that she was what she pretended to be. The  most sceptical would have attested her authenticity on oath, as I do now, and I  was the most sceptical of persons&mdash;once. </p>
  <p>Her  name was Bridget. She was an Irish emigrant. I was always under the impression  that ghosts, like fairies, could not cross running water save in an eggshell,  but as I met Bridget in New Zealand she must have been an exception to this  rule. She, however, made use of a ship in lieu of an eggshell, and complained  bitterly of having been forced to take such a voyage in the interests of her  profession. It had a good deal to do with hatred and revenge&mdash;she was Irish you  see. As the interview was not without interest, I hereby set forth a careful  report of the same for the benefit of the Psychical Society. Unless Bridget was  a liar, her remarks may throw some light on the mysteries of the spiritual  world, and those desiring further information had better apply to the nearest  ghost-raiser. I don&rsquo;t want to see her again. One such interview is enough for  me.</p>
  <p>Queenstown  was the scene of this remarkable adventure. I am not referring to the Irish  town of that name, but indicate thereby the pretty little sanatorium on Lake  Wakitipu in New Zealand. It is amusing how very mixed one&rsquo;s geographical ideas  become in the colonies. Here for instance you sail up the Maori christened lake  of Wakitipu, stay at Queenstown, the name whereof smacks of Cork, and see from  the top of an Antipodean Ben Lomond, the range of the Southern Alps which have  nothing to do with Switzerland. It is a trifle confusing at first, but when one  gets used to the oddity of the thing it is handy to have spots so widely apart  within hailing distance. It is only in Otago that you can go from Queenstown to  Ben Lomond in ten minutes.</p>
  <p>I  was staying in Queenstown for the benefit of my health. Something to do with  the lungs, I believe, but it is so long ago that I quite forget the exact  disease from which I then suffered. Besides it is not material to this story.  It must have been my lungs, however, because the doctor made me climb the lofty  peak of Ben Lomond daily for the benefit of them. There I was accustomed to sit  for hours among the ice and snow, watching the Earnslaw glacier flashing like a  mirror in the sunlight, and the snowy range of the Southern Alps standing like  fairy lacework against the clear blue of the sky.</p>
  <p>When  not climbing, I wandered about Queenstown, and employed my spare time in  dodging the goats. There were a great many goats about the place as the  unfinished condition of the town, rather favoured their existence. You walked  down the main street and in two minutes found yourself among the hills&mdash;and  goats. You surveyed a palatial hotel of the most approved &ldquo;Grand&rdquo; type and  turned round to behold a goat-populated section gaping between a red brick  chapel and a corrugated iron store. Or you could arrive in five minutes at the  outskirts of the town, where the goats abounded among the white pebbles and  sparse grass. Sometimes in such a place you met a man, more often a goat. I  preferred the former myself as he sometimes invited me to have a drink, whereas  the goats were all distinctly hostile. They are the most distrustful animals I  know.</p>
  <p>In  common with other visitors, I put up at Farmer&rsquo;s Hotel, where I was exceedingly  comfortable. Every evening the steamer from Kingston arrived with fresh cargoes  of tourists in search of health and scenery. They found both at Queenstown,  which is the most romantic and salubrious place I am acquainted with. A trifle  wild and lonely, but one must expect that sort of thing in a virgin solitude. I  prefer it myself to an overcrowded play ground like Switzerland. At Queenstown  there is no promenade, no band, no theatre, no casino, no bathing. For this  latter the waters of the lake are too cold owing to its being fed by glaciers.  When I was there, the principal amusements were riding, driving, climbing, and  visiting the cemetery. I didn&rsquo;t care about anticipating my funeral myself, but  many people went there, and told me they enjoyed it greatly. It was so restful.  I did not contradict that statement.</p>
  <p>Sometimes  we drove to Arrowtown and saw the pack horses in long lines climb the track  leading to the Macetown reefs. The sight put me wonderfully in mind of Ali Baba  and the forty thieves, for in the distance they looked exactly like mules laden  with booty. Leaving Arrowtown there was some excitement in regaining Queenstown  by the Shotover Bridge. It was a narrow structure with shallow sides which  sprang across a tremendous abyss in the depths of which swirled a rapid stream.  The approach was down an incline, and for the moment it seemed doubtful whether  the horses would hit the bull&rsquo;s eye of the bridge, or go over into the chasm.  Our Jehu was a wonderful driver, and held his team well together, else I am  afraid I would not now be writing this story. I never repeated the experiment.  It is a mistake tempting Providence twice.</p>
  <p>I  conscientiously saw all there was to be seen in company with Nora and Michael.  These two young scions of the Maguire family were staying at Farmers with their  ancestral Banshee. I don&rsquo;t think the landlord knew of this addition to his list  of guests though Bridget did her best to let him know she was on the premises.  She howled, whereon he called the innocent house dog bad names. I am afraid  Bridget resented the mistake as a slur on her vocal abilities. </p>
  <p>Nora  told me all about herself and Michael. They had left Ireland some five years  back and taken up their abode in Sydney on account of the brother&rsquo;s health. He,  poor fellow, was far gone in consumption, and even the tropical climate of  Australia could do but little for his disease. Indeed so much worse did he  become, that Nora was advised to try the curative effect of New Zealand air,  and for this reason the young couple were staying at Queenstown. When I arrived  on the scene they had already been there for some weeks, but Michael did not  seem to benefit much by the change. On the contrary, he daily grew weaker and  looked more like a shadow than a man.</p>
  <p>One  day I found her seated by his side in front of the hotel. He had fallen asleep  in the warm sunshine, and Nora was dividing her attention between a book and  the invalid. When she saw me, however, she softly arose from her seat and  joined me in my walk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he looks better to-day, Mr. Durham,&rdquo; she asked, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes!&rdquo; I replied trying to comfort the poor girl. &ldquo;I see a decided improvement.  If anything can cure him it will be this air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid the disease has gone too far,&rdquo; she answered with a sigh, &ldquo;poor boy&mdash;to  think of his coming all these miles only to find a grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think of such a thing, Miss Maguire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot help thinking, Mr. Durham. Since we have been here, twice have I heard  the Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Banshee! Did you not hear it wailing last night&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly heard a dog howling at the moon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was no dog,&rdquo; said Nora mysteriously, &ldquo;it was our Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Miss Maguire how can you believe in such rubbish,&rdquo; I remonstrated in a  vexed tone. &ldquo;there are no such things as ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  many people think, but I know there are ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever seen one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  But I have heard the Banshee cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  my dear young lady. Your nerves are out of order with over anxiety. Consult a  doctor at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  nerves are not out of order,&rdquo; she replied, doggedly, &ldquo;I am in perfect health,  and thoroughly in earnest. Why you admit yourself that you heard the cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard a dog howling, Miss Maguire. How can you be so superstitious. This is the  nineteenth century. Ghosts went out when gas came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  took no end of trouble to convince that girl. I promised to lend her a copy of  Abercrombie&rsquo;s Intellectual Powers, where she would find that ghosts are all  humbug. I narrated several instances which had come under my notice of  supposititious spectres, which had been thoroughly explained away. A logical  person would have been convinced by my arguments. But she was a woman, and  therefore not logical. All my talk was on this account so much waste of breath. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  old woman in Ireland knows the Maguire Banshee,&rdquo; she said, triumphantly, &ldquo;for  generations the death of one of our family has been predicted by its wailing.  My father was killed in the hunting field, and I heard it myself crying round  the house on the previous night. When my mother died the Banshee wailed three  times, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; I interrupted emphatically, &ldquo;not one word. The  Celtic nature is excitable and prone to superstition. The howling of a dog, the  whistling of the wind, the skrieking of a hinge would account for your Banshee.  I am a man of sense, Miss Maguire; I laugh at the idea of such folly. Nothing  would convince me of the existence of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment I swear I felt a cold breath blowing against my cheek. The  afternoon was warm and sunny with little or no wind, but for the moment the  unexpected chill struck me dumb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, Mr. Durham?&rdquo; asked Nora, alarmed at the expression of my face, &ldquo;are  you ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ill!  no!&rdquo; I replied, nervously, &ldquo;but really you know, ha! ha! I believe you are  infecting me with your superstition. I felt a cold breath on my face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t say the Banshee, Miss Maguire, because I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t believe such  nonsense. My liver is probably out of order, and our conversation about  spectres is apt to tell on the nerves. Let us talk of other things. Your family  for instance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is not much to talk about there,&rdquo; said Nora, smiling at what she evidently  considered a weak explanation, &ldquo;my family at one time were rich and numerous. Now  we are the only two left, and I don&rsquo;t think Job was poorer than we are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  estates!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  all sold long ago. My father ran through all that remained of the property, and  when he was killed we had nothing but a tumbled down Castle, and a few acres of  barren bog. We sold this and with the money came out to Sydney. There through  the influence of an old friend Michael obtained a good Government appointment.  Then his health gave way, and we were advised to come on here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do you intend to do when you go back,&rdquo; I asked, revolving several  philanthropic schemes in my mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know! It is questionable if we do go back. I feel certain that Michael  will die here, and then I shall be left alone here with but a few shillings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tut!  tut! you must not talk like this,&rdquo; said I blowing my nose to conceal some  natural emotion evoked by her story, &ldquo;the colonial heart is kind! the colonial  hand is open. As to your brother. Hope for the best!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Durham!&rdquo; said the girl solemnly, &ldquo;twice have I heard the Banshee cry&mdash;the third  time will be fatal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was no use arguing against such obstinacy, so I held my tongue merely remarking  that I hoped the Banshee wouldn&rsquo;t wail. Then as it was growing chilly Nora took  her brother inside and left me to my own reflections. They were anything but  pleasant, for I felt certain that his foolish belief in the Banshee would aid  in killing Michael, as surely as would his disease.</p>
  <p>To  think of such superstition being prevalent nowadays. Here was a well educated  young lady living among sensible people, yet she believed in such rubbish as  ghosts. It has been proved over and over again that there are no such things. A  heavy meal, a tired body, a fanciful mind, and lo a ghost is created. Dyspepsia  and hallucination are the parents of all goblins, which exist but in the  imagination of their victims. People who see ghosts should write novels and  thus work off their superfluous imagination. No wonder we need school-boards,  when sensible men can tolerate such humbug. Logic and Arithmetic will cure such  morbidity. No student of the exact sciences ever saw a ghost.</p>
  <p>The  breath of cold air! Well I own that puzzled me, but it might be ascribed to the  nerves. The cause I am convinced was internal not external. It was a still  sunny day, yet I felt a sensation of cold air on my left cheek. Nerves or  liver! only! I am inclined to put it down to the latter, knowing how I suffer  from that organ. A liver will make a man believe anything. Perhaps my ghostly  interview was the result of a disordered liver, but no&mdash;Bridget was too  convincing. You can&rsquo;t explain away actualities and though Bridget wasn&rsquo;t  exactly an actuality, I certainly can&rsquo;t explain her away.</p>
  <p>After  that eminently unsatisfactory conversation with Miss Maguire I took a sharp  walk to shake the cobwebs out of my brain. Ghost-talk does endanger cobwebs in  a man&rsquo;s brain, and if you leave them there nobody knows what will happen&mdash;but I  think Colney Hatch has a good deal to do with the future. Not caring to tend in  that direction I walked those ghostly figments out of my memory and sat on a  hill top admiring the scenery. The sun was setting and the white peaks were  very rosy with his light. It was very beautiful, but very chilly, so not  anxious to trouble my lungs with inflammation I returned to the hotel and  dinner.</p>
  <p>After  the meal I went up to my room to put on warmer clothes, and there took place  that remarkable visitation of which I speak. The bedroom was quite dark when I  entered, and in place of lighting the candle I stood at the window staring at  the wonderful white world without. A stream of moonbeams lay across the floor,  and beyond the distant peak flashed the moon herself glimmering like a ghost.  The comparison put me in mind of Nora&rsquo;s absurd Banshee story, and the memory  made me laugh. To my surprise the laugh was repeated in a thin starved echo. I  turned round at the sound and saw a woman standing near the door. I am a modest  young man, and the intrusion annoyed me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame.&rdquo;  I said in a dignified tone, &ldquo;you have mistaken the room. How did you enter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  the kayhole!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens!  what a voice. It was as thin as a whistle. And then she alluded to an entrance  by the keyhole. I began to feel alarmed and passed my hand across my eyes to  vanish the hallucination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liver!&rdquo;  said I seeing the figure still there. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Divil  a bit,&rdquo; retorted the lady who seemed a cloudy sort of person. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Maguire  Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t like practical jokes, and thinking Nora was playing one on me ventured to  remonstrate. Before I could say a word the figure glided, or rather floated  into the stream of moonlight which lay across the floor. Then I saw it was no  joke&mdash;it was no liver&mdash; it was a ghost!</p>
  <p>A  merciful baldness prevented my hair standing on end, but my flesh creeped, and  I shook as though I had the ague. This apparition upset all my preconceived  ideas, and reduced me to a sort of moral pulp. I felt a cowardly inclination to  run away. The Banshee was between me and the door, and as the window was twenty  feet from the ground I could hardly leave that way without becoming a ghost  myself. I was therefore compelled to remain, and didn&rsquo;t like the idea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t ye offer me a sate!&rdquo; said the Banshee in an irritable tone, &ldquo;is it  insultin&rsquo; me ye&rsquo;re afther doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  pushed forward a seat in great trepidation and she settled on it. I can&rsquo;t say  she sat down for she didn&rsquo;t, but simply subsided thereon, like a cloud on a  mountain-top. The cold beams of the moon shone full on her face, and the sight  did not tend to steady my nerves. I don&rsquo;t want to see another face like it.</p>
  <p>It  was a grey haggard countenance framed in wild elf locks of tangled red hair.  Her mouth was all drawn to one side, and in her eyes dwelt a look of horror.  Round her neck hung a fragment of rough rope, and from shoulders to heels  streamed a cloudy white robe. The whole appearance of this being was vague and  indistinct, the face being the only portion I could see with any degree of  clearness. Sitting there in the chilly light, with her filmy dress undulating  round her thin form, and her baleful eyes glaring from amid her tangled red  hair she was a fearsome object to behold. I shivered and shook and turned away  my eyes, but something I knew not what&mdash;ever compelled me to look at her again. </p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t think she was a lady Banshee. Her language was too free, and her manners  left much to be desired. Still she behaved in a very affable manner for her,  and succeeded to a certain extent in dispelling my fear, though I was anything  but comfortable during the interview. She spoke thoughout in a hoarse broken  voice, alternating with a shrill whistling sound. Constant howling had  evidently injured her vocal organs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you don&rsquo;t believe in my existence,&rdquo; she said, eyeing me in a malevolent manner.</p>
  <p>I  began to protest, but she cut me short with a whistling sniff and shifted her  mouth to the other side of her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  deceit av ye plase. Didn&rsquo;t ye say oi was an hallucination ye brutal Saxon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be now for all I know,&rdquo; I replied, resenting her rudeness.</p>
  <p>She  stretched out her arm which elongated itself like a marine telescope, and  without moving from her seat clutched me by the wrist with chilly fingers. So  cold was her touch that it burnt like fire, and I involuntarily shrieked with  pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whist!  ye spalpeen!&rdquo; she said contracting her arm again. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll athtracth attinshun  and me reputashun &lsquo;ull suffer if Oi&rsquo;m discovered in a jintleman&rsquo;s slapin&rsquo; room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you had better go away.&rdquo; I suggested, anxious to rid myself of this  nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Divil  a bit,&rdquo; she rejoined, composedly. &ldquo;Oi&rsquo;ve a mind to convarse wid ye about thim  Maguires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t you leave them alone. It&rsquo;s impossible for a sick man to get sleep while  you howl round the house like an insane hurricane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wud  ye have me neglect me thrade,&rdquo; said the Banshee, indignantly. &ldquo;Tis me juty to  wail worse luck. An&rsquo; as to slapin&rsquo; Mick Maguire &lsquo;ull slape sound enough wan av&rsquo;  these days, nivir fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Av&rsquo;  coorse he&rsquo;ll die. Haven&rsquo;t oi criedth twice an&rsquo; ut-ll be the third toime this  night. It&rsquo;s not wastin&rsquo; me breath oi am.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oi&rsquo;m  Bridget.*&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I  laughed at the unsuitability of the name, whereupon the Banshee looked at me  fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fwhat&rsquo;s  the matter wid the name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like a servant girl&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  why not. Wasn&rsquo;t oi that same, sorr. Four hundher years ago oi sarved King  Patsey Magireu av&rsquo; Ulster, the ancister av&rsquo; the prisint family no less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how did you become a Banshee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Och  whirra! whirra! willaloo!&rdquo; she moaned, rocking herself too and fro, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t oi  the pride av&rsquo; Ulster an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t King Maguire hang me bekaze oi&rsquo;d nivir give up  Taddy Donovan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he want to marry you himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  shuld oi know! Maybe he didn&rsquo;t care about Taddy liftin&rsquo; thim Kerry cows. An&rsquo; as  Taddy wasn&rsquo;t to be tuk, he hanged me, bad luck to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  that hanging turn you into a Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;y&rsquo;  see this rope, sorr,&rdquo; she said touching the fragment, &ldquo;whin oi died oi tuk the  bit wid me as a mimory an&rsquo; swore to haunt thim Maguires for ever-lastin&rsquo; till  they all died. There&rsquo;s only two now. Whin Mick goes there&rsquo;ull only be wan. Whin  she dies me juty &lsquo;ull be ended for ivir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t kill them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Av&rsquo;  coorse not, but I can warn thim of their sorrows. Oi&rsquo;ve croied at their wakes  for the last four hundher year in Ould Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you come out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bekaze  thim two came. When a Banshee&rsquo;s attached to wan family she has to hould on to  thim like the divil. Where they go, she goes, so oi had to imigrate wid the  Maguires bad cess to thim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t like the colonies!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Divil  a bit. Oi&rsquo;ve not met a single ghost of any consequence here. There&rsquo;s no ruins  to haunt an&rsquo; hathens like yoursilf don&rsquo;t belave in us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you find things so unpleasant why don&rsquo;t you go back to Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  shuld oi know. Whin Nora goes back oi&rsquo;ll go back, but where she is I aim. Mick&rsquo;s  dying so me only reckinin&rsquo; on Nora. Maybe she&rsquo;ll die too though,&rdquo; added the  Banshee, comfortably, &ldquo;and thin I can return to me round tower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  Round Tower?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;County  Down no less. Me family sate. Once &lsquo;twas King Maguire&rsquo;s, now &lsquo;tis mine. Oi sit  on it in the cove av&rsquo; the evenin&rsquo; an&rsquo; houl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant  for your neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Iviry  wan to his juty,&rdquo; replied the Banshee indifferently, &ldquo;tis mine to howl an&rsquo; howl  I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I&rsquo;ve heard you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  sid it was the dog. Oh oi heard your contimptuous spache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  look here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oi  want nane av&rsquo; your bullyin&rsquo; av&rsquo; you plase. Respict age. Oi&rsquo;m four hundher year  ould.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  you look it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  so&rsquo;d you if ye&rsquo;d to pass nights howlin&rsquo; in the open air. It&rsquo;s sorry oi am that  I let ye see a rale live Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  hardly alive. However, I apologise for hurting your feelings. I&rsquo;m not  accustomed to entertain Banshees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  that&rsquo;s true. No Saxon has a Banshee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no colony either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a few hundred years, sorr. Ye want ruins an&rsquo; family sacrats first. Thin the  ghosts &lsquo;ull come, but not in your toime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not sorry! I don&rsquo;t like ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe  ye don&rsquo;t belave in thim,&rdquo; said the Banshee, tauntingly, &ldquo;to-morrow ye&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;oive  bin dramin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not unlikely!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oi&rsquo;d  like to lave some token av&rsquo; me visit,&rdquo; she went on in a meditative tone, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t  I lave five black finger marks on your wrist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you,&rdquo; I replied, shrinking back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  turn your hair white,&rdquo; she added, persuasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  you couldn&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;m bald!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  thin! I&rsquo;ll lave the mark of a gory hand on your cranium.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure you wont. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>For  the Banshee had suddenly shot up as high as the roof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo;  she said shrilly. &ldquo;Oi hear his breath failin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose  breath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s.  The cowld sweat is on his brow an&rsquo; the rattle is in his throat&mdash;it&rsquo;s not long he&rsquo;ll  live anyhow. I must wail &mdash; an&rsquo; wail &lsquo;Whirro!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  the man die in peace,&rdquo; I urged, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fwhat!  wan av&rsquo; thim Maguires. Sorra a bit. Ye&rsquo;ll hear me wailin&rsquo; soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whist  oi tell ye! whist. Oi&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Tis not Banshees ye&rsquo;ll scoff at agin oi&rsquo;m  thinkm&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She  spread herself through the room in a cold white mist, and I shrank terrified  against the wall. In the white shadow I could see the glare of her fiery eyes  like two danger signals. The fog gradually floated out through the open window  and the eyes vanished. Then I heard a whistle outside, which I presume was  Bridget&rsquo;s way of saying good-bye. After that I went for some brandy.</p>
  <p>The  Banshee certainly succeeded in curing my scepticism regarding ghosts. I don&rsquo;t  want any further proof that they exist after seeing her. She impressed herself  too strongly on my memory. Next time I see an Irish ghost, I would like a dozen  or so of my friends to be present at the interview. Now when I hear the average  person scoffing at the idea of spectres, as I used to do, I tell him my  experience. As a rule he doesn&rsquo;t believe me. Perhaps you who read this story  don&rsquo;t believe it either. But it&rsquo;s true for all that.</p>
  <p>When  I had succeeded in pulling myself together&mdash; no easy task&mdash;I hurried at once to  Michael&rsquo;s bedroom, but was met at the door by Nora, who told me he was asleep.  Unwilling to alarm her by a description of the Banshee&rsquo;s visit, I held my peace  and went out into the open air. Lighting a cigar, for I thought a smoke would  soothe my nerves, I strolled up and down in front of the hotel. In a few  minutes a young American who was staying there joined me, and though as a rule I  found him a nuisance, yet on this occasion I was not ill-pleased with his  company.</p>
  <p>It  was a bright moonlight night, and far in the distance arose the serrated peaks  of the mountains. The iron roofs of the houses around glittered like frosted  silver in the light, and here and there on the sullen lake glinted a flake of  moonfire. All was wonderfully beautiful and absolutely still. Suddenly there  sounded a long low wail which shivered pitifully through the air, and died away  among the mountains. Then a second, closely followed by a third. I knew what  that triple cry meant and stopped short in my walk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dog  howling, I guess,&rdquo; said the young American! carelessly.</p>
  <p>I  heard a whistling sniff near me and turned to see the Banshee glaring at the  young man. To him she was invisible and her speech inaudible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dog howlin,&rdquo; she said, angrily, &ldquo; an&rsquo; I nivir wailed so iligantly before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he dead?&rdquo; I asked, breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  a door nail,&rdquo; replied the Banshee and vanished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  who dead?&rdquo;&ldquo; asked the American thinking I had spoken to him, &ldquo;that young Irish  fellow I&mdash;Hark, what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  cry, but this time the utterance of a human throat. I hastened towards the  hotel, and arrived at the door to meet Nora on the threshold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear it?&rdquo; she gasped, throwing herself into my arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  I heard it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you the third time. Michael is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  that she fainted clean away, which action caused me but little surprise. I was  pretty near collapsing myself.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Poor  Michael was duly buried in the little cemetery under the shadow of the mighty  hill. I attended the funeral, did my best to comfort Nora, and in the end supplied  her with money to return to her Sydney friends. I presume the Banshee went with  her, but of this I am not certain. Sometimes I heard from Nora in the months  which followed her brother&rsquo;s death. When I was at Te Aroha in the North Island  last Christmas she wrote and told me she was married and had settled for good  in Sydney.</p>
  <p>This  letter set me thinking about the Banshee. By her own showing she could not  leave Nora, until she died, so as Nora had decided to stay in Australia, I  presume, Bridget would also have to remain. From what I heard, Nora is not  likely to die for some time so I am afraid Bridget must be very discontented.  Here she has no ghostly friends, no Round Tower, and as yet no reason for  wailing, so altogether she must be in a bad way.</p>
  <p>One  consolation she must have. She is the only Banshee in the colonies. None other  is genuine. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSandwalker"></a>The Sand-walker</b></h2>
  <p>I  make no endeavour to explain this experience. Explanation of it is impossible.  I can conceive no theory upon which to base even the most slender attempt. It  baffles me, it has always baffled me and it will continue to baffle me. Yet the  impress of the thing loses nothing of its vividness with time.</p>
  <p>It  is as clear before me now, as it was within a few hours of its event. I believe  I heard a ghost knocking; I am certain I saw a ghost moving. &ldquo;Indigestion,  fancy, an overwrought and distorted brain,&rdquo; you will say, no doubt.</p>
  <p>I  wish I could think it was. But it wasn&rsquo;t. The sequel to that glimpse of the  dead was too terrible, the cause too pertinent to the effect, to permit for one moment  of any attribution to disorder, mental or alimentary. No,&mdash;What I saw was actual  self-existent. I will set down the facts for you as they occurred, and you  shall explain them away&mdash;if you can. Then, if you remain unconvinced&mdash;go to  Gartholm, by the German Ocean, and hear what the folk there have to say. They  are a stodgy people, incapable utterly of the most insignificant hyperbole.  They will tell you this tale plainly as I tell it to you. They believe as I  believe.</p>
  <p>It  was in the summer of &lsquo;96. I was travelling in &ldquo;woollens&rdquo; for the great  Huddersfield firm of Carbury and Crank. Furnished with a gig and a  fast-trotting mare, it was my duty to exploit the more scattered parts of the  country, where the railroad was still unknown and civilisation, as we use the  term, tarried a while.</p>
  <p>Gartholm  is the name given to a certain wide, low-lying plain, shut in from the North  Sea by mile upon mile of sandhills. They are heaped up like hummocks along the  coast. It was along a kind of causeway running straight through many miles of  grain that I drove that hot July. I had never been in these parts, and I  rejoiced at such ample evidence of fertility. It argued prosperity for those  around; hence good business for myself and my employers. I made up my mind to  remain there for at least a month. I left in less than half that time.</p>
  <p>As  if the plain itself were not sufficiently damp and low-lying, the village of  Gartholm had been built in a kind of central depression, immediately beside the  river. In other respects it differed but slightly from the ordinary English  village, save that there was no inn. Close by the tower of the rubble-built  church there was a pot-house, licensed for the sale of liquor &ldquo;to be drunk on  the premises,&rdquo; but I failed there to get sleeping room either for myself or  Tilly, my weary mare.</p>
  <p>Darkness  was close upon us and I was worn out with my day&rsquo;s drive. There seemed little  prospect of comfort, even had I gained admittance to this miserable hovel. But  that was denied me. The landlord, a bulky monumental lump of indolence, stood  in the doorway and effectually blocked all entrance. A dozen or so of idlers  collected to admire Tilly and amuse themselves at my expense. And I realised  that there were worse fates than that of being cast upon an uninhabited island,  even in this England of ours at the close of the nineteenth century.</p>
  <p>While  I was in this plight, arguing with the landlord and endeavouring to arrive  approximately at the sense of his dialect, a being, human by contrast to those  around, made his appearance from out the crowd, and approached my gig. He  turned out to be the village schoolmaster, and those around called him &ldquo;Muster  Abram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are looking for a lodging?&rdquo; he said, in a smooth and (by comparison) strangely  civilised voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; I replied, soothing Tilly, who, small blame to her, in no wise appreciated  her immediate surroundings. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dick Trossall, C.T. to Carbury and Crank, if  you&rsquo;ve ever heard of &lsquo;em in this forsaken hole.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;C.T.?&rdquo;  repeated Master Abraham interrogatively, cocking his one eye (he had lost the  other) which was as bright as any robin&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Commercial  Traveller,&rdquo; said I in explanation; &ldquo;or bagman if you like it better. You don&rsquo;t  comprehend Queen&rsquo;s English I see in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly;  when so abbreviated. But if it really be board and lodging you seek, you can  get that only from Mrs. Jarzil at the Beach Farm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a murmur from those at hand, as he said the name, and, I thought, a  somewhat dubious expression upon the faces of one or two. I did not on the  whole, feel drawn towards Mrs. Jarzil and her farm, and I looked at the  schoolmaster enquiringly. Utterly ignoring this, and vouchsafing me no reply,  he proceeded straightway to climb into my gig, without so much as &ldquo;by your  leave.&rdquo; There was neither modesty nor undue hesitancy about Master Abraham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will get on then to Mrs. Jarzil&rsquo;s farm,&rdquo; said I. A touch from the whip and  Tilly was off at a good spanking trot in the direction Master Abraham had  indicated. In a few moments we were out of sight of the hangers-on and driving  through the street into another causeway similar to the first. In the distance  we could see the house lying under the lee of the sandhills. A dismal sort of  place it seemed, and wholly solitary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yonder is the Beach Farm,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;and Mrs. Jarzil.&rdquo; He stopped  suddenly, so that I turned to look at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth is the matter with Mrs. Jarzil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  nothing&mdash;I was merely wondering, not so much if she could, as whether she would,  accommodate you. You see Mrs. Jarzil had some trouble with her last lodger. He  was a botanist. He called himself Amber&mdash;Samuel Amber. Some two years ago it  was; he boarded at the Beach Farm, then suddenly he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disappeared?  Good Lord! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly  what I say. He walked out of yonder house one night, and never returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were close to the house now. It loomed up suddenly in the mist, which lay thick  and heavy over the sandhills. I felt horribly depressed. Apart from the intense  gloominess of the surroundings, the damp and darkness and desolation, all of  which had perhaps more than their due effect upon my jaded nerves, I was  conscious of an indefinite sense of uneasiness. This one-eyed creature at my  elbow made me decidedly uncomfortable. I have not a robust nervous system at  the best of times, and he with his sinister innuendoes was fast gaining a hold  upon me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a daughter, you see,&rdquo; he went on, before I could speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there was a daughter, was there?&rdquo; I repeated somewhat relieved. It might be,  after all, that he was nothing more than a mere scandal-monger. I fervently  hoped so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  and Mr. Amber made love to her&mdash;at least so it is supposed. At all events she  disappeared, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the same time as the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lottie  was her name,&rdquo; continued Master Abraham, utterly heedless of my query, &ldquo;and a  pretty pink and white creature she was, with the loveliest golden hair. I used  to call her Venus of the Fen. She was at the Farm when Amber first arrived.  After a while he left, and she with him. He did not return for a twelvemonth,  and then only to&mdash;to disappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  on earth are you telling me all this rigmarole for? I don&rsquo;t care twopence for  any of your Ambers and Lotties or Venuses either, for that matter. If the girl  was as pretty as you say, I don&rsquo;t blame the man for going off with her. I  presume she was a willing party to the arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Jarzil will have it that Amber forced her daughter to elope with him. You see  he returned a year later&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what explanation did he make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None&mdash;none  whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did the lady have to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  Amber took up his residence at the Farm as before, and remained there  until&mdash;until he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Upon  my soul I was beginning to feel thoroughly scared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to tell me that Mrs. Jarzil got rid of him by foul play?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me, no; nothing of the kind. Mrs. Jarzil is a most religious woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what the; perhaps you will kindly make yourself clear. For what reason do you  retail to me this parcel of rubbish?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  this.&rdquo; He laid his skinny hand upon my arm. We were turning into the drive  which led up to the house. He pointed with the other hand towards the  sand-ridge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man nodded. Then he whispered to me. &ldquo;The Sand-Walker, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An  elderly woman had come to the door and was standing there. The chief thing I  noticed about her was her determinedly masculine appearance. For the rest she  was a veritable study in half tone. Her hair, her dress, her complexion, in  fact everything about her, was of various shades of grey. Her mouth denoted a  vile if not a violent temper.</p>
  <p>My  reception was anything but cordial; in fact at the outset she refused  altogether to take me in, but under the persuasive eloquence of Master Abraham  she relented so far as to agree to board me by the week at what to me seemed an  exorbitant charge. She was evidently grasping as well as religious&mdash;a highly  unpleasant combination I thought. But in the circumstances I had no option but  to accept the inevitable. It was a case of any port in a storm.</p>
  <p>As  I proceeded to drive round to the stable to put up Tilly&mdash;a thing which I  invariably attended to myself&mdash;Master Abraham accompanied me. And somehow I was  glad of even his company. There was not a living soul about. I asked him why  this was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Jarzil keeps no servants,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She has not kept any since Lottie and  Mr. Amber went away; or rather, to be precise, since Mr. Amber disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  can get none to come here&mdash;or to remain if they do come. They are afraid of the  Sand-walker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  asked him point blank what he meant. But I could get nothing out of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  you do, don&rsquo;t go on to the beaches at dusk,&rdquo; was all he said. Then he vanished.  I say vanished advisedly, for though I ran after him to the door for the moment  I could see no sign of him; I rushed on round the corner of the house, and came  plump on to Mrs. Jarzil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master  Abraham!&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>Then  Mrs. Jarzil pointed down the road, and I saw a flying figure disappearing into  the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does he run off like that?&rdquo; I asked. I began to think I was losing my senses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  one runs from Beach Farm,&rdquo; replied the woman in the coolest manner possible,  and with that she left me staring in amazement. </p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t think anyone could dub me a coward, but this place unnerved me. Both  within and without the house all was mysterious, weird, and uncanny. My spirits  sank to zero and my nerves were strung up to a tension positively unendurable.  Even the bright light from the kitchen fire filled me with apprehension. I  could not touch food or drink.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Jarzil, gliding about the room, in no wise reassured me. Masculine and  ponderous as she was, the deftness and stealthiness of her movements were  uncomfortably incongruous. She spoke not a word. She totally ignored my  presence. I began to loathe the woman. But I determined that anything was  better than the horrible suspense I was enduring. So I went straight for the  thing which was making havoc of me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the Sand-walker, Mrs. Jarzil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  the moment she was polishing a dish cover. As I spoke it crashed on the floor.  I never saw a woman turn quite so pale as she did then. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  has been talking to you about the Sand-walker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master  Abraham,&rdquo; was my answer. By this time she was visibly shaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;  she exclaimed. &ldquo;A triple fool, and dangerous, too. See here, you Mr. Trossall.  I am willing to board you, but not to answer your silly questions. And if you  don&rsquo;t like my house and my ways, you can leave them both. I can do without you.  God knows I have had enough of boarders.&rdquo; Though it was rash, and for all I  knew dangerous, willy-nilly the name Amber slipped my tongue. But she had  regained her self-possession now, and laughed contemptuously as she picked up  the dish cover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see Abraham&rsquo;s been telling you my story. It is not a very pretty story, is it? Yes,  Mr. Amber was a scoundrel. He carried off my daughter Lottie to London. Ay, and  he had the boldness, too, to return here after his wickedness. I said nothing.  It was my duty to forgive him, like a Christian, and I did. Although a mother,  I am a Christian first. Poor Lottie! Poor child! I wonder where she is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know where Mr. Amber is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Abraham told you no doubt that he disappeared. One would think he had been  caught up into the moon; the way the fools round here talk. Yet the explanation  is perfectly simple. The man was accustomed to walk on the Beaches at night.  There are quicksands there, and he fell into one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found his hat by one of the worst of them. He had sunk. I am glad he did. He  ruined my life and Lottie&rsquo;s. But &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay saith the  Lord.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this Sand-walker; who, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  does not concern you. I have told you enough. I am not going to answer all your  silly questions,&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>
  <p>Not  another word would she say. Still I felt somewhat relieved. Abraham had  contrived to surround with an atmosphere of mystery what after all was purely  an accident. I saw that now; and I was able to go to bed in a much more  tranquil state of mind than I would otherwise have done.</p>
  <p>My  room was just off the kitchen. I hadn&rsquo;t been in it more than half an hour when  I heard Mrs. Jarzil at her devotional exercises. I could hear her reading aloud  certain Biblical extracts of a uniformly comminatory character. Her voice was  peculiarly resonant and booming. Her choice seemed to me to range from  Deuteronomy to Ezekiel and back again. &ldquo;And Thine eye shall not pity; but life  shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up; they and all that appertained  to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  wicked are overthrown and are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  for half an hour or more she went on, until I was in a cold perspiration. Then  she knelt down and prayed, I was in hopes she had unbosomed herself for the  night at all events. But then followed such a prayer as I have never heard. The  ban of Jeremiah was a blessing to it. She cursed Amber, dead though he was. She  cursed her daughter and called down upon her unfortunate head such visitations  that I confess I shuddered. The woman was raving; yet all the time I could hear  her sobbing, sobbing bitterly. The whole thing was ghastly, revolting. I would  have given anything to get away.</p>
  <p>At  last she ceased, and, I presume, went to bed; though how she could sleep after  such an indulgence was a marvel to me. But perhaps now that she had so assuaged  her wrath, exhaustion if not relief would follow. I hoped so. At all events she  was quiet. After a while I got up, to make sure that my door was securely  fastened. Then I scrambled back to bed, and fell into an uneasy fitful doze. So  I got through the long night. I never once slept soundly, and when I awoke in  the morning I felt but little refreshed.</p>
  <p>With  the light came the sense of shame. I was inclined to deal severely with myself  for my&mdash;as they now appeared to me&mdash;absurd apprehensions of the previous night. I  made up my mind then and there that I should be a downright coward if I carried  out my determination to leave the place. My room was comfortable, and the food  was good. And I rated myself roundly for being such an impressionable booby.  Besides, I knew enough to make me curious to know more.</p>
  <p>Albeit  as silent as ever, I found Mrs. Jarzil civil and composed enough at breakfast.  So although I had not succeeded in getting rid wholly of my aversion to the  place, I started off in quest of business, saying that I would return about  five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>I  soon found out that so far as business went, at all events, I had fallen on my  feet. The very excellent woollen goods of Messrs. Carbury and Crank appealed to  these fen dwellers. They were a rheumatic lot. But that was more the fault of  the locality than of themselves. At any rate the local dealers seized upon my  samples with avidity, and I booked more orders in the day than I was accustomed  to do in a week in some places. I returned therefore that evening to the Beach  Farm in the best of spirits, but at the gate I encountered Master Abraham. He  soon reduced them to a normal level.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  how did you sleep?&rdquo; he said, I thought with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  a top, of course; I always do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard nothing at your window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. What should I hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you didn&rsquo;t go on to the Beaches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, I was only too glad to get to bed. Besides, were you not at particular  pains to advise me against going there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  perhaps I was; and I repeat my advice. If you do, it will come to you at the  window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  in heaven&rsquo;s name do you mean, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean the Sand-walker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment Tilly made a bound forward&mdash;she hates standing&mdash;and there was nothing  for it but to let her go. The schoolmaster took himself off, and I drove up to  the door.</p>
  <p>But  I silently swore at that skinny Abraham for bringing back to me the uneasy  feelings of the previous night. His warning still rang in my ears. I could not  get rid of it. I was determined I would not pass the night in ignorance. I  resolved to take the bull by the horns and face whatever there was to face then  and there.</p>
  <p>After  a &ldquo;high tea&rdquo; (that was between six and seven o&rsquo;clock) I mentioned casually to  Mrs. Jarzil that I was going for a stroll. She neither bade me go nor stay; so  over the sandhills at the back of the house I scrambled until I found myself on  the sea shore.</p>
  <p>The  beach was very dreary. All was still, save for the gentle swash of the wavelets  breaking in upon the ribbed sand. There was but little wind. To right and left  of me there stretched an interminable vista of sand, vanishing only to blend  itself in the distance with the heavy mists, which even at that season of the  year hung around. The little land-locked pools were blood-red with reflection  of the sun. Through the off-shore of the sea and sun were ablaze with crimson  light, I felt an awful sense of desolation as I sat there in the dip of a  sand-hill watching the departing sun ring its changes on the spectrum. The  crimson merged to amethyst, the amethyst to pearl, until in sombre greyness the  light shut down upon the lonely shore.</p>
  <p>A  mad purposeless impulse seized me. With a whoop I ran down the firm sand to the  brink of the water. I stood there for some moments looking out to sea. When I  turned, the mists were thick even between me and the sand-hills. Darkness came  down fold over fold. Every moment the fog became more damp and clammy, the  sense of desolation more intense. I was isolated from all that was human; from  God for aught I knew.</p>
  <p>Then  I thought of the quick-sands&mdash;of Mr. Amber &mdash;of Mr. Amber&rsquo;s hat found lying  there; and I ran back, as I thought, to the sand hills. But I must have moved  circuitously, for I could not reach even their friendly shelter. I lost my  bearings hopelessly. Where the sea or where the hills I knew not. I rushed  first this way, and then that, heedless and without design, intent only on  escaping from the enshrouding mists, from the awesome desolation.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the sands quaked under me. I stopped. The fate of Korah and his brethren  flashed through my mind. My heart drummed loudly in the stillness. The mists  grew thicker, the night darker. Then it was I saw It beside me.</p>
  <p>At  first I thought it was mortal&mdash;human&mdash;for its shape was that of a man. With an  exclamation of thankfulness I endeavoured to approach it. But try as I might, I  could not get near it. It did not walk, it did not glide, it did not fly. It  simply melted in the mist, yet always visible, always retreating. That was the  horror of the Thing.</p>
  <p>My  flesh creeped. I felt an icy cold through every pore of my skin. With awful  insistence it was borne in upon me I was in the presence of the dead. Yet I was  powerless. I could utter no cry. I could not even stop myself. On, on I went  following that melting receding thing, until suddenly my foot stumbled on a  sand-hill. Then It became mist with the mist, and I saw It no more. I scrambled  up the hill and wept like a child.</p>
  <p>How  I reached the Beach Farm I cannot tell. I stumbled, blind with terror into the  lamplight of the kitchen. I almost fell into Mrs. Jarzil&rsquo;s arms. She uttered no  word of surprise, but sat there staring at my terror-stricken face and  quivering limbs, silent and unsympathetic. At last she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen the Sand-walker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  God&rsquo;s name what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  has nothing to do with the Sand-walker,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is wholly of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could speak no more that night. By help of some raw spirit I managed to pull  myself together sufficiently to scramble into bed. The very sheets were a  comfort to me; at all events they were between me and It.</p>
  <p>I  was utterly exhausted, and for a few hours I slept. I awoke suddenly with every  nerve on the stretch, every sense acute almost beyond bearing. Mrs. Jarzil was  vociferating in the kitchen, and sobbing between whiles. Then, as surely as I  am a man and a Christian, I heard three loud knocks upon the window-pane. Mrs.  Jarzil turned her imprecations into prayer. In her deep voice she boomed out  verses from the Psalms: &ldquo;Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could stand it no longer. I flung myself out of bed, wrapped the coverlet  around me, and rushed into the kitchen. Mrs. Jarzil was kneeling. Her face poured  with perspiration. She paused as I appeared. There were three loud knocks at  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;O  God, what is it?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Sand-walker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she prayed again: &ldquo;I will abide in Thy tabernacle for ever. I will trust in the  cover of Thy wings.</p>
  <p>I  made for the door, but Mrs. Jarzil seized me by the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let him in, don&rsquo;t let him in. He wants me. It is Amber, I tell you. It is  Amber.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amber!  The Sand-walker!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes. He is the Sand-walker. He wants me &mdash;down on the Beaches. If you open the  door I am bound to go. He draws me; he compels me. But the Lord is my strength,  and shall prevail against the powers of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had to prevent her from unbarring the door. She flung herself upon it and  fumbled with the lock in frenzy. I dragged her back fearful lest she should  admit the thing outside. Gradually she grew more calm, until at last she stood  before me with a composure almost as terrible to behold as had been her frenzy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have resisted the Devil, and he is fled!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can go to bed now, Mr.  Trossall. You will be disturbed no more. There will be no more knocking,  no&mdash;more&mdash;knocking.&rdquo; She caught up the candle to go. I detained her till I took a  light from it. Then I went to bed. I kept the light burning all night, but  there was no more knocking.</p>
  <p>Next  morning not a word passed between us about what had occurred. I ate my  breakfast and drove off to my business. In the main street I met Abraham. I  hailed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there no other place where I can find a lodging?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  so you have been on the Beaches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I was there yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen the Sand-walker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; I said. For it terrified me even in the open  day&mdash;here with the sunshine hot upon me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have heard the knocking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have heard everything&mdash;seen everything; let that suffice. Can I find another  lodging, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  there is none other in the district. But why need you fear. It is she&mdash;not you,  the Sand-walker wants, ay, and he&rsquo;ll get her one night&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know this Sand-walker, as you call him, is Amber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  Gartholm knows that. He has been walking for a year past now on the Beaches. No  one would go there now for any money you could offer them&mdash;at least not after  sun-down. I warned you, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you did. But nevertheless I went, you see. And this Sand-walker saved my  life. For he led me back to the sand hills when I had lost myself hopelessly in  the fog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not you he wants, I tell you, it&rsquo;s she.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  does he want her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>The  man&rsquo;s tone was very strange.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  of the quicksands!&rdquo; he replied; and with that disappeared in a hurry. I was  getting quite accustomed to this, and would have been surprised had he taken  his leave in anything approaching a rational manner.</p>
  <p>Now,  you may perhaps hardly credit it, but I tossed a shilling then and there to  decide my action in the immediate future. &ldquo;Heads I go, tails I stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coin spun up in the sunlight. Tails it was. So I was to remain, and in that  devil-haunted house. Well, at all events I was doing a brisk trade. There was  some comfort in that.</p>
  <p>During  the next ten days I drove for miles over the district, and did uncommonly well  everywhere. I found that the legend of the Beach Farm was universally familiar,  and they all shook their heads very gravely indeed when they learned that I  lodged there. In fact, I am not at all sure that this was not of assistance to  me rather than otherwise. I became an object of intense interest, and, no  doubt, of sympathy had I known it.</p>
  <p>After  that terrible night, there was a lull in the torment of the Sand-walker.  Occasionally it rapped at the door or the window, but that was all. As for me I  walked no more on the Beaches.</p>
  <p>But  the time was near at hand when the Devil would have his own. It came one  evening about six o&rsquo;clock. There had been heavy rain, and the marshy lands were  flooded and the mists were thick around. Overhead all was opaque and grey, and  the ground was sodden under foot. I was anxious to get home, and Tilly was doing  all she knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  arrival I looked after her as was my wont, first and foremost. When I had made  her comfortable for the night I returned to the kitchen. To my surprise I found  Mrs. Jarzil in conversation with a girl, in whom from Abraham&rsquo;s description,  meagre though it had been, I had no difficulty in recognising his Venus of the  Fen. She was certainly pretty. I agreed with Abraham there. She was crying  bitterly, whilst her mother raged at her. They both stopped short as I  entered&mdash;a sense of delicacy, no doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  is the matter?&rdquo; I asked, surveying the pair of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir, you are mother&rsquo;s new lodger, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Master Abraham  told me as she had one. Do please ask her to hear reason, do, I implore you,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will allow no one to interfere with my private aflairs,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jarzil,  stamping her foot. &ldquo;If you are wise you will not seek to make public your  disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no disgrace. I have done nothing to be ashamed of, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  disgrace? No disgrace in allowing yourself to be beguiled by that man&mdash;to be  fooled by his good looks and soft speeches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, mother? I have nothing to do with Mr. Amber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liar,  you ran away with him. What more could you have to do with him, I should like  to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lottie&rsquo;s  spirit rose, and with it the colour to her cheeks. &ldquo;I ran away with him? Indeed  I did nothing of the kind. It was you who made me run away. You treated me so cruelly  that I determined to go into service in London. I was sick to death of your  scolding, and your preaching and praying, and this dismal house, and these  horrible mists, and never a soul to speak to, sick to death of it I tell you.  That&rsquo;s why I went. Mr. Amber indeed!&rdquo; (this with a toss of her head). &ldquo;I have  more taste than to take up with the likes of him. I met him as he was leaving  here. I was walking, and he offered me a lift&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Abr&rsquo;am  saw you; Abr&rsquo;am saw you both!&rdquo; interrupted her mother savagly. &ldquo;He told me you  had eloped with the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was a lie. I parted from Mr. Amber at the London railway station. From that  time to this I have never set eyes upon him. For my own sake I made him promise  to hold his tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did&mdash;he did!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Jarzil, wildly. &ldquo;God help him and me, he did. He  returned here, but he said nothing&mdash;made no explanation. I believed he had  ruined you. Now, oh now, I see it all. And you have ruined me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  mother, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you not let him speak? Oh, why did you not write and explain. I believed&mdash;I  thought he had robbed me of you&mdash; and I revenged myself upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenged  yourself?&rdquo; I cried. I began to have an inkling of what was coming. But Mrs.  Jarzil paid no heed to me. She shook Lottie furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what your silence has cost me?&rdquo; (She was beside herself now). &ldquo;It has  cost me my soul&mdash;my soul, I say. Oh, why did you let me believe him guilty? I  killed him. I murdered him for your sake. It was not vengeance, it was not  justice, it was crime&mdash;crime and evil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;killed&mdash;Mr.  Amber?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I killed him. I swore he should pay for what he had done. His own curiosity did  for him. I played upon it. I lured him to the quicksands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  quicksands?&rdquo; I repeated, horrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  placed a lantern on the brink of the most dangerous of them,&rdquo; the woman  continued, feverishly. &ldquo;He used habitually to walk on the Beaches at dark. His  curiosity did the rest. He had to see what that light was. I knew he would. It  was the last light he ever saw in this world. Yes, you call it murder. It was  murder. But it was your fault&mdash; your fault. And now he walks, and taps at the  door for me. He wants me; he wants me. I thought I had justice on my side&mdash;that  I was avenging your disgrace; and I fought with my soul; oh, how I fought! But  now&mdash;I see he is right. It is I who must now be punished. I must go. I must go.  Oh, God be merciful to me, a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lottie  lay stretched on the floor. She had fainted. I placed myself between her mother  and the door. I dared not let her out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  would you go?&rdquo; I cried, seizing her by the arm and frustrating a desperate  effort to get away. She was fairly demented, and seemed possessed of strength  almost demoniacal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the Beaches&mdash;to my death. Let me go&mdash;let me go. An eye for an eye, I say&mdash;a tooth  for a tooth. That is the law of God. Hark! Listen! He calls &mdash;he calls me.&rdquo; (I  could hear nothing but the howling of the wind.) &ldquo;I must go, I must go, I must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was too quick for me. Before I had time to stop her she was away into the  desolate night. I rushed after her. In her present condition there was no  knowing what she might do. Clearly her mind was unhinged. I could hardly see  for the rain. It was nearly dark too. But on through the mire and the mist I  went. I jostled up against a man. It was Abraham. I remembered it was he who  had caused all this, and with the thought I lost control of myself. I gripped  him by the throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  dog&mdash;you liar! Lottie the girl has come back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I  know!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I was coming up to see her. Leave, me alone. What do you  mean by this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  deserve it, and more, you villain. You know well the girl did not go with  Amber. You lied to her mother; you made her think so. You were in love with her  yourself. The man&rsquo;s death lies at your door more than at hers. She has gone to  the Beaches&mdash;to her death, I tell you&mdash;unless she is stopped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  I realised that I was wasting time. I hastened on, regretting deeply that my  feelings had so got the better of me just then.</p>
  <p>It  was blowing half a gale, though it was not till I had crossed the sandhills  that I realised it. Then the full blast of the wind struck me. It was as much  as I could do to keep my feet. I could not see the woman anywhere, though I  peered into the gloom until my head swam. Not a sign of her or any living  creature could I see. There was nothing but the roar of the wind and the sea,  and the swish of the driving rain.</p>
  <p>Then  I thought I heard a cry&mdash;a faint cry. I ploughed my way down in the direction  whence I fancied it came. I became aware that Abraham had followed me. He was  close behind me. Together we groped blindly on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  get her this time!&rdquo; shouted the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  on! Come on!&rdquo; I roared at him. &ldquo;Yonder she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yonder the Sand-walker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  wretch hung back. Then a gust of wind, more concentrated and more fierce than  before, seemed to rend an opening in the fog. Two shadows could be seen  fluttering along&mdash;one a man of unusual height, the other a woman, reeling and swaying.  She followed the Thing. As we gazed, a light appeared in the distance, radiant  as a star. Its brilliance grew, and spread far and wide through the fog. The  tall figure moved up to and past the light&mdash;the other following, always  following.</p>
  <p>She  staggered and flung up her arms, and a wild and despairing cry rang out above  the elements. And the light gradually died away, and the wind howled on,  driving the mists across the sinking figure.</p>
  <p>Slowly  she sank into the sand, deeper and deeper. One last terrible moan reached us  where we were, then she disappeared. For the moment the storm seemed to hush.  Then all was darkness.</p>
