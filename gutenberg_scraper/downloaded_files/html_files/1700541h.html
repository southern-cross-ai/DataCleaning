      <b>&nbsp;<a name="Chapter_1"></a>Chapter </b><b>1<br>
&ldquo;Do  you know what would happen to him?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;NOW state your  problem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The man who was thus  addressed shifted uneasily on the long bench which he and his companion  bestrode. He was facing the speaker, and though very little light sifted  through the cobweb-covered window high over their heads, he realized that what  there was fell on his features, and he was not sure of his features, or of what  effect their expression might have on the other man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you sure we are  quite alone in this big, desolate place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">It seemed a needless  question. Though it was broad daylight outside and they were in the very heart  of the most populated district of lower New York, they could not have been more  isolated had the surrounding walls been those of some old ruin in the heart of  an untraversed desert.</p>
  <p align="left">A short description of  the place will explain this. They were in the forsaken old church not far from  Avenue A&mdash;, a building long given over to desolation, and empty of everything  but d&eacute;bris and one or two broken stalls, which for some inscrutable  reason&mdash;possibly from some latent instinct of inherited reverence&mdash;had not yet been  converted into junk and sold to the old clothes men by the rapacious denizens  of the surrounding tenements.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps you remember  this building; perhaps some echo of the bygone and romantic has come to you as you passed its decaying walls once dedicated to  worship, but soulless now and only distinguishable from the five-story  tenements pressing up on either side, by its one high window in which some bits  of colored glass still lingered amid its twisted and battered network. You may  remember the building and you may remember the stray glimpses afforded you  through the arched opening in the lower story of one of the adjacent tenements,  of the churchyard in its rear with its chipped and tumbling headstones just  showing here and there above the accumulated litter. But it is not probable  that you have any recollections of the interior of the church itself, shut as  it has been from the eye of the public for nearly a generation. And it is with  the interior we have to do&mdash;a great hollow vault where once altar and priest confronted a reverent congregation. There is no altar here  now, nor any chancel; hardly any floor. The timbers which held the pews have  rotted and fallen away, and what was once a cellar has received all this  rubbish and held it piled up in mounds which have blocked up most of the  windows and robbed the place even of the dim religious light which was once its  glory, so that when the man whose words we have just quoted asked if they were  quite alone and peered into the dim, belumbered corners, it was but natural for  his hardy, resolute, and unscrupulous companion to snort with impatience and  disgust as he answered:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would I have brought  you here if I hadn&rsquo;t known it was the safest place in New York for this kind of  talk? Why, man, there may be in this city five men all told, who know the trick  of the door I unfastened for you, and not one of them is  a cop. You may take my word for that. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the kids? They&rsquo;re  everywhere; and if one of them should have followed us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know what would  happen to him? I&rsquo;ll tell you a story&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;re frightened enough  already. But there&rsquo;s no kid here, nor any one else but our two selves, unless  it be some wandering spook from the congregations laid outside; and spooks don&rsquo;t  count. So out with your proposition, Mr. Fellows. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter </b><b>2<br>
&ldquo;Thousands  in that safe&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;NO names!&rdquo;  hoarsely interrupted the other. &ldquo;If you speak my name again I&rsquo;ll give the whole  thing up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;re  too deep in it for that. But I&rsquo;ll drop the Fellows and just call you Sam. If  that&rsquo;s too familiar, we&rsquo;ll drop the job. I&rsquo;m not so keen on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will be. It&rsquo;s right  in your line.&rdquo; Sam Fellows, as he was called, was whispering now&mdash;a hot, eager  whisper, breathing of guilt and desperation. &ldquo;If I could do it alone&mdash;but I haven&rsquo;t  the wit&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Experience,&rdquo; dryly put  in the other. &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he exclaimed impatiently, as  Fellows crept nearer, but said nothing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to speak,  but&mdash;Well, then, here&rsquo;s how it is!&rdquo; he suddenly conceded, warned by the other&rsquo;s  eye. &ldquo;The building is a twenty-story one, chuck full and alive with business.  The room I mean is on the twelfth floor; it is one of five, all communicating,  and all in constant use except the one holding the safe. And that is visited  constantly. Some one is always going in and out. Indeed, it is a rule of the  firm that every one of the employees must go into that room once, at least,  during the day, and remain there for five minutes alone. I do it; every one  does it; it&rsquo;s a very mysterious proceeding which only a crank like my employer  would devise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you do there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m speaking  now for myself. The others&mdash;some of the others&mdash;one of the  others may open the safe. That&rsquo;s what I believe, that&rsquo;s what I want to know  about and how it&rsquo;s done.  There are thousands in that safe, and the old man being away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, this is all very  interesting. Go on. What you want is an artist with a jimmy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s no such  job as that. I want to know the person, the trusted person who has all those  securities within touch. It&rsquo;s a mania with me. I should have been the man. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m  manager.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The hoarseness with  which this word was uttered, the instinct of shame which made his eyes fall as  it struggled from his lips, wakened a curious little gleam of hardy cynicism in  the steady gaze of his listener.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re manager, are  you!&rdquo; came in slow retort, filling a silence that had more of pain than  pleasure in it. &ldquo;Well, manager, your story is very interesting, but by no means  complete. Suppose you hurry on to the next instalment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cringing as from a blow,  Fellows took up his tale, no longer creeping nearer his would-be confederate,  but, if anything, edging away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter </b><b>3<br>
&ldquo;How  does it stand&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;VE watched and  watched and watched,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t pick out the man. Letters come, orders  are given, and those orders are carried out, but not by me. I&rsquo;m speaking now of  investments, or the payment of large sums; anything which calls for the opening  of that safe where the old man has stuffed away his thousands. Small matters  fall to my share. There is another safe, of which I hold the combination. Child&rsquo;s  play, but the other! It would make both of us independent, and yet leave  something for appearances. But it can&rsquo;t be worked. It stands in front of a  glass door from which the curtain is drawn every night. Every passerby can look in. If it is opened it must be done in broad daylight  and by the person whom the old man trusts. By that means only would I get my  revenge, and revenge is what I want. He don&rsquo;t trust me, me who have been with him for  seven years and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Drop that, it isn&rsquo;t  interesting. The facts are what I want. What kind of safe is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The strangest you ever  saw. I don&rsquo;t know who made it. There&rsquo;s nothing on it to show. Nor is there a  lock or combination. But it opens. You can just see the outline of a door.  Steel&mdash;fine steel, and not so very large, but the contents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take its contents  for granted. How does it stand? On a platform?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, one foot from the  floor. The platform runs all the way across the room and holds other things; a  table which nobody uses, a revolving bookcase and a  series of shelves, fitted with boxes containing old receipts and such junk.  Sometimes I go through these; but nothing ever comes of it.&rdquo; He paused, as if  the subject were distasteful.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the safe is opened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Almost every week. I&rsquo;m  ashamed to tell you the old duffer&rsquo;s methods; they&rsquo;re loony. But he isn&rsquo;t a  lunatic. At any rate, they don&rsquo;t think so in Wall Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a guess at  his name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not yet. You&rsquo;ll have to  swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re both in it.  Never mind the heroics. It&rsquo;s too good a thing to peach on. Me and the manager!  I like that. Take it easy till the job&rsquo;s done, anyway. And now I&rsquo;ll take a fly  at the name. It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He had the grace to  whisper.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter </b><b>4<br>
&ldquo;Stenographers  must be counted&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">YOUNG Fellows  squirmed and turned a shade paler, if one could trust the sickly violet ray  that shot down from the once exquisitely colored window high up over their  heads.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he muttered; and  the other grinned. Evidently the guess was a correct one.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s no lunatic,&rdquo;  the professional quietly declared. &ldquo;But he has queer ways. Which of his queers  do you object to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When his letters come,  or more often his cablegrams, they are opened by me and then put in plain view  on a certain little bulletin board in the main office. These are his orders.  Any one who knows the cipher can read them. I don&rsquo;t know  the cipher. At night I take them down, number them, and file them away. They  have served their purpose. They have been seen by the person whose business it  is to carry out his instructions, and the rest you must guess. His brokers know  the secret, but it is never discussed by us. The least word and the next  cablegram would read in good plain English, &lsquo;Fire him!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had that  experience. I&rsquo;ve had to fire three since he went away two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That cuts out three from your list. The person is not among  the ones dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; New life  seemed to spring up in Fellows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do the job,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Somehow, I  never thought of going about it that way. And I know  another man that&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Myself, for one. There  are only seven more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Counting all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stenographers included?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, stenographers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stenographers must be  counted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, seven men  and one woman. Our stenographer is a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What kind of a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A young girl. Ordinary,  but good enough. I&rsquo;ve never noticed her very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me about the men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? You  wouldn&rsquo;t take my word. They&rsquo;re a cheap lot, beneath contempt in my estimation.  There&rsquo;s not one of them clever enough for the business. Jack Forbush comes the nearest to it, and probably is the one. The way he  keeps his eye on me makes me suspect him. Or is he, too, playing my game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can I tell? How can  I tell anything from what you say? I&rsquo;ll have to look into the matter myself.  Give me the names and addresses and I&rsquo;ll look the parties up. Get their rating,  so to speak. Leave it to me, and I&rsquo;ll land the old man&rsquo;s confidential clerk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the list. I  thought you might want it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s  name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The girl! Oh, pshaw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Put her name down just  the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There, then. Grace Lee.  Address, 74 East &mdash; Street. And now swear on the honor of a gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Beau Johnson pulled the  rim of Fellows&rsquo;s hat over his eyes to suggest what he thought of this demand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter </b><b>5<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  business with him&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">NEXT day there  appeared at the offices of Thomas Stoughton, in Nassau Street, a trim,  well-looking man, who had urgent business with Mr. Fellows, the manager. He was  kept waiting for some time before being introduced into that gentleman&rsquo;s  private room; but this did not seem to disturb him. There was plenty to look  at, or so he seemed to think, and his keen, noncommittal eyes flashed hither  and thither and from face to face with restless activity. He seemed  particularly interested in the bookkeeper of the establishment, but it was an  interest which did not last long, and when a neat, pleasant-faced young woman  rose from her seat and passed rapidly across the room, it  was upon her his eyes settled and remained fixed, with a growing attention,  until a certain door closed upon her with a sound like a snapping lock. Then he  transferred his attention to the door, and was still gazing at it when a boy  summoned him to the manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p align="left">He went in with  reluctance. He had rather have watched that door. But he had questions to ask,  and so made a virtue of necessity. Mr. Fellows was not pleased to see him. He  started quite guiltily from his seat and only sat again on compulsion&mdash;the  compulsion of his visitor&rsquo;s steady and quelling eye.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve business with you,  Mr. Fellows.&rdquo; Then, the boy being gone, &ldquo;Which is the room? The one opening out  of the general office directly opposite this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700541h-images/page038.png" width="465" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Fellows nodded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have just seen one of  the employees go in there. I should like to see that person come out. Do you  mind talking with this door open? I know enough about banking to hold up my end  of the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fellows rose with a jerk  and pushed the door back. His visitor smiled easily and launched into a  discussion about stocks and bonds interspersed with a few assertions and  questions not meant for the general ear, as:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the girl who is in there. Not ordinary, by any means. Just the sort an old  smudge like Stoughton would be apt to trust. Now what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Singing.  She often sings. I&rsquo;ve forbidden it, but she forgets, she says,&rdquo; answered Fellows.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pretty  good music. Listen to that note. High as a prima donna&rsquo;s. Does she sing at her work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;d fire her if she did. It&rsquo;s only when she&rsquo;s walking about or when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  in that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At par? I buy nothing at par. There! She&rsquo;s coming. I  wish I dared intercept her, rifle her pockets. Do you know if she has pockets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No;  how should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fellows,  you&rsquo;re not worth your salt. Ah! there&rsquo;s a face for you, and I can read it like  a book. Did a letter or cablegram come to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes;  didn&rsquo;t you see it? Hung up in the outer office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought I saw something.  Ninety-five? That&rsquo;s a quotation worth listening to. Three at ninety-five. That girl&rsquo;s a trump. I will see more  of my lady.&rdquo; Here he took care to shut the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been the rounds, Fellows. Private-detective work and all that. She  is the only puzzler among the group. You&rsquo;ll hear from me again; meanwhile treat  the girl well. Don&rsquo;t spring any traps; leave that to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And Fellows, panting  with excitement, promised, muttering under his breath:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A woman! That&rsquo;s even  worse than I thought. But we&rsquo;ll make the old fellow pay for it. Those  securities are ours. I already feel them in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The sinister twitch  which marred the other&rsquo;s mouth emphasized the assertion in a way Grace Lee&rsquo;s  friends would have trembled to see.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter </b><b>6<br>
&ldquo;If I  could tell you his story&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THAT evening a  young woman and a young man sat on one of the benches in Central Park. They  were holding hands, but modestly and with a clinging affection. No one appeared  in sight; they had the moon-light, the fragrance of the spring foliage, and  their true love all to themselves. The woman was Grace, the young man was  Philip Andrews, a candid-eyed, whole-hearted fellow whom any girl might be  proud to be seen with, much more to be engaged to. Grace was proud, but she was  more than that; her heart was all involved in her hope&mdash;a good heart which he  was equally proud to have won. Yet while love was theirs and the surroundings breathed peace and joy, they did not look quite happy. A  cloud was on his brow and something like a tear in her eye as she spoke gently  but with rare firmness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Philip, we must wait.  One love does not put out another. I cannot leave my old father now. He is too  feeble and much too dependent on me. Philip, you do not know my father. You  have seen him, it is true, many, many times. You have talked with him and even  have nursed him at odd moments, when I had to be out of the room getting supper  or supplying some of his many wants. Yet you do not know him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know that he is  intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes, that is  evident. Any one can see that. And you can see, too, that he is frequently  fretful and exacting, as all old people are. But the qualities he shows me&mdash;his strong, melancholy, but devoted nature, quickened by  an unusually unhappy life&mdash;that you do not see and cannot, much as you like him  and much as he likes you. Only the child who has surprised him at odd moments,  when he thought himself quite alone, wringing his hands and weeping over some  intolerable memory&mdash;who has listened in the dead of night to his smothered but  heart-breaking groans, can know either his suffering or the one joy which palliates  it. If I could tell you his story&mdash;but that would be treason to one whose rights  I am bound to reverence. You will respect my silence, but you must also take my  word that he needs and has a right to all the pleasure and all the hope my love  can give him. I cannot be with him much; my work forbids, but the little time I  have is his, except on rare occasions like this, and he  knows it and is satisfied. Were I married&mdash;. But you will wait, Philip. It may  not be long&mdash;he grows weaker every day. Besides, you are not ready yet yourself.  You are doing wonderfully well, but a year&rsquo;s freedom will help you materially,  as it will me. Every day is adding to our store; in a year we may be almost  independent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Grace, you have  misunderstood me. I said that I was no good without you, that I needed your  presence to make a man of me, but I did not mean that you were to share my  fortunes now. I would not ask that. I would be a fool or worse, for, Grace, I&rsquo;m  not doing so well as you think. While I knew that my present employment was for  a specified time, I had hopes of continuing on. But this cannot be. That&rsquo;s what  I have to tell you to-night. It looks as if our marriage would have to be  postponed indefinitely instead of hastened. And I can&rsquo;t bear it. You don&rsquo;t know  what you are to me, or what this disappointment is. I expected to be raised,  not dismissed, and if I had had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p align="left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The word came very  softly, and with rare tenderness. It made him turn and look at her sweet,  upturned face, with its resources of strength and shy, unfathomable smile. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;  she asked again, with a closer pressure of her hand. &ldquo;You must finish all your  sentences with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed.&rdquo; He  uttered it breathlessly. &ldquo;What am I, to say, &lsquo;If I had three thousand dollars  the Stickney Company would keep me?&rsquo; I have barely three hundred and those are  dedicated to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter </b><b>7<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure that I can get them for you&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;IF you had three thousand!&rdquo;  She repeated it in surprise and yet with an indescribable air, which to one  versed in human nature would have caught the attention and aroused strange  inner inquiries. &ldquo;Does the Stickney Company want money so badly as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. They  have plainly told me that for three thousand dollars and my services they would  give me ten thousand dollars&rsquo; stock interest, but insist that the man who  assumes the responsibility of the position must be financially interested as  well. But I haven&rsquo;t the money, and without the money my experience appears to  them valueless. I despair of getting another situation in  these hard times and&mdash;Grace, you don&rsquo;t look sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; she paused,  and her fine eyes roamed about her jealous of a listener to her secret, but did  not pierce the bush which rose up, cloudy with blossoms, a few feet behind  their bench&mdash;&ldquo;because it is not impossible for you to hope for those thousands.  I think&mdash;I am sure that I can get them for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her voice had sunk to a  whisper, but it was a very clear whisper.</p>
  <p align="left">Young Andrews looked at  her in surprise; there was something besides pleasure in that surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">She hesitated, and just  at that moment the moon slipped behind a cloud.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where, Grace, can you  get three thousand dollars? From Mr. Stoughton? He is generous to you, he pays you well for what you do for him, but I do not think he  would give you that amount, nor do I think he would risk it on any venture  involving my judgment. I should not like to have you ask him. I should like to  rise feeling absolutely independent of Mr. Stoughton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I never thought of  asking him. There is another way. I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to think it over. If your scheme  is good&mdash;very  good, I might be brought to aid you in the way my mind suggests. But I should  want to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She was not looking at  him now. If she had been, she might have been startled at his expression. Nor  could he see her face; she had turned it aside.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  do anything rash. You handle so much money that three thousand dollars may seem  very little to you. But it&rsquo;s a goodly sum to get or to replace if one loses it. You must not borrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will not borrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor raise it in any way  without telling me the sacrifice you must make to obtain it. But it&rsquo;s all a  dream; tell me that it&rsquo;s all a dream; you were talking from your wishes, not  from any certainty you have. Say so, and I will not be disappointed. I do not  want your  money; I&rsquo;d rather go poor and wait till the times change. Don&rsquo;t you see? I&rsquo;d be  more of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d have to take  it if I gave it to you, and&mdash;perhaps I shall. I want to see you happy, Philip; I  must see you happy. I&rsquo;d be willing to risk a good deal for that. I&rsquo;m not so  happy myself, father suffers so, and the care of it weighs on me. You are all I  have to make me glad, and when you are troubled my heart goes down, down. But  it&rsquo;s getting late, dear. It&rsquo;s time we went home. Don&rsquo;t  ask me what&rsquo;s in my mind, but dream of riches. I&rsquo;m sure they will come. You  shall earn them with the three thousand dollars you want and which I will give  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall earn them  honestly,&rdquo; were the last words he said, as they rose from the seat and began to  move toward the gate. And the moon, coming out from its temporary eclipse,  shone on his clear-cut face as he said this, but not on her bowed head and  sidelong look. They were in the shadow.</p>
  <p align="left">There was something else  in the shadow. As they moved away and disappeared in the darkness the long,  slim figure of a man rose from behind the bush I have mentioned. He had a  sparkling eye and a thin-lipped mouth, and he smiled very curiously as he  looked after the pair before turning himself about and going the other way.</p>
  <p align="left">It was not Fellows; it  was his chosen confederate in the nefarious scheme they had planned between  them.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter </b><b>8<br>
&ldquo;I did  as you bid me&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">ANOTHER meeting  in the old church, but this time at night. The somberness of the surroundings  was undiminished by any light. They were in absolute darkness. Absolute  darkness, but not absolute silence. Noises strange and suggestive, but not of  any human agency, whispered, sighed, rattled, and grumbled from far away recesses.  The snap of wood, the gnawing of rats, the rustling of bat wings disturbed the  ears of one of the guilty pair, till his voice took on unnatural tones as he  tried to tell his story to his greedy companion. They were again astride the  bench, and their thin faces were so near that their breaths commingled at times; yet Fellows felt at moments so doubtful of all human  presence that instinctively his hand would go groping out till it touched the  other&rsquo;s arm or breast, when it would fall back again satisfied. He was in a  state of absolute terror of the darkness, the oppressive air, the ghostly  sounds, and possibly of the image raised by his own conscience, yet he hugged  to himself the thought of secrecy which it all involved, and never thought of  yielding up his scheme or even shortening his tale, so long as the other  listened and gave his mind to the problem which promised them thousands without  the usual humdrum method of working for them.</p>
  <p align="left">We will listen to what  he had to say, leaving to your imagination the breaks and guilty starts and  moments of intense listening and anxious fear with which he seasoned it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did as you bid me,&rdquo;  he whispered. &ldquo;Yesterday fresh orders came from abroad, in cipher, as usual.  (It&rsquo;s an unreadable cipher. I&rsquo;ve had experts on it many times.) I had hung it  up, and though business was heavy, my business, you know, I had eyes for our  fair friend, and knew every step she took about the offices. I even knew when  her eyes first fell on the cablegram. I had my door open, and I caught her looking  up from her work, and what was more, caught the pause in the click-click of the  typewriter as she looked and read. If she had not been able to read, the  click-click would have gone on, for I believe she could work that typewriter  with her eyes shut. But her attention was caught, and she stopped. I tell you I&rsquo;ve  been humiliated for the last time. I&rsquo;m in for anything that will make that girl step down and out. What was that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Muttered curses from his  companion brought him back to his story. With a gulp he went on:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may bet your bottom  dollar that I watched her after that, and sure enough, in less than half an  hour she had gone into the room where the safe is. Instantly I prepared my coup d&rsquo;&ecirc;tat. I  waited just long enough to hear her voice in that one song she sings, then I  jumped from my seat and rushed to the door, shouting, &lsquo;Miss Lee! Miss Lee! Your  father! Your father!&rsquo; making hullabaloo enough to raise the dead and scare her  out of her wits; for she dotes on that old man and would sell her soul for his  sake, I do believe.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Great heavens, it  worked! As I live, it worked. I heard her voice fail on that high upper note of  hers, and then the sound of her feet staggering, slipping  over the floor, and in another moment the fumbling of her hand on the knob and  the slow opening of the door which she seemed to have no power to manage.  Helping her, I pulled it open, and there beyond her and her white, shocked  face, I saw&mdash;I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter </b><b>9<br>
&ldquo; &lsquo;The  safe door is opened,&rsquo; I cried&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;GO on! Don&rsquo;t be a  fool; that was nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it was  like a great sigh at my ear. But this is awful! Couldn&rsquo;t we have one spark of  light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And have the police  upon us the next minute? Look up at that window. You can see  it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes, but very  faintly,&rdquo; Fellows whispered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you can see it. So  could those outside, if we had one glimmer of light in here. No, no, you&rsquo;ll  have to stand the dark or quit. But you shan&rsquo;t quit till you&rsquo;ve told me what  you saw in the room where the safe is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The safe door opening.&rdquo;  His voice trembled so that the other shook him to steady  his nerves. &ldquo;Not opened, mind you, but opening. It was like magic, and I stared  so that she forgot her fears and forgot her questions. Turning from me with a  startled cry, she looked behind her, and saw what I saw, and tried to push me  out. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come, I&rsquo;ll come,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;Leave me a minute and I&rsquo;ll come.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t going to  do that. &lsquo;The safe door is opened,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Did you do it?&rsquo; She didn&rsquo;t know  what to say. I have never seen a woman in such a state; then she whispered in  awful agitation, &lsquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ve been given the combination by Mr. Stoughton. I&rsquo;m  duly following his orders. But my father! What about my father? You frightened  me so I forgot that&mdash;&rsquo; I waited, staring at her, but she didn&rsquo;t finish. She just  asked, &lsquo;My father? What has happened to him?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing  serious,&rsquo; I managed to say. I wished the old father was in ballyhack. But he&rsquo;d  served his turn; I must say that he&rsquo;d served his turn. &lsquo;A telephone message,&rsquo; I  went on. &lsquo;He had had a nervous spell and wanted you. I said that you could go  home at noon.&rsquo; She stood looking at me doubtfully; then her eyes stole back to  the safe. &lsquo;You will have to leave me here for a few minutes,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I have  Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s business to attend to. He will not be pleased at my having  given away his secret. He did not wish it known who controlled his affairs in  his absence, but now that you do know, you will be doing the right thing to let  me go on in the way he has planned for me. His orders must be carried out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is very determined,  and understands herself only too well, but I am manager,  and I paid her back in her own coin. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but what  proof have I that you are telling me the truth? You have opened the safe&mdash;you  say you have the combination&mdash;but people sometimes surprise a combination and  open a safe from other interests than those of their employer. You seem a good  girl, but you are a  girl, and there are men here much more likely to be in Mr.  Stoughton&rsquo;s confidence than yourself. With that open safe before us I cannot  leave you here alone. What you take from it I must see, and if possible be  present at your negotiations. That I consider a manager&rsquo;s duty under the  circumstances.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mr. Fellows,&rsquo; she asked, &lsquo;can you read this morning&rsquo;s  telegram?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I felt bound to reply. &lsquo;Then that acquits you. I can.&rsquo; And again she tried to urge me to go out. But I would  not be urged. I was staring across the room at the open safe and in fancy  clutching its contents. In fact, I made one step toward them. But she drew  herself up with such an air that I paused. She&rsquo;s a big girl, you know, and not  to be fooled with when she&rsquo;s angry. &lsquo;Come a step farther and I will scream for  the watchman,&rsquo; she whispered. All our talk had been low, for there were  listening ears everywhere&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t risk that, and I stepped back.  Immediately she saw her advantage, and added, &lsquo;If you do not think better of it  and leave the room, I&rsquo;ll scream.&rsquo; For answer to this I said that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter </b><b>10<br>
&ldquo;I  have a scheme&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A yell answered him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something hit me!  Something hit me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I hit you; and I&rsquo;ll  hit you again if you don&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fellows shivered,  attempted some puerile protest, balked, and stammeringly  obeyed his restless and irritated companion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I said&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t such  a fool then as I am now&mdash;that she had lied when she told me that she had the  combination. There was no combination. The safe did not even have a lock. The  door opened with a spring. How had she induced that spring to give way? I demanded to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. She merely  repeated, &lsquo;I will scream, and that will cause a scandal which will lead to your  discharge, not mine.&rsquo; So&mdash;so, I came out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Blast your eyes! And  when did she  come out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Within five minutes. I  watched the clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what did she have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing in sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. A deep game. But  I know a deeper. There is no possibility of breaking into that safe by night,  undetected by the watchman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;None; and that watchman  is incorruptible. The whole contents of the safe wouldn&rsquo;t move him to connect  himself with this job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The job must be done by  day and during office hours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And cannot be done  without the assistance of this girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well; I have a  scheme. Now listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Not even the rat which  at that minute nibbled at Fellows&rsquo;s boot heel could have heard what followed.  The panting of two breasts was, however, audible; and when, fifty minutes  later, both crawled out of the cellar window among the rubbish which littered  the rear of this once holy place, the one was trembling with excitement and the  other with fear. They parted at the first thoroughfare, neither having eyes to  see nor hearts to appreciate the touching scene which miles away was taking  place in a little flat not very far from Harlem. An old man, frail in body, but  with a sturdy spirit yet, was looking up from his pillow  at the loving face of a young girl who was bending over him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot sleep  to-night,&rdquo; he said to her; &ldquo;I cannot sleep; but that must not disturb you. I  have so many things to think, pleasant things; but you have only cares, and  must rest from them. You look very tired to-night, tired and worried. Leave me  and sleep. I want to see you bright in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;She  will go in&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THE next day  there was a dearth of assistants in the office. One was sick, one had pleaded a  long-delayed vacation, two had business for the concern which took them into  different quarters of the city, and Mr. Beers, who was next in authority to Mr.  Fellows, had been summoned to serve on the grand jury. Perhaps it was this  knowledge that Mr. Beers would be absent which had led to the manager&rsquo;s  easiness in regard to the others. For he had been easy, or so Miss Lee thought  when she arrived in the morning and saw the office almost empty. However, it  did not trouble her much. On the contrary, the quiet and  non-surveillance of the two clerks who did the business of the day seemed  rather to elate her, and she went about her work, copying letters and taking  down notes with an alacrity and air of cheerful hope which caused the manager  to cast toward her more than one suspicious look from his desk in the adjoining  room. He  was not busy, though he had been the first to arrive that morning; and he had  brought with him a large square package which he had taken into the room which  held the safe. He pretended to be busy, but any one watching him closely would  have noticed that his eyes, and not his hands, were all that were engaged, and  they were anywhere but on his desk or the letter he appeared to be reading. An  observer would also have noticed that his nervousness was of the extreme sort,  and that the trembling which shook his whole body  increased visibly whenever his glance fell on the door of Mr. Beers&rsquo;s private  room, opening at his back. No one was supposed to be in that room to-day, and  had Miss Lee not been one minute late this especial morning, perhaps there  might not have been. But in that one minute&rsquo;s grace a man had entered the office  who had not gone out again, and where could he be if not in that one closed  room?</p>
  <p align="left">The room which held the  safe was open as usual, and many of Mr. Fellows&rsquo;s glances traveled that way. He  had entered it once only since his first hurried visit of the early morning,  but only to pull down the shade over the glass in the door communicating with  the outside hall. This was his usual custom, and it attracted no attention. Why  shouldn&rsquo;t he enter it again? He thought he would. A fascination was upon him. The problem he had given Beau Johnson to solve  was to receive a test this day which would make him a rich man or a felon; but  before that hour why not make his own study, his own investigation? True, he  had made these many times before, but not with such lights to guide him. He  might learn&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">But no, the very conceit  was folly. He knew his own limitations, else he had not called in the services  of this crook. He could learn nothing by himself, but he might look the place  over and see if all was in shape for the great attempt. That was only his duty.  Beau Johnson had a right to expect that of him. If the scrub woman had moved  anything&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">At the thought that this  possibly might have happened, he jumped to his feet and hurried into the outer  office; but when he turned toward the room of the safe,  he met Miss Lee&rsquo;s eye fixed upon him with such a keen, inquiring look that he  faltered in his determination, and went in another direction instead. She knew  that he had no business in that room, and she also knew that he knew she knew  this. Any pretense that he had would only rouse her suspicions, and these must  be lulled to the point of security, or she might not enter there herself, and  on her entering there everything depended. Almost immediately upon the thought  he was back in his seat, and the weary moments crept on. Would she never make  her accustomed visit to that room? No cablegram had come that morning, but she  would find some reason for going in. Of that he had been assured by Johnson.  Why, he had not been told. &ldquo;She will go in,&rdquo; Beau Johnson  had said, and Fellows believed him. He believed everything the other said,  otherwise he could not have gone on with this business. But she was very long  about it. Harlowe would be coming back&mdash;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter </b><b>12<br>
&ldquo;A  block of steel&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">AH, he had an  idea! It was not his own, but for the moment he thought it was. He would leave  the office himself and thus give her an opportunity to quit her work and shut  herself up with the safe. But&mdash;(was his mind leaving him?) there was something  to be done first. The way must be cleared for the man in hiding to enter that  room before she did. How was this to be accomplished? A dozen suggestions had  been given him by his confederate, but he had forgotten them all. He was in too  great a whirl to think, yet he must think; some way must be found. Ah, he had  it. Taking up the receiver at his side, he telephoned to  a German friend to call him up in five minutes, giving him the number of the  telephone in the farthest room. This he did in German, telling him it was a  joke and that he was not to insist upon an answer. Then he waited. In five  minutes this farther bell rang. Calling to Miss Lee, he asked her to answer for  him, saying he was very busy. As she rose, he gave a preconcerted signal on the  door of Mr. Beers&rsquo;s room. As she disappeared in the one beyond, the dapper  figure of Johnson crossed the outer office and slipped into the one holding the  safe. A minute later she was back reporting the message and getting  instructions, but the one thing she had to fear had been done; the trap had  been laid, and now for its victim!</p>
  <p align="left">It was not long before  that victim responded to the call. On the departure of  the manager from the room Grace Lee rose, and with a conscious look toward the  two clerks, slipped across the floor to the open door of the safe room.  Entering, she swung to the door, which closed with a snap; then, with just a  moment of hesitation, in which she seemed to be trying to regain her breath,  she passed quickly across to the safe and took up her stand before it. So directly  and so quickly had she done this that she had not seen the slim, immovable  figure drawn up against the wall at her right behind the projection of a large  bookcase. Nor did any influence for good or evil cause her to turn after she  had reached the safe. All her thoughts, all her hopes, all the dreams which she  had cherished seemed to be concentrated in the blank, eyeless object which  confronted her, impenetrable to all appearance&mdash;a block of  steel without visible opening&mdash;an enigma among safes&mdash;the problem of all problems  to every cracksman in town but one&mdash;which was about to be solved if one could  judge from the thrill which now shook her, and in shaking her communicated the  same excitement to the silent, breathless, determined man in her rear, watching  her as the tiger watches the quarry, and with the same tiger spring latent in  his eye. In a moment her secret would be out, and then&mdash;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter </b><b>13<br>
&ldquo;I am  from headquarters&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">FOR just a minute  Grace Lee paused before the blank door of the safe, then she passed around to  an unused speaking tube in the neighboring wall. Halting before it, in low but  distinct tones she began to sing the famous aria from &ldquo;The Magic Flute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">All agog, with eyes  starting and ears alert, the man behind listened and watched. Nothing happened.</p>
  <p align="left">Then came a change.  Gradually her voice rose, sweet and piercing, till it reached that famous F in  alt so rarely attempted, so exciting to the ear when fairly taken and fairly  held. Grace Lee could take it, and as it hung, sweet and  deliciously thrilling in the air, Beau Johnson saw, to his amazement, though he  was in a way prepared for it, the heavy safe door slip softly ajar. She had  done it with her voice. How, he could only vaguely guess. He was better  educated than most of his class, or he could not have understood it at all. As  it was, he laid it to the vibration caused by a certain definite note acting on  some delicate mechanism set in accord with that note, which mechanism starting  another and a stronger one gradually led up to that which drew the bolts and  set the door ajar. Whether his theory were true or not mattered little at the  moment. The event for which he waited had been accomplished and accomplished  before his eyes. To profit by it was his next thought, and to this end he held  himself ready for the spring which had laid latent in his eyes since he first saw her advance toward the safe.</p>
  <p align="left">She was ignorant of his  presence. This was evident from the jaunty way she turned from the tube, still  singing, but in a desultory way, which showed that her thoughts were no longer  on her music. But she was not so engrossed that she did not see him. The moment  that her face turned his way, her eyes enlarged, her body stiffened, her whole  personality took on power and purpose and she sprang more quickly than he  did and shut the safe door with one quick movement of her hand that fastened it  as securely as before. Then she drew herself up to meet his rush, a noble  figure of resolute womanhood which any other man would have hesitated to  assail. But he was proof to any appeal of this kind. She had been quicker than  he who was esteemed the readiest in his class, and he  owed her a grudge, if only for that. Smiling&mdash;it was a way of his when deeply  moved or deeply dangerous&mdash;he accosted her with smooth and treacherous words.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700541h-images/page100.png" width="471" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scream, young  lady; screaming will do you no good. Mr. Fellows has left the  business to me and I am quite competent to manage it. I am from headquarters&mdash;a  detective. Yesterday you aroused the manager&rsquo;s suspicions, and I was detailed  this morning to watch you. What do you want from Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s safe? An  honest answer may help you. Nothing else will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I want&mdash;&rdquo; she  hesitated, eyeing him over with an insight and an undoubted air of self-command  which told the hardy rascal that in this woman he was likely to meet his match.  &ldquo;I want some securities of Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s which he has ordered me to dispose  of for him. I am in his confidence, as I can prove to you if you will give me  the opportunity. I have papers at home that will satisfy any one of my right to  open this safe and to negotiate such papers as are designated in Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s  cablegrams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it.&rdquo; The  words came easily from the mobile lips of the wily Beau Johnson. &ldquo;But it was  not to do Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s business that you opened the safe just now. You have  had no orders to-day; you had no order yesterday. Another purpose is in your  mind&mdash;a personal purpose. It is this abuse of Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s confidence which  brings me here. You  want three thousand dollars badly!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter </b><b>14<br>
&ldquo;You  do not answer&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">SHE recoiled.  Strong as she was, she was not proof against this surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;  she asked, her voice losing its clear tone. &ldquo;I do not deny it, but how could  you know what I thought to be a secret between&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You and your lover?  Well&mdash;we&mdash;the police know many things, young lady. We have a gift. We also have a  kind of foreknowledge. I could tell you something of your future if you will  deign to listen to me. Your lover is an honest man. What do you suppose he will  do when he hears that you have been arrested for attempted burglary on your employer&rsquo;s effects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He had been slowly  advancing as he reeled off these glib sentences, but he paused as he met her  smile. It was not of the same sort as his, but it was not without a certain  suggestiveness which he felt it would be best for him to understand before he  threw off his mask.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he  will do,&rdquo; said she, meeting the false detective&rsquo;s eye as she laid her hand on  the safe, &ldquo;but I know what I shall do if you carry out the purpose you  threaten. Show my papers to the police and demand evidence of my having any bad  intentions in opening this safe this morning. I think you will have difficulty  in producing any. I think that you will only prove yourself a fool. Are you so  strong with the authorities as to brave that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Astonished at her  insight and more than astonished at her self-control,  the experienced cracksman paused, and then in tones he rarely used, remarked  quietly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are playing with  your life, Miss Lee. I have a pistol leveled at you from my pocket, and I&rsquo;m the  man to fire if you give me the slightest occasion to do so. I&rsquo;m Beau Johnson,  miss, a detective if you please, but also a tolerably experienced cracksman,  and I want a taste of those bonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Mr. Fellows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The words rang out clear  and fearlessly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, he? He&rsquo;s a muff.  You needn&rsquo;t concern yourself about him. The matter&rsquo;s between us two. Three  thousand dollars for you, and a little more, perhaps, for me, and I to take all  the blame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her eye stole toward the  door. No one could enter that way, she knew. Even her  screams, if she survived them, might alarm, but could not bring her help for  several minutes, if not longer. Yet she did not tremble; only grew a shade  paler.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You do not answer. What  have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This.&rdquo; She was like  marble now. &ldquo;You will not kill me, because that would be virtually to kill  yourself. You cannot leave this room without my help, nor fire a shot without  being caught like a rat in a trap. I want three thousand dollars, and I mean to  have them, but I do not see how you are going to get the few more which you  promise yourself. Certainly I am not going to aid you in doing so, and you  cannot open that safe. You have not the musical training.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The word came like  a shot, possibly in lieu of a shot, for if ever he felt  murderous it was at that moment. &ldquo;I have not a musical training, but that does  not make me helpless. In a few moments I shall have the pleasure of hearing you  test your voice again. There&rsquo;s the office clock ticking; count the strokes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She stood fascinated.  What did he mean by this? Involuntarily she did his bidding.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One, two, three, four,  five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;eleven!  And at half past your old father dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dies?&rdquo; Her lips did not  frame the words; her eyes looked it, her whole sinking, suddenly collapsing  figure gave voice to the maddening query, &ldquo;Dies?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter </b><b>15<br>
&ldquo;Now,  if Fellows will stay away&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;YES. Such is the  understanding if I do not telephone my pals to hold off. He&rsquo;s not at home; he&rsquo;s  with my friends. They don&rsquo;t care very much about old men, and if I have not a  decent show of money by half-past eleven this morning the orders are to knock  him on the head. It won&rsquo;t take a very hard knock. He was far from being in  prime condition this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She had shown great  feeling at the beginning of this address, but at its close she drew herself up again and met him with something of her old composure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These are all lies,&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;My father would never leave his house at the  instigation of any gang. In the first place, he is not strong enough to attempt  the stairs. You cannot deceive me in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He might be carried  down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t submit to  that, nor would the other lodgers in the house allow it without an express  order from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They got the order; not  from you, but from him. He demanded to be allowed to go. You see, Mr. Fellows  sent a message that you were hurt&mdash;I will speak the whole truth, and say dying.  The old man could not be held after that. He went with the messenger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her cheeks were now like  ashes. She had gauged the man before her and felt that he was fully capable of  this villainy. How great a villainy she alone knew who had the history of this  old man in her heart.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went with the  messenger,&rdquo; repeated Johnson, watching her face with a cruel leer. &ldquo;That  messenger knew where to take him. You may be sure it was to a place quite  unknown to the police and to every one else but myself. Five minutes more gone,  miss. In just twenty-five minutes more you will be an orphan and one impediment  to your marriage will be at an end. How about the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;If I  could really believe you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can smooth away that  doubt. If you will promise not to compromise me with the clerks or any one  inside there, I will allow you to telephone home and learn the truth of what I  have told you. Anything further will end all business between us and wind up  your father&rsquo;s affairs at the hour set. I can afford to  humor you for ten minutes more in this nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; she  cried. &ldquo;I must know what I am fighting before&mdash;&rdquo; She caught herself back, but he  was quite able to finish the sentence for her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Before you submit to  the inevitable,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
  <p align="left">Her head fell and he  pointed toward the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will trust you to  guard my&mdash;our interests,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Open and go directly to your own telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With a staggering step  she obeyed. Creeping up stealthily behind her he watched her manner of opening  the door and profited by the one quick glance he got of the office as she  stepped through and passed hurriedly forward to her desk. There was no one  within sight. Mr. Fellows had not yet returned and the clerks were too remote to notice her agitation or pay attention to her gait or  the tremulousness of her tone as she called for her home number.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo;  thought he. &ldquo;Now if Fellows will stay away long enough, I&rsquo;ll be able to double  the boodle I&rsquo;ve promised myself.&rdquo; This with a chuckle.</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime Miss Lee had  got in her message. The answer sent her flying toward him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone! He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;  she gasped. &ldquo;My old, old father! Oh, you wretch! Save him and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You save me first,&rdquo; he  whispered, and was about to draw her back into the room with the safe, when the  outer door opened and a stranger entered on business.</p>
  <p align="left">Her agony at the  interruption and the few necessary words it involved caused the visitor to  stare. But she was able to make herself intelligible and  to turn him over to one of the clerks, after which she rejoined Johnson,  closing the door quietly behind her.</p>
  <p align="left">His greeting was  characteristic.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You waste breath,&rdquo; said  he, &ldquo;by all this emotion. You&rsquo;ll need it to open the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What guarantee have I  that you will keep your part of the contract?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I sing&mdash;the door  opens&mdash;you help yourself, and you go. That does not restore to me my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll play fair. In  proof of it, here&rsquo;s my pistol. If on our going out I do not stop with you at  the telephone and let you communicate with your father and send my own message  of release, then shoot me in the back. I give you leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Taking the pistol he  held out, she cocked it, and looking into the chambers, found they were all full.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know how to use it,&rdquo;  she said simply.</p>
  <p align="left">Admiration showed in his  face. He bowed and pointed toward the tube.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now for the song,&rdquo; he  cried.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter </b><b>16<br>
&ldquo;It  was not paper I meant to have&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">WITH a bound she  took her stand. She was white as death and greatly excited. Watching her  curiously, the crafty villain noted the quick throbbing of her throat and the  feverish grip on the pistol.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Time is galloping,&rdquo; he  remarked.</p>
  <p align="left">She gave a gasp, opened  her lips and essayed to sing. An awful, indescribable murmur was all that could  be heard. Stiffening herself, she resolutely calmed down her agitation and  tried again. The result was but little better than before. Turning with a cry,  she looked with horror-stricken eyes into the unmoved,  slightly sardonic face of the man behind her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot sing! You have  frightened away my voice. I cannot raise that note even to save my father&rsquo;s life.  I&rsquo;m choking, choking.&rdquo; Then as she caught the devilish gleam lighting up his  eye, she added, &ldquo;You will never have those thousands! The safe is closed to us  both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He laughed, a very low,  cautious laugh, but it made her eyes distend with uncertainty and dread.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You fail to do justice  to my fore-thought,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I took this into my  calculations. I know women; they can be wicked enough, but they lack coolness.  Let me see now what I can do. I cannot sing, but I have a little aide de camp  which can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Walking away from her,  he approached a small table on which stood an object she had never seen in that room before. It was covered with a cloth, and as he  removed this cloth, she reeled with surprise; then she became still with hope  and the rush of fresh and overpowering emotions.</p>
  <p align="left">A graphophone stood  revealed, one of the finest quality. It was set to play the air so often on her  lips, and in another moment that keen, high note rang through the room,&mdash;that  and no more.</p>
  <p align="left">It answered. Slowly,  softly, after one breathless moment, the door they both watched with fascinated  gaze swung slowly ajar, just as they had seen it do at the beginning of this  interview, and Johnson, coming forward, pulled it open with a jerk and began to  fumble among the contents of the safe.</p>
  <p align="left">She could have killed  him easily. He had forgotten&mdash;but so had she, and there was no one else by to  remind her. Had there been, he would have seen a strange  spectacle, for no sooner had Johnson&rsquo;s hand struck those shelves and minute  drawers, than Grace Lee&rsquo;s whole attitude and expression changed. From a  terrified, incapable woman, she became again her old self, strong,  self-controlled, watchful. Creeping up behind him, she looked over his  shoulders as he examined with his quick, experienced eye the various papers he  drew out, noting his anger and growing disappointment as he found them  unavailable for immediate use. Conscious of her presence, his rage grew till it  shot forth in words. Not stinting oaths, he whirled on her after a moment and  asked where the securities were. &ldquo;You meant to have them; you know where the ready money  is. Show me, show me at once or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then a great anguish  passed across her face, a look of farewell to hopes  sweet and dearly cherished. If he saw it he did not heed. All his evil, indomitable  will shone in the eye he turned up askance at her, and though she held the  means of killing him in her hand, she bowed to that will, and leaning over him,  she whispered in his ear:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was not paper I  meant to have, but&mdash;but something else&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She stopped, for breath  was leaving her. His slim, assured hand was straying toward a certain knob  hidden partly from sight, but plain to the touch if his fingers crept that way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; She was  gasping now, but her hand laid on his shoulder emphasized her words. &ldquo;There are  jewels at the other end; Mrs. Stoughton&rsquo;s bridal jewels. They are worth  thousands. I&mdash;I&mdash;meant to take those. They are in a compartment under that lower drawer. Yes, yes&mdash;there they are; take them and be  gone. I&mdash;I have lost&mdash;but you will give me back my father? See! there are not  many minutes left. Oh, be merciful and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter </b><b>17<br>
&ldquo;Now  for my part of the bargain&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">HE was looking at  the jewels, appraising them, making sure they were real and marketable. She was  looking at them, too, with a wild longing and a bitter disappointment, which  he, turning at that moment to mark her looks, saw and rated at its full value.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I guess they&rsquo;ll  do,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pausing in his task of thrusting the gems in his pocket to  hand her a bracelet ornamented with one small diamond. &ldquo;But I expected more  from all this fuss and feathers. Was it to guard these&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured,  thrusting the bracelet into the neck of her dress and stepping quickly back. &ldquo;They are priceless to the owner. Associations you know.  Mrs. Stoughton is dead&mdash;There! that will do. Now for my part of the bargain,&rdquo;  and bethinking her at last of the pistol, she raised it and pointed it full in  his face. &ldquo;You will close that door now and send the telephone you promised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He rose and banged to  the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  behaved well. Now hide that pistol in your waist and we&rsquo;ll step into the outer  office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She did as she was bid,  and in a moment more they were crossing the floor outside. As they did so, she  noticed that the two clerks had been sent out to luncheon, leaving them alone  with Mr. Fellows. This was not encouraging, nor did she like the click which at  this moment Beau Johnson made with his tongue. It  sounded like a preconcerted signal. Whether so or not, it brought Mr. Fellows  from his room, and in another instant he was standing with them before the  telephone. There was a clock over the safe-room door. It stood at just twenty-five minutes after eleven.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; she whispered  as the other took up the receiver.</p>
  <p align="left">She did not need to say  it. His own anxiety seemed to be as great as hers, but his anxiety was to be  gone. The nerve which sustained him while the issue was doubtful gave some  slight tokens of failing, now that his efforts had brought success and only  this small obligation lay between him and the enjoyment of the booty he had won  at such a risk. She was sure that his voice trembled as he uttered the  familiar. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; and during the interchange of words  which followed, the strain was perhaps as great on him as on her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello! how&rsquo;s the old  man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She could hear the  answer. It swept her fears away in a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, but anxious about  the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,  everything&rsquo;s all right. Take the sick man home and tell him that his daughter  will be there almost as soon as he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must hear my father&rsquo;s  voice.&rdquo; It was Grace who was speaking. &ldquo;I will give a cry that will echo  through this building if you do not put me in communication with him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her hand went out to the  receiver.</p>
  <p align="left">The veins on Beau  Johnson&rsquo;s forehead stood out threateningly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he  muttered; but he gave the order just the same.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello! Don&rsquo;t shut off.  The girl&rsquo;s nervous; wants to hear her  father&rsquo;s voice. Have him up! two words from him will answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Grace&rsquo;s mouth was at the  phone.</p>
  <p align="left">No reply.</p>
  <p align="left">She cast one look at  Johnson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting him on  his feet,&rdquo; he grumbled. His eye was on the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she called  again, her voice tremulous with doubt and anxiety.</p>
  <p align="left">A murmur this time, but  she recognized it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s he! it&rsquo;s he,&rdquo; she  cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe; he&rsquo;s well. Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But Johnson had no time  for dilly-dallying. Catching the receiver back, he took his place again at the  phone and shouted a few final injunctions. Then he faced her with the question:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; She nodded, speechless at last and almost breathless from  exhaustion. He bowed and made for the door. As he opened it, Mr. Fellows slid  forward and joined him. Both were leaving. He as well as Johnson. She caught  the look which the manager threw her as he closed the door behind them. There  was threat in that look and her heart strings tightened as she stood alone  there facing her fearful duty. Mr. Fellows was a thief! The manager of this  concern was even then perhaps walking off with the booty wrenched from her care  by the devil&rsquo;s own inquisition. What should she do? Send for Philip? Yes, that  was all her tortured mind could grasp. She would send for her own Philip and  get his advice before she notified the police or sent the inevitable cablegram.  She was too ill, too shaken to do more. Philip! Philip!</p>
  <p align="left">She was fainting&mdash;she  felt it, and was raising her voice to call in one of the clerks, when the outer  door opened and Mr. Fellows came in. She had not expected him back. She had  fondly believed that he had gone with his professional comrade; and the sight  of him caused her to rise again to her feet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she murmured,  facing him in dull wonder at his renewed look of threat. &ldquo;I cannot stay in the  same room with you. You are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter </b><b>18<br>
&ldquo;What  have you done among you&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;NEVER mind me,&rdquo;  came clearly and coldly from his lips. &ldquo;It is of yourself you must think. Here,  officer!&rdquo; he cried, opening the door again and ushering in a man in plain  clothes, but evidently one of the force. &ldquo;This is the young lady. I accuse her  of taking advantage of her power to open Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s private safe to steal  his jewels. Her confederate has escaped. He had a pistol and I had no means of  stopping him. But she is right here and you will make no mistake in arresting  her. The booty is on her, and smart as she is, she cannot deny that proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With a cry, Grace&rsquo;s hand  went up to her throat.</p>
  <p align="left">Then she settled into  her usual self once more.</p>
  <p align="left">The officer, eyeing her,  asked what she had to say for herself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; was her  low answer. &ldquo;But I shall not say it here. If Mr. Fellows will go with me to  wherever you take people suspected of what you suspect me, I can soon make  plain my position. But first I should like to send for my friend, Mr. Philip  Andrews. He is with the Stickney Company, and he is acquainted with my affairs  and the understanding between Mr. Stoughton and myself by which I have access  to that gentleman&rsquo;s safe and do much of his private business for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Send  for Mr. Andrews if you wish, but you mustn&rsquo;t expect to talk to him without  witnesses. Is that your coat and hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, put them on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Fellows advanced and  whispered something in the officer&rsquo;s ear. Immediately the suspicious look grew  in his eyes, and he watched her every movement with increased care. She saw this  and stepped up to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall not deny having  this piece of jewelry about my person,&rdquo; she said, drawing the bracelet from its  hiding place. &ldquo;The man whom Mr. Fellows calls my confederate gave it to me and  I took it; but it will be hard for him or any one else to prove that it is a  theft, harder than it will be for me to prove who is the real culprit here and  the man whom you ought to arrest. Watch me, but watch him also; he is more  deserving of your close attention than I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her disdain, her poise,  the beauty which came out on her face when she was  greatly stirred, gave her a striking appearance at that moment. The officer  stared, then followed her glance toward Mr. Fellows. What he saw in him made  him thoughtful. Turning back to Miss Lee, he said kindly enough, &ldquo;Will you let  me have that bracelet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She passed it over and  he thrust it in his pocket.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will  go first. In a few minutes follow me and go down Nassau Street. A carriage will  be at the curb. Take it. As for Mr. Fellows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot leave till  some of the clerks come in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We will all wait till a  clerk comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Fellows paled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here is one now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The door opened and  Philip Andrews came in.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700541h-images/page144.png" width="452" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Philip!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is this? What have  you done among you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was no wonder he  asked. At sight of him Grace Lee had fainted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter </b><b>19<br>
&ldquo;So  that was your motive&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">TWO hours later  Grace was explaining herself. She was still pale, but very calm now, though a  little sad. The sadness was not occasioned by any doubt she felt about her  father. She had telephoned home and learned that he had arrived there and was  well, and had nothing but good to say of his captors. No, there was another  cause for her manifest depression, a cause not disconnected with Philip, toward  whom her eyes ever and anon stole with an uneasy appeal which her mother would  have been troubled to see. But it comforted Fellows, who began to regard her  threats as idle in face of the evidence of her complicity as afforded by the  concealed bracelet.</p>
  <p align="left">The officer on duty was  questioning her. Had she done this and that? Yes, she had. Why? Then she told  her story&mdash;the story you have already read. As she proceeded with it, every eye  sparkled under the graphic tale, and the police, who had some acquaintance with  Beau Johnson, recognized his hand in all that she told. One face only wore a  sneer, and that was Fellows&rsquo;s. But no sneer could discredit a story told with  such vim and straightforward earnestness. As she mentioned the emptying of the  office, each person present turned and gave him a look. The manager had  undertaken a piece of work too big for him. His explanations of the presence of  the graphophone in this inner office were feeble and contradictory.</p>
  <p align="left">But he had his revenge,  or thought he had, when she came to the jewels. She had  pointed them out, but only to save a worse disaster. Injury to her father? &ldquo;Yes,  and&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and her voice thrilled. &ldquo;In one of the secret drawers,&rdquo; she  continued, &ldquo;there was an immense amount of currency in large denominations, the  loss of which would cripple the business, if not bankrupt Mr. Stoughton. His  hand was feeling its way along the face of this drawer. In another moment he  would have discovered the tiny knob by the manipulation of which this drawer opens.  To save the struggle which would have ensued, I directed his attention  elsewhere. I don&rsquo;t believe I did wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you accepted one of  these articles as your share. Do you believe you did right in this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I will not mention  the smallness of the share, for that makes the portion  saved for the owner of little account. Yet that portion is saved. I wish it had  been a larger one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No doubt. So that was  your motive&mdash;to save this souvenir for Mr. Stoughton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Casting a proud look at  Philip, she moved a step nearer to the table on which the bracelet lay. &ldquo;Will  you be good enough,&rdquo; she asked her interrogator, &ldquo;to take up that bracelet and  read the initials on the inner side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;R. S. T.,&rdquo; read the  official.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does any one here know  Mrs. Stoughton&rsquo;s maiden name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Evidently not, for all  remained silent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does any one here know  my mother&rsquo;s maiden name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Philip started.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I do.  Her name was Rhoda Selden Titus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p align="left">&ldquo;R. S. T.,&rdquo;  smiled Grace. &ldquo;This bracelet was my mother&rsquo;s. Mr. Stoughton allowed me to place  this keepsake and some other valuables of mine in his private safe. Gentlemen, the whole of those jewels were mine&mdash;my sole and only  fortune. I was keeping them for&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes stole toward Philip&mdash;&ldquo;for my marriage  portion, the secret and great surprise I had planned for my future husband.  They are worth some five thousand dollars&mdash;my mother was the daughter of a  wealthy man. They would have given us a home if I could have kept them; they  would also have given my husband a start in business, and this I should have  preferred, but I could not let Mr. Stoughton&rsquo;s securities be endangered, and so  they had to go. Philip, cannot you forgive me when you think that it was  through my folly the secret of the safe became known?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I forgive you?&rdquo; He  could not show his feelings, but his eyes were eloquent; so were Fellows&rsquo;s; so  were those of the various officials.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can prove these  statements, Miss Lee?&rdquo; asked one.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p align="left">Then they turned to  Fellows.</p>

&ldquo;A  jewel of far greater value&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="left">GRACE never got  back her jewels. The wily Johnson was not caught, though Fellows turned state&rsquo;s  evidence and did all he could to have the professional netted in the same  manner as himself. But she did not suffer from this loss. When Mr. Stoughton  learned the full particulars of this daring robbery, he made good to her the  value of those jewels, and the prosperity of this young couple was secured. He  was even present at the wedding. Grace wore her mother&rsquo;s bracelet, but on her  breast was a jewel of far greater value. On its back was engraved,</p>
<p align="center">To brave G. L.<br>
  &nbsp;From her grateful friend, T. S.</p>
