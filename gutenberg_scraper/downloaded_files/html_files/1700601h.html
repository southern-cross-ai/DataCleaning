    The Ghoul</b></h2>
  <p>I  THINK it is Lord Beaconsfield who, in one of his brilliant stories, makes the  clever observation that &ldquo;adventures are to the adventurous,&rdquo; and certainly he  who seeks for adventures even in this prosaic nineteenth century will surely  succeed in his quest. Fate leads him, chance guides him, luck assists him, and  although the adventure supplied by this trinity of circumstances may be neither  so dangerous nor so picturesque as in the time of Borgia or Lazun, still it  will probably be interesting, which after all is something to be grateful for  in this eminently commonplace age of facts and figures. Still, even he who  seeks not to prove the truth of Disraeli&rsquo;s aphorism, may, after the principle  of Mahomet&rsquo;s mountain, have the adventure come to him, without the trouble of  looking for it, and this was my case at Verona in the summer of 18&mdash;. </p>
  <p>The  Cranstons were always a poor family, that is, as regards money, although they  certainly could not complain of a lack of ancestors; and when it came to my  turn to represent the race, I found that my lately deceased father had left me  comparatively nothing. Not having any fixed income, I therefore could not live  without doing something to earn my bread; and not having any business capacity,  I foresaw failure would be my lot in mercantile enterprise. I was not good looking  enough to inveigle a wealthy heiress into matrimony; and as, after a survey of  my possessions, I found I had nothing but a few hundred pounds and an excellent  baritone voice, I made up my mind to use the former in cultivating the latter  with a view to an operatic career.</p>
  <p>Italy,  living on the traditions of the days of Rossini, of Donizetti and of Bellini,  has still the reputation of possessing excellent singing-masters, so to Italy I  went with a hopeful heart and a light purse, and established myself at Milan;  where I took lessons, in singing, from Maestro Angello. Milan is a detestable  city, hot and arid in summer, cold and humid in winter; and as a year after I  arrived in the land of song the end of spring was unusually disagreeable,  Maestro Angello went to Verona for a change of air, and thither I followed him  with no small pleasure at escaping from that dreary commercial capital of the  north which has all the disagreeables of Italian life without any of the  compensating advantages of romance and beauty.</p>
  <p>But  Verona! ah, it was truly delightful, that sleepy town lying so peacefully on  the banks of the rapid Adige, dreaming amid the riotous present of the splendid  past, when Can Grande held his brilliant court, and received as an honoured  guest the great poet Dante, exiled by ungrateful Florence. The city of the gay  rhymer Catullus, merry lover of Lesbia, who wept more tears over her sparrow  than she did over her poet. The city of Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers  as they were, who were recompensed for their short, unhappy lives by gaining  immortality from the pen of Shakespeare as types of eternal love and eternal  constancy, for the encouragement of all succeeding youths and maidens of later  generations. Yes, indeed, with all these memories, historical and poetical,  Verona was a pleasant place in which to idle away a summer, so I thanked the  kind gods for my good fortune and enjoyed myself.</p>
  <p>Not  that I was idle. By no means! Maestro Angello kept me hard at work at exercises  and scales, so I studied industriously most of the day and wandered about most  of the night in the soft, cool moonlight, when Verona looked much more romantic  than in the garish blaze of the Italian sun.</p>
  <p>It  was on one of these nights that an adventure happened to me, an adventure in  which I was involved by the merest chance, although I confess that the vice of  curiosity had a good deal to do with my entanglement therein.</p>
  <p>After  dining at the hotel I went out for my customary stroll, and having lighted a  pipe as a preventive against the evil odours which seem inseparable from all  Italian towns, I wandered on through the deserted streets in a listless,  aimless fashion, contrasting in my own mind the magnificent Verona of the past  with the dismal Verona of the present. Taken up with these fantastic dreamings,  I did not notice particularly where I was going, or how quickly the time was  passing, until I found myself on the Ponte Aleardi&mdash;that iron bridge which spans  the Adige&mdash;and heard the church bells chiming the hour of eleven.</p>
  <p>The  moon was shining in the darkly blue sky amid the brilliant stars, and the  leaden waters of the river shone like a band of steel in the pale, silvery  light. On either side of the stream lowered dark masses of houses, from the  windows of which gleamed here and there orange-coloured lights, while against  the clear sky arose the tall steeples of the churches and the serrated outlines  of full-foliaged trees. It was wonderfully beautiful, and the soft wind blowing  through the night, rippled the swift waters to lines of ever-vanishing white;  so leaning over the balustrade of the bridge, I dreamed and smoked, and smoked  and dreamed, until the chiming of the half-hour warned me to return to my  hotel.</p>
  <p>The  night, however, was so beautiful and cool, that I could not but think of my hot  sleeping-chamber with repugnance, and feeling disinclined for rest, I made up  my mind to stroll onward for some time. </p>
  <p>I  might have visited that fraudulent tomb of Juliet in the moonlight, but as I  had already seen it by day, and could not feel enthusiastic about such a  palpable deception, I refused to be further victimised, and crossed over the  bridge to the left shore of the river.</p>
  <p>It  was somewhat solitary, there, but I was not afraid of robbers, as I had but  little money and no jewellery on me, and moreover I felt that, should occasion  arise, I could use my fists sufficiently well to protect myself. Being thus at  ease regarding my personal safety, I lighted a cigar which luckily happened to  be in my pocket, and wandered on until I came within sight of the cemetery.</p>
  <p>Now  I firmly believe that every one has in him a vein of superstition which is  developed in accordance with his surroundings. Place a man at midday in a  bustling city, and he scoffs at the idea of the supernatural; but let him find  himself at midnight alone on a solitary moor, with the shadows of moonlight on  every side, and all his inherent superstition will start to life, peopling the  surrounding solitude with unseen phantoms, more terrible than those of the  Arabian Nights. Whether it was the time of night, or the proximity of the  burial-ground, I do not know, but I felt my breast fill with vague fears, and  hastened to leave the uncanny spot as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Fate,  however, was against me, for in my blind speed, instead of crossing the bridge,  I turned to the left, and unexpectedly found myself in the vicinity of another  burial-ground. It was apparently much older than the one I had first seen, and  there was a ruined wall around it, overtopped by tall, melancholy cypresses,  looming black and funereal against the midnight sky. By this time I had  recovered my nerve, and feeling somewhat ashamed of my former ignominious  flight, I determined to punish myself by entering this antique abode of the  dead, and examining it thoroughly.</p>
  <p>With  this idea I climbed over a portion of the broken wall, and in the shadow of the  cypress-trees &mdash;shadow dense as the darkness of Egypt&mdash;I viewed the mournful  scene before me, with mingled feelings of curiosity and dread.</p>
  <p>It  was evidently very old, for even under the softening light of the moon, the  near tombs looked discoloured and timeworn. I saw the soft swell of the green  turf, betokening graves, upon which grew the grass long and rank; the milky  gleam of slender white columns, broken at the top to typify the short lives of  those who slept below; and while yonder, in frowning grey stone, stood a solemn  pyramid, built in imitation of those Egyptian monsters by the Nile, here, near  at hand, a miniature temple of white marble, delicate and fragile in  construction, hinted at the graceful architecture of Greece. Among these myriad  tombs arose the slender, lance-shaped cypress-trees, and their dark forms  alternating with gleaming crosses of white marble, sombre pyramids, classic  temples, and innumerable lines of tall columns, gave to this singular scene the  aspect of a visionary city of the dead, which had become visible to mortal eyes  by the enchantments of the moon.</p>
  <p>Fascinated  by the weirdness of this solitude, I let my cigar fall to the ground, and,  hidden in the gloom of the cypress-trees, stared long and earnestly at this  last abode of the old Veronese, when suddenly my hair bristled at the roots, a  cold sweat broke out on my forehead, and a nervous shudder made my frame  tremble as if with ague.</p>
  <p>The  cause of this sudden fear was that, while wrapt in contemplation of this  desolate necropolis, I heard a laugh, a low, wicked laugh, which seemed to come  from the bowels of the earth. It was now nearly midnight, that hour when the  dead are said to come forth and wander among the living, whose nightly sleep so  strangely mocks the semblance of that still repose which chains these spectres  to their tombs during the day. This idea pierced my brain like a knife, and for  the moment, under the influence of the hour, the ghastly scene, the evil laugh,  I believed that I was about to witness this terrible resurrection. I tried to  turn and fly, but my limbs were paralyzed, and like a statue of stone I stood  there rooted to the earth, feeling as if I were under the influence of some  horrible nightmare.</p>
  <p>Again  I heard that wicked laugh, and this time it seemed to come from a tomb near me,  a square block of gray stone, in the centre of which was an iron door,  evidently the entrance to some vault. Beside this portal stood a life-sized  figure in white marble of the Angel of Death, guarding the entrance with a flaming  sword, the undulating blade of which seemed, to my startled eye, to waver  against the blackness of the door. All round this strange tomb the grass grew  long and thick, but, half veiled by the tangled herbage, star-shaped flowers  glimmered in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>In  another moment I would have fled, when for the third time I heard the evil  laugh, the iron-door of the tomb slowly opened, and a dark figure appeared on  the threshold. The sight was so terrifying that I tried to mutter a prayer,  feeling at the time as firm a belief in the visitation of the dead as any old  woman; but my throat was so dry that I could do nothing but remain silent in my  hiding-place and stare at this ghoul, vampire, wraith, or whatever it was,  leaving its tomb.</p>
  <p>To  add to the horror of the situation, the moon had obscured herself behind a  thick cloud, and there was now a deep darkness over all the graveyard, a  darkness in which I could see nothing, and only hear the faint sigh of the  wind, the rustle of the dry grasses, and the loud beating of my heart.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  I felt that this creature of the night was passing near me, and in abject  terror I shrank back against the rough trunk of the tree under which I was  standing. I heard nothing in the still night, I saw nothing in the thick  darkness; but I felt it pass, by that sixth sense which is possessed by those  who have highly strung nerves. In another moment the moon emerged from behind  the clouds in all her splendour, and the burst of light gave me courage, for  without considering the danger, either material or immaterial, I rushed quickly  towards the broken wall, in which direction I judged this unseen ghoul had  gone.</p>
  <p>The  white moonlight flooded the whole space between the burial-ground and the  river, so that I saw clearly this figure walking quickly away in the direction  of the Ponte Aleardi. It was draped in a long black cloak with a monkish hood,  and with its trailing, noiseless garments it seemed to glide along in the  moonlight like a shadow.</p>
  <p>I  had been so quick in my pursuit that it was only a little distance away, and as  I peered cautiously over the broken wall it paused for a moment, and, throwing  back its hood, looked towards the place where I was hiding. The space between  us was so small and the moonlight so lustrous that I could see the face and  head plainly rising from amid the dark drapery.</p>
  <p>The  face was that of a woman, a beautiful woman with full crimson lips, large dark  eyes, and great masses of reddish-coloured hair, for even in the cold moonlight  I could see the warm, bronze glint of her tresses. One hand, slender and white,  clasped the dark robe to her breast, and she looked towards the darkness of the  broken wall as if she knew that some one had seen her terrible resurrection. On  her delicate features there was a cold, stern look, like that of the ancient  Medusa, and truly I felt as if I were turning into stone before the cruel glare  of those eyes which seemed to pierce the gloom in which I lay hid. It will be  said that I describe somewhat minutely the appearance of this ghoul, seeing  that I only beheld her for a moment in the pale, uncertain gleam of the moon;  but so close was she to the wall, and so highly strung were my nerves by the  weirdness of the situation, that the sudden apparition of this creature of the  night photographed itself indelibly on my brain.</p>
  <p>At  last she seemed satisfied with her gazing at the burial-ground from whence she  had emerged, and, again drawing her hood over her face, glided rapidly away  towards the Ponte Aleardi. Moved by curiosity and supernatural fear, I  determined to follow this spectre and find out where she was going, so without  a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I jumped down, and, keeping in the shadow of the wall,  stole after her noiselessly and swiftly.</p>
  <p>Who  was she? Some unhappy ghost of antique Verona, who had committed one of those  terrible crimes invented by Lucrezia Borgia, and who was condemned by God to  nightly revisit the scene of her former splendour as a punishment for her evil  life? Some ghoul who left the feast of the dead in order to prey upon the  living? Some vampire, lusting for blood hastening towards the sleeping city to  select her victim and drain him of his life-blood? All the wild, weird tales  which I had heard recurred to my memory; all the terrible legends of Brittany,  of the East, of Spain, and of the savage North. The memories of witches rifling  the dead for their unholy needs, of wizards holding orgies in lonely  churchyards, of magicians evoking the silent tenants of the grave by powerful  spells, and of demons entering the bodies of the newly dead in order to roam  the midnight world&mdash;all these gruesome ideas surged in my brain like the  delirium of fever.</p>
  <p>My  fear had passed away. I felt intensely curious to know the errand upon which  this woman was bent, and, with all my faculties sharpened by danger, I sped  swiftly after this flying spectre, which, looking neither to right nor left,  glided rapidly onward towards the sleeping city of Verona. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    A Boccaccian Adventure</b></h2>
  <p>Italian  towns are very perplexing to strangers. Keep to the principal thoroughfares  built in modern days, and you may have a reasonable hope of finding your way  about; but once get enmeshed in the crooked, harrow, winding streets of the  period of the middle ages and you are lost. The Italians, like Nature, delight  in curves, and these narrow alleys, with cobble-stone pavements and no  side-walks, dignified by the name of streets, twist in and out, and here and  there, between forbidding houses, seven or eight stories in height, under heavy  archways, which threaten to fall and crush the unwary stranger, and down steep  flights of worn steps, until you become quite bewildered by the labyrinthian  windings. Then these houses are built high in order to exclude the burning sun  from the alleys, and a cold, humid feeling pervades the entire network of  streets; so that what with the gloom, the twistings, and the treacherous  pitfalls in dark corners, one feels like Orpheus going down to Hades in search  of lost Eurydice.</p>
  <p>Having  been warned of the difficulty of exploring these unknown depths, I had mostly  confined my wanderings to the broad, modern streets and the populous piazzas;  therefore as long as my spectre guide kept to the Via Pallone, which begins at  the Ponte Aleardi and ends at the Piazza Vittoria Emanuele, I felt quite safe.  When, however, after leaving the Piazza she plunged into the narrow streets of  the medieval period, I hesitated at first to follow her. I did not know my way,  I was a stranger, and unarmed; moreover, I knew not into what unknown dangers I  might be led by this mysterious woman who had emerged from the graveyard.</p>
  <p>Curiosity,  however, prevailed over fear, and as at any moment I might lose sight of her,  and thereby never discover if she were of this or the other world, I followed  her boldly into the intense gloom into which she had vanished. My eyes could  hardly pierce the darkness, and I feared I would not be able to keep her in  sight, when luckily, a portion of her cloak became disarranged, and I saw the  vivid glimmer of a white dress, on which I kept my eyes fastened as a guiding  star.</p>
  <p>Here  and there in the houses, lights were burning dimly, but the hour being late, no  people were in the streets; and as I followed this noiseless phantom along the  solitary alleys, with the dark houses on either hand, and the white gleam of  the moonlit sky above, I felt as if I were moving in a dream.</p>
  <p>Onward  she glided, turning down here, climbing up there, until my feet were weary with  walking; and besides, not knowing the way, I stumbled frequently, which gave me  many a bruise. The darkness, however, seemed no obstacle to the ghoul, who  walked onward as rapidly as if she were still in the moonlight; on the  contrary, it was only by the greatest care that I could grope my way  sufficiently quickly to keep her in sight, and prevent her from discovering me  by my frequent stumbles.</p>
  <p>I  was about to give up the chase in despair, when suddenly she led me out on to a  small square, and hastening across it, disappeared into a palace at the further  end. I remained in the alley until she vanished, as I feared if I followed her  too closely she might perceive me in the moonlight. The place, which occupied  the whole of one side of the square, was a richly decorated building, with a  great arched portal in the centre; but I had no time to examine it closely,  for, fearful of losing my ghoul, I ran quickly across the square, came to the  portal, and was stopped by an iron gate.</p>
  <p>It  was one of those heavy iron gates common to Italian palaces, which stretching  across from wall to wall, afford a view of the inner court, and are only open  on festive occasions, or to admit vehicles. I knew that entrance was ordinarily  afforded by a side door, and without doubt this was the way she had gone,  unless indeed, being supernatural, she found bolts and bars no hindrance. Determined  to pursue this strange adventure to the end, I sought the side door, but, on  finding it, discovered to my vexation that it was locked. I could not enter  that way, and the bars of the iron gate were so close together, that a man of  my size could not possibly squeeze through them, so to all appearances the  adventure, as far as I was concerned, was finished.</p>
  <p>Making  one last effort, however, I felt all the iron bars singly, to see if any one  was loose, in which case I could remove it and thus slip through; when to my  astonishment, on the left side of the gate furthest from the door, I found that  one of the bars had been wrenched away. Without waiting to consider this, which  was curious to say the least of it, I concluded that the woman, if indeed she were  flesh and blood, had entered by this breach in the gate, so at once took  advantage of my discovery and soon found myself in the courtyard. The palace  appeared to be quite deserted as the windows were all broken, and the ironwork  of the balconies which ran round the four sides of the courtyard, at different  heights, was twisted out of all shape; besides which, the mosaic pavement upon  which I stood was smashed in several places, and grass grew between the  interstices. I could see all this plainly in the moonlight, and, moreover, as a  great door at the end of the courtyard opposite the iron gate was slightly  ajar, while all the other smaller doors were closed, I came to the conclusion  that the ghoul had gone in there. My conjecture proved correct, for as hiding  in the shadow, I peered into the gloom of the building, I saw the sudden flare  of a torch which the woman had just fired, and with this in her hand she began  to climb up a flight of steps&mdash;at least, so I judged from seeing the torch rise  higher and higher in the darkness until it vanished altogether.</p>
  <p>The  lightning of the torch made me believe that I had to do with flesh and blood,  as certainly no phantom would use natural ways and means in preference to  supernatural; so directly the light disappeared, I stole cautiously across what  appeared to be a large hall, grasping my walking-stick tightly in case of any  surprise. I could not disguise from myself that my curiosity had led me into a  very perilous adventure, but, as since the affair of the torch I had quite  recovered my nerve, I went resolutely forward, and, feeling my way carefully in  the dark, climbed up the staircase.</p>
  <p>At  the first turning of the ascent all was still in darkness, but on taking the  second turning I saw the torch gleaming like a fierce yellow star in the gloom  of a long corridor. Luckily I had very light, thin shoes on, and trod  cautiously, otherwise the echo of my footsteps would most surely have betrayed  me to the mysterious torch-bearer. The palace was certainly not inhabited, as I  heard nothing to support such a belief; but as I hastened along the wide  corridor, through the windows on the left side streamed the pale moonlight, and  I saw that the glass in these windows was painted to represent coats-of-arms,  so without doubt this deserted mansion had once been the residence of some  great Veronese noble.</p>
  <p>But  what was the ghoul doing here? Why had she come from her vault in the  churchyard to this neglected habitation? Again the fear seized me that this  creature was a phantom of some splendid lady of the middle ages, come to  revisit the scenes or her antique magnificence, The cold air as I passed along  seemed full of the strange perfume of sandalwood, and this sensuous odour in  conjunction with the flitting torch, the coloured shadows cast on the floor by  the moonlight streaming in through the painted windows, and the state of  nervous excitement in which I was, all made me feel like the hero of one of  those amorous adventures which are described in the glowing pages of Boccaccio.</p>
  <p>Once  more the torch disappeared round a corner to the left, but in a moment I had it  again in sight; another flight of shallow steps, another short corridor, and at  the end an arched door, through which the phantom disappeared. At the door I  paused to consider what I should do next, as, if I rashly entered the room, I  might pay for my temerity with my life; so I stood irresolutely at the  half-open door, ready to fly at the least sign of danger.</p>
  <p>As  I stood at the door in the intense gloom, for there were no windows in this  corridor, I saw a faint glimmer of light in the room within, and this light  remaining stationary for some considerable time, I judged that the lady of the  sepulchre had left the torch there and retired into some inner chamber.  Resolving, therefore, to risk the attempt, I peered into the apartment, and saw  the torch stuck in a socket made in a small table in the centre of this small  hall, which was hung with ancient tapestry. At the end opposite the portal  through which I was looking, was an opening draped with heavy red curtains  embroidered with gold, for every now and then as they stirred I saw the dull  glitter of the tarnished metal.</p>
  <p>Determined  not to be discovered, I thought it a capital plan to hide between the tapestry  and the wall, so as to secure good concealment, and then steal along the walls  until I arrived at the curtained opening, through which I hoped to be able to  see into the room beyond. Just as I made up my mind to put this plan into  practice, the torch, which had been burning very low, flickered and went out,  so that the hall was in complete darkness. In the gloom, however, rays of  bright light shone through the embroidered curtains. I heard the murmur of  voices, and then the sharp, clear notes of a mandolin. The ghoul evidently had  some one with her, perhaps the unfortunate individual whom she proposed to  devour; so as no time was to be lost, I slipped into the apartment, ensconced  myself between the tapestry and the wall on the left of the door, and prepared  to creep along, if possible, to the curtained archway. While I paused a moment  to regain breath and courage, for certainly the situation was not without an  element of danger, the metallic notes of the mandolin ceased and a man&rsquo;s voice  began singing some Italian song, but one with which, in spite of my knowledge  of music, I was not acquainted. It was a slow and sensuous melody of passionate  sweetness with an undercurrent of sadness, and the singer had a remarkably fine  tenor voice, sounding full and rich even through the heavy curtains, which  prevented me hearing the words clearly. Evidently this was an amorous  rendezvous, but why was it taking place in this deserted palace, and why had  the lady come from a vault in a graveyard to keep it?</p>
  <p>All  at once the singer stopped abruptly in the middle of a phrase, I heard the  mandolin suddenly smashing on the marble floor, and then sounded the low,  wicked laugh I had first heard at the burial-ground. Filled with anxiety to  learn the meaning of all these strange events, I glided rapidly along the wall,  and speedily arrived at the curtained opening. Being afraid to pull it to one  side lest I should be discovered, I took out my penknife and made a slit in the  heavy embroidery; then, looking through the opening thus obtained, I beheld a  most extraordinary spectacle.</p>
  <p>A  circular chamber, not very large, but very lofty, surrounded by eight  half-pillars of veined white marble built into the wall, and supporting a domed  ceiling richly painted with garlands of flowers, from amid which peered the  smiling faces of beautiful women. Between these noble pillars hung voluminous  draperies of darkly red velvet, all magnificently embroidered with fantastic  designs in tarnished gold thread, but, curiously enough, the apartment had no  windows, neither in the ceiling nor at the sides, so whatever took place within  could not be seen save through the curtained archway.</p>
  <p>In  the centre of the white marble floor stood a low, heavy table, richly gilt, and  covered with the remains of a splendid feast. The gorgeousness of the vessels  thereon was truly marvellous, consisting, as they did, of elaborately chased  silver epergnes filled with brilliantly-coloured fruits; many-branched  candelabra of gold, bearing slender wax tapers to illuminate the apartment;  gracefully carved jugs, of wonderful designs which must have emanated from the  brains of Cellini himself; and strangely shaped antique goblets which put me in  mind of the sacramental cups used in Italian churches at the celebration of the  mass. The voluptuous scent of sandalwood pervaded the heavy atmosphere of the  chamber; gold and silver and crystal shone in the mellow light of the myriad  tapers, and the whole appearance of this sensuous banquet was like those of  former ages presided over by Can Grande or splendour-loving Caesar Borgia. I  thought I was in dreamland, the more so when I saw the bizarre costumes worn by  the two occupants of the room.</p>
  <p>One  was the lady I had followed from the graveyard, who, having thrown off her  heavy cloak, now appeared in a white silk dress of antique cut, richly  embroidered with gold. Round her slender neck she wore an old-fashioned  necklace of superb rubies, set in silver, which flashed forth crimson flame  with every heave of her snowy bosom, while strings of soft-shining pearls were  twisted in her magnificent red hair; an Eastern girdle of gold fretwork  encircled her waist, and broad gold bracelets radiant with gems clasped her  milk-white arms. The profusion of jewels she wore scintillated with her every  motion, throwing out sparks of many-coloured fire, and she looked like one of  those proud dames of Venice who smile so haughtily in the pictures of Titian.  But her face! Oh, heavens! what a beautiful, cruel, relentless face!&mdash; the  tigerish look in the splendid eyes, the wicked laugh of the full red lips! Was  she truly a woman, or some fiend sent upon earth to lure men to hell by the  fascination of her evil beauty?</p>
  <p>If  the woman was curiously dressed for modern days, her companion, a handsome  young man of seven-and-twenty was still more so, as he wore a doublet of  pale-blue velvet slashed with white satin and diapered with gold embroidery; a  small ruff round his neck; high riding-boots of black leather, reaching to the  thigh, with gilt spurs; and a short mantle of azure silk, which drooped  gracefully from his shoulders. He had no rapier, but at his girdle hung a small  poniard, the handle of which was thickly encrusted with gems, and on the  velvet-covered chair beside him lay a large cloak and a small mask of black  velvet. I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself to see if I were really awake, for  the whole fantastic scene looked like one of those which had doubtless taken  place at Verona in the opulent days of her splendour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am mad, asleep, or intoxicated,&rdquo; I thought, as I looked at this Boccaccian  feast, at these Boccaccian lovers. &ldquo;What does it mean? This must be the phantom  of Lucrezia Borgia, who has risen from the tomb to meet one of her dead lovers  and renew for a time the joys of the past. Oh! I am mad or asleep. I will wake  up and find this is all a dream&mdash;some fantasy of the brain created by the  delirium of fever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Between  the lovers lay the broken mandolin, and the woman, pointing to this, talked  volubly while the young man stood listening with a scornful smile on his lips.  Not being a very good Italian scholar, I could not follow all this rapid talk  without great difficulty, but from what I could gather it seemed to me that the  phantom of Lucrezia Borgia was accusing her lover of infidelity. At length,  when she seemed exhausted, he caught up his mantle and mask as if about to go,  but she fell prostrate before him, and seemed to implore him to stay. He shook  his head, and then springing to her feet in anger, she snatched the poniard  from his belt and tried to strike him. The young man warded off the thrust with  his left arm, round which was wrapped his heavy black cloak, whereupon she let  the dagger fall and began to beseech him again. I could not understand the  meaning of this terrible dumb-show any more than I could the curious dresses,  the antique chamber or the deserted palace. It was the phantasmagoria of a  dream seen by the soft light of the tapers, and my brain being quite upset by  the strange events of the night, I entirely forgot the nineteenth century, and  seemed to live, to breathe, to tremble, on the threshold of one of those fatal  chambers wherein the Medici, the Scaligers and the Borgias feasted, loved,  betrayed, and slew their friends, their lovers, and their enemies.</p>
  <p>The  woman, evidently seeing it was useless, stopped beseeching the young man, upon,  which he picked up his dagger, and throwing, the fold of his cloak over his  right shoulder, advanced towards the door without saying good-bye to the lady.  I withdrew quickly, fearful of discovery, when, just as his hand was on the  curtains, her voice sounded once more, slow and deliberate, so that I was able  to understand what she said:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you leave me for ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  he replied with the same deliberation, &ldquo;for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  before you go, let me drink to your future happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  pleasure, madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  appeared to hesitate at first, but after saying these words I heard him move  away from the curtain, upon which I looked again and saw him standing by the  chair, while the woman, with her face turned away, was filling a goblet with  wine. Her back was towards him, so that he could not see what she was doing,  but I could perceive her least action. She filled two goblets with wine, then  taking something from her breast, dropped it into one of them, and, turning  round with a smile, presented the cup to him. It flashed across me that she was  trying to poison her lover, and I would have called out to warn him, but the  extreme peril of my position, the terrible appearance of this woman, and the  uselessness of interference kept me silent during this supreme moment.</p>
  <p>The  young man took the cup she gave him, and drained it with a bow, while she  simply touched her lips with the other goblet, and smiled again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  your future happiness,&rdquo; she said in a significant voice, and set the goblet  down on the table.</p>
  <p>They  talked together after this reconciliation for some time and seemed better  friends than before, but I saw that the woman kept furtively glancing at his  face with a wicked smile on her lips. At length he handed her the mask, which  evidently did not belong to him, and, after kissing her hand, was about to turn  in the direction of the archway, when suddenly he grew pale, put his hand to  his head quickly, and grasped the chair near which he stood to keep  himself&nbsp; from falling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what is this?&rdquo; he cried in a hoarse, strained voice. &ldquo;Gran Dio! what does it  mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bent forward with a wicked laugh, and the rubies flashed forth venomous red  flame in the soft light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means that you have betrayed me and I have revenged myself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked at her with a dazed expression, made a step forward as if to kill this  terrible woman, who, dangling the mask in her hand, stood mocking at his agony  with a cruel smile, then suddenly flung up his hands with a wild cry of despair  and fell at her feet&mdash;dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;  she said, without displaying the least sign of emotion. &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  wished to rush forward and denounce the demon in woman&rsquo;s shape who had so  vilely perpetrated this cold-blooded murder, but, overcome with horror, I  reeled away from the curtain and fell&mdash;fell into the arms of some one who held  me with a powerful grip. I gasped with alarm and was about to call out, when I  felt a handkerchief dashed suddenly over my face wet with some liquid. In spite  of my struggles it was held firmly there, and I gradually felt my senses leave  me until I knew no more.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>When  I came to myself it was early morning, and I was seated on a stone bench in the  Piazza Vittoria Emanuele, surrounded by a group of curious onlookers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  am I?&rdquo; I asked in English.</p>
  <p>No  one answered, and I repeated the question in Italian, upon which a fat woman  spoke up,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor,  you are in the Piazza Vittoria!&rdquo; she said in a husky voice; &ldquo;we found you here  when we came first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the palace, the woman, the poison!&rdquo; I said stupidly, for my head was aching  terribly.</p>
  <p>The  peasants looked at one another with a meaning smile and shook their heads. I  saw that they thought I had been drinking, so, giving a piece of money to the  fat woman who had spoken, I took my way at once to my hotel, which I reached in  a state of bewilderment better imagined than described. </p>

    The Feast Of Ghosts</b></h2>
  <p>WAS  it a dream? Common sense said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; My bruises said &ldquo;No!&rdquo; But certainly the  whole affair was most remarkable, and quite out of the ordinary kind of events  which take place in this prosaic nineteenth century. We have done with those  romantic episodes in which the heroes and heroines of Boccaccio, Le Sage and M.  Dumas p&egrave;re take part, and in the searching light of the Press lantern, which is  nowadays turned on all things and on all men, it is impossible to encounter  those strange events of the middle ages. Judging from my experiences of the  previous night I had been entangled in a terrible intrigue, which might have  taken place under Henri Troisor Lorenzo di Medici, yet, as the past can never  become the present, the whole affair was a manifest anachronism. I was inclined  to think that I had been the sport of some Italian Puck, but as there are no  fairies nowadays, such an idea was absurd, so the only feasible explanation of  the bizarre occurrence was that I had been dreaming.</p>
  <p>I  had certainly gone to the old burial-ground and had seen the phantom of  Lucrezia Borgia emerge from an old Veronese tomb, and as certainly I had  followed her to the Piazza Vittoria Emanuele, but here, without doubt, reality  ended and fiction began. Evidently I had sat down upon the stone bench where I  was discovered by the peasants, and had there fallen asleep to undergo this  extravagant adventure in a vision of the night. In sleep I had dreamed a dream after  the fashion of the Athenian lovers in Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedy, and the antique  chamber, the quaint costumes, and the phantom characters had been idle visions  of the brain, which had played their several parts in this mediaeval  phantasmagoria.</p>
  <p>To  put entirely to one side the impossibility of living people dressing themselves  in rococo costumes in order to play a fantastic comedy-tragedy in a deserted  place, if I had really seen all I imagined, how did I find myself in the Piazza  Vittoria Emanuele at daybreak? The visionary pursuit of the lady of the  sepulchre had been a long one, and I certainly could not have walked back such  a distance to the Piazza without knowing something about it. But memory ceased  at my fainting at the door of the fatal chamber, and revived on my finding  myself on the stone bench in the Piazza; therefore, granting that the whole  adventure had actually occurred, how had I been taken from the deserted palace  to the Piazza?</p>
  <p>Idling  over my midday meal at the Hotel d&rsquo;Este, I thought of the extraordinary series  of events in which I had taken part, and kept puzzling my brain as to whether  they had really occurred or whether I had been the victim of a grotesque  nightmare. I had received a letter from the Maestro Angello, saying he could  not give me my usual lesson, therefore I determined to devote the whole day,  which was thus at my disposal, to finding out the truth or falsehood of this  mysterious adventure.</p>
  <p>My  bruises were very painful, but I doctored myself as I best could, so that  without much difficulty I was able to walk. Doubtless I had received these  bruises whilst pursuing the unknown from the graveyard to the Piazza Vittoria  Emanuele, and thus far I was certain of the actuality of my adventure. With  this idea in my head, I made up my mind to go to the old graveyard and  discover, if possible, who was buried in the tomb from which the ghoul had  emerged. By finding out the name I might possibly ascertain that of the lady,  as there must certainly have been some connection between her and the person  buried in the mysterious vault. No sooner had I thus sketched out my plan of  action than I put it at once into execution, and as I found some difficulty in  walking, I sent for Peppino&rsquo;s fiacre in order to drive to the cemetery.</p>
  <p>Peppino  was a merry little Florentine, whose services I employed for two reasons, one  being that he spoke excellent Italian, so that I understood him easier than I  did the general run of these Northern Italians, who usually gabble a vile  patois which no Englishman can understand without constant practice, and my  acquaintance with the modern Latin tongue was not sufficient to warrant my  indulging in liberties with it; the other reason was that Peppino, having lived  a long time in Verona, knew the town thoroughly, and would be able to tell me  better than any one if such a deserted palace as I had dreamed of really  existed; besides which, he was also a very amusing companion.</p>
  <p>The  fiacre duly arrived, and on going outside I found Peppino grinning like a small  black monkey as he held the door open for me to enter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!&rdquo;  said Peppino in a commiserating tone, seeing how I leaned on my stick, &ldquo;is the  Signor not well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes! quite well, Peppino, only I fell yesterday and hurt myself, so you see I  have to get you to drive me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!&rdquo;  replied Peppino philosophically, mounting the box, &ldquo;the ill of one is the good  of another. To where, Signore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  the cemetery near the Porto Vittoria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  new or the old one, Signore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  old cemetery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  cast a queer look at me over his shoulder, and, muttering something about the &ldquo;mad  English,&rdquo; drove away towards the Via Pallone. As he was on the box-seat, and  the fiacre made a good deal of noise going over the rugged stone pavement, in  addition to the incessant jingling of the bells, I could not question him as I  desired to do, so, making up my mind to wait until I arrived at the graveyard,  I leaned back in the carriage and gave myself up to my own thoughts.</p>
  <p>Then  a curious thing occurred which made me certain that the events of the previous  night had actually taken place, for without the least effort of memory, on my  part the strange melody sung by the young man in the palace came into my head.  I could not possibly have dreamed that, and I could not possibly have composed  the air, so I concluded that I had really heard the song, and, having an  excellent musical ear, it had impressed itself on my memory. Of course I did  not recollect the words, but only the tune, and thinking it might prove useful  as a link in the chain of circumstances, I hummed it over twice or thrice so as  to keep it in my mind.</p>
  <p>I  therefore concluded from this piece of evidence that I had actually been to the  deserted palace and witnessed that strange feast, but if so, how had I found  myself at dawn in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele? It was no use puzzling my  brains any more over this mysterious affair, so the wisest plan would be to  wait until I found out the name on the tomb, and then perhaps Peppino would be  able to tell me about the palace, in which case, with these two facts to go on,  I might hope to discover the meaning of these extraordinary events.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the fiacre had left the Via Pallone, crossed over the Ponte Aleardi, and was now  being driven rapidly along the left bank of the Adige, past the Campo Marzo. We  speedily arrived at the old burial-ground, and Peppino, stopping his horse near  the gate, assisted me to alight from the carriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peppino,&rdquo;  I said, when this was done, &ldquo;tie your horse up somewhere and come with me into  the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Diamine!&rdquo;  replied Peppino, crossing himself with superstitious reverence. &ldquo;I like not  these fields of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  broad daylight, you coward; besides, I wish you to tell me about the tombs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why does not the Signor go to the beautiful new cemetery?&rdquo; said Peppino,  leading his horse to the wall and fastening him to a heavy stone; &ldquo;the statues  there are beautiful. This is old, very old; no one is buried here now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was the last person buried, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;eh, oh, yes, Signore, last year an illustrious was buried in his  own vault, but he was mad. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he have a vault built in such an old cemetery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the vault was old&mdash;as old as the Trezza. All the signori of his family had been  buried there for many days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  the Republic?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  yes, and before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the name of this family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, Signore, I forget!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  come along, Peppino. As you know so much about one tomb, you will probably know  something about another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Command  me, Illustrious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did not enter the burial-ground by the gate, as I wanted to go the same way as  on the previous night, in order to be certain of finding the tomb I was in  search of, so, with some little difficulty, and the help of Peppino, I managed  to climb over the broken wall, and soon found myself in my old hiding-place.  Peppino looked at me with considerable curiosity, as he could not conceive my  object in coming to this dreary locality; but ultimately, shrugging his  shoulders, he put it down to a freak on the part of a mad Englishman, and waited  for me to speak.</p>
  <p>The  tomb looked scarcely less forbidding and gloomy in the daytime than it did at  night, with its massive-looking architecture, and the stern-faced angel  guarding the iron door. Advancing through the long grass which grew all round it,  I looked every where for a name, but could find none, then tried to open the  iron door, to the great dismay of Peppino.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,&rdquo;  he said in a faltering voice, &ldquo;do not let out the ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are no ghosts here, Peppino. They have all departed,&rdquo; I replied, finding the  door locked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, Illustrious. Many dead are in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they&rsquo;ve been dead so long that their ghosts must have grown weary of this  gloomy sepulchre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore, but the ghost of the mad Count buried last year!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  I cried with lively curiosity, &ldquo;is this the vault where he was buried?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Illustrious!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the name, Peppino? What was his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little Italian looked perplexed, as he could not understand the interest I took  in this sepulchre; still, seeing I was in earnest, he tried to think of the  name, but evidently could not recall it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cospetto!  Signore, I have the memory of Beppo, who forgot the mother who bore him; but  the name will be here, Illustrious, for certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  if you can find it, Peppino,&rdquo; I replied, sitting down on a stone near the iron  door. &ldquo;I am anxious to know to whom this tomb belongs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino,  being more conversant with Italian tombs than myself, went to look for the  name, and in a wonderfully short space of time came back with a satisfied smile  on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,  the tomb is that of the Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Morone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore, they were a great family of Verona, as great as the cursed Medici of  my beautiful Florence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this Count, who died last year, was their descendant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  Illustrious, he was the last of them. No father, no brother, no child. He was  the last. Basta, basta!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he a wife?&rdquo; I asked, thinking of the woman who had emerged from this tomb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore, a beautiful wife, but when he died she left Verona for Rome I heard.  She is not now here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  I had found out the name of the family buried in the tomb, and that the wife  was the sole representative of the race, so I naturally thought she was the  only person who would have been able to enter the tomb; although why she did  so, unless it was to pray beside the corpse of her late husband, I could not  understand. Besides, Peppino, who was one of the greatest gossips in the town,  said she had left Verona, so perhaps the midnight visitor was not the Contessa  Morone at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  the Count and Countess an attached couple, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Italian shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  I know not indeed,&rdquo; he replied carelessly; &ldquo;the Signor Conte was certainly mad.  I saw him at times, and he had the evil eye. Diamine! often have I made horns  for that eye, Illustrious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Countess, Peppino? Have you ever seen the Countess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signore! The Conte let her not out. Ah! he was jealous, that madman. He was old  and the Signora was young. Per Bacco! the husband was afraid of the handsome  officers. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  mad and jealous husband, old, too, into the bargain. With such a trinity of  imperfections a young and beautiful woman could hardly be much in love with  him, and, a year after his death, would certainly not have taken the trouble to  pray at his tomb. No! the unknown lady could not possibly have been the Contessa.  Who, then was this mysterious visitant? I had now quite got over my fancy that  she was a spectre, and felt profoundly curious to find out who she was, and why  she had come to this ancient burial place at midnight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there a Palazzo Morone, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  changed colour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know of the Palazzo Morone, Signore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there is one then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Illustrious! It is haunted!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haunted!  Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  Signore, I speak the truth. No one has lived there for the last two hundred  years. It is shut up for the rats and the owls and the spectres of the tomb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  tomb&mdash;this one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Signore, do not jest, I pray you, or the illustrious Signori Morone will hear  us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  looked so serious that I forebore to smile at this absurdity, lest I should  offend his pride and thus lose the story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Peppino, tell me all about this haunted palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  here, Signore, I am afraid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  help me back to the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  obeyed with great alacrity, and, when I was once more in the fiacre, prepared  to loosen his horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Peppino,&rdquo; I said, smiling; &ldquo;the ghosts can&rsquo;t hear us here, so tell me the  story of the Morone.</p>
  <p>Peppino  cast a doubtful glance in the direction of the burial-ground, and then, seating  himself on the step of the carriage, began his story. His Italian, as I have  said before, was very good, so, making him speak slowly, I was easily able to  understand the strange legend he related.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,&rdquo;  he began, with a solemn look on his usually merry face, &ldquo;the Morone were very  famous in Verona four hundred years ago. Dio! they fought with the Scaligers,  and afterwards with the Visconti. They were Podestas of the city before the  Della Scala, and several of them were great Cardinals. One would have been his  Holiness himself, but the Borgia asked him to supper and he died of their  poison. About two hundred years ago Mastino Morone wedded the Donna Renata  della Moneta, who was said to have been descended on the wrong side from Donna  Lucrezia herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean that this Renata was an illegitimate descendant of Lucrezia Borgia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore. Ah! she was a devil of a woman, that Madonna Lucrezia. Ebbene!  Signore. This Donna Renata wedded with Count Mastino Morone, and a pleasant  life she led him, for she loved all other men but him. Cospetto! he would have  strangled her, but he was afraid of her many lovers. There was a room in the  Palazzo Morone, without any windows, where Donna Renata supped with those she  favoured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the room is there still?&rdquo; I said, thinking of that mysterious chamber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  a surety, Signore! It is haunted by the ghost of the Marchese Tisio!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,  he was the last lover of Donna Renata, whom she killed with the Borgia poison  because he was faithless. Eh! it is true, Illustrious. She found out by her  spies that the Marchese loved another, so she asked him to a last feast in her  room, and when he was going she gave him a cup of wine. Dio! he drank it, the  poor young man, and died. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why was he her last lover? Did she repent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signore! The Count Mastino was watching at the door, and when she had killed  the Marchese he went in to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  killed her, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Per  Bacco! Signore, no one knows. She never came out of that room again. The  friends of the poor Tisio found his body, but they never found Donna Renata.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what became of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cospetto!  No one ever found out. Mastino married again and said nothing, but after that  last feast his first wife was never seen again. Diamine! it is strange.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a curious story, Peppino, but it does not explain how the palace is haunted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen,  Illustrious! I will tell,&rdquo; said Peppino in a subdued whisper. &ldquo;The spirits of  the Donna Renata, of the Conte Mastino, and of the Marchese Tisio, haunt the  palace, and in the Month of May, when the crime was committed, the lovers hold  a feast in that secret room while the husband watches at the door. Then the  Donna Renata poisons the Marchese, the husband enters, and cries of pain and  terror are heard. Then the lights go out and all is still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was certainly very curious, for Peppino was describing the very same I had  beheld&mdash;the terrible Renata, the unhappy lover, and the poisoned cup, but the  Count&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me, Peppino, has anyone ever beheld this feast of ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  Signore, the people who lived in the palace were so afraid of the ghosts, that  they left altogether, and no one has lived there for two hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes! but this spectral banquet seems all imagination&mdash;no one has seen it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore. A holy Frate, who did not fear the devil, went one night in May and  saw the feast through the door, but just as the poisoned cup was given, the  ghost of the Conte dragged him away and tried to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and did the ghost succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Illustrious! The Frate made the sign of the cross and called on the Madonna, on  which the ghosts all vanished with loud cries, and the Frate fainted. Next  morning he found himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signore; lying on the floor of the palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was somewhat disappointed at this different ending to the narrative of Peppino,  but it was very extraordinary that my adventure and that of the Frate should be  so similar. It was broad day, I had overcome my superstitious fancies, yet the  whole affair was so strange that I could not help feeling a qualm of fear,  which I tried to laugh off, a proceeding which mightily offended Peppino.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,  it is the truth I tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  I prove it, Peppino. This is the month of May, and no doubt the feast takes  place every night. You will show me the palace, and I will watch at the door of  the secret room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  do not think of it, Illustrious,&rdquo; cried Peppino in alarm; &ldquo;the Frate himself, a  holy priest, was nearly killed, and you, Signore, you are a heretic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,  therefore, liable to be carried off by his Satanic Majesty. You are  complimentary, Peppino. Nevertheless, to-morrow you must show me the palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Illustrious must excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  watch with me for this feast of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio?  the Signore jests!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  indeed, Peppino! I am in sober earnest. We will go to the Palazzo Morone  to-morrow; and now drive back to my hotel, as I feel very tired. Your story has  been very entertaining, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  the Signor does not believe me?&rdquo; said Peppino, getting on the box again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do, Peppino; but I believe your ghostly party can be explained away.&rdquo; </p>

    The Angello Household</b></h2>
  <p>The  bruises I had received during my nocturnal adventure turned out to be worse  than I expected, especially one on the left knee-cap, which quite incapacitated  me from walking; therefore I was forced to remain in the house all day. This  was somewhat annoying, as I was anxious to find out the Palazzo Morone, and see  the chamber of Donna Renata during daylight. I thought also that as the palace  bore such an evil reputation, my lady of the sepulchre would think herself safe  in leaving the dead body of the young man lying in the room, and if I  discovered the corpse I intended to give notice to the authorities of the crime  I had seen committed.</p>
  <p>Unluckily,  however, I had to remain in bed most of the day, and when Peppino came in to  say that his fiacre was at the door I was obliged to send him away, much to his  gratification, as he was by no means anxious to guide me to the haunted palace.  The curious resemblance between my own experience and the legend related by  Peppino had rather startled me; but, being certain that I had to deal with the  natural, and not the supernatural, I was firmly resolved to unravel this  mystery before leaving Verona. To do this every moment was of value, and I  bitterly regretted that my stiff knee kept me confined to the house.  Everything, however, is for the best, and before I saw the Palazzo Morone,  fresh light was thrown upon the events of the night in a most unexpected  manner.</p>
  <p>After  my one day of enforced idleness I was fully determined to seek the conclusion  of my adventure the next, when on the following morning I received a note from  Maestro Angello, asking me to be sure and come to my lesson. As the Maestro was  always annoyed at the non-appearance of a pupil, I judged it wise to go, and  arranged with Peppino to search for the Palazzo Morone in the afternoon. The  lesson would only last an hour, and I would thus have plenty of time to carry  out my intention, as Peppino, knowing the palazzo, would be able to take me  there direct.</p>
  <p>I  felt much better this second day after my adventure, as the pain had quite left  my knee, so having thus arranged my plans for the afternoon, I started in a  very contented frame of mind for the Casa Angello.</p>
  <p>It  was a dreary day, for there are dreary days even in Italy, and at intervals  there fell heavy showers, which made me feel somewhat depressed. Pedestrians  were hurrying along with large umbrellas of the Gamp species, red being the  prevailing colour; and what with the sloppy streets, the gloomy houses, and the  absence of the chattering Italian populace, the whole place looked infinitely  melancholy, so in order to keep up my spirits I hummed the weird air I had  heard in the Palazzo Morone.</p>
  <p>Maestro  Angello lived in a narrow street more like a drain than anything else, and I  entered into a damp courtyard through a dismal little tunnel barred by an iron  gate. The <i>portinaia</i>, who lived in a  glass-fronted room as if she were a unique specimen of the human race preserved  in a case, nodded her head to intimate that the Maestro was at home, so I  climbed up the evil-smelling stone stairs which went up the side of the  courtyard, and soon arrived at Angello&rsquo;s door. Ringing a little bell which  tinkled in a most irritating manner, I was admitted into the dingy ante-chamber  by Petronella, a short, fat, good-natured woman who managed the whole  household, and made a great deal of noise over doing so. She was dressed in an  untidy print gown, with a bright red shawl over her shoulders, and wore wooden  clogs which clattered noisily on the terra-cotta floor. Her plenteous hair was  roughly twisted into a knot and stuck through with large brass pins, which gave  her a spiky appearance about the head. This curious apparition saluted me with  a jolly smile in a gruff voice, with the usual familiarity of Italian  servants,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sta  bene! Signore. Ah, the Maestro! povero Maestro!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with him, Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Signore, he cannot live much longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Angello was considerably over eighty years of age I thought this highly  probable, but was about to condole with Petronella over his illness, when she  saved me the trouble of a reply by bursting out into a long speech delivered  with much dramatic effect:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is nothing but trouble, Signore. Such a fine young man, and the piccola loved  him so! It will surely place the Maestro among the saints. Four masses for his  soul, Signore; and those priests are such thieves. I said &lsquo;No lesson,&rsquo; but the  Maestro is a mule for having his own way. Let him teach, say I; it will divert  his mind! There, Signore, go in with you! But I always thought it would come;  four times I heard the cock crowing, a bad sign, as Saint Peter knew. There,  there! the Madonna aid us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Not  understanding in the least what Petronella was talking about, I allowed myself  to be pushed mechanically into the inner room in a state of bewilderment. The  Maestro, seated in his usual chair, was waiting for me, and his granddaughter,  Bianca, who assisted him in his lessons, was looking out of the window at the  falling rain. An atmosphere of sadness seemed to pervade the dull, grey room,  and as Bianca advanced to meet me I saw that her eyes were red with crying,  while old Angello stared at her in a listless, indifferent manner, being so old  as to be past all sympathetic feelings. .</p>
  <p>He  was a mere mummy, this old man who had been celebrated as a teacher of singing  in the days of Pasta and Malibran; a faint shadow of his former self, only kept  alive by the mechanical exercise of his art. Yet, in spite of his great age,  his ear was wonderfully keen and true; the sense of hearing, from continuous  cultivation, being the only one which had survived the wreck of his faculties,  and with the assistance of Bianca, he was still enabled to teach his wonderful  system in an intelligible manner. Many of his pupils had been European  celebrities on the operatic stage during the past fifty years, and his rooms in  Milan were crowded with souvenirs of famous artists of undying fame. His  children, and, with the exception of Bianca, his grandchildren, were all dead;  his friends and acquaintances and the generation that knew him had all passed  away; but this Nestor of lyrical art still survived, alone and sad, amid the  ruins of his past. White-haired, wrinkled, blear-eyed, silent, he sat daily in  his great armchair, taking but little notice of the life around him, save to  ask childish questions or talk about some dead-and-gone singer whose fame had  once filled the world; but place a baton in his hand, strike the piano, lift  the voice, and this apparent corpse awoke to life. He beat time, he corrected  the least false note, he explained the necessary instructions in a faltering  voice, and, during the lesson, bore at least some semblance of life; but when  all was finished, the baton fell from his withered hand as he relapsed into his  former apathy. One would have thought that he would have been glad to rest in  his old age, but such was his love for his art that he insisted upon teaching  still, and it was this alone which kept him alive. His granddaughter, Bianca,  trained in the family traditions, was enabled to interpret his words, and, as  his system of singing was unique, in spite of his apparent uselessness, he had  many pupils.</p>
  <p>Bianca  herself was a charming Italian girl of twenty, more like a graceful white lily  in appearance than anything else, so fragile, so delicate, so pallid did she  seem. Her mournful eyes, dark and soft as those of a gazelle, seemed too large for  her pale, oval-face; and her figure, small and slender, always put me in mind  of that of a fairy. Indeed, in sport, I sometimes called her the Fairy of  Midnight, after some poet-fancy that haunted my brain, for all her strength  seemed to have gone into those glorious masses of raven-black hair, coiled so  smoothly round her small head. This portraiture seems to give the idea that  Bianca was a melancholy young person, yet such was not the case, for I have  seen her as gay as a bird on bright days, or when she received a letter from  her lover.</p>
  <p>Yes!  she had a lover to whom she was engaged to be married, but, curiously enough, I  knew nothing about this lover, not being intimate enough with Bianca to be the  confidant of her tender little secret. This unknown lover was always away in  other parts of Italy, and when he did visit Bianca it was during my absence, so  I used to joke with the Signorina about this visionary being. But she, with one  delicate finger on her lip and an arch smile of glee, would tell me that he&mdash;she  never mentioned his name&mdash;that he had an actual existence, and some day I would  see him in person at Verona. Well, here was Verona, here was Bianca, but the  lover had not appeared, so I would have jestingly asked this Fairy of Midnight  the reasons of his absence, had not the real grief expressed on her face  deterred me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  are you in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes! Signore, great trouble; but you cannot help me. No one can help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  perhaps I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signore, it is useless. Come, you must have the lesson at once. The Maestro is  dull to-day, he needs amusement; so come, the lesson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very cruel of you to make a joke of my lesson, Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  made no reply to my jesting remark, but heaving a little sigh, placed the ivory  baton in the hand of the Maestro and sat down at the piano. The mummy, finding  his services required, woke up and had a little conversation with me before  beginning the lesson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Signor Inglese,&rdquo; he croaked&mdash;this being his name for me&mdash;&ldquo;London is dark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had a fearful prejudice against London, which he had once visited at a foggy  season, and always made the above remark to his English pupils, which no one  ever thought of contradicting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes!&rdquo; he said, nodding his old head like a Chinese mandarin; &ldquo;London is always  dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Maestro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  not been working?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I have, Maestro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  then, Signor Inglese, we will see,&rdquo; and the lesson commenced.</p>
  <p>Oh,  those lessons! what agonies I suffered during them, trying to attain the  impossible! To how many fits of despair have I given way in failing time after  time to manage my breathing! It was all breathing&mdash;a deep drawing in, a slow  letting out&mdash;the exercise of internal muscles of which I had never heard even  the name&mdash;the weariness of incessantly practising notes in a still, small voice  hardly audible,&mdash;it was enough to discourage the most persevering. Some of the  female pupils, I believe, cried with vexation when not able to do what was  required by the severe Maestro, who denied the existence of the word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;  in connection with singing; but I, not being a woman, was reduced to swearing,  which certainly relieved my feelings after a battle with a particularly  aggravating exercise.</p>
  <p>Even  now, when I am successful in my art, I often turn cold as I think of those  apparently insurmountable obstacles which I had to overcome; but with these  painful memories there is mixed at the same time a kindly thought of that noble  old Maestro, so patient, so courteous, so painstaking, whose devotion to his  art was so great, who was so severe on the least fault and so encouraging of  the least success in conquering a difficulty.</p>
  <p>Well,  the lesson went on slowly with frequent interruptions from the Maestro, who was  satisfied with nothing less than perfection, and I breathed according to directions,  sang &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; &ldquo;eh,&rdquo; &ldquo;ee&rsquo;s&rdquo;  in a tiny, tiny voice, until at the end of the hour I was glad to sit down and  rest before departing. I felt tired out, I felt hungry, and, as the weather was  bad, I felt cross, but at the same time I felt curious to know what was the  matter with Bianca.</p>
  <p>The  Maestro, having remarked encouragingly that I had the voice of a goose and  would never sing in La Scala, relapsed into silence, evidently thinking of his  colezione which was being prepared in the kitchen with some trouble, judging  from the raised tones of Petronella&rsquo;s voice; and as Bianca still sat at the  piano, striking random chords, there was nothing for me to do but to take my  departure. She was not prepared to tell me her trouble, and indeed she had no  reason to do so, but feeling anxious to aid the poor child if I could, I  ventured to speak to her on the subject. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    Lost</b></h2>
  <p>WHILE  I was wondering which was the best way to approach this somewhat delicate  matter, the door was flung open to its fullest extent and Petronella stalked  majestically into the room. There was a wrathful look on her strongly marked  features, and Bianca trembled in expectation of a storm. Both she and the  Maestro were terribly afraid of Petronella, who ruled the household and looked  after them as she would a couple of children, so now that she frowned they  acted like children; and were cowed by her eagle eye. Petronella surveyed the  three of us grimly, and, being satisfied that her entrance had produced an  effect, spoke with a dramatic gesture that Rachel herself might have envied,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am enraged to-day. Let no one speak to me.&rdquo; Neither the Maestro nor Bianca  seemed inclined to accept this tread-on-the-tail-of-my-coat challenge, so  Petronella looked from one to the other to see on whom she should pour out the  vials of her wrath. Ultimately she chose Bianca.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  it is you, Signorina! it is you who enrage me. And for why? you ask. Holy  Saints! you ask why. Because you sit there like a statue in the Duoma. Will  that bring him back? say I. No, Signora, let the bad young man go. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guiseppe  is not a bad young man,&rdquo; cried Bianca, rising angrily to her feet</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you older than I am, piccola? No! Have you been married like I was? No! Then  let me speak, child that you are. All men are bad&mdash;ask the Signor there! All men  are bad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Petronella  made a comprehensive sweep of her arms so as to indicate the whole masculine  portion of the human race, and I, seeing an opportunity of finding out what was  the matter, did not attempt to defend masculine depravity in any way, but  artfully asked a question,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can hardly say. I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  has the Signore no ears? I speak of Guiseppe Pallanza!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  the tenor at the Teatro Ezzelino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore, he is the engaged one of the Signorina here, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough,  enough, Petronella!&rdquo; cried Bianca, her face flushing. &ldquo;Do not trouble the  Signor with these chatterings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  its no trouble,&rdquo; I replied quickly. &ldquo;Perhaps I can help you, Signorina, if you  require help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  eh!&rdquo; assented Petronella approvingly, &ldquo;the English have long heads, piccola.  Tell him all and he will find out what others cannot find out. And you,  Maestro, the colezione is ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  tenderly led the old man into the next room, and I was thus left alone with  Bianca, who had retreated to the window, where she stood twisting her  handkerchief with nervous confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not tell me, Signorina, if you would rather not,&rdquo; I said gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Signore, if I thought you would be my friend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  I will be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Maestro is so old. Petronella is so foolish. We know none in Verona, and I can  do nothing for my poor Guiseppe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  lover, Signorina?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I promised you should see him at Verona, but&mdash;now&mdash;ah now! &mdash;but perhaps you have  heard him singing at the Ezzelino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I have not been to the opera since my arrival here. What is the matter with  him? Is he ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know not! I know not! He is lost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore. My Guiseppe has disappeared and no one knows where he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Could  there be any connection between the disappearance of Guiseppe and the death of  that young man I had seen in the fatal chamber? The thought flashed across me  as she spoke, but I dismissed it as idle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you want some one to look for Signor Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I will undertake the task.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  Signore!&rdquo; she cried joyfully; &ldquo;will you search for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  Signorina; I promised to be your friend. Now sit down, and tell me all about  your lover and his disappearance. I may be able to do more for you than you  think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fact is, that by some subtle instinct I connected the disappearance of this  young man with the curious events of two nights before, and, leading Bianca to  a seat, I prepared to listen attentively to her recital.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,&rdquo;  she began in her flute-like voice, &ldquo;I have been engaged to marry Guiseppe  Pallanza for some months. He was a pupil of the Maestro, and we loved each  other when we first met; but ah! Signore, he was poor then, and we could not  marry, but now he is rich and famous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have heard of the tenor Pallanza, but have never seen him on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has the voice of a god, Signore, and at La Scala, two seasons ago&mdash;oh, Signore,  it was the talk of the whole city. The papers called him the New Mario, and he  is so handsome&mdash;like an angel. After La Scala he went to Florence, to Naples,  and then to Rome, where he sang in &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; and &lsquo;Polyeuct&rsquo; at the Apollo, then  he came on here a week ago for the season at the Ezzelino; but now he is lost.  Dio! how unhappy I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  covered her face with her hands, and wept quietly for a few minutes, and,  impatient as I was to hear the particulars of the affair, I did not dare to  disturb her grief. After a time she dried her tears, and went on again,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  came to Verona on Saturday, Signore, and we were so happy together talking  about our marriage; and on Monday he sang in &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; at the Ezzelino. I went to  the theatre with Petronella, and that was the last time I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  then he disappeared on Monday night!&rdquo; I asked quickly, feeling my heart begin  to beat rapidly with excitement, for it was on Monday night that my  extraordinary adventure had taken place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signore. He was to come here after the opera, to tell the Maestro how he had  sung&mdash;you know how anxious the Maestro is over his pupils, but he never came,  nor the next day either; so this morning I went to ask at the Ezzelino, and  they told me he had disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  curious I never heard of it. The disappearance of a popular tenor is not a  common thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Signore,  he sang on Monday and was to sing again to-night, so nothing was thought about  him not coming to the theatre yesterday; but this morning they sent to his  lodgings, to find that he had not been there since he left the Ezzelino after  the opera on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  papers will be full of it to-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that will not bring him back,&rdquo; said poor little Bianca in a melancholy tone,  shaking her small head, which drooped like a faded flower.</p>
  <p>I  was now certain that my adventure on Monday night had something to do with the  disappearance of Guiseppe Pallanza, and doubtless the young man I had seen in  the deserted palace was the missing tenor; but the antique dress, the amorous  rendezvous&mdash;these needed some explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  he in love with any one, Signorina?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a cruel but necessary question which angered Bianca, who threw back her  little head with great haughtiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore,  he loved me and no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he any reason for disappearing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive  me if I appear rude,&rdquo; I said in a deprecating tone; &ldquo;but indeed, Signorina, to  find out all I must know all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Signore, I am telling you all,&rdquo; she replied petulantly. &ldquo;It was most strange  his going away from the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  left the Ezzelino in his stage-dress!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  jumped to my feet in a state of uncontrollable excitement, for I saw at once  that I was on the right track. The antique dress was explained now! it was the  dress he wore in the last act of &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely, Signorina, that was very extraordinary,&rdquo; I said, pausing in my walk;  &ldquo;no one would walk the streets of Verona in a dress like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can explain that, Signore. When Guiseppe came from Rome, a friend came with him  who was very ill&mdash;a baritone singer, who was in the same company at the Apollo.  I was told at the Ezzelino that just before the last act of the opera, Guiseppe  received a note saying that his friend was dying, so as soon as the curtain  fell, he threw on a cloak which hid his dress, and went away as quickly as  possible, so as to see his friend before he died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and is the friend dead yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know, Signore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  story of the dying friend might be true, yet to me it seemed highly improbable,  and I guessed that the people at the theatre had told this fiction to pacify  the fears of Signorina Angello, to whom they knew that Pallanza was engaged.  The real truth of the matter was doubtless that the letter came from the woman  I had followed, asking him to meet her at the deserted Palazzo Morone, and he  had gone there innocently enough to be poisoned as I had seen. This explained a  great deal, but it did not explain why the meeting should have taken place at  such an extraordinary spot, and why the woman should have come from a  burial-ground to keep the appointment. Taking all the circumstances into  consideration, I was certain that it was Pallanza I had seen murdered on Monday  night, but in order to be quite sure of his identity, I asked Bianca if she had  any photograph of her betrothed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  a surety, Signore,&rdquo; she replied, and going to an album on the table, brought me  a cabinet portrait </p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Guiseppe as Faust, the dress in which he left the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was as I surmised. The portrait was coloured, and I saw an exact representation  of the young man I had beheld at the Palazzo Morone. The typical Italian face  with the black curly hair, dark eyes, small moustache and sallow skin; the  slender figure arrayed in a doublet of blue velvet, slashed with white satin;  the azure silk cloak, the poniard and the high riding-boots&mdash;nothing was  wanting; the successful tenor of the portrait was the man who had taken poison  from the hand of the lady of the sepulchre. Still it was no use telling Bianca  of my suspicions until I had discovered the whole secret; and besides, as  Guiseppe was dead, I naturally shrank from being the bearer of such bad news. I  suppose my face betrayed my thoughts, for I saw the Signorina watching me  anxiously; so to lull any fancies she might have, I made the first remark that  came into my head,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never saw Faust in riding-boots before!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Signore!&rdquo; replied the girl with a fond look, &ldquo;Guiseppe was an artist as well as  a singer, and designed his own dresses. He said that as Faust in the last act  was going to fly with Marguerite, and Mephistopheles speaks of the horses  waiting, it is natural that he should wear a riding-dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  explanation was quite satisfactory, and having thus learned the identity of the  young man whom I had seen murdered, I prepared to go, when another idea entered  my head, and, going over to the piano, I began to play by ear the strange air I  had heard at the Palazzo Morone. Bianca gave a cry of surprise as she heard the  melody, and came over to the piano with a puzzled look on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you know it, Signorina?&rsquo;&rsquo; I said, turning round quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  in fact I gave it to Guiseppe. It is an old air by Palestrina, which I found  among the music of the Maestro, to which Guiseppe set words. He is very fond of  it and sings it a great deal. Ah, Signore, you must have heard him sing it, for  no one else has a copy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  turned off the matter with a careless remark, not caring to tell Bianca where I  had heard it; and now being quite certain that I would be able to unravel the  whole mystery, I wanted to get away as quickly as possible in order to arrange  my plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Addio,  Signorina,&rdquo; I said, giving her my hand. &ldquo;When I see you again I may be able to  give you news. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I hope so, Signorina,&rdquo; I replied hurriedly as Petronella appeared at the door. &ldquo;Do  not anticipate evil, I beg of you. I have no doubt Guiseppe is quite well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I hope so! I trust so! Addio! Signor Hugo, you will come back soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,  Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I see you have brought back the smiles,&rdquo; said Petronella&rsquo;s gruff voice as she  ushered me out. &ldquo;What do you think of this evil one going away, Signore? I was  going to have four masses if he is dead, but those priests are such thieves.  Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you think he is dead, Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Signore, he loves the piccola so much that nothing but death would keep him  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know what you would say, Signore, except a woman. Well, maybe men are all bad.  I&rsquo;ve been married, Signore&mdash;I know, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m particularly bad, Petronella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  then you&rsquo;re not a true man, Signore,&rdquo; retorted Petronella, closing the argument  and the door at the same time. </p>

    A Haunted Palace</b></h2>
  <p>I  need hardly say that I was very much excited over the strange discovery I had  made, as there now appeared to be a reasonable chance of clearing up the  mystery of the Palazzo Morone. I had discovered the name of the unhappy young  man, which gave me a most important clue to the reading of the enigma; but I  had yet to find out the name of the lady who had behaved in such an  extraordinary manner and committed so daring a crime. After hearing Peppino&rsquo;s  story I fancied that she might perchance be the Contessa Morone, but had later  on dismissed this idea as idle, seeing that she had been absent from Verona for  many months; but now that Bianca had told me that Pallanza had come straight  from Rome, I began to suspect that I had been right in my surmise. According to  Peppino the Contessa had taken up her residence at the Italian capital, so what  was more likely than that she had fallen in love with Guiseppe while he was  singing at the Teatro Apollo, and, following him to Verona, had killed him by  means of poison, in revenge for his determination to leave her?</p>
  <p>So  far everything was feasible enough, but two points of the affair perplexed me  very much, one being the choosing of the deserted palace as a place of meeting,  the other the visit to the burial ground by the woman. We do not live in the  times of the Borgias, when noble ladies can thus rid themselves of their lovers  with impunity, else I might have believed that this phantom of Donna Lucrezia  had gone to the old Veronese cemetery to select a grave for the unfortunate  young man she intended to murder. To think thus, however, was foolish, and  although I guessed that she had used the old palace of her family as a safe  place for a lovers&rsquo; meeting, seeing its gruesome reputation secured it from  public curiosity, yet I was quite unable to explain the cemetery mystery. One  thing, however, appeared to me to be certain, that Guiseppe Pallanza had been  carrying on an intrigue with the Contessa&mdash;presuming the ghoul to be her&mdash; and  that he had gone to the Palazzo Morone on the night in question at her request.  As to the sick friend&mdash;</p>
  <p>Now  I greatly mistrusted that sick-friend story. So many fast young Englishmen whom  I knew had adopted the same lie to cover their little peccadilloes that I was  quite sure Pallanza had employed the same fiction to prevent the scandal of his  intrigue with this unknown woman from reaching the ears of his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. Bianca was a very proud girl,  and I felt certain, from what little I had seen of her character, that if she  discovered Guiseppe was playing her false, she would at once break off the  engagement at any cost. Like all Italian women, when she loved she loved with  her whole soul, and expected the same single-hearted return to her passion; so  that the discovery of her lover&rsquo;s infidelity could only be punished  sufficiently, according to her ideas, by an everlasting parting between them.  Pallanza knew this, and therefore tried to hide his guilt by the plausible  story of his dying friend, which appeared to me to be such a remarkably weak  fabrication that, before going to the Palazzo Morone, I determined to find out  if this mythical invalid existed.</p>
  <p>Curiously  enough, although I was studying for the musical profession and was devoted to  operatic performances, I had not been to the Teatro Ezzelino since my arrival  at Verona, preferring to wander about the streets of the romantic old city in the  moonlight to sitting night after night in a stifling atmosphere of heat, glare,  and noise. I made up my mind, however, to go on this special night, in the hope  that I might hear some talk about Pallanza&rsquo;s disappearance, and be guided  thereby in my future movements; but meantime I went to the theatre in the  afternoon, and, introducing myself to the impresario as a friend of Guiseppe&rsquo;s,  asked him if he had heard any news of the missing tenor.</p>
  <p>The  impresario, a dingy old man of doubtful cleanliness, was in despair, and raged  against the absent Pallanza like a Garrick of the gutter. He had heard nothing  of this <i>birb&aacute;nte</i>&mdash;this ladrone who had  thus disappeared, and left an honest impresario in the lurch. &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; was the  success of the season; without Pallanza there could be no &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and the  season would be a failure. What was he to do? Cospetto! it was the luck of the  devil. Why had this scellerato run away? A sick friend? Bah! there was no sick  friend. It was a woman who had enticed away this pazzo. A dying friend from  Rome was not a very likely story, but a lie&mdash;a large and magnificent lie. Here  was the basso of his company, who had been singing with Pallanza at the Apollo;  ask him, truth is on his lips. Behold this good man!</p>
  <p>Signor  Basso-profundo advanced, and though truth might have been on his lips it  certainly was not apparent on his face, for a more deceitful countenance I  never beheld. However, I have no doubt he spoke truth on this occasion, as  there was no money to be made by telling a lie, and he confirmed the words of  the wrathful impresario. The sick friend was a myth, but in Rome Pallanza had  been friendly with a lady. Per Bacco! a great lady, but the name was unknown to  him. It appeared that Signor Basso-profundo dressed in the same room as  Pallanza, and it was just before the last act of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; that Guiseppe received  the note. He told the basso-profundo that it was from a dying friend, and had  departed quickly when the opera was ended, in his stage-dress, with a cloak  wrapped round him. The basso-profundo was sure, the note was from a lady. The  impresario was also sure, and devoted the lady in question to the infernal gods  with a richness of expression I have never heard equalled in any language.</p>
  <p>Having  thus found out what I suspected from the first, that the dying friend was a  mere invention to cloak an intrigue, I left the impresario to tear his hair and  call Guiseppe names in company with Signor Basso-profundo, and went back to my  hotel, where I found Peppino waiting with his fiacre to drive me to the Palazzo  Morone.</p>
  <p>He  was still unwilling to take me to this place of evil reputation, and made one  last effort to shake my determination by gruesome stories of people who had  gone into the palazzo and never came out again; but I laughed at all these  hobgoblin romances, and getting into the fiacre, told him to drive off at once,  which he did, after crossing himself twice, so as to secure his own safety should  the ghosts of Palazzo Morone take a fancy to carry me off as a heretic.</p>
  <p>We  speedily left the broad, modern streets, and rattled down gloomy, mediaeval  passages, the humid atmosphere of which chilled me to the bone, in spite of the  heat of the day. The fiacre&mdash;with its jingling bells&mdash;bumped on the uneven  stones, turned abruptly round unexpected corners, corkscrewed itself between  narrow walls, crept under low archways, and after innumerable dodgings,  twistings, hairbreadth escapes from upsettings, and perilous balancings on the  edges of drains, at length emerged into that queer little piazza at the end of  which I saw the great facade of the richly-decorated palace I had beheld in the  moonlight of two nights before.</p>
  <p>I  had been an ardent student of Baedeker since my arrival in Italy, and from the  fortified appearance of the palazzo, judged that it had been built by Michelo  Sammicheli, who, according to the guide-book, was the greatest military  architect of the middle ages. The building was four stories high, with long  lines of narrow windows closely barred by curiously ornamented iron cages&mdash;which  bulged outward,&mdash;as a protection against thieves or enemies, and the whole front  was adorned with almost obliterated paintings after the style of the Genoese  palaces. In addition to the brush, the chisel had done its work, and wreaths of  flowers, grinning masks, nude figures of boys and girls, elaborate crests and  armorial devices with fishes, birds, tritons, shells, and fruit were sculptured  round the windows, along the fortified castellated top, and over the great  portal. All the square in front of this splendid specimen of Renaissance art  was overgrown with grass. The houses on every side were also deserted, and what  with the broken windows, the empty piazza, and the closed doors, everything had  a melancholy, desolate appearance, as if a curse rested upon the whole  neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>Peppino  evidently was of this opinion, for although it was broad daylight, and the hot  sunlight poured down on the grass-grown square, yet he kept muttering prayers  in a low voice; and if by chance he looked towards the Palazza, he always  crossed himself with great devoutness. I was not, however, going to be baulked  of my intention by any superstitious feeling on the part of an Italian  cab-driver, so I ordered Peppino to tie up his horse and come with me into the  palace. This modest request, however, so horrified Peppino that he absolutely  squeaked with horror, like a rabbit caught in a snare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,  Signore!&rdquo; he whimpered, touching the relic on his breast. &ldquo;Dio! not to be King  of Italy would I go into that house! If you are wise, Signore, look and come  away lest evil befall you. Cospetto! Signore, remember the Frate. Think of  Madonna Matilda!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Madonna Matilda, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Illustrious, do you not know? She was a friend of his Holiness at Canossa, and,  though a woman, wanted to celebrate mass, but Il Cristo burnt her to ashes with  fire from above!&mdash;and she died. Ecco! Cospetto! Signore, it is foolish to meddle  with holy things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you can&rsquo;t call this palace holy, Peppino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;No,  Illustrious. It is accursed!&rdquo; replied the Italian, crossing-himself, &ldquo;but there  is fire below as well as above, and you are a heretic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  means that I had better beware of the devil! eh, Peppino. Well, well; I&rsquo;m not  afraid, so I will enter the palace; and if you see me carried off by the  ghosts, you can tell the carabinieri.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  Illustrious, do not jest; but if you will go you must go. I will wait here and  pray for your soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peppino  was as obstinate as a mule in his fear of ghosts, so leaving him to smoke his  long Italian cigar and watch the brown lizards scuttling over the hot stones in  the sunshine, I advanced towards the palace with the determination to find out  the secret chamber. As I knew it would be dark therein, owing to its want of  windows, I had taken the precaution to provide myself with a candle and a box  of matches. Feeling that these were safe in my pocket, I went to the iron gate  and entered the courtyard in the same way as I had done on that night. This  time, however, I examined the ironwork, and found to my surprise that the  missing bar had been half filed through and then wrenched away. The marks left  were quite fresh, and it had been done so recently that the bar had not had  time to grow rusty. This discovery astonished me not a little, as I did not see  the reason of such an entrance being made. If it were the Contessa who used the  palace, she would have the key of the side door, and could thus admit herself  and her lover at her pleasure, while this breach could only have been made by  some one who could not enter in any other way.</p>
  <p>I  thought of the person into whose arms I had fallen, the person who had placed a  handkerchief wet with some liquid over my face, and although, according to Peppino&rsquo;s  story, this watcher at the door was the phantom of Count Mastino Morone, yet  dismissing such an explanation as due to superstition, I began to think that  another person had followed the lady of the sepulchre besides myself. Yes,  there could be no doubt about it, some third person had tracked her to the  palazzo, and, unable to enter in the ordinary way, had filed through and broken  the iron bar in the gate. Gaining access to the interior of the palazzo in this  way, the unknown had penetrated to the secret chamber, and doubtless had  witnessed the same strange scene as I had done. My presence had been  discovered, and to preserve for some unknown reason, the secret of this  terrible chamber, I had been seized, rendered insensible by chloroform, and  taken to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, so that I would be unable to re-discover  the Palazzo Morone.</p>
  <p>All  these thoughts flashed through my brain with the rapidity of lightning, and I  wondered whom this unknown could be&mdash;a friend of Pallanza? an accomplice of the  Contessa! I did not know what to think, so leaving all such conjectures to a  more seasonable time, I crossed over the dreary courtyard and entered the great  hall.</p>
  <p>It  was a magnificent entrance, and when thronged with courtiers, men-at-arms,  pages, and ladies, must have presented a noble appearance. Of enormous size,  the high walls and lofty roof were painted with glowing frescoes representing  the ancient glories of the Republic, and the floor was brilliant with gorgeous  mosaics of coats-of-arms and fantastic figures. The painted windows on either  side of the huge portal blazed with variegated tints, and the bright sun  streaming in through the glass&mdash;as many-coloured as Joseph&rsquo;s coat&mdash;dyed the floor  with vivid lights and gaudy hues. Ancient tapestries hung here and there  between the two lines of black marble columns running down the sides of the  hall, and the wind, stealing in through the open door, shook the grey dust from  these mouldering splendours of the loom. At the end of this immense vestibule  arose a broad staircase of white marble with balustrades of elaborate bronze  fretwork, and from the first landing two other flights sloped off to right and  left of the main branch. All the air was filled with floating shadows, the soft  wind moved the hangings without sound, and I was alone in the deserted hall,  over which brooded an intense silence, which made me shiver in the chill  atmosphere pervading this abode of desolation.</p>
  <p>However,  the afternoon was passing quickly, and as I had plenty to do before nightfall,  I rapidly ascended the shallow stairs. Turning to the right; which was the way  the unknown lady had taken the other night, I soon found myself in the long  corridor with the windows looking out on to the courtyard. Many of these were  broken, but others were quite whole, their colours as bright and glowing as  when they had first been placed there.</p>
  <p>At  the end of the corridor I turned to the left, and found the short flight of  shallow steps, which, however, led up into darkness, so that before ascending  them I had to light my candle. Luckily there were no draughts, for the air was  absolutely still, and the flame of my candle burned clear and steadily. Up  these steps I went, entered the short corridor, and paused before the heavy  door which gave admission into the ante-chamber of the fatal room. Realizing  what had taken place inside on that fatal night, I dreaded to enter, lest I  should find the corpse of the unfortunate Pallanza on the floor; but overcoming  my emotions, with a strong effort I thrust open the door and entered.</p>
  <p>The  tapestried chamber presented exactly the same appearance, with the small table  in the centre, the burnt-out torch lying on the floor, and at the end the rich  folds of the gold-worked curtains veiling the entrance to the inner apartment.  I stood on the threshold, half expecting to hear the shrill notes of the  mandolin, and the passionate song ring through the silence, but all was still  and mute, as if it were indeed the tomb of the dead I expected to find.</p>
  <p>At  last, with a thrill of dread, I parted the heavy curtains and found myself in  the circular chamber. The faint light of the candle just hollowed out a gulf in  the Cimmerian darkness, and I saw the dim glitter of the gold and silver on the  table, the ghastly glimmer of the white cloth, and the sparks of weak fire  flashing from the tarnished gold embroidery of the curtains; All was as I had  seen it&mdash;the eight white pillars, the dull-red hangings with their Arabesque  patterns of golden thread, the gilt table, the massive metal goblets and silver  candelabra, even the half-eaten fruit, with everything on the table in  disorder; but, somewhat to my relief, I found nothing else. The dead body,  which I had seen lying at the feet of that terrible woman, had vanished, and  although I searched over every inch of the chamber, I could find no trace of  the fearful crime which had been committed. The demon who had enticed the  unhappy young man to his ruin had completed her evil work by secreting his  body, and I began to think that all trace of Guiseppe Pallanza had disappeared  from the earth for evermore.</p>
  <p>Who  was this woman who, in this room, had so wickedly slain her lover? Who was the  man&mdash;I felt sure it was a man&mdash;who had seized me at the door, and borne me  insensible from the palace? I could answer neither of these questions, and had  it not been for the story of Bianca, for the disappearance of Pallanza, I would  have fancied the whole some hideous dream, some nightmare of medieval devilry,  which had filled my brain with the phantasmagoria of delirium. Everything,  however, was too real, too terrible, to admit of such an explanation; so as I  could discover nothing more from examining the chamber I prepared to leave. The  atmosphere yet had a faint aroma of the sandalwood perfume which emanated from  the unknown woman; At my feet still lay the broken mandolin; and the rich  wine-cups still glittered in the dim light. I no longer wondered at such wealth  being left here undefended, for superstition, more of a safeguard than bolts  and bars, protected this cave of Aladdin from thievish Italian fingers; and  even if a thief had known of these riches, I doubt whether he would have had  the courage to dare the unseen horrors of the palazzo.</p>
  <p>For  myself, standing there in the perfumed atmosphere, with the light just showing  the intense gloom, the dim glitter of gold and silver, the absolute stillness  and the horrible memories of the chamber&mdash;I felt as though I were in the  presence of the dead. At the table sat the phantoms of Donna Renata and her  lover, smiling at one another with hatred in their ghostly hearts; at the door  watched the evil face of the outraged husband awaiting the consummation of the  tragedy; and in imagination I could see the wicked smile of the woman, the  scowl of the husband, the loathing look on the face of the lover. My breath,  coming quick and fast, made the flame of the candle flicker and flare until,  overcome by the horror of the room, and by the workings of my imagination, I  turned and fled&mdash;fled from the evil gloom, from that blood-stained splendour,  out into the blessed sunshine and pure air of heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!&rdquo;  cried Peppino, as I walked quickly out into the square, &ldquo;how pale you are,  Illustrious! Eh, Signore, have the ghosts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen no ghosts, Peppino, but I have felt their presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cospetto!  did I not warn the Signore against the accursed place? Come, Illustrious, jump  in and we will leave this abode of devils.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Peppino,&rdquo; I replied, entering the fiacre, &ldquo;but drive slowly, as I want to  know the way to this palazzo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  the Signore will not come again?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I am coming some night this month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Saints!  the Signore is mad and lost!&rdquo; muttered Peppino with a pale face. Then, hastily  gathering up the reins, he drove rapidly away from the lonely square, leaving  this gruesome palace to the night and to the feast of ghosts. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    At The Teatro Ezzelino</b></h2>
  <p>From  my mother I had inherited one of those highly strung organizations which are  largely affected by their surroundings, and which, like an Eolian harp, to the  sighing wind vibrate with every breath of passion that passes over  them&mdash;organizations which take their colour, their bias, their desires from the  last event which occurs, and which are entirely in sympathy with the  predominating feeling of the moment. In childhood this dangerous spirit of  moods and fancies had been fostered by an old Scottish nurse, who used to  thrill me with wild stories of Highland superstitions, and with weird ballads  of elfish fantasy; but since I had mixed in the world I had learned to control  and sway my imaginative faculty, and had thus acquired a command over myself.  But, as I said before, superstition is in every one, and waxes or wanes  according to their surroundings; so the terrors of childish tales, which had  been half-forgotten in the bustle of worldly life, now came upon my soul with  full force in this haunted city of Verona. The burial-ground, the ghostly room,  the accursed palace, the phantoms of evil-seeming, all these peopled the  chambers of my brain, with their unreal horrors, until I became so nervous and  unstrung, that every sudden noise, every unexpected sound, and every shadowy corner,  made me thrill with supernatural fear as if I were again a child listening to  tales of devildom.</p>
  <p>I  knew this mood was a bad one, and would have sought cheerful society to drive  away the evil spirit had I known where to seek it. But there were no English at  my hotel, and, in the present state of affairs, the Casa Angello was not  particularly cheerful, so as I did not care about spending a lonely evening, I bethought  myself of my intention to go to the Teatro Ezzelino. On glancing at the paper I  saw that the opera for the night was &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia;&rdquo; and this name gave me a  renewed sensation of horror. The lady of the sepulchre had taken in my  imagination the semblance of Ferrara&rsquo;s Duchess, and the memory of the terrible  daughter of Pope Alexander seemed never to leave me. She had come from the  graveyard, she had supped in the fatal chamber, she had murdered her lover; and  now, when she had vanished into thin air, I was to see her represented on the  stage in all her magnificent wickedness. I had a good mind not to go, but  seeing that there was a ballet after the opera, I thought I would brave this  phantom of the brain, and find in the lightness of the dancing an antidote to the  gloomy terrors of the lyrical drama.</p>
  <p>The  cooking at my hotel was somewhat better than the usual run of Italian culinary  ideas, so I made an excellent dinner, drank some Asti Spumati, an agreeable  wine of an exhilarating nature, and felt much better when I started for the  Ezzelino.</p>
  <p>It  was one of those perfect Italian evenings such as one sees depicted by the  glowing brush of Turner, and there yet lingered in the quiet evening sky a  faint purple reflection of the sunset glories. No moon as yet, but here and  there a burning star throbbing in the deep heart of the sky, and under the  peaceful heavens the weather-worn red roofs and grey walls of antique Verona  mellowed to warm loveliness in the twilight shadows. Beautiful as it was,  however, with the memory of that eerie night still on me, I had no desire to  renew my moonlight wanderings, so, without pausing to admire the enchanting  scene, I hastened on to the theatre to be in time for the first notes of  Donnizetti&rsquo;s opera.</p>
  <p>The  Teatro Ezzelino is a very charming opera-house, built in a light, airy fashion,  with plenty of ventilation, a thing to be grateful for on hot summer nights.  All the decorations are white and gold, so that it has a delightfully cool  appearance; nevertheless, what with the warmth of the season without, and the  glaring heat of the gas within, I felt unpleasantly hot. The gallery and stalls  were crowded, but as it was only eight o&rsquo;clock, most of the boxes were empty,  and I knew would not be filled until late in the evening by those who, tired of  the well-known music of &ldquo;Lucrezia,&rdquo; wanted to see the new ballet.</p>
  <p>Having  glanced round the theatre, I bought a book of the words, hired an opera-glass  from an obsequious attendant, and settled myself comfortably for the evening.  The orchestra&mdash;a very excellent one, directed by Maestro Feraldi, of  Milan&mdash;played the prelude in a sufficiently good style, and the pictured curtain  arose on the well-known Venetian scene which I had so often beheld. The chorus,  in their heterogeneous costumes of no known age, wandered about in their usual  aimless fashion, shouted their approval of smiling Venice in the ordinary  indifferent style; and a very good contralto who sang Orsini, having delivered  her first aria with great dramatic fervour, they all vanished from the stage,  leaving the sleeping Genaro to be contemplated by Lucrezia Borgia.</p>
  <p>I  was disappointed with the Duchess when she arrived, and I must say that my  majestic evil lady of the sepulchre looked far more like the regal sister of  Caesar Borgia than this diminutive singer with the big voice, who raged round  the stage like a spitfire, and gave one no idea of the terrible Medusa of  Ferrara, whose smile was death to all, lovers and friends alike. The tenor was  a long individual, and Lucrezia being so small, their duets, in point of  physical appearance, were sufficiently ridiculous; but as they sang well  together, their rendering of the characters, artistically speaking, was  enjoyable. The chorus entered and discovered Lucrezia with Genaro; the  prima-donna defied them all with the look and ways of a cross child; there was  the usual dramatic chorus, and the curtain fell on the prologue with but slight  applause. I did not go out, as I felt very comfortable, so amused myself with  looking round the house, when, during the first act of the opera, two officers  entered the theatre and took their seats in front of mine. They were two gay  young men, who talked a great deal about one thing and another in such raised  voices that I could hear all they said, some of which was not particularly  edifying.</p>
  <p>During  the first act which succeeds the prologue they were comparatively quiet, but  when Lucrezia entered in the second to sing the celebrated duet with Alfonso,  they were loud in their expressions of disapproval concerning her appearance.  The music of this part of the opera is particularly loud and noisy, but even  through the crash of the orchestra I could hear their expressions of  disapproval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  voice is not bad, but the appearance&mdash;the acting&mdash;oime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Teodoro, what would you? Donna Lucrezia is not on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on the stage!&rdquo; said Teodoro in an astonished tone. &ldquo;Ebbene! where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at the box yonder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Per  Bacco! the Contessa Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  started as I heard this name, and, looking in the same direction as the young  men, saw a woman seated far back in the shadow of a box, the fourth or fifth  from the stage. She was talking to three gentlemen, and her face was turned  away so that I could not see her features; but, judging from the glimpse I  caught of her head and bust, she seemed to be a very majestic woman.</p>
  <p>The  Contessa Morone! She was then in Verona after all. This discovery removed all  my doubts concerning the identity of the ghoul. She was the woman who had left  the vault in the burial-ground. She was the woman who had slain Guiseppe  Pallanza in the secret chamber of the deserted palace, and she was the woman  seated in the shadow of the box, talking idly as though she had no terrible  crime to burden her conscience. If I could only see her face I would then  recognise her; but, as if she had some presentiment of danger, she persistently  looked everywhere but in my direction. As I gazed she moved slightly, the  bright light of a lamp shone on her neck, and I saw a sudden tongue of red  flame flash through the semi-twilight of the box, which at once reminded me of  the necklace of rubies worn by that terrible vampire of the graveyard.</p>
  <p>Eager  to know all about this woman, whom I felt sure was the murderess of Pallanza, I  listened breathlessly to the two officers who were still talking about her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a year since Morone died,&rdquo; said Teodoro, lowering his opera-glass, &ldquo;and she  has lived since at Rome, where I met her. Why has she returned here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  who knows! Perhaps to reside again at the Palazzo Morone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  tomb, Diamine! She must become a ghost to live there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene,  Teodoro! the ghost of Lucrezia Borgia! Why does she not marry again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows! I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be her husband in spite of her money. Corpo di Bacco!  a woman who sees in the dark like a cat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  evil eye!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  and everything else that&rsquo;s wicked. I do not like that Signora at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Che  peccato! you might marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  her money! Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  both laughed, and, the act being ended, left their seats. I also went out into  the corridor for a smoke and a breath of fresh air, feeling deeply sorry that  this interesting conversation had been interrupted. From what one of the  officers had said she was evidently a nyctalopyst, and could see in the dark,  which accounted at once for the unerring way in which she had threaded the dark  streets, and was also the reason that she now remained secluded in the shadow  of her box, preferring the darkness to the light. Puzzling over these things,  and wondering how I could get a glimpse of her face, I lighted a cigarette and strolled  about in the vestibule of the theatre with the rest of the crowd.</p>
  <p>There  were a goodly number of civilians of all sizes, ages, and complexions, while  the military element was represented by a fair sprinkling of officers in the  picturesque uniforms of the Italian army. The air was thick with tobacco-smoke  there was a clatter of vivacious voices, and the great doors of the theatre  were thrown wide open to admit the fresh night air into the overpoweringly hot  atmosphere. Being wrapt up in my ideas about the Contessa Morone and her  extraordinary behaviour, I leaned against a pillar and took no notice of any  one, when suddenly a tall officer stopped in front of me and held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!  Is it you, Signor Hugo? Come sta!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beltrami!  You here! I am surprised!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi,&rdquo; replied Beltrami, who constantly introduced French words into his  conversation; &ldquo;you are not so surprised as I am. I thought you were in your  foggy island, and behold you appear at Verona. How did you come here? What are  you doing? Eh! Hugo, tell me all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  do not think I have mentioned Beltrami before, which is curious, considering I  have been talking so much about Italy and the Italians; but the fact is, my  friend the Marchese only now enters into this curious story I am relating, so thus  being introduced in due season I will tell all I know about him.</p>
  <p>During  my narrative I fancy I have mentioned that I spoke and understood Italian  tolerably for an Englishman. Well, I did not learn my Italian in Italy&mdash;no,  indeed! Foggy London saw my maiden efforts to acquire that soft bastard Latin  which Byron talks of, and the Marchese Luigi Beltrami gave me my first lessons  in his melodious language. He had come to England some years before with a card  of introduction to my father from a friend in Florence, and on being introduced  to our household we had taken a great fancy to one another. Even in those days,  perhaps as a premonitory symptom of my operatic leanings, I was mad on all  things Italian, and discoursed about art, raved of Cimabue and Titian, and  quoted Dante, Ariosto, and Alfieri until every one of my friends were, I am  sure, heartily wearied of my enthusiasm. Beltrami appeared, and feeling  flattered by my great admiration for his country, advised me to learn Italian.  I did so, and with his help soon became no mean proficient in the tongue which  the Marchese, being a Florentine, spoke very purely. In return I taught him  English; but either I was a bad master, or Beltrami was an idle scholar, for  all the English he ever learned consisted of two sentences: &ldquo;You are a  beautiful miss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; but with these two he got along  comparatively well, particularly with women.</p>
  <p>English  ladies at first were indignant at this outspoken admiration, but Beltrami was  so good-looking, and apparently so sincere in his use of these two English  sentences, that they usually ended by pardoning him; nevertheless the Marchese  found that if he wanted to get on in society he would have to moderate his  transports. Ultimately, if I remember rightly, he took refuge in French, and  said a great many pretty things in that very pretty tongue.</p>
  <p>My  friend Beltrami and myself were the antithesis of one another in character, as  he had a great deal of the subtle craft of the old Italian despot about him;  yet somehow we got on capitally together, perhaps by the law of contrast, and  when he returned to Italy I was sorry to see the last of him. I promised to  some day visit him at his palazzo in Florence, and fully intended to do so  before leaving Italy; but here was Verona, and here, by the intervention of  chance, was the Marchese, as suave, as subtle-faced, and as handsome as ever.  He appeared to be delighted to see me, and as I was a stranger in a strange  land, I was glad to find at least one familiar face.</p>
  <p>In  response to his request I told him about the death of my father, of my  determination to study singing, and the circumstances which had led me to  Verona, to all of which Beltrami listened attentively, and at the conclusion of  my story shook hands with me again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene!  my friend Hugo, I am glad to see you in our Italy. As you see, I serve the King  and am stationed in his dismal palace, so while you are here I will make things  pleasant. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! my dear Marchese, I know what you mean by making things pleasant. I have come  here to work, not to play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame,  mon ami! too much work is bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Marchese, and too much play is worse; but tell me how have you been since I saw  you last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  just the same; I am as poor as ever, but soon I will be rich!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo,  Beltrami! Is your uncle, the Cardinal, dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  uncle, the Cardinal, is immortal,&rdquo; replied the Marchese cynically. &ldquo;No, he  still lives in the hope to succeed to the Fisherman&rsquo;s Chair. I am going to be  married!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Hugo, I think you will when you see the future Marchese! She is in the theatre  to-night. I am engaged to marry her, and as she takes my friends for her own,  come with me and I will introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  drew back, as I wanted to watch the Contessa Morone, and if I went to  Beltrami&rsquo;s box I would perhaps lose sight of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must excuse me, Signor Luigi, because&mdash;because you see I am not in evening  dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the best excuse I could think of, but, being a very weak one, Beltrami  laughed, and, slipping his arm into mine, dragged me along the corridor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sapristi!  you talk like a child. You are my friend. Signora Morone will be delighted to  see you. She adores the English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame  Morone!&rdquo; I exclaimed, thunderstruck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the Contessa! Do you know her by sight? Mon Dieu! is she not beautiful? You  shall speak the English to her. She loves your foggy islanders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was so bewildered by the chance thrown in my way of finding out if the Contessa  Morone had anything to do with the burial-ground episode, that I only replied  to Beltrami&rsquo;s chatter by an uneasy laugh, and suffered myself to be led  unresistingly along.</p>
  <p>The  Marchese did not take me into the box itself, but into one of those small  ante-rooms, on the opposite side of the corridor, which are used by Italian  ladies as reception saloons for their friends when at the theatre. I heard the  loud chatter of many voices as Beltrami opened the door, and there, standing  under the glare of the gas-lamp, with the wicked smile on her lips, the pearls  in her hair, the ruby necklace round her throat, I saw the woman who had come  from the vault, the woman who had poisoned Pallanza in the secret room, the  phantom of Lucrezia Borgia. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    The Phantom Of Lucrezia Borgia</b></h2>
  <p>I  WAS duly introduced by the Marchese, and Signora Morone received me in the most  amiable manner. She was certainly a very charming woman, and had I not known  her true character, I would doubtless have been fascinated by her gracious  affability; but, in spite of her courtesy, I could hardly speak to her without  a feeling of repulsion. This beautiful woman, so suave, so smiling, so  seductive, inspired me with that sensation of absolute dread which one  experiences at the sight of a sleek, velvet-footed pantheress&mdash;a comely beast to  admire, but a terrible one to caress. I replied to her polite inquiries in a  somewhat mechanical fashion, which she doubtless put down to my imperfect  knowledge of Italian, for in spite of all my efforts to feel at ease in her  society, yet I was unable to do more than behave with strained courtesy towards  this woman whose mask I had torn off, whose secret I had penetrated, and the  wickedness of whose heart I knew.</p>
  <p>There  were several other gentlemen in the room, who talked gaily with the Contessa,  and amused themselves by eating the bonbons and crystallised fruits provided  for refreshments. The last act of the opera had not yet commenced, so Signora  Morone sank gracefully into a velvet-cushioned chair, and permitted her  courtiers to retail all the news of the day for her amusement. I am afraid this  description sounds somewhat hyperbolical, but indeed it is the only way in  which I can describe this woman, whose every movement was full of sinuous grace  and feline treachery. Cat, tigress, pantheress as she was, her claws were now  sheathed in her velvet paws, but the claws were there all the same, and would  doubtless scratch at the least provocation.</p>
  <p>Some  people do not believe in transmigration, but . I am a true disciple of  Pythagoras in that bizarre doctrine, and I firmly believe that in a former  existence the soul of Giulietta Morone had animated the body of some tawny  tigeress who had stolen through the jungle beneath the burning skies of  Hindostan, slaying and devouring her victims in conformity with the instincts  of her savage nature. Now she was a woman&mdash;a fair, majestic woman but the  instinct of the beast was there, the desire for slaughter and the lust for  blood. What made me indulge still more in this fancy was the colours of the  dress she wore black and yellow&mdash;all twisted in and out with a curious  resemblance to the sleek fur of the beast to which I had likened her. The soft  glimmer of the pearl strings twined in her magnificent red hair seemed out of  place as ornaments for this woman; but the rubies suited</p>
  <p>her  nature well, the red, angry rubies that shot flashes of purple fire from her  neck at every heave of her white bosom. Leaning back in her deep chair with a  cruel smile on her full crimson lips, the glimmer of pearls, the fire-glint of  the fierce-tinted gems, and the bizarre mixture of amber and black in her dress,  she slowly waved her sandalwood fan to and fro, diffusing a strange, sleepy  perfume through the room, and looking what I verily believed her to be, the  type of incarnate evil in repose.</p>
  <p>While  I was thinking in this fanciful fashion, the Contessa was talking to her  friends in a slow, rich voice, and Beltrami&mdash;well, Beltrami was watching me  closely. Do you know that strange sensation of being watched? that uneasy  consciousness that some unseen eye is observing the least movement? Yes, of  course you do! Every one has felt it, in a more or less degree, according to  their nervous susceptibility. At the present time, with all my senses on the  alert for unexpected events, it was therefore little to be wondered at that I  felt the magnetism of Beltrami&rsquo;s gaze, and, on looking up, saw his keen black  eyes fixed upon me with an enigmatical expression. For the moment I was  startled, but immediately that feeling passed away for I well knew the strange  nature of the Marchese, which was a peculiar mixture of good and evil, of  kindness and cruelty, of hate and love, which must have proceeded from some  aberration of his subtle intellect.</p>
  <p>Beltrami&rsquo;s  face always put me in mind of that sinister countenance of Sigismondo  Malatesta, which sneers so malevolently at the curious onlooker from the walls  of the Duomo at Rimini. He had the same treacherous droop of the eyelids, the same  thin nose with wide, sensitive nostrils, and the same malignant smile on his  thin lips. Yet he was handsome enough, this young Italian; but his face, in spite  of my friendship, repelled me&mdash;in a less degree, it is true, but still it  repelled me in the like manner as did that of the Contessa Morone. So he was  going to marry her. Well, they were certainly well-matched in every respect,  and if the man had not the active wickedness of the woman, still the capability  of evil was there, and would awaken to life when necessary to be exercised.  Both Beltrami and his future wife were anachronisms in this nineteenth century,  and should have lived, smiled, and died in the time of the Renaissance, when  they would have been fitted companions of those Italian despots of whom  Macchiavelli gives the typical examples in his book &ldquo;The Prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese saw my inquiring look, and with an enigmatic smile walked across to  where I was standing in the warm, yellow light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene!  Signor Hugo,&rdquo; he whispered, with a swift glance at the Contessa, &ldquo;tell me what  you think of my choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does you credit, Marchese. You will have a beautiful wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a loving one, I hope. Tell me, mon ami, do you not envy me?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  hesitated a moment before replying, and then blurted out the truth,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honestly  speaking, Signor Luigi, I do not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  and why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I can hardly tell you my reasons, but I have them, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  looked hard at me with an inquisitive look in his dark eyes, and a satirical  smile on his thin lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not complimentary, my friend,&rdquo; he said, turning away with a supercilious  laugh.</p>
  <p>I  laid my hand on his shoulder and explained,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, Beltrami, you do not understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  do not apologise! I understand better than you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was evidently not at all offended, and I felt puzzled by his manner. It was  true he had candidly acknowledged that he was making this marriage for money,  but surely he must also love this woman, whose ripe beauty was so attractive to  the passionate nature of the Italians. Yet, judging from his mode of speech, he  evidently had some mistrust&mdash;a mistrust for which I could not account. He could  know nothing of the affair at the Palazzo Morone, so there certainly could be  no reason for suspicion on his part. She was a beautiful woman, a rich woman,  an attractive woman, so with this trinity of perfections she decidedly merited  a warmer love than Beltrami appeared inclined to give her. Could it be that her  evil beauty repelled him, as it did me? No! that was impossible, seeing that,  according to my idea, their natures were wonderfully alike. Altogether the  whole demeanour of the Marchese perplexed me by its strangeness, and I watched  him narrowly as he approached the Contessa, to see if she perceived the lack of  warmth on the part of her lover.</p>
  <p>To  my surprise, as he bent over her chair to speak, she shrank away with a gesture  of disdain, and the rubies shot forth a red flame, as if to warn the lover that  there was danger in pressing upon this woman his unwelcome attentions.  Unwelcome, I am sure they were, for as he adjusted her cloak and aided her to  rise, in order to return to the box, I saw that she accepted all his politeness  with forced civility and cold smiles. So then she did not love him&mdash;he had  almost openly acknowledged to me that he did not love her, and yet these two  people, who had no feeling of love in their hearts, were about to marry. It was  most extraordinary, and I marvelled greatly at the juxtaposition of these two  human beings, who evidently hated one another heartily.</p>
  <p>At  this moment the Contessa spoke of the man she had murdered, and I was horrified  in the cold, callous tones in which she veiled her iniquity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know, gentlemen, if anything has been heard of this lost tenor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  shot a keen glance at her, then a second at me, and I felt more bewildered than  ever by this strange action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  has been heard of him, Contessa,&rdquo; he said quickly, before the others could  speak; &ldquo;he has vanished altogether, but no doubt he will appear again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you think so?&rdquo; observed the Contessa, with a cruel smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  winced, and looked at him in a startled manner, upon which, impelled by some  mysterious impulse, I know not what, I joined in the conversation,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary, madame, I do not think Signor Pallanza will ever be seen again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  present turned round in surprise, and the Contessa darted a look at me which  seemed to pierce my soul. Only Beltrami was unmoved, and he, with a smile on  his face, laid his hand upon my shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Signor Hugo, and why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;A  mere fancy, Marchese, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! and a fancy that may turn out true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was annoyed at having yielded to the impulse and spoken out, as, unless I told  all about my adventure, I could not substantiate my statement, and I was  certainly not going to reveal anything I knew, particularly in the presence of  the woman so deeply implicated in the affair. Beltrami&rsquo;s mocking manner  irritated me fearfully, the more so as it was so very unaccountable, and I was  about to make some sharp reply, when the opening chorus of the last act  sounded, and all the gentlemen, after making their adieux to the Contessa, left  the room.</p>
  <p>The  Marchese offered his arm to Madame Morone, but she dismissed him with a haughty  gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Marchese&mdash;I wish to speak with this Signor for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  darted one of his enigmatic looks at us both, and with a low bow to conceal the  smile on his lips, left the room. As soon as he had disappeared, Madame Morone  turned round on me with a quick gesture of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Hugo, why did you say the tenor Pallanza would never be seen again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no reason, Signora,&rdquo; I replied, being determined to baffle her curiosity;  &ldquo;I merely spoke on the impulse of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know Signor Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  madame, I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  heaved a sigh of relief, and looked at me long and earnestly, as if to see  whether I was speaking the truth. Apparently she was satisfied with her  scrutiny, for she laughed softly, and placed her hand within my arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confess  now, Signor Hugo, you think me most mysterious, but I will tell you why I speak  thus. I heard Pallanza at Rome, when he sang at the Apollo, and I hoped to see  him again here, therefore I am annoyed at his disappearance and anxious for him  to be found. A selfish wish, Signor Hugo, for it is only my desire to hear him  sing again. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think your wish at all selfish, madame, for I hear he is a charming  singer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes! the New Mario they call him in Milan. Will you not hear the rest of the  opera in my box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will excuse me, madame, I will say no, as I have an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a lie, but I was so fearful of betraying myself to this terrible woman, who  had evidently a half-suspicion that I knew something of Pallanza, that I was  anxious to get away as soon as possible. She, saying good-night in a cold,  polite manner, re-entered the box, and I was moving away when Beltrami suddenly  appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Hugo, how cruel! the Contessa tells me you must go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes.  I will see you again, Marchese!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;To-morrow  then; if not, the next day. Here is my card, and I am always at home in the  afternoon. Do not fail to come, mon ami&mdash;I wish to speak to you about&mdash;about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, and I asked curiously,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! I forget. I will tell you at our next meeting! A rivederci! Signor Hugo.  Don&rsquo;t forget your old friend, or he will quarrel with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  nodded, smiled, and vanished, then I took my departure from the theatre, and  wandered up and down the street in the moonlight. I felt that to sit out the  ballet would be more than I could bear, as I was so excited over the meeting  with the Contessa Morone, therefore I strolled up and down the street, smoking  and thinking. As time passed on I grew calmer, and thought I would return to  the Ezzelino, not to see the ballet, but to catch a glimpse of the Contessa  once more.</p>
  <p>As  I reached the portico of the theatre she was just coming down the steps to her  carriage, leaning on the arm of Beltrami, and I, hidden in the crowd, could see  her looking hither and thither as if searching for some one. She could not see  me, and in order to satisfy myself in every way as to her identity with the  creature of the night I had seen leave the graveyard, with a sudden inspiration  I hummed a few bars of the strange song I had heard in the fatal chamber.</p>
  <p>Being  close to me she could hear quite plainly, and gave a kind of gasping cry as she  fell back into the arms of Beltrami, just as he was helping her into the  carriage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, cara?&rdquo; he asked quickly. She clutched his arm with so powerful a  grasp that it made him wince, and I heard her mutter with white lips,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pallanza!  Pallanza!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was all I wanted to hear, and, fearful, of discovery, I threaded my way quickly  among the crowd, and hastened home to my hotel.</p>
  <p>I  had recognised Guiseppe, I had found the woman who had slain him, but I had yet  to discover where she had hidden the body of her victim&mdash;and then!&mdash; well, my  future movements would be guided by circumstances. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    Fiore Della Casa</b></h2>
  <p>I  DID not get much sleep that night after the excitements of the day, but towards  the morning fell into an uneasy slumber, during which I had fragmentary dreams  in which Pallanza the Contessa, and the antique chamber were all mixed up  together. One moment I was at the iron door of the tomb, and the guardian angel  took the semblance of Signora Morone; the next I was kneeling beside the corpse  of Pallanza, illuminated by the faint light of the candles; and I ever saw the  pallid shade of Donna Renata pointing towards the watchful face of her husband,  filled with ghastly meanings in the dim shadows. No wonder, after these  terrific visions which blended the real and the ideal, I awoke in the grey  morning light unrefreshed and haggard; so when the waiter brought me my roll  and coffee I left them untouched, and, lying quietly in bed, wondered what step  it was necessary to take next in solving this riddle.</p>
  <p>Riddle  do I say? No! it was a riddle no longer, save as to the visit of the Contessa  to the vault of her family, for otherwise everything was clear enough. She had  met Pallanza at Rome, and had fallen in love with his handsome face. The young  man, flattered by the attentions of a great lady, had yielded readily enough to  the charm of the situation, but, growing tired of the intrigue, had come to  Verona, where Bianca awaited him, with the intention of breaking it off. With a  woman of Giulietta Morone&rsquo;s fiery nature the sequel can easily be guessed&mdash;she  had followed him hither, and having in some way forced him to come to the  deserted palace, had there poisoned him out of revenge for his contemplated  infidelity.</p>
  <p>Of  course, this was all theoretical, but from one thing and another I guessed that  this could be the only feasible way of accounting for the whole affair. Two  points, however, remained to be cleared up before the reading of the riddle  could be successfully accomplished: the first being the reason of the burial-ground  episode, the second the strange disappearance of the dead man&rsquo;s body.</p>
  <p>In  thinking over the legend related by Peppino, one thing struck me as  peculiar&mdash;that Donna Renata had never been seen again after her husband entered  the chamber, and I guessed from this that there was some secret oubliette or  alcove in the room, with a concealed entrance in which Mastino Morone had  entombed his guilty wife as a punishment for her crimes. Doubtless, from  tradition or from old family papers, Madame Morone knew of this secret hiding place,  and having killed Pallanza, had put his body therein so as to destroy all  evidences of her criminality. No one had seen Pallanza enter this deserted  palace, so once his body was hidden in the secret alcove it would remain there  for ever undiscovered, and no human being, save the Contessa herself, could ever  tell what had become of him. She, for her own sake, would remain silent, and  thus Guiseppe Pallanza&rsquo;s fate would remain a mystery for evermore.</p>
  <p>Fortunately,  however, God, who had thus permitted this evil woman to conceive and carry out  her crime, had also permitted me to behold the murder, so that, secure as she  no doubt felt of her safety, yet one word from me and the whole affair would be  revealed. I never thought, however, of going to the Veronese police and telling  them what I had seen, as in their suspicions of foreigners they would doubtless  regard me as an accessory, and thus I would get myself into trouble, which I  had no desire to do. I therefore determined to once more go to the fatal  chamber and make a final effort to discover what had become of the body of the  unfortunate Pallanza.</p>
  <p>So  far so good, but now the question arose. How much of this story was I to reveal  to Bianca? I could not tell her the whole, for if the body of her lover were  discovered, the poor child would suffer quite enough without the additional information  of Guiseppe&rsquo;s infidelity; so, making a virtue of necessity, I determined upon  telling her a pious lie. To do this it was necessary to leave out the Contessa  Morone altogether, as the least mention of a woman&rsquo;s name would arose Bianca&rsquo;s  suspicions, and for the Contessa I substituted a robber, who had decoyed.  Guiseppe to the deserted palace by means of a false letter, and there ended his  life. Of course it was somewhat difficult to be consistent in the narrative;  but I was so anxious to hide the cruel truth of Pallanza&rsquo;s worthlessness from  Bianca that I went over the story I had invented, again and again, until I  thought I had the whole pious fraud quite perfect.</p>
  <p>Having  thus arranged my plans, I arose, finished my roll and coffee, then, having  dressed myself, rapidly, set off at once for the Casa Angello, as it was nearly  time for my lesson. All my bruises were now quite well, yet I felt very depressed  and downcast, as the state of nervous excitement which I had been in for the  last few days had told terribly on my system. However, having once put my hand  to the plough I could not, with satisfaction to myself, turn back; and although  I heartily dreaded the coming interview with Bianca, yet it was unavoidable, as  the poor child was so anxious over her lost lover that it was necessary to tell  my fictitious story without delay in order to set her mind at rest.</p>
  <p>On  my arrival at the Casa Angello I found no one there but Bianca, who was  anxiously awaiting me. It appeared that the Maestro had taken it into his head  that he would like a walk in the sunshine, and had gone out under the care of  Petronella; but, as Bianca knew I was coming to take my usual lesson, and was  anxious to hear if I had any news of her lover, she remained indoors to speak  to me.</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;Fior&egrave; della Casa,&rdquo; as old Petronella tenderly called her in the poetic  language of the Italians, looked even paler than usual, and the dark shadows  under her dark eyes made them appear wonderfully large and star-like. She had a  bunch of delicate lilies-of-the-valley in the bosom of her white dress, and she  looked as pale and blanched as the frail flowers themselves. Lying back on the  green-covered sofa on which she was seated, she reminded me of a late snowflake  resting on the emerald grass of early spring, which at any moment might vanish  under the pale rays of the sun.</p>
  <p>We  were talking together in the room in which I generally had my lessons, and my  eyes wandered from one thing to another with vague hesitation as I looked  everywhere but on the face of this delicate girl to whom I had to tell such a  cruel story&mdash;for, soften it as I might, the story was cruel and could not fail  to affect her terribly. Every object in the apartment photographed itself on my  memory with terrible distinctness, and, even after the lapse of years, by  simply closing my eyes I can recall the whole scene with the utmost  truthfulness. The dull red of the terra-cotta floor, the heavy time-worn  furniture, covered with faded green rep, the small ebony piano with its  glistening white keys alternating with the black, the mirror-fronted press in  which Petronella kept everything from food to clothes, the many photographs of  operatic celebrities, and the gaudily painted picture of St. Paul, the  Maestro&rsquo;s patron saint, encircled by a faded wreath of withered laurel-leaves  and dead flowers, flung to some favourite pupil in her hour of triumph. Even  the view from the window I can recall, with the slender campanile tower, from  whence every quarter rang the brazen bells, and then the faltering voice of  Bianca, &ldquo;Fiore della Casa,&rdquo; stealing like a melancholy wind through the silence  of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor!&rdquo;  she said, twisting her thin white hands nervously together, &ldquo;you have something  to tell me of Guiseppe. I can see it in your face&mdash;is it good or evil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does my face tell you, Signorina?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evil,  evil! your eyes are sad, your mouth does not smile! Oh, tell me quickly what  you know! Is he found? is he ill? is he&mdash;dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  brought out the last word in a shrill scream, with dilated eyes that almost  terrified me by the fear expressed in them, and, dreading the effect of a  sudden shock on this fragile child, I hastily replied in the negative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signorina, no! Do not look so fearful, I pray you. He is not dead. Child, I am  sure he is not dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have not found him yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I have not found him, but I think I know where he is to be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Signor Hugo, tell me all&mdash; tell me all. See, I am strong, I can  bear it&mdash;I wish to know everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  the note which Guiseppe Pallanza received at the Ezzelino was not from a friend  but from an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  enemy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  from one who wished him ill. Thinking it was from his dying friend, he obeyed  the letter and was lured to the deserted Palazzo Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know that palazzo, Signor. I am a stranger in Verona.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know where it is, Signorina, for on that night I was wandering about near it,  when I saw Pallanza go into it alone. Knowing the evil reputation of the place,  I followed him, although he was a stranger to me. He went to a room in the  palace where his enemy met him, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes, Signor&mdash;for the love of the Saints, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you no more, Signorina, except that I do not believe Guiseppe left  that room again. I believe he is there still, perhaps held captive by the  robber who lured him thither in the hope of obtaining a ransom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  looked at me searchingly. She was a simple little thing as a rule, but this ridiculous  story I had manufactured of brigands in the heart of Verona was too much even  for her confiding nature, and she made a gesture of disbelief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not true! it is not true!&rdquo; she cried vehemently. &ldquo;Why do you deceive me,  Signor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not deceiving you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  enemy! a false letter! a deserted palace! held captive! Oh, I cannot believe  it. If it is true, why did you not rescue him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  some one I do not know seized me from behind as I watched, and, rendering me  insensible with chloroform, bore, me away from the palace. I had great  difficulty in finding it again, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Signor,  your story is that of a dream. I cannot believe you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  said nothing, but tapped her little foot on the ground with a thoughtful frown on  her small face. I was glad that my task was over, for absurd as was the story I  had told her, it was more merciful than the truth. Now that I had to some  extent quieted her fears by telling her that Guiseppe was alive&mdash;a thing, alas!  that I could not be certain of myself&mdash;I hoped to get away at once to the  Palazzo Morone and make one last effort to find his body. If I failed there  would be nothing left for me to do but to inform the police, and in the  interests of Bianca I was unwilling to do this until I had exhausted every  means of solving the mystery myself.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Bianca&rsquo;s face cleared, and she looked at me with steady determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor,  you know this palazzo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  this room where you think Guiseppe is held captive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,  Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take me to it at once.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  started to her feet with a deep flush on her face, and threw out her hands  towards me with an appealing gesture. As for me, I sat still, transfixed with  astonishment at the spirit displayed by this gentle girl, who was thus willing  to dare the dangers of the unknown in order to save her lover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  me to it at once!&rdquo; she repeated quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  I&mdash;I cannot. You are mad to think of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  your story true or false, Signor Hugo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True!  yes, it is true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will judge of its truth myself&mdash;with my own eyes. Wait, I will put on my hat,  and you will take me to this palazzo at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  another word, I have made up my mind. You promised to be my friend, Signor  Hugo. I hold you to that promise. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was gone before I could utter further remonstrance, and during her absence I  reflected rapidly. It was true that Guiseppe was dead, that I believed his body  was concealed somewhere in that room, so perhaps after all it was best that  Bianca should come, as her quick woman&rsquo;s wit might succeed where I had failed.  She knew nothing about the implication of the Contessa Morone in the affair,  the palazzo would be quite deserted during the daytime, so I would be able to  take her there, let her examine the room, and if by chance the truth was  revealed that Guiseppe was dead, it would be a more merciful way than by the  lips of a stranger. Yes, I would take her there at once. If we failed in our  mission she would be no wiser than before, but if we succeeded&mdash;ah! how I pitied  the poor child if we succeeded in finding out the terrible secret of the  Contessa. At this moment she returned trembling with ill-suppressed excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Signor Hugo, are you ready&mdash;are you willing to help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  all my heart, Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene!  come, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  ran lightly out of the room, and I followed with a heavy heart, for I had a  presentiment of evil. I feared that fatal chamber, which held so many impure  memories&mdash;I feared the discovery of the dead&mdash;I feared for this child who went  forward in ignorance to face such horrors. </p>

    A Voice In The Darkness</b></h2>
  <p>ON  returning from my last visit to the palace I had carefully noted the way  thereto, so I was able to escort Signorina Angello without calling in the services  of Peppino. I was unwilling to drive there, as the presence of a fiacre even in  that deserted piazza might be noticed, and I did not want any comment made by  the scandal-loving Italian populace on our visit to this out-of-the-way  locality. So in company with Bianca, who had put on a veil, and who said  nothing to me from the time we left Casa Angello, being apparently occupied  with her own reflections, I walked down the gloomy, narrow streets towards that  terrible Palazzo Morone, the very idea of which inspired me with horror and  dismay.</p>
  <p>It  was one of those burning days common to that time of the year in Italy, and  much as I despised and cursed those drain-like alleys in wet weather, yet I now  saw there was method in the madness of their style of building, for their cool  shadow and humid atmosphere was wonderfully pleasant after the glare, the dust,  and heat of the great piazza. We walked on the broad carriage-way, which was  less painful to the feet than the cobble-stone paving between, and every now and  then saw some typical picture of Italian life. A dark-faced woman with a red  handkerchief twisted carelessly round her head, leaning from a high balcony, on  the iron railings of which was displayed the family washing; a purple cloud of  wisteria blooming in some pergola near the red roof-tops; sleek grey donkeys  laden with panniers, stepping complacently along the narrow way; slender Italian  men presiding over fruit-stalls, piled high with their picturesque contents;  and over all, the vivacious clatter and din of voices, struck through at times  with the sharp, metallic notes of the mandolin. It was very charming, and I  would have enjoyed it thoroughly, artistically speaking, had it not been for  the local odours. Oh, the smells of those picturesque streets! they were too  terrible for description; and how the Italians are not swept off the face of  the earth by a plague of typhoid is more than I can understand. I smoked  cigarettes most of the time, as a preventive against infection; but on  beholding ideal paintings of Italian scenes, I always shudder at the memory of  the malodorous reality, and on arriving in well-drained London again, my first  prayer was one of thanks for having escaped from ill-smelling Italy.</p>
  <p>My  thoughts during this portentous walk were, I am afraid, rather frivolous; but  so fearful had been the strain on my nerves for the past few days, that it was  a great relief to think idly of anything and any one. Not so Bianca; even  through her veil I could see the glisten of tears, and catch the sound of her  quick indrawn breath as she strove to fight down the emotion that threatened to  overwhelm her. I saw that the poor child was nearly hysterical with her efforts  to control herself, and stopped short in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  you are not well. Do not go to this palazzo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes! I must, Signor Hugo. I cannot pass another night in this state of  suspense. I must know all, and at once. Is the Palazzo Morone far off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are just at it, Signorina.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so we were; for at that moment we entered the silent, grass-grown square, at  the end of which stood the palazzo, looking gruesome even in the sunshine, with  its broken windows, damp, disfigured walls, and general air of weird solitude.  Some swallows were shooting through the still air and twittering round the rich  sculptures of the facade, but their merry chirpings only added to the eerie  feeling inspired by the great mansion&mdash;a feeling which I noticed thrilled Bianca  with fear as she paused shuddering, under the grinning masks and unlovely faces  peering downward from the arched entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how could he come to this terrible place at night!&rdquo; she cried, crossing  herself, with a look of fear in her eyes. &ldquo;Desolate as it is in the sun, what  must it be when the moon shines! It is an abode of the dead&mdash;a tomb&mdash;a tomb! Dio!  his tomb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina;  do not affright yourself thus! Things may not be so bad as you think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is like the Inferno of Dante! and turns my blood cold with fear; but I will not  go back! I must find Guiseppe, even if it cost me my life. Come, Signor,  presto! there is no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  crossed herself once more, then flitted through the opening in the iron gate  like a noiseless-winged bird, upon which I hastily followed her, and we stood  for a moment in the lonely courtyard, gazing at the great portals of the door  leading to the hall, which stood half-open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  I will lead you to the room. You are not afraid? You do not tremble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I am afraid, and I do tremble, Signor, for I am only a girl; but lead on, love  will make me strong, and you will protect me. Give me your hand, Signor; I am  not afraid when I hold your hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a fleeting smile on her pale lips, she placed her hand in mine, and as I  grasped its cold whiteness, I guessed how terrified this delicate,  superstitious girl was of this unholy place. But for the resolute look on her  pallid face, I would have insisted upon her turning back; but it was useless to  urge retreat now, so with the name &ldquo;Guiseppe! Guiseppe!&rdquo; on her lips, as if to  inspire her with courage, she almost dragged me through the half-closed door  into the hall of shadows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Mother Mary, it is like a church!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was like a church&mdash;like some old deserted church, filled with the chill  atmosphere of the grave; and the slow movement of the wind-shaken tapestries,  the glimmer of the ghostly white stairs in the dim distance, and the solemnity  of the huge pillars of black marble, made me think of those God-cursed cities of  the &ldquo;Thousand and One Nights,&rdquo; whose silence is only broken by the voice of the  one survivor chanting the melancholy verses of the Koran. Bianca, overpowered  by this mute spectacle of a dead past, clung convulsively to my arm with  faltering prayers on her lips, and I became afraid lest, by a feeling of  sympathy, her terror should unnerve me also, so with a cheerful laugh, which  echoed dismally through the vast vestibule, I led her onward towards the grand  staircase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  Signorina, do not be afraid. You are quite safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes! Guiseppe! Guiseppe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  slowly ascended. the staircase, gained the corridor, and at length arrived at  the second flight of shallow steps leading to the secret room. Here Bianca,  seeing the darkness, nearly fainted with nervous fear, for, deeply imbued with  grim Italian superstitions, she beheld unseen terrors in every shadowy comer. I  again wanted her to return, but with willful obstinacy she refused, so, as I  luckily had a pocket-flask of brandy with me, I made her take a little to  revive her. The fiery spirit put new life into her sinking limbs, and, after  lighting my candle as usual, I led her up the steps, through the short  corridor, through the tapestried ante-chamber, until at last we stood in the  fatal room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  Signor Hugo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  flung back her veil with a feverish gesture, and peered into the darkness, which  was hardly broken by the feeble light of the small candle I carried. Suddenly a  thought struck me which I at once put into execution, and lighted all the  tapers yet remaining in the candelabra on the table. To the darkness succeeded  a blaze of mellow light, and Bianca, with a look of surprise on her face, gazed  round the singular room with the white pillars, the ominous blood-red hangings,  and the banquet of the dead set forth with such splendid display on the gilt  table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a strange room!&rdquo; she said timidly. &ldquo;Signor Hugo! what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have told you all I know, Signorina. Your lover was lured to this room. I saw  him pass through that door, and then I was drugged as I have said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not then see who received him here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  first part of the lie was difficult to utter on account of a choking feeling in  my throat, but the last sentence came out with tolerable grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you do not think Guiseppe left this room again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid not, Signorina!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,  where can he be?&rdquo; she asked with an anxious look around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think he is concealed in some secret cell, the entrance to which is from this  apartment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Signor Hugo, let us look for it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  meal on the table&mdash;all this gold and silver. It is a robbers&rsquo; cave, Signor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;es&mdash;I  suppose so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  let us be quick then, or the robbers may arrive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  looked nervously towards the door, but I, taking a candle off the table,  reassured her with a gay laugh,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not be afraid, Signorina. No one comes here during the day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Infected  by her terror my heart gave a jump, and I listened intently, but could hear no  sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is nothing, Signorina. Your nerves are unstrung!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! I can hear it. Some one is coming. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  order to humour her fancy I remained silent with all my senses on the alert,  and with a feeling of dread I heard the sound. The light fall of footsteps, the  rustle of a silken dress&mdash;a dress!&mdash; the full horror of the situation rushed on  me at once.</p>
  <p>It  must be the Contessa Morone!</p>
  <p>In  a moment I had blown out all the candles, and, dragging Bianca with me,  retreated in the darkness to the far end of the room. The girl gave a little  cry as the lights disappeared, but I pressed her hand significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,  Signorina. Not a word!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>At  the time I heard the steps they were at the door of the ante-chamber, where the  new-comer was evidently pausing a moment, and as the curtains of the inner room  had been half drawn aside on our entrance, it was for this reason we had heard  them so clearly. The steps recommenced. I heard their soft, light fall on the  marble floor, the rustle of the silken gown, like the sound of dry leaves in an  autumnal wind, and then I felt that this woman was standing in the arched doorway,  looking straight at myself and the shrinking girl through the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  are you here, Signor Hugo, and who is that woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the voice of the Contessa, and I gave a cry of horror as I suddenly  remembered how ineffectual the darkness was to conceal us from the eyes of this  nyctalopist. Bianca, however, knew nothing of this woman, or of her gift of  seeing in the dark; so, overcome with fear at the demoniac power she believed  the unknown possessed, she gave a shriek of terror and sank fainting at my  feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  the voice of the Contessa sounded cruel and menacing in its tones; so feeling  myself at a disadvantage in the dark, through not possessing the terrible  attribute of this woman, I staggered forward and lighted the candles. At once  out of the gloom sprang that evil face with a frown on the white brow, a deadly  glitter in the cruel eyes, and an ominous tightening of the thin lips. </p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t think I can call myself a coward, but at that moment my blood ran cold at  the horror of that Medusa-like countenance, and I stood before this phantom of  Lucrezia Borgia as if turned into stone, unable to move or speak.</p>
  <p>The  Contessa moved forward to the table and looked at me steadily, with a wicked  smile frozen on her red lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not reply, Signor Hugo; but I begin to understand. You have been here  before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hardly recognised my own voice, so hoarse and broken did it sound, stealing in  a whisper from between my dry lips. She still looked at me steadily, and I felt  fascinated with dread by the snake-like glare of those cruel eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  were you here, Signor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  Monday night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saw&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; she said in a meaning tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  I replied, lifting my head boldly, &ldquo;I saw you receive Guiseppe Pallanza, and I  saw you give him the poisoned cup!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a cry of rage like a trapped animal, and made a step forward, but  restraining herself with a powerful effort, sank into a chair and leaned her  elbow on the table. Dressed in heavy black garments of velvet and silk, she  looked more like the Borgia than ever, and the ruby necklace she constantly  wore flashed forth rays of red fire in the glimmer of the tremulous light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand now why you said Guiseppe Pallanza would not come back,&rdquo;she said  with a scornful smile. &ldquo;I thought last night you knew more than you told. Eh!  Signor, and it was you who sang at the door of the Ezzelino.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meddlesome  Englishman that you are, do you not fear that I will treat you as I treated  that false one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I mistrust your wine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  Signor Macchiavella! forewarned is forearmed. So you came here to look for  Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  came to look for his body, Madame Morone, but I do not know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  nor will you find it. And who is this woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guiseppe&rsquo;s  betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Contessa gave a cry of rage, and, rising from her seat, rushed towards the  unconscious girl where she lay in the darkness. Owing to her singular gift she  needed no light to see by, but examined the face of her rival minutely in the  gloom. I had stepped forward, fearing lest, carried away by jealous anger, she  should do the poor child an injury; but such was not her intention, for after a  minute&rsquo;s examination, she arose from her stooping position with a burst of  wicked laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it was for this white-faced thing that he was going to leave me&mdash;me, Giulietta  Morone! Eh, I feel much flattered at having such a rival. Why is she here,  Signor Hugo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  find Pallanza,&rdquo; I replied shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will never find him; he is lost to her for ever. But,&rdquo; she added, with a wicked  smile, &ldquo;I am not afraid of your betraying me, Signor Hugo. I am nhot afraid of  this poor fool, who thought to take Guiseppe from me, so I will revenge myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenge  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I have said it You came here like a thief in the night, and saw what you were  not meant to see. She comes in the daylight to seek her lover. Well, she shall  see him. Wait till she revives, and I will blast her eyes with the sight of  what he is now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a demon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a wronged woman, whom a man sought to deceive. Ecco! Behold, then, Englishman  that you are, how we Italian women revenge ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  stepped past the unconscious body of the girl, and, going to one of the pillars  on the right side of the room, apparently touched a spring, for the whole  pillar&mdash;which, as I have described before, was half built into the wall&mdash;revolved  slowly with a grating sound and displayed a cavity. I bent forward with a  shudder of horror, and saw&mdash;nothing!</p>
  <p>The  cavity was empty!</p>
  <p>Signora  Morone gazed at it with a look of horror on the wild beauty of her face; then,  with a cry of rage, of fear, and of dread, rushed out of the room.</p>
  <p>I  heard her shriek, &nbsp;&ldquo;Lost! lost! lost!&rdquo;  three times, then the sound of her retreating footsteps died away in the  distance, and I was left alone in the ghastly gloom with the unconscious girl  at my feet, and an agony in my heart such as I never hope to feel again in this  life.</p>
  <p>How  I got out of that accursed room I hardly know; but I faintly remember lifting  Bianca in my arms, and, guided by instinct, staggering through the dark  corridors, down the silent stairs, and out into the courtyard. The fresh air  seemed to revive me, and, collecting my scattered senses together with a  gigantic effort, I looked round for some means by which to bring Bianca out of  her faint, the length of which alarmed me terribly.</p>
  <p>In  the corner of the courtyard there was a sculptured trough, which the late rains  had brimmed over, so, hastening, towards this, I filled my cap with water, and,  returning to Bianca, threw it in her face.</p>
  <p>She  revived slowly with a shuddering sigh, and looked round vacantly; then, with a  sudden recollection of what she had come through, she flung herself into my  arms with an imploring cry,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that voice! that voice! Take me away from that cruel voice!&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    The Marchese Beltrami</b></h2>
  <p>I MANAGED  to take Bianca home without much difficulty, for it was my good fortune to meet  a disengaged fiacre in one of the narrow streets leading to the piazza Vittorio  Emanuele, and placing the poor girl therein, we drove straight to the Casa  Angello. The Signorina was in a very excited state, as that menacing voice,  issuing out of the darkness, had quite unnerved her; so, placing her in charge  of Petronella, who made her lie down, I went for a doctor. Being a stranger in  Verona it was difficult to find one, but at last I did so, and took him at once  to see Bianca, for whom he prescribed a soothing draught, and assured me that  she would be all right after a few hours&rsquo; sleep. This trouble therefore being  off my mind, I went back to my hotel, in order to consider what was best to be  done in the present emergency.</p>
  <p>I  now saw that my surmise was right, and that the Contessa had hidden the body of  the unfortunate Pallanza in the concealed tomb contrived by Count Mastino  Morone for his guilty wife. It was a horribly ingenious idea that revolving  pillar, and no one would have guessed its ghastly secret without being shown.  Doubtless the wicked Donna Renata, shut up in this circular prison, had there  starved slowly to death in an upright position, for, of course, the cavity was  too narrow and too shallow to admit of any human being lying down. The skilful  devilry of the device made me feel quite ill, especially when I thought how the  worthy descendant of Borgia&rsquo;s accursed daughter had utilised this secret cell  for her own infamous purpose. In this frightful oubliette the body of Guiseppe  Pallanza would have remained for ever concealed; but then, according to the  evidence of my own eyes, the body was not there.</p>
  <p>That  the Contessa had placed the corpse in the pillar I had not the slightest doubt,  as in showing the hiding-place she evidently expected to overwhelm me by the  hideous evidence of her barbarous criminality. That the cavity was empty was as  much a surprise to her as to me, and the shriek of terror she had given when  flying from the chamber showed me that she was overpowered with fear at the  thought that her gruesome secret was shared by another person, for, putting me  out of the question altogether, there appeared to be a third party implicated  in this singular affair.</p>
  <p>For  my own part I believed it to be the man who had watched with me at the  curtained archway, and who, after drugging me, bore me insensible from that  terrible place. After doing so, and thus, according to his idea, putting it out  of my power to re-discover the palace, he had returned to his post and seen the  Contessa conceal the body of her victim in the cavity of the pillar. On her  departure, for some reason best known to himself, he had removed the corpse,  and hidden it somewhere else. This was, no doubt, the true story of the affair,  but who was the man who had watched at the door, and who had taken away the  body of Pallanza? It was impossible to guess the reasons for his behaving in  this mysterious way, and the Contessa was evidently as ignorant as myself of  his actions, judging from her terrified flight on discovering the truth.  Whomsoever this unknown person was, he, to all appearances, held the key to the  whole riddle, and, could I find him, I would doubtless learn the reason of  Madame Morone&rsquo;s visit to the burial-ground, and the final fate of the unhappy  tenor whom she had lured to his destruction.</p>
  <p>But  how to find him! that was the question, and one to which I could find no  satisfactory answer; so in the dilemma in which I thus found myself involved, I  decided to tell Luigi Beltrami, as the only friend I had in Verona, the whole  devilish story. In addition to the desire I felt of asking his advice and  opinion, I thought it but right that he should know the real character of the  woman he was about to marry, and not discover too late that he was tied for  life to a ghoul, a vampire, a murderess.</p>
  <p>With  this determination I looked for the card the Marchese had given me, and finding  it in one of my pockets, discovered that my Italian friend lived in the Via  Cartoni. As he had mentioned that he was always at home in the afternoon,  doubtless to take a siesta during the heat of the day, on finishing my midday  meal I went out to pay him a visit.</p>
  <p>In  spite of his assertion that he was poor, Beltrami had a sufficient income to  warrant him living in a moderately expensive manner, and on my arrival at his  rooms in the Via Cartoni, I was shown into a very well-furnished apartment. As  the Marchese was stationed with his regiment at Verona for some considerable  time, he had evidently brought a portion of his furniture from his Florentine  palazzo, for the room was too handsome to be that of the ordinary class of  furnished apartments. As usual, the ceiling was charmingly painted; the floor  was of marble, covered here and there with square Turkish carpets; and in  addition to a piano there were plenty of pictures and photographs, showing the  artistic taste of the owner of the place.</p>
  <p>Beltrami  himself, dressed as usual in his uniform, was seated at a desk placed in the  window, writing letters, but he desisted when I was announced, and arose to  greet me with marked cordiality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, Hugo, this is kind of you to call so soon,&rdquo; he said when I was comfortably  established in a chair. &ldquo;I was just writing you a letter asking you to dine  with me and go to the Ezzelino to-night, but as you are here the note is  useless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fact is, my dear Marchese, I have called on a selfish errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  still it is one that concerns yourself also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so, mon ami? Come, tell me this mystery about which I know nothing and you know  everything; but first here are some excellent cigarettes&mdash;Russian, my friend,  not Italian. Dio! the tobacco of this country, it is horrible. Will you have  some wine?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you, Beltrami, but I will be glad to smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  pushed the box towards me, and, after I had taken a cigarette, followed my  example, then, throwing himself into a chair near me, he nodded his head to  show that he was ready to hear what I had to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marchese!&rdquo;  I said, after some slight hesitation, &ldquo;I think we are old enough friends to  admit of my speaking to you freely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  certainly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust you will not be offended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  blew a wreath of smoke, and laying back his handsome head on the cushions of  the chair, laughed heartily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my doubting Englishman, I promise you I will not be offended at anything you  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Luigi, it is about the Contessa Morone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  about the Contessa?&mdash;I thought as much!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;How  so?&rdquo; I asked in some surprise.</p>
  <p>The  face of the Marchese assumed that cruel, cunning look I so much disliked to  see, and he eyed me in a nonchalant manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  Signor Hugo, I will tell you when I hear your story of the Contessa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  committed to narrative, I told Beltrami the whole story of my adventure from  the time I had seen the Contessa at the graveyard to the hour when she had fled  in dismay from the Palazzo Morone. He listened attentively, and when I had  finished remained silent for a few minutes with a thoughtful look on his dark  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you tell me all this, mon ami?&rdquo; he asked, at length, twisting his moustache  in a reflective manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  two reasons. First, you may be able to aid me in my search for Pallanza; and  second, you must have been ignorant of the character of the woman you are going  to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to the first reason, Hugo, you are right. As to the second, you are wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know most of the story you have told me, and as to the Signora Morone, mon  Dieu! I know her better than she does herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why marry her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  shrugged his shoulders and selected another cigarette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  she is rich and I am poor. It is time I ranged myself, as the French say, and I  cannot afford to marry a poor wife; besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Besides  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  rather like the task of taming this demon of a woman. Madame Morone is Satan&rsquo;s  mistress in the matter of temper, I know, but I come of a race who either broke  the will of their wives or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo;  I asked interrogatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  killed them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rather risky nowadays, Marchese. We do not live in the time of the Renaissance  remember. But let us leave off this discussion of Madame Morone. I have told  you my story, and you say you knew most of it before!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I say truly. Now listen, you cold-blooded islander, and see if I cannot disturb  your phlegmatic disposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused a moment to give greater weight to his remarks, the conclusion of which  I impatiently awaited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was the man who drugged you and had you carried to the Piazza Vittorio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was the man who carried away the body of Guiseppe Pallanza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am the man who, knowing what I do, calmly and with open eyes, have made up my  mind to marry Madame Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  was so overwhelmed with the disclosures made by Beltrami that I could only sit  thunderstruck in my chair, looking like an idiot and repeating &ldquo;You! you! you!&rdquo;  parrot-fashion. Beltrami enjoyed my confusion for some time, and then went on speaking  with a mocking smile:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  I astonish you, Hugo. Well, I admit I treated you rather badly, my friend; but  then at the time I did not know whom you were. Dame! I cannot see in the dark  like Madame Gatta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese then was the man who held the key to this enigma, and, far from being  offended at his rough treatment of me on that fatal night, I was only too  delighted at discovering the unknown person who, in this strange repetition of  the old legend, had played the part of Count Mastino Morone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have rather startled you, I fancy, Hugo?&rdquo; said Beltrami with an ironical laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would be a fool to deny it; but now that your dramatic surprise has come off so  excellently, perhaps you will tell me what it all means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  doubt; confidence for confidence! Besides, I want your help to carry this  comedy to its legitimate conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Comedy,  you call it? To my mind it is more like a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are wrong, mon ami. In a tragedy there must be a death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  You forget Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, Hugo; that is the whole point. Pallanza is not dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stared at the Marchese in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pallanza  not dead! Impossible! I saw him die on that night.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw him fall insensible at the feet of the Contessa Morone, but insensibility  is not death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he is alive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally!  One must either be alive or dead. And as this devil of a tenor is not the  latter, he must therefore be the former.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  that is part of the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  epigrammatic fencing on the part of Beltrami annoyed me greatly, as it piqued  my curiosity without satisfying it, and I threw my half-smoked cigarette away  with an outburst of bad temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Luigi, you have promised to tell me the story of this mystery, and instead  of doing so you fire off epigrammatic squibs like Pasquin during the Carnival.  The story, the story! I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  certainly! Then take another cigarette, and I will tell you this &lsquo;Thousand and  Second Night&rsquo; romance.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Death In Life</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;IT  is such a long story, Hugo,&rdquo; said Beltrami, a trifle maliciously, &ldquo;that we must  really have some wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want wine; I want &lsquo;The Thousand and Second Night.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  you shall have both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese arose and summoned his servant, who brought up a bottle of Barbera,  that rough-tasting wine which is so pleasant and cool in hot weather. For the  sake of companionship I took some with Beltrami, and haying thus attended to  the duties of hospitality, he signed to his servant to withdraw, and without  further preamble began his tale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  Hugo, mon ami,&rdquo; he said, settling himself comfortably in his chair, &ldquo;this would  be a charming story for M. Bourget, that modern Balzac, who analyses the hearts  of the ladies of this generation in so masterly a fashion. Dame! I would like  to give him Madame Morone&rsquo;s to dissect&mdash;he&rsquo;d find some strange things there.  Yet&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;this woman, worthy to be a sister of Lucrezia Borgia,  came out of a convent to marry my poor friend Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew him then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! I should think so, for many years. People said he was mad, but the only  mad action he committed, to my mind, was in marrying Giulietta Rossana.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you propose to do the same thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  but I possess a means of taming this tigress of which the unfortunate Giorgio  Morone knew nothing. He was a great chemist, this poor Count, and particularly  fond of toxicology, a dangerous science with such a wife, as he found out to  his cost. Cospetto! I would not care myself about forging weapons for another  to use against me, but that is exactly what Morone did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  poisoned him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  nobody says so, yet everybody thinks so. For my part, I believe the Contessa  capable of anything. At all events, Morone died very suddenly, and was duly  buried in that old ancestral vault to which his devoted wife, a year after his  death, paid a visit. Well, before he died, Morone grew suspicious of the  Contessa, and as he had just invented or rediscovered a poison which left no  trace of having been used, and also an antidote to the same, he determined not  to give the Signora an opportunity of exercising it on him, so this  toxicological secret was buried with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I see now why she went to the graveyard. It was to get this poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!  Whether it was put in the coffin of the dead man, or merely hidden in the  vault, I don&rsquo;t know, but we will go and see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  what end? She has the poison!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!  I believe that, after seeing it exercised upon Pallanza; but she has not got  the antidote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that, Beltrami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the Contessa knows nothing of the existence of the antidote. Morone talked  enough about the poison itself, but he only mentioned the antidote to one man,  and that was myself. You see, Hugo, he thought madame might try a little of his  own poison on himself, in which case I would be able to give him the antidote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  he have taken it himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  this poison does not kill unless given in a large quantity; five drops make you  feel chill and listless; ten drops take away your senses and converts you into  what I may paradoxically call a breathing corpse; but fifteen drops kill. So if  madame had given her husband fifteen drops he would have lapsed into a stupor  and died, unless the antidote was given, so that is why he bestowed it on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  but she killed him after all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but with another poison not of home manufacture. Eh! what would you, Hugo, the  Contessa was not going to be thwarted by a husband who kept his laboratory  locked. However, he tricked her over this particular poison, for he either gave  instructions that it was to be put into his coffin without the knowledge of his  dear wife, or he hid it himself in the vault, as he hinted to me one day he  intended to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no doubt then that the Contessa went to the vault for the poison; but what  about the antidote? Is it in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,  no, mon ami. I was ordered away from Verona, and gave back the antidote to the  Count; but on my return here; I heard casually that he had left a letter for  me, to be delivered after his death. I went to Rome, where the Contessa was one  of the ornaments of the Court, and asked for the letter. Of course she denied  ever having heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do you think was in this letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  ma foi, I believe it told me where the poison was hidden in the vault, and that  our dear Contessa found the letter, went to the vault on the night you saw her  and obtained the poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also  the antidote?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that. I knew about the antidote so well that I don&rsquo;t think  Morone would have mentioned it in the letter, in case it should meet the eye of  his wife. No! No! mon ami! she has the poison, of course; but the antidote, I  believe it is still in the vault; where we will look for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Diamine!  to revive this devil of a tenor who has had the misfortune to take ten drops of  the Signora Morone&rsquo;s mixture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  where is Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  in good time, Hugo, all in good time. I must tell you the rest of the story  first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am all impatience, Beltrami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese, I saw, was enjoying this conversation, as the subject-matter was of  an involved and difficult character which appealed to the subtleties of his  Italian nature; and the chance of playing a part in this intrigue, worthy of  the Court of Lorenzo di Medici, delighted him beyond measure. He was, as I have  said before, an anachronism, and this everyday, commonplace life of the  nineteenth century offered no field for the exercise of his cunning brain and  delicate diplomacy, which revelled in those bizarre complications, full of  sophistry and double meanings, which distinguished the intricate statecraft of  the Italian republics.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wonder,&rdquo; continued the Marchese reflectively; &ldquo;you wonder, no doubt, after  hearing my opinions about the Contessa Morone, that I should care to marry her;  but, as I told you before, there are reasons. I am poor, she is rich, and I  marry her for her money. This is brutal is it not? but then you see I look at  the matter from a Latin point of view, you from an English. As Euclid&mdash;whom, by  the way, I always hated&mdash;says, &lsquo;Two parallel straight lines cannot meet,&rsquo; it is  no use our arguing over this point, as neither of us would convince the other.  It is a question of race, Hugo, nothing more. Ebbene! my other reason is that I  wish to tame this woman with the heart of a tigress. I am wearied of the dullness  of this present life, and the task of fencing with Signora Morone will be a  perpetual excitement, particularly as I know it will not be unattended with  danger. This is also a question of race, and the theory of straight lines  applies, so again we will not argue; but you can see one thing plainly, that I  want to marry the Contessa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I can see that, and I wonder at your daring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Straight  lines, for the third time, Signor Hugo. Ebbene! Although I wanted to marry the  Contessa, she hating and detesting me with her whole soul, as a friend of her  late husband, would not listen to me at all, so as she would not go to the  altar willingly, I determined to force her there. I made it my business to find  out all about her life, and a devil of a life it is, I can tell you. Pallanza  is not the first lover this daughter of Venus has smiled on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  I broke out in disgust, &ldquo;how can you think of marrying this infamous woman&mdash;a  murderess, a poisoner, a fiend in human form?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  I have given you my reasons, and you, straitlaced Englishman that you are,  cannot understand them. However, we will talk of this again; meantime to  continue. The Contessa was so madly in love with Pallanza, who I grant you is a  handsome fellow with a charming voice, that I foresaw when he attempted to  leave her there would be trouble. I discovered that he was engaged to some  Signorina of Milan, that she was at Verona, and that Pallanza was going to sing  at Verona; so when he did arrive I was in nowise astonished at the appearance  of Madame Morone at the Ezzelino. Things were coming to a climax, so I watched  for the bursting of the storm. The rendezvous of these lovers would be, I knew,  at the deserted Palazzo Morone. How did I know? Mon cher ami, you are  simplicity itself. Have I not told you that I knew the Contessa when she lived  at Verona with her husband, and&mdash;and&mdash;well it is not the first time she has used  that palazzo and played at Boccaccian stories in that room. You know she  fancies herself like Lucrezia Borgia, and tries to imitate those picturesque  feasts to which Ferrara&rsquo;s Duchess was so addicted&mdash;yes, even to the use of  poison. Dame! I thought I was at the opera when I saw that supper the other  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you get into the palazzo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is an adventure worthy of Gil Bias. I filed through a bar in the gate and  wrenched it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;I  thought so, for I entered the same way!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guessed as much, my friend. Ebbene! I watched the palace from the time Madame  Morone arrived in Verona, and my patience was rewarded on Monday night by  seeing our picturesque tenor use his key and enter by the side door. I was not  alone, for I greatly mistrusted Madame Morone should she discover me in that  lonely palazzo; so, as I had two men absolutely devoted to me, I took them with  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were very brave to go near that ghastly palace, considering the reputation it  has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, they are Florentines, and know nothing about Verona. Their ancestors have  been in the service of mine for many years, and in their eyes a Beltrami can do  no wrong. Now is that not wonderful in this present age of ducats and steam-engines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  wonderful, Marchese, that I can hardly believe it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cospetto!  it is true I tell you. These men are absolutely devoted to me, and think me a  much greater man than Umberto of Savoy. Ebbene! I posted my two men in a dark  corner of the palazzo with instructions not to move until I told them; then I  went after our tenor, and found him strumming on the mandolin while he awaited  the arrival of the Contessa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  she had gone to the burial-ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I did not know that until you told me. However, I hid myself behind the  tapestry in the outer room and waited. The Contessa arrived, and, to my  surprise, you also appeared. I caught a glimpse of you at the door before that  torch went out, but, of course, I did not recognise you, and was puzzled to  account for your presence there. Luckily, I had a bottle of chloroform in my  pocket, which I took with me to the palace in case of accidents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what good would chloroform do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  have you ever seen Madame Morone in a rage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it is not a pretty sight, I can tell you. That woman is a devil, and, for all I  know, might have had some one in the palace to do her bidding. If I had been  found there, and taken at a disadvantage, I might have occupied that delightful  pillar and never been seen again. Ah! you smile, mon ami, but remember this is  Italy, not England, and with a woman like the Contessa, who recalls the Borgia  times so admirably, it is always well to be prepared. If she had discovered me,  my chloroform might have come in useful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;It  certainly did in my case!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, I&rsquo;ve told you before I did not know it was you. I only beheld a stranger,  and thinking that the stranger might interfere with my plans, I stole across  the antechamber, and when you fell back&mdash;well, I used my chloroform. Then I left  you lying hidden behind the tapestry, and went on watching Madame Morone at her  Borgian supper. She was dragging Pallanzas body to the pillar, and, having  safely shut him up there, departed with a satisfied smile on her face; so I was  left alone with two apparently dead men&mdash;Pallanza in the pillar, and you behind  the tapestry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sufficiently dramatic situation I think, Marchese.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  no doubt. There is more drama in life&mdash; especially in Italian life&mdash;than people  think, and there are even stranger events than this comedy of the Palazzo  Morone take place in our midst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what I have seen of your people, Luigi, I quite believe it. Well, about this  dramatic situation&mdash; what did you do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cospetto!  I played my part on the stage with great judgment, I can tell you. When I was  sure that Madame Morone had left the palazzo I re-lighted the candles, and went  to see what appearance my man behind the tapestry presented. To my surprise I  recognised Signor Hugo Cranston, and you may fancy I was considerably  astonished, as I could not understand how you had become mixed up in this  Boccaccian adventure. Friendship said, &lsquo;Revive him and apologize.&rsquo; Caution  remarked, &lsquo;Remove him from the palazzo, and let him think the events of the  night a dream.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  and you adopted the advice of caution?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Diavolo!  what else could I do? You might have interfered with my plans; and, besides, I  always intended to give you an explanation when the Contessa became the Marchese  Beltrami. Circumstances, however, have brought about the explanation sooner  than I intended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I see,&rdquo; I replied drily. &ldquo;However, you removed me from the palace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I called up my two men, and, telling them you were&mdash;well&mdash;overcome by Bacchus,  ordered them to take you to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele and leave you there.  Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Beltrami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  you reproach me. Well, I no doubt deserve your reproaches, but it was the best  excuse I could think of, as it doesn&rsquo;t do to trust servants too much. Ebbene!  they took you away and left you in the Piazza, where you awoke in the morning?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did, with a confounded headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! that was the chloroform, no doubt. Having thus arranged your little matter  I went to the pillar and released Guiseppe Pallanza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  She gave him ten drops, I tell you. So that, although he was not actually dead,  he had all the appearance of a corpse. I could not revive him as I had not the  antidote; so, when my two men returned, I had him brought here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!  In this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely!  he is in the next room. We will go and look at him presently. But to continue:  the next day I called upon the Contessa, and told her I had seen all,  suppressing, however, the fact that I had carried off this unfortunate lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  accounted for her surprise to-day on seeing the pillar empty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; she never dreamed that I would meddle with her work. Well, I gave her a  choice of either explaining her little adventure to the authorities, and thus  run a chance of being imprisoned for life, or of becoming my wife. Of these two  evils she chose the least; so now I am engaged to marry her, and she will  become the Marchese Beltrami next month. Interesting, is it not, Hugo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was no use arguing with this man, who, as he said himself, looked at the affair  in a totally different light from what I did, and I did not know whether to  loathe his brutal candour, to despise his mercenary designs, or to admire his  undoubted courage in marrying this woman. However, I reflected that his subtle  intriguing would undoubtedly be sufficiently punished by his marriage with this  tigress of a Contessa, and as my only desire was to restore Pallanza to the  arms of Bianca, I neither condemned nor praised Beltrami&rsquo;s singular conduct,  which seemed admirable in his own eyes, but simply complimented him on his  adroitness in following the precepts of Niccolo Macchiavella. He listened to my  cold remarks with a disbelieving smile on his face, and laughed mockingly when  I ceased speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Hugo, you do not approve of my ideas? Well, I do not wonder at that. Fire and  water are not more different than an Italian and an Englishman. Your cool blood  comes from generations of church-going, straight-laced ancestors, whose beliefs  ruled their lives in a simple manner; but my fiery blood burned in the veins of  those condottieri of the Renaissance who were at war with King and Pope and  Republic, who constantly stood on the verge of unseen precipices, and who  needed all their craft, their courage, and their iron nerve to preserve their  lives and fortunes. Dame! let us talk no more of such contrasts, but come with  me, and I will show you this missing lover of Madame Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  acquiesced eagerly in this proposal, and followed Beltrami, who led me into his  bedroom, and, having unlocked a door in the opposite wall, ushered me into a  small, bare apartment, containing a bed on which lay the still form of Guiseppe  Pallanza. There he was dressed the same as on that fatal night, with his eyes  closed, a frozen look on his white face, and his hands crossed on his breast.  Lying thus in his antique garb he put me in mind of one of those coloured  statues which adorn the tombs of great men; where the face, the hair, and the  vestments are all tinted so as to produce the semblance of life. But was life  here, in the body of this young man, who lay so passively before me with closed  eyes as though he were indeed buried in some sepulchre of the dead?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  he is alive,&rdquo; said Beltrami, guessing my thought as I shrank back from the bed;  &ldquo;it is a case of suspended animation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  lasting three,&mdash;four days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame,  yes! It would last much longer, I have no doubt. Ten drops produce this  life-in-death state which you see, fifteen drops the same thing; but the one  ends in death after a certain time, the other does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why did you not go to the vault and find this antidote at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  to tell you the truth, Hugo, I thought it would be a useless errand, as I do  not know where to look for it. I fancied that Madame Morone might have found  another bottle of this damnable poison, but it never struck me until I heard  your story that she had read the letter addressed by Morone to me, and gone to  the vault for the poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what are we to do now?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  to the vault, to be sure, and look for this antidote. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  the vault is locked!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  I forgot that,&rdquo; said Beltrami, with a thoughtful frown, &ldquo;however, I think I can  procure the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;From  Madame Morone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dame!  No! that would put her on her guard at once. I want her to think Pallanza is  still in this cataleptic state, otherwise she won&rsquo;t marry me, as my power over  her will be gone. I&rsquo;ll get the key somehow; if not, one of my men knows  something about picking locks, so we will take him with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  reputable servant, truly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  What would you!&rdquo; said Beltrami carelessly, as he led the way out of the room  and locked the door. &ldquo;Even lock-picking is useful on occasions&mdash;witness the  present one. Well, are you ready to go to the vault with me to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  night, Beltrami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  certainly. If we went in the day-time all Verona would be in commotion. No! we  must go at midnight when no one is about. Have you the courage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so! but I hope Madame Morone will not be there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no fear of that, as she has no reason to pay a second visit to the remains of  her husband. She has got the poison, and knows nothing about the antidote, so  make yourself easy on that score. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you going to do now, Marchese!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;See  if I can obtain that key. If I fail to obtain it, I will bring Matteo with me.  As for you, my friend, go and take something to eat, and meet me on the Ponte  Aleardi at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be there, Beltrami. Good-bye for the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  revederci, Hugo; I am obliged for your confidence, as it has solved the  difficulty of knowing what to do with Signor Cupid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  both went different ways; Beltrami to search for his key, and myself to hasten  home to my hotel, and prepare myself for the fatigues of this midnight  excursion, which, however much it appealed to the Marchese&rsquo;s sense of the  romantic, was certainly not relished by me.</p>

  &ldquo;Down Among The Dead Men&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Do  you know that gruesome old ballad, with its sombre refrain of &ldquo;Down! Down! Down  among the dead men?&rdquo; A friend of mine with a deep bass voice, used to sing it  in order to display his lower notes, upon which&mdash;and not without reason&mdash;he  flattered himself greatly; but in after years, I never heard it sung without a  shudder, so vividly did it recall to my mind the grotesque horror of that  midnight visit to the Tomb of the Morone, in that old burial-ground of Verona.  Of late I had been so much mixed up with ghosts, vaults, ghouls and crimes,  that I was by no means anxious to continue the category, and would have  infinitely preferred to have let Beltrami, who liked such uncomfortable things,  go alone; but being an Englishman, I had to uphold the honour of my country, so  never thought for a moment of showing the white feather. Besides, the only  chance of saving Pallanza was by obtaining possession of the antidote, and in  spite of my repugnance to the errand, I fully made up my mind to be on the  Ponte Aleardi at the appointed time.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  I fortified myself against possible horrors by having an excellent dinner,  supplemented by a small bottle of champagne. I could not afford that luxurious  wine, and it was sinfully extravagant of me to waste my small stock of money  upon such a thing, but in the face of this midnight adventure I really felt  that a little stimulant would comfort me under the circumstances. The result  was admirable, for all my nervous apprehensions disappeared, and I sat in the  smoking-room puffing at my after-dinner pipe in a very contented frame of mind,  considering what awaited me at twelve o&rsquo;clock p.m. Was I a coward? I don&rsquo;t  think so. Many men who have no physical fear, and would ride gaily enough into  battle, shrink with superstitious awe from the eerie neighbourhood of the dead,  and I, owing to the causes I have stated before, am of this class. Come, then,  ye dauntless scoffers, who would dare anything&mdash;in the broad daylight, and let  me see if you would contemplate a midnight visit to an antique vault with  equanimity! I think not, for however brave a man may be, it is the law of  Nature that he should thrill with fear at the approach of the supernatural.</p>
  <p>I  sat smoking and thinking in the twilight, which was a bad preparation for the  event, as twilight thoughts are invariably mournful, and my own dear dead ones  seemed to throng in the dusky shadow of the room, reproaching me in voiceless  grief for the intention I had of profaning the sanctity of the Tomb. To rid  myself of these melancholy reflections, and banish from my brain the mute crowd  of ghosts, I went out for a walk, intending to call at the Casa Angello, in  order to ask after the Signorina Bianca.</p>
  <p>Petronella  told me that the poor child was much better, but exhausted by the shock she had  sustained at the Palazzo Morone, and had fallen into a deep sleep which would  do her more good than all the drugs of the doctor. The worthy domestic was very  wrathful at me, and wanted to know what I had told her &ldquo;piccola,&rdquo; but I put her  off with some excuse, as I had no desire that she should know the events of  that day. On taking my departure I gave Petronella a note for the Signorina,  which contained only three words, &ldquo;Wait and hope,&rdquo; with instructions that it  was to be delivered to her when she woke up. Petronella, somewhat mollified by  my assurance that all would be right, promised to fulfil this commission, and I  returned to my hotel very contented with the present aspect of affairs.</p>
  <p>On  regaining my bedroom I lay down about eight o&rsquo;clock, in order to get a little  sleep, but the remedy was worse than the disease, for when my eyes were closed  the phantoms of waking hours reappeared still more vividly to my inner senses.  However, I fought against the dread which threatened to overwhelm me, and fell  into a comparatively dreamless slumber, from which I awoke shortly after  eleven. Rising from the bed upon which I had thrown myself half dressed, I  hurriedly completed my toilette, and bathed my burning face in cold water. On  my arrival in Milan, I had bought one of those picturesque Italian cloaks which  one only sees in England on the operatic stage, and throwing this around me, I  put on a soft black wide-awake, so that what with the mantle draped around me,  and my naturally dark face, I looked very much like a native of Italy. Lighting  a cigarette, I took my heavy stick, and thus prepared, went out to keep my  appointment with Luigi Beltrami on the Ponte Aleardi.</p>
  <p>To  the hot day had succeeded the hot night, but a strong dry wind was blowing  which drove the filmy clouds across the face of the haggard-looking moon. A few  stars peeped out here and there through the frail woof, and the chill moonlight  waxed and waned with the appearing and disappearing of the pale planet, almost  lost amid the wild confluence of drifting clouds. A misty circle round the moon  was prophetic of rain, and under this wild, wind-vexed sky lay the sleeping  city, dark and sombre, with the rough blasts sweeping drearily down the lonely  streets.</p>
  <p>In  spite of the heat, so eerie was the aspect of the night that I drew my cloak around  me with a shiver of nervous fear, and leaving the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele,  hastened along the Via Pallone, in the direction of the Ponte Aleardi. I  arrived there just as the clock of St. Fermo sounded the three-quarters, and as  Beltrami was not yet at the meeting place, I leaned on the balustrade of the  bridge and watched the grey waters swirling under the fitful light of the moon.  I could not help thinking of the strange events which had taken place since I  had last occupied the same position&mdash;the antique chamber with its associations  of love and crime&mdash;the Teatro Ezzelino, where I had beheld the phantom of  Lucrezia Borgia&mdash;the grief and pain of poor little Bianca, and the extraordinary  conversation I had held with Beltrami a few hours before. It was all most  unreal and feverish, this mediaeval intrigue into which I had been drawn; and I  question if any student of singing had ever before been involved in such a  bizarre adventure&mdash;an adventure which I hoped and prayed and trusted would end  to-night.</p>
  <p>Buried  in these sombre reflections I did not hear the sound of approaching footsteps,  and it was only when I felt a hand on my shoulder that I turned round, with a  sudden start, to see the Marchese standing beside me wrapped in his military  cloak, and accompanied by a man who waited a little way off in respectful  silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo,  Signor Hugo!&rdquo; cried the Marchese in a cheerful tone, &ldquo;you have been waiting  long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  a quarter of an hour. So you have not obtained the key, Beltrami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately  I have not! However, here is Matteo, and I daresay we shall manage to get the  door open in some way. Come, Caro,&rdquo; continued Beltrami, taking my arm, &ldquo;we have  no time to lose. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  do not believe Beltrami had any nerves, for the whole way to the burial-ground  he chatted cheerfully about the antidote, the Contessa and the tenor, not  appearing to be at all impressed with the solemnity of the affair. What Matteo  felt I do not know, as he never opened his mouth, but glided after us like a  shadow, until we arrived at the broken wall.</p>
  <p>The  Marchese climbed over first, his long sabre clashing heavily against the stones  as he jumped down on the other side. I followed without delay, and Matteo,  having joined us, we went on through the dense shade of the cypress trees,  until we arrived at the forbidding-looking tomb, the sight of which put me in  mind of my uncanny adventure.</p>
  <p>Beltrami,  undeterred by the flaming sword of the guardian angel, tried the iron door, on  the chance that it might be unlocked; but finding it fast closed, signed to  Matteo to get to work at once. Without a word the man obeyed, and as the moon  was now shining down in her full splendour, he could see perfectly well,  without the aid of artificial light, for, although he carried a torch, Beltrami  did not wish it lighted, in case the glare should attract attention.</p>
  <p>While  Matteo was working away at the lock I took my seat on the fallen stone near the  door, and Beltrami, throwing off his cloak, flung himself down on the grass  beside me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio,  how, hot I am!&rdquo; he exclaimed, wiping his brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how very imprudent, Luigi. Remember, you are in uniform.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, I&rsquo;m never in anything else,&rdquo; retorted the Marchese gaily; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t trouble  yourself, Hugo, no one will dare to come near the cemetery at this hour, so,  uniform or no uniform, I&rsquo;m safe from observation. Will you have a cigar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you. But you surely do not intend to smoke now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; said Beltrami, lighting his cigar; &ldquo;it cannot harm the Signori Morone,  and I&rsquo;ve no wish to go down into that evil-smelling vault without taking some  precaution against fever. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well, do as you will,&rdquo; I replied, indifferently, beginning myself to grow  callous; &ldquo;but I want to ask you something, Luigi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Count Giorgio Morone really mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  I&rsquo;m not sure. Every one said he was, but I did not think so. Dame! they call  every man mad who has brains above his fellows, and Morone was a clever man.  Though, to be sure, it was curious his hiding this poison in the vault, instead  of destroying it altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would certainly have been the wisest plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely, but you see, my wise Englishman, Morone had a tenderness for this child  of his brain, and he could not bear to destroy his work. Oh! inventors are  wonderful egotists, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Matteo, who had been working in silence for some considerable time,  approached his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eccellenza,  it is open!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!&rdquo;  cried Beltrami, springing to his feet, and wrapping his cloak around him again,  &ldquo;give me the torch. Come, Signor Hugo, let us go down, and you, Matteo, stay at  the door, and see that we are not interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si,  Eccellenza!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  stepped cautiously into the tomb, and I followed him, then half closing the  iron door so that the light might not attract attention, he fired the torch,  the flame of which shot upward with a red flare and resinous odour of smoke,  showing us that we stood on the top of a flight of steep steps which led  downward into the darkness. A chill, humid atmosphere pervaded this abode of  the dead, and seemed to penetrate into my very bones, notwithstanding the heavy  cloak I wore.</p>
  <p>For  a moment we paused on the height, looking downward into the thick gloom; then  Beltrami descended the steps slowly, tossing the flaring torch up and down, to  and fro, in order to illuminate the darkness, and as I followed him the smoke,  with its pungent odour, streamed backward towards my face. A bat, startled by  the glare, flew round our heads with a rapid sweep of its noiseless wings, then  vanished through the half-open door into the night beyond, like some escaping  spectre of the tomb.</p>
  <p>At  last we reached the floor of the vault, which was paved with broad black marble  slabs, so highly polished that the crimson blaze of the torch was reflected  therein. All around in niches were innumerable coffins, some covered with  tattered velvet palls, while others stood out grim and bare in their leaden  hideousness, the coverings having long since mouldered away. In the gloom,  there every now and then could be perceived the glimmer of some white figure sculptured  on the massive wall, the glitter of tarnished silver ornaments, and the  outlines of painted devices, while the smoky torch with its angry flame cast  strange gleams upon these mouldy splendours of the dead.</p>
  <p>In  the centre, on a square stone hidden by a rich pall of black velvet,  embroidered with armorial devices in silver braid, rested the gorgeous coffin  of the last Morone, which I presume was to remain there until the death of the  Contessa, when it would be removed to its already-prepared niche to make way  for the sole survivor of the proud race.</p>
  <p>The  Marchese at once advanced to the coffin, and waving the torch above it,  examined the decorations closely. True to his determination he was smoking, and  it gave me an unpleasant shock to see this cloaked figure behaving so  disrespectfully in the solemn presence of the dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!&rdquo;  he said at length in a satisfied tone, &ldquo;there is one thing certain. It is not  in the coffin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that, Beltrami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the lid is screwed down, and the Contessa, who as you say was alone, could not  have taken that off. Besides, even if she did, Madame Morone knows the value of  time too well to waste it in replacing the lid. No, it is not <i>in</i> the coffin, but it&rsquo;s somewhere about  the coffin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think so, Luigi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  this elaborate silver work! There&rsquo;s too much of it to be there without some  reason. Caro, Hugo, just hold the torch and I will make an examination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  took the torch in silence and watched his actions with great curiosity. The  coffin, as he said, was most elaborately adorned with silver work representing  the arms of the Morone family, interspersed with wreaths of flowers and tangled  seaweed. On the lid was a broad silver plate similarly adorned, setting forth  the name, titles, and date of death of the deceased, and round the oblong sides  of this shell ran another broad wreath of flowers, shells, crests, and  seaweeds, designed in the same style as the decorations on the lid. Beltrami,  who was a clever prestidigitator and could perform the most marvellous tricks  with cards, had a wonderfully delicate sense of touch, and trusting to this  more than to his eyes he ran his slender fingers rapidly over the raised silver  ornaments on the lid of the coffin.</p>
  <p>I  saw at once that he suspected this useless silver ornamentation concealed some  secret hiding-place in which the bottles of the poison and its antidote were  hidden, and I could not help admiring the wonderful cleverness of the man in  thinking of such an extraordinary idea, particularly as I saw at once that if  the poison were anywhere it would be in some such ingenious hiding-place.</p>
  <p>After  running his hands twice or thrice over the lid, he shook his head with an angry  ejaculation, and desisted from his apparently useless task.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  it&rsquo;s not on the top, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; he said, stamping his foot with vexation.  &ldquo;My fingers never deceive me, and I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t missed anything. From what  I&rsquo;ve told you I don&rsquo;t think it can be within the coffin. Ecco! let us try the  sides.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He  carefully wiped the tips of his fingers with his handkerchief, and beginning at  the side nearest the head ran his fingers delicately along the cold silver  work. Nothing was discoverable at the side, but when he came to the end of the  coffin at the feet of the corpse he gave a cry of triumph which brought me at  once to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bravo,  Hugo! what did I tell you! The poison-bottle was in the silver work. Behold,  infidel, how truly I speak. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  decoration at this narrow end was a heart-shape shield, bearing the arms of the  Morone family and wreathed with flowers, but this shield, which curved outward  had a spring at the top. In touching this, the whole shield fell downward,  working on a single hinge, and there was a cavity in which a small bottle might  easily be concealed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see the hiding-place, Beltrami; but where is the poison!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  have you forgotten the visit of the Contessa, mon ami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! of course not! She, no doubt, took the poison away, and, I daresay, the  antidote with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mon  cher, I will never make anything of you,&rdquo; cried the Marchese in despair; &ldquo;what  did I tell you about that letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that no doubt as the Count was afraid of it being found by his wife he  would only mention where the poison was concealed, and keep silent about the  antidote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene!  The Contessa knew nothing of the existence of the antidote, so when she found  the poison she thought she had found all. Is that not so, you stupid  Englishman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  Well I, knowing of the existence of the antidote not mentioned in the letter,  and only finding the poison at the feet, would naturally look for the  antidote&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay at the head,&rdquo; I suggested, after a pause; upon which Beltrami laughed,  and walked to the other end of the coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course; it would be the most natural thing to do. Behold, mon ami!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  touched the top of a similar shield at the head of the coffin; it fell stiffly  outward, and lo! in the hollow of the curve, lay a small bottle, which Beltrami  took in his hand, and then restored the shield to its former position. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luigi,  you are a most wonderful man!&rdquo; I cried, with a burst of genuine admiration at  the clever way in which he had guessed this riddle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only use my brains,&rdquo; he replied, with a gratified laugh. &ldquo;The poison being at  the feet, it was not difficult to guess the antidote was at the head;  particularly as the decorations on both ends of the coffin are the same  precisely. Dame! if the Contessa had only known the antidote was in existence  she would have argued in the same way as I have done, and carried it off as she  had done the poison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we can now restore that unfortunate Pallanza to life. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose so,&rdquo; said the Marchese, slipping the bottle containing the antidote  into his pocket; &ldquo;though he certainly does not deserve to have another chance  of existence. But as it is inconvenient keeping him in my house, I suppose I  must send him away on his legs. Ecco! But come along, Hugo. We have what we  desire, and I care not for this abode of death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  went up the stairs and out of the iron door, where we found Matteo still  keeping guard. It was quite a relief to get out of the fetid atmosphere of the  tomb into the cool, fresh air again, and I felt like a released prisoner who  was free for the first time after many years. The Marchese, however, man of  iron as he was, did not seem to be affected in any way, but wrapping his cloak  round him, prepared to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you close that door again, Matteo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eccellenza!  it is done!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  Let us go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  fact the moment we emerged, Matteo, knowing our task was concluded, had  reclosed the door by some trick known to himself; so we all three climbed over  the broken wall, and took our way to the Ponte Aleardi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when are you going to give Pallanza the antidote?&rdquo; I asked, as we walked along  arm-in-arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Signor Hugo, to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! I am tired. A few hours will not make much difference; besides, I want a  doctor to be present. The antidote will revive the poor devil, but he will be  so weak after going without food all these days that the doctor will have to  take charge of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, I will see you to-morrow, Marchese. At what hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  and a half in the afternoon. I attend to my military duties in the morning.  Buona sera, Hugo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,  Beltrami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  parted with a hearty shake of the hand, and I suppose after all I had gone  through, nature was thoroughly tired out; for I went straight to bed and slept  soundly without dreams, visions, or phantoms of any kind coming to disturb my  rest. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The New Lazarus</b></h2>
  <p>FOR  the first time during the week I had a good night&rsquo;s rest, for ever since my  adventure the events in connection therewith had succeeded one another so  rapidly that my brain was kept in too active a state to admit of slumber, but  now that everything seemed to be at an end, that the antidote had been found,  and that Pallanza would be restored to Bianca Angello, my mind was relieved of  the strain upon it, and I slept soundly till morning. In fact, I did not waken  till nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock, and having taken my bath I dressed myself slowly,  made a good meal at midday, and altogether felt better than I had done for the  last week.</p>
  <p>As  my appointment with Beltrami was for half-past two I did not go to Casa Angello  for my usual singing lesson, not wishing to see the Signorina until I could  tell her the good news that her lover was alive and well. It was true Beltrami  had asserted that the antidote would awaken the young man from his death-like  slumber, but remembering that he had now been in this state of catalepsy for  nearly a week, I felt doubtful as to the success of the experiment. However, a  few hours would now decide the fate of Pallanza for life or death, and in the  event of the antidote acting according to the expectations of the Marchese, I  promised myself I should be the first to carry the joyful news of this  wonderful resurrection to the Signorina Bianca.</p>
  <p>When  two o&rsquo;clock struck I could no longer restrain my impatience, but set off  without further delay to see Beltrami at his apartments. He had just returned  from the barracks, and was taking some biscuits and wine when I was announced,  but jumped up when he saw me and came forward with outstretched hand,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  mon ami, I am delighted to see you! Sit down, while I finish this small meal. Will  you have a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  thank you, Marchese!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  take a cigarette, there are some on that table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese returned to his wine and biscuits, while I lighted a cigarette, and  lay down on the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me lying down, Luigi, but our last night&rsquo;s experience has knocked me up  terribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would never do for a soldier, Signor Hugo! I&rsquo;ve been drilling some stupid  recruits all the morning, and I feel perfectly fresh. Ecco! I&rsquo;m glad to see  you, however, as I have some news to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;About  Pallanza?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  No! About Madame Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  she has found out we were at the vault?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  not a bit of it. She left Verona by the five o&rsquo;clock train last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left  Verona!&rdquo; I cried, rising hastily from my recumbent position. &ldquo;Why has she gone  away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Eh!  who knows?&rdquo; replied Beltrami, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even leave a  message for me, her promised husband. I think, myself, the empty pillar of  yesterday startled her. She evidently thought everything was discovered,  therefore has gone to Rome so that she can appeal to the King in case of  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what are you going to do, Marchese?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best thing I can do under the circumstances. I have applied for, and obtained,  leave of absence, so I will give this infernal tenor the antidote to-day, and  start for Rome by the night train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  when you arrive at Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  Will see Madame Morone, and tell her that I removed the body of Pallanza from  the pillar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  body, Beltrami! You forget Pallanza is alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he is, but I&rsquo;m not going to tell her that. Cospetto! if she discovered  that this devil of a tenor was still in existence my power over her would be  gone, and she would not marry me. Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  as Pallanza will sing again, she is bound to find it out sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  no doubt, Signor Hugo; but by the time she finds out I hope to be married. In  that case it does not matter. Besides, I am going to make Pallanza promise not  to sing anywhere for a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  he refuses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t refuse. Dame! he owes me something for bringing him into existence  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will soon be here,&rdquo; said Beltrami, glancing at his watch; &ldquo;I expect him every  minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he keep this affair quiet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Per  Bacco! I should think so, mon ami. I ascertained that before I told him  anything. Not that I told him much, ma foi, no! I invented a delightful story  about Pallanza, which he swallowed as easily as I do this wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not the time to tell it to you, but it is a beautiful story, worthy of  Boccaccio. Oh, he will keep his mouth shut, I promise you, Hugo. He is a great friend  of mine, and I never associate with those who talk of other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you the antidote, Marchese?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it is,&rdquo; said Beltrami, rising and taking the small bottle from his desk near  the window; &ldquo;and, ma foi! here is the doctor coming up the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  fond you are of French,&rdquo; I remarked, laughingly. &ldquo;Parisian ejaculations are  never out of your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  must ejaculate in some language, Hugo, and I&rsquo;ve been so often in Paris that  I&rsquo;ve got into the trick in some way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  city of fogs! Eh! You know I cannot master your tongue, Signor Hugo. &lsquo;You are a  beautiful mees; I loove you&rsquo;&mdash;Dio! what a difficulty I had in learning those two  sentences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  are perfectly useless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not found them so. But here is Signor Avenza, the doctor I spoke of.  Good-day, for the second time, my friend. Permit me to introduce Signor Hugo  Cranston, an Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor, a fat little man with a round smiling face and two twinkling black  eyes, executed an elaborate bow, for which purpose he brought his feet smartly  together in military fashion, and, having thus saluted me, rashly entered into  a contest with the English language, which vanquished him at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spik  Inglis,&rdquo; he said, mincingly. Then, with a gigantic effort, &ldquo;Gif me your tongue!  Ah! he is bad. Dis writing is your cure. Goot-day! I vil taake a leetle valk  wis you agin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Signor  Avenza had evidently learned these choice English phrases for the purposes of  his profession.</p>
  <p>While  this lesson in philology was going on the Marchese had opened the door leading  into the room where Pallanza was concealed, and called to us to enter. Both the  doctor and myself, obeying the summons, went through the bedroom, and soon  found ourselves by the couch, whereon lay the still form of the young man, with  that terrible death-in-life look on his white face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,  Avenza, this is what I spoke about,&rdquo; said Beltrami, holding up a small phial  filled with a red liquid. &ldquo;It is the antidote to the poison which this Pallanza  was foolish enough to take.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  all through a love disappointment;&rdquo; replied Avenza, lifting his eyes. &ldquo;Ah! the  poor young man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  now began to see the kind of story Beltrami had told Avenza to account for the  condition of Pallanza, and I must say it did credit to his powers of invention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  amount of the poison he took was ten drops.&rdquo; went on Beltrami, uncorking the  bottle, &ldquo;so it will require ten drops of this antidote to revive him, but when  the life is once more in him I suppose he will be weak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  certainly,&rdquo; answered Avenza, nodding his head, &ldquo;since you say he has been like  this for nearly a week. But proceed, Marchese, I am anxious to see the result  of this antidote.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  bent over the face of the unconscious man, and forced the teeth slightly apart with  a spoon he held in his left hand. Having done this, he poised the bottle over  the pale lips, and began to pour the red liquid drop by drop into the mouth.</p>
  <p>Both  Avenza and myself bent forward eagerly to watch the operation, and held our  breaths with anxiety as the Marchese counted, slowly,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One,  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  body made no movement, and Beltrami drew back, looking somewhat anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dio!  I am afraid ten drops are not enough!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  said Avenza, taking his watch out of his pocket, and placing his fingers on the  pulse of the seemingly-dead man. &ldquo;You cannot expect this antidote to act at  once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  minutes passed slowly, and we all three remained with our eyes eagerly watching  for some sign of life on that still face, while Avenza occasionally glanced at  his chronometer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  pulse beats,&rdquo; he said at length in a low voice, &ldquo;faintly, it is true, but still  it beats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  heaved a sigh of relief, but Beltrami remained silently looking at the face of  Pallanza with an anxious frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  cannot have given him fifteen,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, &ldquo;if so, he would  have been dead by this time; but his pulse beats, so he is alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  looked irresolutely at the phial in his hand, and then turned to Avenza, who was  still counting the feeble pulsation of the blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,  I will give him three more drops!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  and why not?&rdquo; replied Avenza, raising his eye-brows; &ldquo;as that is an antidote a  few drops more or less cannot kill him after the dose of poison he has taken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese made no further remark, but, bending forward again, he held the phial  over the half-open mouth for the second time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One,  two, three!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time the effect was magical; for after an interval of about two or three  minutes, we saw a shudder run through the rigid body, the left arm jerked  upward in a spasmodic manner, the face flushed crimson with the rush of blood  once more flowing freely through the arteries, and at last the heavy eyelids lifted  slowly. Pallanza gazed at us with a dazed, unseeing expression, then some  tremendous force seemed to take possession of the body, for a spasm of pain  passed over his face, a choking cry issued from his lips, and in a moment he  was shrieking, writhing, twisting, rolling and plunging about the bed like a  demoniac. All the nerves and muscles which had been dead and inert for so many  days were now waking again to life, and the agony which racked his frame from  head to foot must have been truly terrible. Both Beltrami and myself made a  step forward to hold down this agonized body, but Avenza stopped us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  antidote is doing its work,&rdquo; he said rapidly; &ldquo;the dead body is renewing its  life throughout every particle. Wait! wait! the paroxysm will soon pass away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor was right, for in a short time the writhing stopped, the cries grew  fainter, and at last, with a heavy sigh, the young man sank back on the pillows  in a state of exhaustion, on seeing, which; both Beltrami and the doctor ran  out of the room to get some brandy, leaving me alone with this new Lazarus.  During their absence he opened his eyes, to which the light of sanity had now  returned, and spoke in a feeble voice,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  am I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Contessa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is not here! You are quite safe! Hush! do not speak, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pallanza  gave me a look of gratitude, then, closing his eyes, relapsed into silence.  Avenza returned with a glass of weak brandy and water, which he gave to the  young man in spoonfuls, while I went back into the sitting-room to see  Beltrami, whom I found standing by the window with a frown on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ebbene?&rdquo;  he asked, turning-round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is much better, and I think will soon be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a blessing. But what a nuisance! I want to go to Rome to-night by the five  o&rsquo;clock train, but Avenza tells me that Pallanza will have to sleep for a few  hours, so I won&rsquo;t have an opportunity of speaking to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  with a light heart, my dear Beltrami; I will arrange everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Pallanza can sleep in that room for an hour or two, then I will get a fiacre  and take him to his lodgings. No one shall come near him but myself, and when  he is quite sensible I will make him promise all you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  you are a good friend, my dear Hugo,&rdquo; said the Marchese, in a tone of relief;  &ldquo;but do you think he will do what you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  certainly! I can force him to obey me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;How-so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  threatening to tell Signorina Angello about his affair with Madame Morone. She  knows nothing as yet, and Pallanza is afraid of her knowing. Witness the lie he  told about that note at the Ezzelino, asking him to come to the Palazzo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami,  with his cynical estimate of the Contessa&rsquo;s character, was not at all disturbed  by this somewhat blunt speech, but laughed cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Hugo. I think I will make you Italian after all. Your plan is a good, one, mon  ami, so make Pallanza promise not to sing anywhere for a month, to leave Verona  and keep quiet. By that time I will be married to the Contessa, and all will be  well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will arrange everything as you desire, Luigi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excellent!  Then that trouble is off my mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment the doctor entered, rubbing his fat hands together with an  expression of glee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  he sleeps, this young man,&rdquo; he said in a satisfied tone, &ldquo;he will sleep for  one, two, three hours, then, if you like, Marchese, you can send him to his own  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Hugo will attend to all that, Avenza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  Well, Marchese, a revederci! And you, Signor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment, Signor Avenza; I am coming too.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going, Hugo?&rdquo; asked Beltrami, looking at me in some surprise, and  nodding his head in the direction of Pallanza. I crossed over to him, and while  Avenza was getting his hat, whispered in his ear,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to the Ezzelino to find out Pallanzas address, so as to know where to  take him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  a good idea! I will wait here till you return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  accompanied Signor Avenza to the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, where we parted. I  then went to the Teatro Ezzelino and found out Pallanza&rsquo;s address from the  stage-door keeper. While I was returning to Beltrami&rsquo;s rooms I saw Peppino, and  arranged with him to be at the Via Cartoni at seven o&rsquo;clock that evening to  take a sick gentleman away. At first Peppino objected, being, like all  Italians, terribly afraid of disease, but I soon quieted his objections, and he  promised to call as directed.</p>
  <p>On  returning to Beltrami I found him packing up, and at five o&rsquo;clock he took his  departure for Rome, promising to write me immediately he arrived, and in return  I assured him I would let him know everything as soon as I arranged matters  with Pallanza.</p>
  <p>That  young man slept until nearly seven, when he woke up and began to ask me  questions as to where he was. I insisted upon his keeping quiet, telling him I  was a doctor, and when Peppino arrived with his fiacre I wrapped him up in his  cloak so as to hide his stage costume, and helped him downstairs to the carriage.  We soon arrived at his lodgings, where, dismissing Peppino, I made Pallanza go  to bed at once, and gave him a light supper, together with some weak brandy and  water. After this he fell asleep, and I sat watching by his bed all night,  wondering why I was such a fool as to do all this for a cynical man of the  world like Beltrami, who would probably laugh at my good nature when all was  over. Yet there was something about Luigi Beltrami which I liked; and in spite  of his affected cynicism and his extraordinarily loose notions of right and  wrong, I believe that he had a sincere regard for me, which regard I considered  not the least curious part of his whimsical nature, seeing that my character  was the antithesis of his own in every way. Perhaps it was by the law of  contrast, or illustrated inversely the saying that &ldquo;like draws to like;&rdquo; but  whatever was the reason, though we had nothing in common either in nationality  or character, yet we were friends, and I leave this problem to be worked out by  those who deny that such an enigma can exist.</p>

    Found</b></h2>
  <p>GUISEPPE  PALLANZA slept soundly all night, while I took snatches of sleep in the arm-chair  by his bedside. At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning he awoke, feeling much stronger,  and after I had given him something to eat I prepared to go out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going, Signor?&rdquo; asked Pallanza in an anxious tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to send a doctor to see you, and then I am going to the Casa Angello.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  bring Signorina Bianca here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know the Signorina Bianca?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, Signor Pallanza. I am the Englishman of whom you have no doubt heard her  speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Hugo! yes, I know,&rdquo; muttered Guiseppe; and then, after a pause, &ldquo;I wish to  speak to you, I wish to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall tell me all shortly, but meanwhile lie down quietly, and when the doctor  comes say nothing about the Palazzo Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  cried Pallanza, starting up in his bed, &ldquo;do you know that horrible place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all! But there, you are still weak,&rdquo; I answered, forcing him to lie down.  &ldquo;When I return I will speak to you about some important matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Important!&mdash;to  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and to the Contessa Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that terrible woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,  Signor Pallanza, say nothing about your visit to the palace or about Madame  Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a word! And you will bring Bianca to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this hope, Pallanza was perfectly contented, and after instructing his  landlady, who was in a state of great bewilderment at this sudden reappearance,  to look after him, I went out to find Avenza. Fortunately he was well known in  Verona, and I had no difficulty in discovering his house. He saw me at once,  listened to my account of the way Pallanza had passed the night, and promised  to see him without delay. Having thus carried out satisfactorily the first part  of my mission, I departed to perform the second, which involved a somewhat  embarrassing interview with Signorina Angello.</p>
  <p>On  arriving at the house of the Maestro, I was received by Petronella, who threw  up her hands with an appeal to the saints when she saw my haggard appearance  and burst out into a volley of questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Signor Inglese. Is it not well with you? San Pietro! how the wine does change a  face. Here has the Maestro been asking for you every day! &lsquo;Well! Well!&rsquo; said I,  &lsquo;he has gone away like the lover of the piccola!&rsquo; And it is true! I see how you  return. Eh! Madonna, all men are bad. I have been married&mdash;I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wrong on this occasion, Petronella. I have not been at the wine, as you  seem to think!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your face, Signor Inglese&mdash;like that of a sick person! Gran dio!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Comes  from sitting up all night by the bedside of Guiseppe Pallanza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Petronella  clapped her hands together with an ejaculation of delight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is found, then, the poor young man! Ah! it is well I did not waste a centesimo  in masses; and those priests are such thieves. Eh! this news will be like wine  to the piccola. Go in! go in, Signor Inglese! the Signorina is there, but the Maestro!  he is in bed, which is the best place for him, say I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  this breathless harangue Petronella ushered me into the sitting-room, where I  found Bianca sitting by the window, contemplating a portrait of her lost lover.  She arose when she saw me and came forward with an anxious look on her pale  face, while the faithful but noisy domestic left the apartment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Signorina, do you feel better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, Signore, much better; but you have news!&mdash;news of Guiseppe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  best of news, my poor child. Guiseppe is found, and is now at his lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  blood rushed into her hitherto pale cheeks, her melancholy dark eyes sparkled  with joy, and from a pallid, worn-looking girl she changed into a bright,  joyful woman. It was a most wonderful transformation, as if a wan lily had  suddenly blossomed under the wand of some fairy into a rich red rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Hugo! Signor Hugo! Ah, the good news! Oh, how happy I am! He is alive, then? &nbsp;he is well! Oh, say he is well, Signor Hugo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signorina,  he is still weak after his adventure, and at present he is in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  let me go to him! let me go at once! He may die, my poor Guiseppe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  he will not die; but put on your hat and I will take you to him, for you alone,  Signorina, can nurse him back to health and strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  ran to put on her hat and tell the Maestro the good news, which evidently  delighted the old man greatly, judging from the extraordinary chuckling sounds  which shortly proceeded from his bedroom. Petronella at the doorway celebrated  a noisy triumph on her own account, and at last amid the chucklings of the  patriarch and the loud delight of his handmaiden, Bianca took her departure  under my wing to visit the newly-found prodigal.</p>
  <p>She  absolutely danced along the pavement, so exuberant was her delight at the good  news, and I thought how easily I could damp this joy by telling her the true  story of Guiseppe&rsquo;s disappearance. It was a cruel thought, and I regretted it  the moment after it flashed across my mind; for it would have been the wanton  act of a boy crushing a butterfly to have destroyed the happy ignorance of this  merry child, who, tripping gaily along by my side, put me in mind of the  smiling Hebe of the Greeks, that charming incarnation of joyous maidenhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signore!&rdquo;  said Bianca, moderating her transports, &ldquo;you have not told me the reason of  Guiseppe&rsquo;s absence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid there is very little to tell, Signorina! He was lured to the Palazzo  by an enemy, who kept him there until last night, when, luckily, I discovered  where he was concealed and released him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  Signor Hugo, how can I thank you for your kindness! Then my poor Guiseppe was  hidden in that terrible room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was concealed near it, at all events,&rdquo; I replied evasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the voice in the darkness, Signor? Oh, that cruel, cruel voice! It has haunted  my dreams ever since!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was nothing, Signorina; it was&mdash;it was a friend of mine, who came to assist me  to look for Guiseppe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it a signor or a signora?&rdquo; asked Bianca, who, evidently in her nervous  agitation, had not distinguished the feminine tones of the unknown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a signor! a young signor whom I know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he saw us in the darkness. Dio! how terrible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  he did not see us. He guessed we were there, as I told him we were going to  look for Guiseppe, and he came to assist me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bianca  was satisfied with this&mdash;I flatter myself&mdash; skilful explanation, and stopped  asking questions, much to my relief. The number of lies I was forced to tell in  connection with this affair was truly surprising, but as it was absolutely  necessary to keep this poor child in ignorance of the true state of the case, I  ventured to hope that the Recording Angel would treat them in the same way as  he did the oath of my Uncle Toby, in Sterne&rsquo;s delightful story. Italian  intrigue, from the experience I had of it, was certainly very little to my  taste, as I was by no means a convert to the Jesuitical maxim that the end  justifies the means, therefore it was with a thankful heart that I saw the  whole intricate affair was nearly finished.</p>
  <p>By  this time we had arrived at Pallanza&rsquo;s lodgings, and I placed Bianca in an  outer room with strict injunctions that she was not to leave it until I called  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guiseppe is still weak, Signorina, and I must prepare him for your coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fact is I wanted to carry out my promise to Beltrami, in asking Pallanza to  live in retirement for a few months, and, until this was arranged, I was  unwilling that he should see Bianca. The poor child fully believing what I said,  promised to obey me faithfully in all things; so leaving her in the outer room  I went in to see Pallanza, whom I found eagerly expecting my arrival. </p>
  <p>To  my surprise, the young man was up and dressed, as Dr. Avenza, finding him so  much better, had insisted on him leaving his bed, to remain in which, he  declared, was weakening; so I found Pallanza walking slowly to and fro to  exercise his muscles, but on seeing me he came forward with an anxious look,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  she here, Signor Hugo? Has Bianca come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;She  is in the next room, Signor! No, do not go to her. I wish to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am  at your service, Signor Hugo. You have done so much for me that I can never  repay you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Yes,  you can by telling me how you went to the Palazzo Morone on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell all, Signore! You have a right to know. But, Bianca?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  look of relief came over the anxious face of the young man, and we both sat  down to continue the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  met Madame Morone at Rome, Signore,&rdquo; said Pallanza with some faint hesitation,  &ldquo;and we were together a great deal. I did not love her exactly, but she being a  great lady flattered my pride. Of course, I should have remembered Bianca, but  she was not beside me, and as to the Contessa! ah, Signore Hugo, who can escape  when a woman wills? Madame Morone made me afraid at last. She is a tigress,  that woman, and threatened to kill me if I left her for another. I saw how  dangerous was her love, and telling her I was going to marry the Signorina  Angello, left Rome for Verona. She followed me here and took me to the Palazzo  Morone on Sunday, where she exhausted every means of making me give up Bianca.  I should not tell you all this about a woman, Signor, but by her attempt to  kill me she has released me from the laws of honour. Cospetto! she is a  mistress of the devil. Her rage is terrible, and on Sunday she implored, she  wept, she raged, she threatened, but I was true to Bianca, and at last escaped  from the palazzo intending never to see her again. On Monday night, however, I  received a letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  a dying friend?&rdquo; I interrupted meaningly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  I said so in order to keep the affair from Bianca, as I knew if she heard about  it I should be lost. No! Signor Hugo. The letter was from the Contessa, saying  that if I did not come by eleven o&rsquo;clock to the room in the palazzo, in order  to bid her farewell, she would go at once to the Signorina Angello and tell  all. Per Bacco! Signor, you may guess my fear at this message; and I determined  to go to the palazzo at any cost. The opera was long that night, and before the  curtain descended it was past eleven. I was so afraid of the Contessa  fulfilling her threat that I did not wait to change my costume, but throwing on  my cloak over my dress of Faust, went at once to the palazzo. She was not in  the room, and I had a horrible fear that I was too late, but I waited for some  time, and she came. We had another scene of tears, reproaches and rage, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you the rest, Signor Pallanza. She gave you the poison in a cup of  wine, and when you fell at her feet she shut you up in a hiding-place, from  whence you were rescued.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  you, Signor, by you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  by the Marchese Beltrami, who took you to his house, and after many days  revived you with an antidote to the poison which he obtained with great  difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the Marchese! You, Signor, how did you see all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that is a long story. I will tell it to you another time, but at present you  must promise me something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything,  Signor Hugo! For you have saved my life from that terrible woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is indeed a terrible woman! and it is to escape her vengeance that I advise you  not to sing for at least two months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my engagement at the Ezzelino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pay  forfeit-money. Say you are ill and cannot sing. Then return to Milan with the  Signorina and marry her at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the Contessa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  gone to Rome for the present; but as soon as she finds out you are alive she  will come after you; so, if you are wise, Signor Pallanza, you will obtain some  engagement out of Italy.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Basta,  Signor! your advice is good, and I will do what you ask. For two months I will  not sing. I will pay the forfeit-money to the Ezzelino and return to Milan with  Bianca. It is best so. Per Bacco! what a demon I have escaped!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  felt greatly relieved that everything had thus been settled, so arose from my  chair to take Pallanza to the Signorina, after which I intended to go straight  to my hotel and write a letter to Beltrami, telling him of all that had taken  place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  Signor Pallanza, lean on me, and I will take you to Bianca.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  cara Blanca,&rdquo; he cried joyfully, as I led him to the door; &ldquo;Bianca, Bianca,  gioja della mia vita!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guiseppe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  saw him standing with outstretched arms on the threshold of the room, and with  a cry of joy flew towards him like a bird to its nest, and flung herself on his  breast.</p>
  <p>As  for me, I went out of the room and left them together.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    An Interrupted Honeymoon</b></h2>
  <p>WELL,  at last I was back in Milan, much to my satisfaction, as after the strange  adventures I had met with in Verona that city became positively hateful to me.  Two months had elapsed since the affair of the Palazzo Morone had come to an  end, and during that time two marriages in connection therewith had been celebrated&mdash;that  of Beltrami with the Contessa Morone, at Rome; and that of Guiseppe Pallanza  with Signorina Bianca, at Milan. True to his promise, Guiseppe had forfeited  his engagement at the Ezzelino, much to the wrath of the impresario, and had  rested quietly since at Milan, passing most of his time with Bianca, who was  now in a state of high glee preparing for her marriage.</p>
  <p>It  took place at the church of St. Stefano, in Milan, and out of consideration for  the great age of the Maestro it was a very quiet affair, I being the only one  present beyond the Angello household, but that was at the urgent request of  both Bianca and her husband, who never forgot the services I had rendered them  at Verona.</p>
  <p>Thanks  to my dexterity, Bianca never discovered the truth, and fully believed that  Guiseppe had been kept a prisoner at the Palazzo Morone by some enemy who had  lured him thither, by means of the letter purporting to come from a dying  friend. At first, considering the weak way in which Guiseppe had acted, I did  not consider that he deserved his good fortune in marrying such a charming girl  as the Signorina, but during the time that preceded the marriage he was so  devoted to her in every way, and apparently so remorseful for his amorous  folly, that I quite forgave him his momentary infidelity. It was a very pretty  wedding, the bride and bridegroom making a handsome couple, and when the  ceremony was ended Signor and Signora Pallanza went to spend the honeymoon of a  few days at Monza, and I was left alone in Milan.</p>
  <p>Guiseppe  had obtained an engagement at the Madrid Opera House, and on their return from  Monza the young couple were to start almost immediately for Spain, leaving the  Maestro under the tender care of Petronella. The old man&rsquo;s health had been  failing sadly of late, and I doubted very much whether Bianca would find him  alive on her return to Italy, seeing how frail he was in every respect.</p>
  <p>Now  that he was deprived of his right hand by the marriage of his granddaughter,  the Maestro decided to give up teaching, at which decision I was profoundly  sorry, as only having been with him a year I had still many things to learn in  the art of vocalisation. There was, unfortunately, no one else with whom I  could study the same system, for Paolo Angello taught the old, pure Italian  method, of which he was the last exponent; and I infinitely preferred the round  sonorous notes which his training produced to the shouting, colourless style of  present-day singing, which curses the voice with a perpetual tremolo. The  elaborate fioriture school of Pasta, Grisi, Ronconi, and Malibran has almost  entirely passed away, and in its place what have we in Italy?&mdash;nothing but the  present abominable fortissimo singing, without grace, sweetness, steadiness, or  colour. The old Italian operas were composed not so much as stage performances  as to show off the beauty, execution and brilliancy of the voice, while this  new school of music-drama; designed principally for dramatic effect, is  interpreted by singers who rely but little on the perfection of the vocal  organ, and pride themselves not so much on the individual colouring of a single  number as on the general broad effect of the whole. Fortunately, however, by  incessant work during my one year under Angello, I had acquired a pretty good  idea of his system of vocalisation, and hoped, by cautious industry in  following out his hard and fast rules, to perfect my singing in accordance with  his severely pure method.</p>
  <p>Of  the Marchese Beltrami and his wife I heard but little, save through the medium  of the papers, as except one letter announcing his marriage with the Contessa,  and thanking me for my attention to his interests, this ungrateful Luigi had  not written to me. I consoled myself with philosophical reflections on the  hollowness of friendship, when one day, towards the end of July, I was  astonished to receive a visit from the Marchese.</p>
  <p>Pallanza  and his wife had returned to Milan, and were making preparations for their  departure, which was now near at hand. I had just come back from a visit to the  Maestro with whom they were staying, and was writing letters in my bedroom,  when Beltrami&rsquo;s card was brought to me, upon which I ordered him to be shown  into the room in which I was scribbling, so as to secure perfect privacy during  our conversation.</p>
  <p>In  those days of poverty I lived like a cat on the tiles, up four flights of  stairs just under the roof, and my one room served me for everything,&mdash;that is,  as dining-room, reception-salon, and sleeping chamber. I took my meals at a  sufficiently good restaurant near at hand, but otherwise the whole of my indoor  life was bounded by the four walls of that small apartment, which contained an  ingenious bed made to look like a sofa during the day, a wardrobe, a  wash-stand, and a diminutive piano of German manufacture hired by myself. Yet,  as Beranger sings, &ldquo;One is happy in a garret at twenty years of age,&rdquo; and I  think the days spent in that dingy Milanese eyry were among the most delightful  of my life. I was young, enthusiastic, not badly off for a poor man, and  devoted to my art, so I used to strum chords on that small piano while I  practised my voice, act operatic scenes in front of the looking glass, and  dream impossible dreams of applausive multitudes, of recklessly-generous  impresarios, and of a career like that of the kings of song.</p>
  <p>Then  I had a view&mdash;a delightful view&mdash;of the red-roofed houses of Milan, seen from the  window, with here and there a tall factory chimney, the slender tower of a  church from whence sounded the jangling bells which used to irritate me, at  least, every quarter of an hour, and just a glimpse of the white miracle of the  great Duomo, rising like a fairy creation of milky lacework against the deeply  blue sky. Even a vision of green trees I obtained by craning my head round the  corner of the window, and when it was fine weather I looked at my roof-top view  while enjoying a pipe, but when it rained&mdash;oh! heavens, Milan was as dreary as  London in a fog, and the blue skies of Italy became a fable of inventive minds.  The intense heat changed to humid cold, and then I used to shut out this  deceptive city of the Visconti by closing my window, and, retreating to the  piano, practised exercises with a voice rendered, I am afraid, rather gruff by  the chill terra-cotta floor and the damp atmosphere.</p>
  <p>It  was in this poor but honest abode, as the novelists say, that I received  Beltrami, who entered gaily in civilian dress with outstretched hands, looking  exactly the same as when I had last seen him at Verona. Marriage evidently had  not changed him, as he had the same subtle smile on his dark face, talked in  the same vein of cynicism, and interlarded his conversation with his usual number  of French ejaculations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Hugo; mon ami,&rdquo; shaking both my hands heartily, &ldquo;you are astonished to see me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Considering  you have never written me a line since your marriage, Beltrami, I certainly  am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  suppose I spoke with a certain bitterness, for the Marchese shrugged his  shoulders, with a slight flush reddening his cheeks, and sat down on the bed&mdash;I  mean, seeing it was day-time&mdash;the sofa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! I am a newly-married man, Hugo!&rdquo; he said, in an apologetic tone, &ldquo;I have  forgotten everything in the delightful society of that dear Contessa. But you  are right to reproach me; I ought to have written, only I am so terribly  negligent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  fickle; don&rsquo;t forget that trait of your character, Luigi. However, I&rsquo;m glad to  see you, fickle friend as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  you don&rsquo;t spare me. I have called on you for a purpose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  goes without saying. When one requires a friend one always knows where to find  him. Well, Marchese, and in what way can I assist you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell you! but I see you do not ask after my wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  trust Madame Beltrami is well!&rdquo; I said stiffly, not feeling any particularly warm  feeling towards that lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  her health is good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are happy, Beltrami?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tolerably!  But tell me, how is Pallanza and his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they live in Elysium, Marchese. At present they are in Milan, but leave next  week for Madrid, where Pallanza is going to sing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  have to go by himself, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  Madame, my very good wife, is hunting through Milan for his Elysium, with that  famous bottle of poison in her pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  heavens! Is she going to try and poison Pallanza again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  you remember the Latin maxim, &lsquo;Non bis in idem.&rsquo; She is going to try the effect  of the poison on his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet you can sit there calmly without making an attempt to save this innocent  creature! Beltrami, it is infamous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was walking up and down the room in a state of great excitement, for it seemed  horrible and incomprehensible to see the Marchese sitting there so calm and  composed, when he knew that a reckless, dangerous woman like his wife was in  Milan bent on murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Hugo, keep cool,&rdquo; said Beltrami, quietly. &ldquo;It is just this affair I have come  to see you about. Sit down, mon ami, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;But  every moment is of value!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, but as it will take madame some time to find out where Signor Pallanza  is staying, I think we can safely talk for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, then! I am all impatience!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I see! Ebbene! When I went to Rome I told the Contessa that I had taken away  Pallanza&rsquo;s body; but of course I did not say he was alive, and swore that if  she did not marry me I would tell everything to the authorities. The sequel you  know&mdash;she married me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  horrible contract,&rdquo; I muttered savagely, looking at the whole affair from an  English point of view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think  we argued that matter before,&rdquo; said Beltrami, coolly, &ldquo;and, if I remember  rightly, you did not agree with my reasons. However, it is too late now to  blame me, seeing I have been married for nearly five weeks. We spent our  honeymoon at Como &mdash;in fact, mon ami, we are spending it there still, only a  perusal of yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Lombardia</i> sent  my excellent wife off to this city in search of Signora Pallanza.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?  Then I will enlighten you. Madame, my wife, thought this devil of a tenor dead,  and, as he has been keeping quiet all this time, she never for a moment  suspected the truth. I saw an announcement of his marriage in the newspapers,  but you may be sure I did not let the Marchese see it. Everything was going  beautifully, and we were a model couple&mdash;outwardly&mdash;when, as ill-luck would have  it, this paragraph appeared in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  handed me a copy of <i>La Lombardia</i>, and  pointed to a paragraph, which I read. It stated that Guiseppe Pallanza, the  famous tenor, was going to sing at the Grand Opera House, Madrid, and would be  accompanied to Spain by his wife, the granddaughter of Maestro Angello, the  celebrated teacher of singing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can guess what a rage she was in,&rdquo; said Beltrami, when I had finished reading  this fatal information. &ldquo;Diavolo! she has a temper; but, as I told you, I am  quite a match for Madame, and held my own during this furious quarrel. She  demanded an explanation, and I gave her one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?  you told her &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything,  mon ami. Your story, my story, Pallanza&rsquo;s story&mdash;all about the antidote, the  vault, the supper. Eh! Hugo, she now knows as much as you or I. Mon Dieu, you  should have seen her when I had finished!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  what did she do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  smiled, that was all; but it was the smile that alarmed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  your own safety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, no! I told her she need not try the poison on me, as I had the antidote.  In reply, she gave one of those wicked laughs that freeze your blood, and said  that Signora Pallanza had not an antidote, and it would be the worse for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she intends to poison the poor girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancied so yesterday, and I was sure of it this morning, when I heard from my  servants that the Marchese Beltrami had gone to Milan. I knew what she was  after, so followed by the next train, and came straight to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what do you want me to do, Beltrami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;Come  with me at once to the Casa Angello, to warn Signora Pallanza! I suppose she is  still staying with the Maestro Angello?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  until she goes to Spain with her husband. Let us go at once, Luigi. But, oh!  Beltrami, if we are too late!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not be alarmed! I have the antidote in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

    Nemesis</b></h2>
  <p>THE  Maestro had a very comfortable suite of apartments in Milan overlooking the Via  Carlo Alberto, near the Piazza del Duomo, which were chosen by him on account  of their situation, as he could sit at the window of his bedroom and amuse  himself by gazing at the crowded street. This watching of the populace was his  great delight, and when not giving a lesson he was generally stationed at his  window, or else employed in reading <i>Il  Seccolo</i>, which he did in a curious fashion, by holding it close to his  best- seeing eye.</p>
  <p>Of  course, like all the entrances to these Milanese flats, the stairs were  singularly damp, dark, and malodorous, and after running the gauntlet of a fat <i>portanaia</i>, who was devouring a large  dish of polenta in her glass house, we climbed up the humid steps, and speedily  arrived at the second storey, where dwelt the Maestro when in Milan. To make up  for the filth under our feet the ceilings over our heads were gorgeously  painted with mythological figures; and even at that moment I could not help  recalling George Sands&rsquo; remark anent the contrast between these two. However we  had no time to admire the clumsy Jupiter throwing fire-brand thunder-bolts, for  at this moment Petronella, who had seen us through the dingy glass of her  own-little sanctum, opened the door, and was about to burst into a torrent of  greetings, when I stopped her to ask if the Signora Pallanza was at home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  yes! the Signora is in, but she is engaged&mdash;engaged in talking with a lady&mdash;Dio!  a great lady!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great  heavens! we may be too late!&rdquo; I muttered to Beltrami, who nodded his head  silently. &ldquo;Petronella, speak low. This gentleman and myself came on an important errand to the Signora. What is  the lady&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor,  she said she was the Marchese Beltrami,&rdquo; replied Petronella, her jolly face  growing rather grave at all this mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Signor Pallanza in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signor Hugo; he has gone to see an impresario.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is alone with Madame, let us go in at once,&rdquo; whispered Beltrami, exhibiting, the  first signs of alarm I had ever beheld in him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment! What about the Maestro, Petronella?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  his bedroom, Signor Hugo, at the window. Holy Saints! what is wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!  nothing! I will explain all shortly; but meanwhile, Petronella, show us a place  where we can see into the room where the Signora is talking to the Marchese,  without being seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  nodded his head approvingly, for he saw my plan was to overhear the  conversation and only interrupt it should there be any danger to the Signora.  Petronella was bursting with curiosity, but seeing, from the expression of our  faces, that something important was going on, she screwed up her mouth with a  shrewd look, to assure us we could depend upon her, and, closing the outside  door cautiously, led us into the room adjacent to that in which the  conversation was taking place. Pointing to an archway, veiled by curtains, to intimate  that there was nothing else but the drapery to impede our hearing, she retired  on tiptoe, with a puzzled, serious look on her usually merry face.</p>
  <p>It  seemed my fate to overhear mysterious conversations through veiled archways,  but this one was not used as an entrance between the two rooms, for, as I  peered through the curtains, I saw in front of them a small square table, upon  which was placed a lacquered tray with glasses, and an oval straw-covered  bottle of Chianti wine. I drew back for a moment, to see if Beltrami had  noticed this obstacle to our sudden entrance into the room; but, instead of  appearing dismayed, he had a grim, satisfied smile on his lips, as if he rather  approved than otherwise of this table blocking up the doorway. Puzzled at this,  I withdrew my eyes from his face, and looked again into the room beyond, where  the Marchese Beltrami was seated talking to Bianca in what appeared to be a  very friendly fashion.</p>
  <p>It  must be remembered that Bianca knew nothing about the Contessa Morone&rsquo;s  intrigue with her husband, as both Guiseppe and myself had carefully kept all  knowledge of the affair from her; and moreover, owing to her nervous agitation,  she had not recognised the voice of the Marchese when she spoke to us in the  darkness of that fatal chamber at Verona. Consequently she was completely in  ignorance of the real character of her visitor, and only beheld in her a lady  who had called to see Signor Pallanza about some important business; this, as I  afterwards learned, being the excuse she gave for her presence in the Casa  Angello. It was truly terrible to see these two women seated together in  friendly discourse, the one so innocent of the danger she was in, the other so  ruthless in her determination to revenge herself on her rival. The pure white  dove was in the clutches of this relentless hawk, who, while watching her  victim closely, was meditating as to the best means of carrying out her plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it is horrible!&rdquo; I murmured, turning pale with emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  whispered Beltrami with a sinister look; &ldquo;she will fall into her own pit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  did he mean by these strange words? I could not understand; but I had no time  nor desire to ask for an explanation, as the terrible drama being played out in  the next room riveted my attention; so, with a violent effort of  self-repression, I resumed my post of observation, and listened to the  conversation between the two actresses in the tragedy. It was idle and  frivolous, the conversation of two strangers who had nothing to talk about but  the merest commonplace; but this frivolity had for us a ghastly meaning; this  commonplace concealed a frightful intention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so, Signora Pallanza, you have never heard your husband mention my name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Madame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is strange,&rdquo; said the Marchese, smiling; &ldquo;for in Rome I did what I could to  help him in his profession. Eh! yes. I heard him singing Faust at the Apollo,  and told all my friends to go and hear the New Mario.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what they call him here, Signora,&rdquo; replied Bianca proudly; &ldquo;but, indeed, it  was kind of you to aid him. I wonder Guiseppe never spoke to me about you, for  he never forgets a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  I&rsquo;m afraid some men have not much gratitude,&rdquo; said Madame Beltrami with a  laugh. &ldquo;Never mind, when Signor Pallanza comes in you will see he has not  forgotten me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could hardly do that, Madame,&rdquo; answered Bianca, looking with honest admiration  at the splendid beauty of the woman before her. &ldquo;Had I seen you before I would  always have remembered you! But&mdash;it is so strange!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is strange, Signora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not recognise your face, and yet I seem to have heard your voice before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly!&rdquo;  said the Marchese indifferently. &ldquo;I go about a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you ever in Verona?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame  Beltrami was startled for the moment at this apparently innocent question, but  recovered her self-possession in a moment, and laughed gaily in a rather forced  fashion,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Signora! I lived there a long time with my first husband, Count Giorgio  Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Morone!&rdquo;  cried Bianca, starting to her feet with a cry of alarm. &ldquo;Oh! Madame, do you  know that palace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Marchese saw that she had made a mistake by mentioning that fatal name, but  with iron nerve opened a fan she had hanging to her girdle, and fanned herself  slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;it belongs to the family of my late  husband, and is said to be haunted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  shivered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it is! so it is!&rdquo; she muttered in a fearful tone. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have been in that room. Signor Hugo took me  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Hugo!&rdquo; repeated the Marchese reflectively. &ldquo;I think I have heard my husband  speak of that gentleman. He is English, is he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Madame. A great friend of my husband&rsquo;s. A terrible thing happened to Guiseppe  at Verona! Oh! a terrible thing. And that room, that fearful room! Dio! I shall  never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are trembling, Signora! You are ill,&rdquo; cried Madame Beltrami, rising to her feet  and crossing quickly to the table before the curtain behind which we were  concealed; &ldquo;Let me give you some wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&rdquo;No,  no! thank you. I am quite well!&rdquo; said Bianca, going to the window and opening  it. &ldquo;It is only the heat. The fresh air will do me good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  glass of wine will be better,&rdquo; replied the Marchese, pouring out a glass of  Chianti.</p>
  <p>I  felt myself seized with a kind of vertigo at seeing this demon take from her  breast a small bottle and empty the whole contents of it into the glass. I would  have cried out only the voice of Bianca arrested me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am perfectly well, Madame; but will you not take some wine yourself, since the  day is so warm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you will drink with me!&rdquo; said Madame Beltrami, turning round with a calm  smile; &ldquo;but indeed the wine will do you good, you seem so faint&rdquo; </p>
  <p>She  poured out another glass of the Chianti for herself, and was about to take the  fatal drink to Bianca, when the latter called quickly from the window,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame!  quick! come here! Guiseppe is coming down the street!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Out  of courtesy the Marchese was forced to obey the call of her hostess, and went  quickly to the window, leaving the two wine-glasses close together on the  table, the one on the left containing the poison destined for Bianca, the other  on the right innocent of any drug, which she intended to drink herself.</p>
  <p>At  this moment, while the two women were looking out of the window, I heard the  voice of Beltrami, hoarse and broken, sound in my ear,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  to the door and tell the servant to detain Pallanza!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  looked at him in astonishment, for there was a frightful look of agitation in  his pale face, and great drops of sweat were standing on his brow; but he made  an imperative gesture, and I obeyed him without a word.</p>
  <p>Petronella  was in the kitchen, and I hurriedly told her to keep Pallanza at the door on  some pretext or another, and stole quickly back to the room, where I found  Beltrami leaning against the wall with a haggard look on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; I whispered quickly. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! Look!&mdash;look!&mdash;see! See what she is doing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had only been gone a little over two minutes between the time I had last looked  in the room and the moment I resumed my post of observation, but during that  period the Marchese, evidently afraid of the entrance of Pallanza, had given  Bianca the fatal wine, and the girl was drinking it at the window. Madame  Beltrami herself, with rather a pale face, but a devilish look in her eyes, had  just set down her glass upon the table, empty. A moment after Bianca, having  drained the fatal draught to the dregs, came across to the table and placed her  glass beside that of the Marchese&rsquo;s with a merry laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am  glad you persuaded me to have the wine, Signora. It is so refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I think you will find it so,&rdquo; replied the Marchese, with a strange smile.</p>
  <p>The  whole of this terrible scene had passed so rapidly that I had no time to  interfere. My tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, as I saw Bianca drink the  Borgian wine; yet with a mighty effort I was about to cry out, when Beltrami  seized my arm in his powerful grasp, and dared me, with lurid eyes, to utter a  sound.</p>
  <p>The  Marchese, having completed her devilish work, was about to go, for I heard her  say something to Bianca about seeing Pallanza on the stairs, when suddenly we  heard Guiseppe&rsquo;s gay voice talking to Petronella, who strove to detain him; but  with a merry laugh he brushed past her, and a moment afterwards was in the  room. Standing there in the grasp of Beltrami, hidden by the curtains, there  seemed to be a silence lasting an eternity; then we heard Guiseppe give a  terrible cry of rage and fear, and despair,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Giulietta!  you here! Demon! what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slow  and soft, like the hiss of a snake, came the answer,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doing  to her what I did to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poison!  Bianca!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  poor girl gave a terrible shriek of agony, and flung herself into the arms of  her husband, while again there sounded the wicked laugh of the Marchese.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you cannot save her now, traitor! perjurer that you are! she will die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a sudden smash of glass, as Beltrami hurled himself through the archway and  stood before his terrible wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lie, wretch! Here is the antidote!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bianca  was lying unconscious in Guiseppe&rsquo;s arms, and he, with a cry of joy, stretched  out his hand for the phial which Beltrami, standing midway between his wife and  the tenor, was holding. Suddenly, with a shriek of rage, the Marchese sprang  forward, and tearing the phial from his hand, hurled it through the open window  into the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! She shall die! She shall die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  shall never forget that supreme moment of anguish. Bianca lying pale as a lily  in the arms of her agonized husband; myself standing amid the ruins of the table  in the archway; the Marchese erect, defiant, and snarling like an enraged  tigress; and only Beltrami calm&mdash;Beltrami standing cold and inflexible, with  folded arms and a sinister smile on his thin lips. The whole of this frightful  drama had only lasted a few minutes, but the denouement, more terrible than  anything that had gone before, had now arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  shall die!&rdquo; repeated the Marchesa with devilish persistency.</p>
  <p>Beltrami  gave a wild laugh that sounded like the mocking merriment of a fiend,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!  you, have thrown away your life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Giuseppe  looked up with sudden hope, and the Marchesa, with a cry of abject terror,  reeled back with staring eyes and outstretched arms as the truth flashed across  her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Life!  life! oh! devil that you are, you&mdash;you&mdash; have changed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fierce beauty of her face was suddenly distorted by a spasm of agony. She put  her hands to her throat and tore open her dress, tore off the ruby necklace,  the gems of which, flashed down to the floor like a rain of blood, then with a  yell of fear which had nothing human in its despair, she fell at our feet  &mdash;dead.</p>
  <p>Yes,  she had fallen into her own pit; she had flung away her only chance of life in  her desire to doom her rival, and there amid the brilliant sunshine, amid the  blood-red jewels scattered around her, with all her crimes, devilries, and  wickedness on her head, lay the dead body of that Creature of the Night I had  seen issue like a vampire from the old sepulchre to fulfill her evil destiny;  and over her with folded arms, sinister and cruel, towered the man who, as the  instrument of God, had sent her back to the hell from whence she had emerged.</p>

    A Last Word</b></h2>
  <p>IT  was at the Paris Opera House that I last saw Beltrami, three years after the  death of that terrible woman. Things had gone exceedingly well with me since my  student life in Milan, and I can say without vanity that Signor Hugo Urbino  holds a very good position among operatic artists of to-day. After leaving  Angello I devoted another year to hard study, and was finally pronounced fit to  appear before an Italian audience by my last Maestro. This, however, was only  half the battle, for now, having gained complete control of my vocal powers, I  had to take lessons in scena from Maestro Biagio, or, in other words, I had to  study the art of acting. I elected to make my debut in the fine part of Renato  in Verdi&rsquo;s opera, &ldquo;Un Ballo in Maschera,&rdquo; and having learned the music  thoroughly, Biagio taught me how to render the character, dramatically  speaking. This took some time, as every movement, every action, every gesture  had to be studied; but with perseverance I overcame all difficulties, and at  length found myself capable of rendering the character of Renato in a  sufficiently good style. In passing I may say that, as far as I have found, it  is ridiculous to think that acting comes instinctively. No doubt a histrionic  genius is able to give a gesture or strike an attitude during the emotion  engendered by the performance of a part, but he must always hold himself well  under control, and, broadly speaking, act the character, as he studied it, in  cold blood. Otherwise, carried away by his powers, he would do things likely to  upset the entire mechanism of the scene. I have sung the part of Renato many  times since my first appearance, and the critics are pleased to consider it a  striking performance, but whatever touches on the spur of the moment I have  introduced, the broad rendering of the character always remains precisely the  same as taught to me by Maestro Biagio.</p>
  <p>Being  thus in a position to sing and act the part, my greatest difficulties  commenced, and I can safely say that I never met a more unscrupulous set of  scoundrels than these sixth-rate impresarios who go about Milan, like degraded  Satans, seeking whom they may devour. English students, being popularly  supposed to be made of money, are their favourite victims, and they demand from  these the sum of four or five hundred francs as the price of a scrittura, i.e.,  an appearance on the stage. In a playful, ironical fashion they call this sum a  present, I suppose after the fashion of Henry VIII.&mdash;I think it was that  king&mdash;who dubbed his taxes &ldquo;Benevolences;&rdquo; and if you do not make the impresario  &ldquo;a present,&rdquo; you certainly will not get an appearance in Italy. With this money  they take a theatre in a small town and put on the opera in which you desire to  sing, but even then it is doubtful whether the debut so dearly purchased will  come off at all.</p>
  <p>The  first impresario with whom I had to deal was a dingy individual, who, according  to his own account, had brought out all the greatest singers of Europe for the  last twenty years, and, having made him &ldquo;a present&rdquo; of two hundred francs&mdash;he  was a modest man and asked no more&mdash;it was arranged that I should make my debut  at Como but on arriving there for rehearsals I found that both the present and  the impresario had vanished, like Macbeth&rsquo;s witches, into thin air.  Considerably disheartened by this sample of Italian honesty, I yet had  sufficient faith to trust another gentleman in the same fashion, but he must  have been a brother of the first impresario, for he too vanished. I now began  to perceive that there were still brigands in Italy, but that having become  civilised, they were either hotel-keepers or impresarios, and as my two  unfortunate attempts to get a scrittura had ended in disaster, I was not very  anxious to make any one a third &ldquo;present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>However,  it was no use turning back when within the sight of the goal, so I consulted  Maestro Biagio, who kindly interested himself on my behalf, and introduced me  to an honest impresario, who required the necessary present, but nevertheless  fulfilled his promise of introducing me to the Italian public. I made my debut  at Brescia with great success, and at the conclusion of the season, for which,  of course, I did not receive a penny, I had plenty of offers from all parts of  the Continent. To make a long story short, I sang everywhere I possibly could,  and, having secured an excellent reputation, by an unexpected stroke of good  fortune I was engaged to sing at the Paris Opera House two years after my  debut. I think Dame Fortune was anxious to make reparation to Hugo Urbino for  the misfortunes of Hugh Cranston, for, to my great delight, I was favourably  received by the critical Parisians, and before the season ended was overwhelmed  with offers of lucrative engagements.</p>
  <p>What  with my good fortune and the constant excitement of the life of an artiste, I  had almost forgotten the episode of Verona when I was reminded of it by the  unexpected appearance of Luigi Beltrami, who came to my dressing-room one night  at the conclusion of &ldquo;Il Barbiere,&rdquo; in which I had been singing the part of  Figaro.</p>
  <p>He  was changed, this cynical Marchese, since I had last seen him, and changed for  the better, as he had lost his former sinister air and looked much happier and  brighter than formerly. Since our parting in Milan he had written me  frequently, but of late his letters ceased, so I was somewhat puzzled how to  account for this new air of cheerfulness. However, we shook hands heartily,  being glad to see one another, and Beltrami, lighting one of his eternal  cigarettes, sat down to wait until I was ready to leave the theatre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Hugo,&rdquo; he said, gaily blowing a cloud of smoke, &ldquo;so things have gone well with  you, mon ami?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exceedingly  well, Beltrami, or you would not see me in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bene!  I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many  thanks, Marchese; but you look as if life were agreeing with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  laughed, not with his former sardonic merriment, but with a hearty sense of  enjoyment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi, yes! I am married again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I hope I can congratulate you this time,&rdquo; I said with great significance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  present Marchese is an angel, mon ami. Dame! I had enough of demons with the  Contessa Morone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she was punished for her sins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  what would you? There is a God, mon ami, and He was wearied of the crimes of  that Lucrezia Borgia. But what about the poor girl she tried to poison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signora  Pallanza! Oh, I hear she is in America with her husband. He has made a  wonderful success in New York, and Bianca tells me they have two children, a  boy and a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  new Mario and Patti, I suppose. Diavolo! what a pity the old Maestro is not  alive to train the voices of his great-grandchildren!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he is dead, poor old man! I heard all about it in Vienna, and Petronella has  gone to America to look after her beloved piccola. Well, Angello had a long  life, but he was not immortal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dame!  perhaps his system is immortal. It ought to be if your singing is an example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  flatterer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  upon my word your Figaro was delightful. It is such a relief to hear a voice  without that awful tremolo. But come, are you ready? I want you to sup with  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be delighted, Beltrami. Is the Marchese in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  no, not this time. I am here <i>en gar&ccedil;on</i> for a few days. Madame is in Florence, where you must come and visit us. We are  wonderfully happy. Dame! who wouldn&rsquo;t be with health, wealth, and an angel of a  wife? Ecco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  inherited the wealth of Madame Morone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma  foi! yes. It was the only good turn she ever did me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  I cried, with a revulsion of feeling, &ldquo;you are becoming cynical again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always become cynical when I think of that demon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beltrami,&rdquo;  I said after a pause, as we left the Opera House, &ldquo;there is a question I have  often wished to ask you.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>I  felt the Marchese&rsquo;s arm tremble a little in mine, but he laughed in a  nonchalant manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  ask what you will, mon ami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you put your hand through the curtains and change the position of those  glasses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Beltrami  stopped and looked at me steadily with a grave look in his bright eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hugo,  mon ami,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I neither deny nor affirm, what you say. Giulietta  Morone was a demon who came into the world to work evil, and God, wearied of  her crimes, sent her back to the hell from whence she came. I am not much given  to religion, Hugo, as you know, but I believe in a God; and whosoever He chose  as an instrument to destroy that which He permitted to exist, rest assured that  such a one will be held guiltless for executing the just decree of Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  ceased speaking, and we walked on in silence through the crowded streets under  the dark-blue summer sky. I understood perfectly what he meant, and whether it  was right or wrong it is not for me to say, still I firmly believe that this  man obeyed his impulse at that terrible time, not from any selfish motive, but  because he saw clearly that in removing this frightful creature from the world  he was doing a service to the humanity upon which she preyed.</p>
  <p>All  the same, I do not intend to visit the Marchese Beltrami at his Florentine  palazzo.</p>
