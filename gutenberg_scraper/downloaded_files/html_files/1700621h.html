    The Oak Parlor</b></h2>
  <p align="left">I WAS riding between  Albany and Poughkeepsie. It was raining furiously, and my horse, already weary  with long travel, gave unmistakable signs of discouragement. I was, therefore,  greatly relieved when, in the most desolate part of the road, I espied rising  before me the dim outlines of a house, and was correspondingly disappointed  when, upon riding forward, I perceived that it was but a deserted ruin I was  approaching, whose fallen chimneys and broken windows betrayed a dilapidation  so great that I could scarcely hope to find so much as a temporary shelter  therein.</p>
  <p align="left">Nevertheless, I was so  tired of the biting storm that I involuntarily stopped before the decayed and  forbidding structure, and was, in truth, withdrawing my foot from the stirrup,  when I heard an unexpected exclamation behind me, and turning, saw a chaise,  from the open front of which leaned a gentleman of most attractive appearance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are you going to  do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hide my head from the  storm,&rdquo; was my hurried rejoinder. &ldquo;I am tired, and so is my horse, and the  town, according to all appearances, must be at least two miles distant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No matter if it is  three miles! You must not take shelter in that charnel-house,&rdquo; he muttered; and  moved along in his seat as if to show me there was room beside him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I exclaimed,  struck with sudden curiosity, &ldquo;is this one of the haunted houses we hear of? If  so, I shall certainly enter, and be much obliged to the storm for driving me  into so interesting a spot.&rdquo; I thought he looked embarrassed. At all events, I  am sure he hesitated for a moment whether or not to ride on and leave me to my  fate. But his better impulses seemed to prevail, for he suddenly cried: &ldquo;Get in  with me, and leave mysteries alone. If you want to come back here after you  have learned the history of that house, you can do so; but first ride on to  town and have a good meal. Your horse will follow easily enough after he is rid  of your weight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was too tempting an  offer to be refused; so thankfully accepting his kindness, I alighted from my  horse, and after tying him to the back of the chaise, got in with this genial  stranger. As I did so I caught another view of the ruin I had been so near  entering.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; I  exclaimed, pointing to the structure that, with its projecting upper story and  ghastly apertures, presented a most suggestive appearance, &ldquo;if it does not look  like a skull!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">My companion shrugged  his shoulders, but did not reply. The comparison was evidently not a new one to  him.</p>
  <p align="left">That evening, in a  comfortable inn parlor, I read the following manuscript. It was placed in my  hands by this kindly stranger, who in so doing explained that it had been  written by the last occupant of the old inn I was so nearly on the point of  investigating. She had been its former landlady, and had clung to the ancient  house long after decay had settled upon its doorstep and desolation breathed  from its gaping windows. She died in its north room, and from under her pillow  the discolored leaves were taken, the words of which I now place before you.</p>
  <p align="left">January 28, 1775.</p>
  <p align="left">I do not understand  myself. I do not understand my doubts nor can I analyze my fears. When I saw  the carriage drive off, followed by the wagon with its inexplicable big box, I  thought I should certainly regain my former serenity. But I am more uneasy than  ever. I cannot rest, and keep going over and over in my mind the few words that  passed between us in their short stay under my roof. It is her face that haunts  me. It must be that, for it had a strange look of trouble in it as well as  sickness; but neither can I forget his, so fair, so merry, and yet so  unpleasant, especially when he glanced at her and&mdash;as I could not help but think  before they went away&mdash;when he glanced at me. I do not like him, and the chills  creep over me whenever I remember his laugh, which was much too frequent to be  decent, considering how poorly his young wife looked.</p>
  <p align="left">They are gone, and their  belongings with them; but I am as much afraid as if they were still here. Why?  That is what I cannot tell. I sit in the room where they slept, and feel as  strange and terrified as if I had encountered a ghost there. I dread to stay  and dread to move and write, because I must relieve myself in some way&mdash;that is,  if I am to have any sleep to-night. Am I ill, or was there something  unexplained and mysterious in their actions? Let me go over the past and see.</p>
  <p align="left">They came last evening  about twilight. I was in the front of the house, and seeing such a good-looking  couple in the carriage, and such a pile of baggage with them that they had to  have an extra wagon to carry it, I ran out in all haste to welcome them. She  had a veil drawn over her face, and it was so thick that I could not see her  features, but her figure was slight and graceful, and I took a fancy to her at  once, perhaps because she held her arms out when she saw me, as if she thought  she beheld in me a friend. He did not please me so well, though there is no  gainsaying that he is handsome enough, and speaks, when he wishes to, with a  great deal of courtesy. But I thought he ought to give his attention to his  young and ailing wife, instead of being so concerned about his baggage. Had  that big box of his contained gold, he could not have looked at it more  lovingly or been more anxious about its handling. He said it held books; but,  pshaw! what is there in books, that a man should love them better than his  wife, and watch over their welfare with the utmost concern, while allowing a  stranger to help her out of the carriage and up the inn steps?</p>
  <p align="left">But I will not dwell any  longer upon this. Men are strange beings, and must not be judged by rules that  apply to women. Let me see if I can remember when it was that I first saw her  face. Ah, yes; it was in the parlor. She had taken a seat there while her  husband looked through the house and decided which room to take. There were  four empty, and two of them were the choicest and airiest in the inn, but he  passed by these and insisted upon taking one that was stuffy with disuse,  because it was on the ground floor, and so convenient for us to bring his great  box into.</p>
  <p align="left">His great box! I was so  provoked at this everlasting concern about his great box, that I ran to the  parlor, intending to ask the lady herself to interfere. But when I got to the  threshold I paused, and did not speak, for the lady&mdash;or Mrs. Urquhart, as I  presently found she called herself&mdash;had risen from her seat and was looking in the  glass with an expression so sad and searching that I forgot my errand and only  thought of comforting her. But the moment she heard my step she drew down the  veil which she had tossed back, and coming quickly toward me, asked if her  husband had chosen a room.</p>
  <p align="left">I answered in the  affirmative, and began to complain that it was not a very cheerful one. But she  paid small attention to my words, and presently I found myself following her to  the apartment designated. She entered, making a picture, as she crossed the  threshold, which I shall not readily forget. For in her short, quick walk down  the hall she had torn the bonnet from her head, and though she was not a  strictly beautiful woman, she was sufficiently interesting to make her every  movement attractive. But that is not all. For some reason the moment possessed  an importance for her which I could not measure. I saw it in her posture, in  the pallor of her cheeks and the uprightness of her carriage. The sudden halt  she made at the threshold, the half-startled exclamation she gave as her eyes  fell on the interior, all showed that she was laboring under some secret  agitation. But what was the cause of that agitation I have not been able to  determine. She went in, but as she did so, I heard her murmur:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oak walls! Ah, my soul!  it has come soon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Not a very intelligible  exclamation, you will allow, but as intelligible as her whole conduct. For in  another moment every sign of emotion had left her, and she stood quite calm and  cold in the center of the room. But her pallor remained, and I cannot make sure  now whether this betokened weary resignation or some secret and but half  recognized fear.</p>
  <p align="left">Had I looked at him  instead of at her, I might have understood the situation better. But, though I  dimly perceived his form drawn up in the empty space at the left of the door,  it was not until she had passed him and flung herself into a chair, that I  thought to look in his direction. Then it was too late, for he had turned his  face aside and was gazing with rather an obtrusive curiosity at the  old-fashioned room, murmuring, as he did so, some such commonplaces to his wife  as:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope you are not  fatigued, my dear. Fine old house, this. Quite English in style, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To all of which she  answered with a nod or word, till suddenly, without look or warning, she  slipped from her chair and lay perfectly insensible upon the dark boards of the  worm-eaten floor.</p>
  <p align="left">I uttered an  exclamation, and so did he; but it was my arms that lifted her and laid her on  the bed. He stood as if frozen to his place for a moment, then he mechanically  lifted his foot and set it with an air of proprietorship on the box before  which he had been standing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Strange and  inexplicable conduct,&rdquo; thought I, and looked the indignation I could not but  feel. Instantly he left his position and hastened to my side, offering his  assistance and advice with that heartless officiousness which is so unbearable  when life and death are at stake.</p>
  <p align="left">I accepted as little of  his help as was possible, and when, after persistent effort on my part, I saw  her lids fluttering and her breast heaving, I turned to him with as inoffensive  an air as my mingled dislike and distrust would admit, and asked how long they  had been married. He flushed violently, and with a sudden rage that at once  robbed him of that gentlemanly appearance which, in him, was but the veneer to  a coarse and brutal nature, he exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;&mdash; you! and by what  right do you ask that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But before I could reply  he recovered himself and was all false polish again, bowing with exaggerated  politeness, as he exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Excuse me; I have had  much to disturb me lately. My wife&rsquo;s health has been very feeble for months,  and I am worn out with anxiety and watching. We are now on our way to a warmer  climate, where I hope she will be quite restored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And he smiled a very  strange and peculiar smile, that went out like a suddenly extinguished candle,  as he perceived her eyes suddenly open, and her gaze pass reluctantly around  the room, as if forced to a curiosity against which she secretly rebelled.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page015.jpg" width="800" height="602"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think Mrs. Urquhart  will do very well now,&rdquo; was his hurried remark at this sight. He evidently  wished to be rid of me, and though I hated to leave her, I really found nothing  to say in contradiction to his statement, for she certainly looked completely  restored. I therefore turned away with a heavy heart toward the door, when the  young wife, suddenly throwing out her arms, exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do not leave me in this  horrible room alone! I am afraid of it&mdash;actually afraid! Couldn&rsquo;t you have found  some spot in the house less gloomy, Edwin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I came back.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are plenty of  rooms&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p align="left">But he interrupted me  without any ceremony.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I chose this room,  Honora, for its convenience. There is nothing horrible about it, and when the  lamps are lit you will find it quite pleasant. Do not be foolish. We sleep here  or nowhere, for I cannot consent to go upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She answered nothing,  but I saw her eyes go traveling once again around the walls, followed in a  furtive way by his. Whereupon I looked about me, too, and tried to get a  stranger&rsquo;s impression of the place. I was astonished at its effect upon my  imagination. Though I had been in and out of the room fifty times before I had  never noticed till now the extreme dismalness and desolation of its appearance.</p>
  <p align="left">Once used as an  auxiliary parlor, it had that air of uninhabitableness which clings to such  rooms, together with a certain something else, equally unpleasant, to which at  that moment I could give no name, and for which I could neither find then nor  now any sufficient reason. It was paneled with oak far above our heads, and as  the walls above had become gray with smoke, there was absolutely no color in  the room, not even in the hangings of the gaunt four-poster that loomed dreary  and repelling from one end of the room. For here, as elsewhere, time had been  at work, and tints that were once bright enough had gradually been subdued by  dust and smoke into one uniform dimness. The floor was black, the fireplace  empty, the walls without a picture, and yet it was neither from this grayness  nor from this barrenness that one recoiled. It was from something  else&mdash;something that went deeper than the lack of charm or color&mdash;something that  clung to the walls like a contagion and caught at the heart-strings where they  are weakest, smothering hope and awakening horror, till in each faded chair a  ghost seemed sitting, gazing at you with immovable eyes that could tell tales,  but would not.</p>
  <p align="left">There was but one window  in the room, and that looked toward the west. But the light that should have  entered there was frightened, also, and halted on the ledge without, balked by  the thick curtains that heavily enshrouded it. A haunted chamber! or so it  appeared at that moment to my somewhat excited fancy, and for the first time in  my life, here, I felt a dread of my own house, and experienced the uncanny  sensation of some one walking over my grave.</p>
  <p align="left">But I soon recovered  myself. Nothing of a disagreeable nature had ever happened in this room, nor  had we had any special reason for shutting it up, except that it was in an  out-of-the-way place, and not usually considered convenient, notwithstanding  Mr. Urquhart&rsquo;s opinion to the contrary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I,  with a last effort to soothe the agitated woman. &ldquo;We will let in a little  light, and dissipate some of these shadows.&rdquo; And I attempted to throw back the  curtains of the window, but they fell again immediately and I experienced a  sensation as of something ghostly passing between us and the light.</p>
  <p align="left">Provoked at my own  weakness, I tore the curtains down and flung them into a corner. A straggling  beam of sunset color came in, but it looked out of place and forlorn upon that  black floor, like a stranger who meets with no welcome. The poor young wife  seemed to hail it, however, for she moved instantly to where it lay and stood  as if she longed for its warmth and comfort. I immediately glanced at the  fireplace.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will soon have a  rousing fire for you,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;These old fireplaces hold a large pile of  wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I thought, but I must be  mistaken, that he made a gesture as if about to protest, but, if so, reason  must have soon come to his aid, for he said nothing, though he looked uneasy,  as I moved the andirons forward and made some other trivial arrangements for  the fire which I had promised them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He thinks I am never  going,&rdquo; I muttered to myself, and took pleasure in lingering; for, anxious as I  was to have the room heated up for her comfort, I knew that every moment I  stayed there would be one less for her to spend with her surly husband alone.</p>
  <p align="left">At last I had no further  excuse for remaining, and so with the final remark that if the fire failed to  give them cheer we had a sitting room into which they could come, I went out.  But I knew, even while saying it, that he would not grant her the opportunity  of enjoying the sitting room&rsquo;s coziness; that he would not let her out of his  sight, if he did out of the room, and that for her to remain in his presence  was to be in darkness, solitude and gloom, no matter what walls surrounded her  or in what light she stood.</p>
  <p align="left">My impressions were not  far wrong. Mr. and Mrs. Urquhart came to supper, but that was all. Before the  others had finished their roast they had eaten their pudding and gone; and  though he had talked, and laughed, and shown his white teeth, the impression  left behind them was a depressing one which even Hetty felt, and she has  anything but a sensitive nature.</p>
  <p align="left">I went to the room once  again in the evening. I found them both seated, but in opposite parts of the  room; he by his great box, and she in an easy chair which I had caused to be  brought down from my own room for her especial use. I did not look at him, but  I did at her, and was astonished to see, first, how dignified she was; and next  how pretty. Had she been happy and at her ease, I should probably have been  afraid of her, for the firelight, which now shone on her wan young cheek,  brought out evidences of character and culture in her expression which proved  her to be, by birth and training, of a position superior to what one would be  led to expect from her husband&rsquo;s aspect and manner. But she was not happy nor  at her ease, and wore, instead of the quiet and commanding look of the great  lady, such an expression of secret dread that I almost forgot my position of  landlady, and should certainly, if he had not been there, fallen at her side  and taken her poor, forsaken head upon my breast. But that silent, immovable  form, sitting statue-like beside his big box, smiling, for aught I knew, but if  so, breathing out a chill that forbade all exhibition of natural feeling, held  me in check, as it held her, so that I merely inquired whether there was  anything I could do for her; and when she shook her head, starting a tear down  her cheek as she did so, I dared do nothing more than give her one look of  sympathetic understanding, and start for the door.</p>
  <p align="left">A command from him  stopped me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My wife will need a  slight supper before she goes to bed,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Will you be good enough to see  that one is brought?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She roused herself up  with quite a startled look of wonder.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, Edwin,&rdquo; she began,  &ldquo;I never have been in the habit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But he hushed her at  once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know what is best for  you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A small plate of luncheon, Mrs. Truax; and let it be nice and  inviting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I courtesied, gave her  another glance, and went out. Her countenance had not lost its look of wonder.  Was he going to be considerate, after all?</p>
  <p align="left">The lunch was prepared  and taken to her.</p>
  <p align="left">Not long after this the  inn quieted down, and such guests as were in the house prepared for rest.  Midnight came; all was dark in room and hall. I was sure of this, for I went  through the whole building myself, contrary to my usual habit, which was to  leave this task to my man-of-all-work, Burritt. All was dark, all was quiet,  and I was just dropping off to sleep, when there shot up suddenly from below a  shriek, which was quickly smothered, but not so quickly that I did not  recognize in it that tone which is only given by hideous distress or mortal  fear.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is Mrs. Urquhart!&rdquo; I  cried in terror, to myself; and plunging into my clothes, I hurried down  stairs.</p>

  <p align="left">All was quiet in the  halls, but as I proceeded toward their room I perceived a figure standing near  the doorway, which, in another moment, I saw to be that of Burritt. He was  trembling like a leaf, and was bent forward, listening.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page025.jpg" width="645" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;they  are talking. All seems to be right. I just heard him call her darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I drew the man away and  took his place. Yes; they were talking in subdued but not unkindly tones. I  heard him bid her be composed, and caught, as I thought, a light reply that  ought to have satisfied me that Mrs. Urquhart had simply suffered from some  nightmare horror at which she was as ready to laugh now as he. But my nature is  a contradictory one, and I was not satisfied. The echo of her cry was still  ringing in my ears, and I felt as if I would give the world for a momentary  peep into their room. Influenced by this idea, I boldly knocked, and in an  instant&mdash;too soon for him not to have been standing near the door&mdash;I heard his  breath through the keyhole and the words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who is there, and what  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We heard a cry,&rdquo; was my  response, &ldquo;and I feared Mrs. Urquhart was ill again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Urquhart is very  well,&rdquo; came hastily, almost gayly, from within. &ldquo;She had a dream, and was  willing that every one should know it. Is not that all?&rdquo; he said, seemingly  addressing his wife.</p>
  <p align="left">There was a murmur  within, and then I heard her voice. &ldquo;It was only a dream, dear Mrs. Truax,&rdquo; it  said, and convinced against my will, I was about to return to my room, when I  brushed against Burritt. He had not moved, and did not look as if he intended  to.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there  is no use of our remaining here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; was his  whispered reply. &ldquo;In this hall I stay till morning. When I see a lamb in the  care of a wolf, I find it hard to sleep. There is a door between us, but please  God there shan&rsquo;t be anything more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And knowing Burritt, I  did not try to argue, but went quietly and somewhat thoughtfully to my room,  vaguely relieved that I left him behind, though convinced there would be no  further need of his services.</p>
  <p align="left">And so it was. No more  sounds disturbed the house, and when I came down, with the first streak of  daylight, I found Burritt gone about his work.</p>
  <p align="left">Breakfast was served to  the Urquharts in their own room. I had wished to carry it in myself, but I  found this inconvenient, and so I sent Hetty. When she came back I asked her  how Mrs. Urquhart looked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was  the quick reply. &ldquo;And see! I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s as unhappy as we all thought  last night, or she wouldn&rsquo;t be giving me a bright new crown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I glanced at the girl&rsquo;s  palm. There was indeed a bright new crown in it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did she give you that?&rdquo;  I inquired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am; she  herself. And she laughed when she did it, and said it was for the good  breakfast I had brought her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I was busy at the time,  and could not stop to give the girl&rsquo;s words much thought; but as soon as I had  any leisure, I went to see for myself how Mrs. Urquhart looked when she  laughed.</p>
  <p align="left">I was five minutes too  late. She had just donned her traveling bonnet and veil, and though I heard her  laugh slightly once, I did not see her face.</p>
  <p align="left">I saw his, however, and  was surprised at the good nature in it. He was quite the gentleman, and if he  had not been in such a hurry, would have doubtless made, or endeavored to make,  himself very agreeable. But he was just watching his great box carried out to  the wagon, and while he took pains to talk to me&mdash;was it to keep me from talking  to her?&mdash;he was naturally a little absentminded. He was in haste, too, and  insisted upon placing his wife in the carriage before all his baggage was taken  from the room. And she seemed willing to go. I watched her on purpose to see, for  I was not yet satisfied that she was not playing a part at his dictation, but I  could discover no hint of reluctance in her manner, but rather a quiet  alacrity, as if she felt glad to quit a room to which she had taken a dislike.</p>
  <p align="left">When I saw this, and noted  the light step of her feet, I said to myself that I had been a fool, and lost a  little of the interest I had felt for her. Nor did I regain it till after they  had driven away, though she showed a consideration for me at the last which I  had not expected, leaning from the carriage to give me a good-by pressure of  the hand, and even nodding again and again as they disappeared down the road.  For the fear which could be dissipated in a night was not the fear with which I  had credited her; and of ordinary excitements and commonplace natures I had  seen enough in my long experience as landlady to make me unwilling to trouble  myself with any more of them.</p>
  <p align="left">But when the carriage  and its accompanying wagon had quite disappeared, and Mr. and Mrs. Urquhart  were virtually as far beyond my reach as if they were already in New York, I  became conscious of a great uneasiness. This was the more strange in that there  seemed to be no especial cause for it. They had left my house in apparently  better spirits than they had entered it, and there was no longer any reason why  I should concern myself about them. And yet I did concern myself, and came into  the house and into the room they had just vacated, with feelings so unusual  that I was astonished at myself, and not a little provoked. I had a vague  feeling that the woman who had just left was somehow different from the one I  had seen the night before.</p>
  <p align="left">But I am a busy woman,  and I do not think I should have let this trouble me long if it had not been  for Burritt. But when he came into the room after me, and shut the door behind  him and stood with his back against it, looking at me, I knew I was not the  only one who felt uncomfortable about the Urquharts. Rising from the chair  where I had been sitting, counting the cost of fitting up that room so as to  make it look habitable, I went toward him and met his gaze pretty sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; I  asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the  somewhat sullen reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel right about those folks, and yet&mdash;&rdquo; He  stopped and scratched his head&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m afraid of. Are you sure  they left nothing behind them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The last words were  uttered in such a tone I did not know for a minute what to say.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Left anything behind  them!&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;They left their money, if that is what you mean. I don&rsquo;t  know what else they could have left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Notwithstanding which  assertion, I involuntarily glanced about the room as if half expecting to see  some one of their many belongings protruding from a hitherto unsearched corner.  His gaze followed mine, but presently returned, and we stood again looking at  each other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is it, then?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
  <p align="left">I frowned in  displeasure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is what?&rdquo; I  demanded. &ldquo;You speak like a fool. Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He took a step toward me  and lowered his voice. Every one knows Burritt, so I need not describe him. You  can all imagine how he looked when he said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see me handling  of the big box, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I nodded yes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Saw how I was the one  to help carry it in, and also how I was the one to first take hold on it when  he wanted it carried out?&rdquo; I again nodded yes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, that box  was a heavy load to lift into the wagon, but, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;here his voice became  quite sepulchral&mdash;&ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t as heavy as it was when we lifted it out, and it  hadn&rsquo;t the same feel either. Now, what had happened to it, and where is the  stuff he took out of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I own I had never in my  life felt creepy before that minute. But with his eyes staring at me so  impressively, and his voice sunk to a depth that made me lean forward to hear  what he had to say, I do declare I felt as if an icy breath had been blown  across the roots of my hair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Burritt, you want to  frighten me,&rdquo; I exclaimed, as soon as I could get my voice. &ldquo;The box seemed  heavier to you than it did just now. There was no change in it, there could not  be, or we should find something here to account for it. Remember you did not  sleep last night, and lack of rest makes one fanciful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It does not make a man  feel stronger, though, and I tell you the box was not near so heavy to-day as  yesterday. Besides, as I said before, it acted differently under the handling.  There was something loose in it to-day. Yesterday it was packed tight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I shook my head, and  tried to throw off the oppression caused by his manner. But seeing his eyes  travel to the window, I looked that way too.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t carry  anything out of the door,&rdquo; declared Burritt, at this moment, &ldquo;because I watched  it, and I know. But that window is only three feet from the ground, and I  remember now that at the instant I first laid my ear to the keyhole, I heard a  strange, grating sound just like that of a window being lowered by a very  careful hand. Shall I look outside it, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I replied by going  quickly to the window myself, lifting it, which I did with very little trouble,  and glancing out. The familiar garden, with its path to the river, lay before  me; but though I allowed myself one quick look in its direction, it was to the  ground immediately beneath the window that I turned my attention, and it was  here that I instantly, and to the satisfaction of both Burritt and myself,  discovered unmistakable signs of disturbance. Not only was there the impression  of a finely booted foot imprinted in the loose earth, but there was a large  stone lying against the house which we were both confident had not been there  the day before.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went roaming through  the garden last night,&rdquo; cried Burritt, &ldquo;and he brought back that stone. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I shuddered instead of  replying. Then remembering that I had seen the young wife well and happy only a  few minutes before, felt confused and mystified beyond any power to express.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will have a look at  that stone,&rdquo; continued Burritt; and without waiting for my sanction, he vaulted  out of the window and lifted the stone.</p>
  <p align="left">After a moment&rsquo;s  consideration of it he declared:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It came from the river  bank; that is all I can make out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And dropping the stone  from his hand, he suddenly darted down the path to the river.</p>
  <p align="left">He was not gone long.  When he came back, he looked still more doubtful than before.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If I know that bank,&rdquo;  he declared, &ldquo;there has been more than one stone taken from it, and some dirt.  Suppose we examine the floor, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">We did so, and just  where the box had been placed we discovered some particles of sand that were  not brought in from the road.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; I  cried.</p>
  <p align="left">Burritt did not answer.  He was looking out toward the river. Suddenly he turned his eyes upon me and  said in his former suppressed tone:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He filled the box with  stone and earth, and these were what we carried out and put into the wagon. But  it was full when it came, and very heavy. Now, what was it filled with, and  what has become of the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was the question  then; it is the question now.</p>
  <p align="left">Burritt hints at crime,  and has gone so far as to spend all the afternoon searching the river banks.  But he has discovered nothing, nor can he explain what it was he looked for or  expected to find. Nor are my own thoughts and feelings any clearer. I remember  that the times are unsettled, that the spirit of revolution is in the air, and  try to be charitable enough to suppose that it was treasure the young husband  brought with him, and that all the perturbation and distress which I imagine  myself to have witnessed in his behavior and that of his wife were owing to the  purpose that they had formed of burying, in this spot, the silver and plate  which they were perhaps unwilling to risk to the chances of war. But when I try  to stifle my graver fears with this surmise, I recall the fearful nature of the  shriek which startled me from my sleep, and repeat, tremblingly, to myself:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Some one was in mortal  agony at the moment I heard that cry. Was it the young wife, or was it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    A Fearful Discovery</b></h2>
  <p align="left">April 3, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">IT is sixteen years  since I wrote the preceding chapters of this history of mystery and crime. When  the pen dropped from my hand&mdash;why did it drop? Was it because of some noise I  heard?</p>
  <p align="left">I imagine so now, and  tremble. I did not anticipate ever adding a line to the words I had written.  The impulse which had led me to put upon paper my doubts concerning the two  Urquharts soon passed, and as nothing ever occurred to recall this couple to my  mind, I gradually allowed their name and memory to vanish from my thoughts,  only remembering them when chance led me into the oak parlor. Then, indeed, I  recollected their manner and my fears, and then I also felt repeated, though  every time with fainter and fainter power, the old thrill of undefined terror  which stopped my record of that day with the half-finished question as to who  had uttered the shriek that had startled me the night before. To-day I again  take up my pen. Why? Because to-day, and only since to-day, can I answer this  question.</p>
  <p align="left">Sixteen years ago! which  makes me sixteen years older. My house, too, has aged, and the oak parlor&mdash;I  never refurnished it&mdash;is darker, gloomier, and more forbidding than it was then,  and in truth, why should it not be? When I remember what was revealed to me a  week ago, I wonder that its walls did not drop fungi, and its chill strike  death through the man or woman who was brave enough to enter it. Horrible,  horrible room! You shall be torn from my house if the rest of the structure  goes with you. Neither I nor another shall ever enter your fatal portal again.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a week ago to-day  that the coach from New York set down at my door a stranger of fine and quaint  appearance, whose white hair betokened him to be aged, but whose alert and  energetic movements showed that, if he had passed the line of fourscore, he had  still enough of the fire of youth remaining to make his presence welcome in  whatever place he chose to enter. As had happened sixteen years before, I was  looking out of the window when the coach drove up, and, being at once attracted  by the stranger&rsquo;s person and manner, I watched him closely while he was  alighting, and was surprised to observe what intent and searching glances he  cast at the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He could not be more  interested if he were returning to the home of his fathers,&rdquo; I murmured  involuntarily to myself, and hastened to the door in order to receive him.</p>
  <p align="left">He came forward  courteously. But after the first few words between us he turned again and gazed  with marked curiosity up and down the road and again at the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You seem to be  acquainted with these parts,&rdquo; I ventured. He smiled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is an old house,&rdquo;  he answered, &ldquo;and you are young.&rdquo; (I am fifty-five.) &ldquo;There must have been  owners of the place before you. Do you know their names?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I bought the place of  Dan Forsyth, and he of one Hammond. I don&rsquo;t know as I can go back any further  than that. Originally the house was the property of an Englishman. There were  strange stories about him, but it was so long ago that they are almost  forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The stranger smiled  again, and followed me into the house. Here his interest seemed to redouble.</p>
  <p align="left">Instantly a thought flashed  through my brain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is its ancient  owner, the Englishman. I am standing in the presence of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You wish to know my  name,&rdquo; interrupted his genial voice. &ldquo;It is Tamworth. I am a Virginian, and  hope to stay at your inn one night. What kind of a room have you to offer me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a twinkle in  his eyes I did not understand. He was looking down the hall, and I thought his  gaze rested on the corridor leading to the oak parlor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should like to sleep  on the ground floor,&rdquo; he added.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have but one room,&rdquo; I  began.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And one is all I want,&rdquo;  he smiled. Then, with a quick glance at my face: &ldquo;I suppose you are a little  particular whom you put into the oak parlor. It is not every one who can  appreciate such romantic surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I surveyed him,  completely puzzled. Whereupon he looked at me with an expression of surprise  and incredulity that added to the mystery of the moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The room is gloomy and  uninviting,&rdquo; I declared; &ldquo;but beyond that, I do not know of any especial claim  it has upon our interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You astonish me,&rdquo; was  his evidently sincere reply; and he walked on, very thoughtfully, straight to  the room of which we were speaking. At the door he paused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the  secret of this room,&rdquo; he asked, giving me a very bright and searching glance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you mean anything  concerning the Urquharts,&rdquo; I began doubtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Urquharts!&rdquo; he  carelessly repeated. &ldquo;I do not know anything about them. I am speaking of an  old tradition. I was told&mdash;let me see how long it is now&mdash;well, it must be  sixteen years at least&mdash;that this house contained a hidden chamber communicating  with a certain oak parlor in the west wing. I thought it was curious, and&mdash;Why,  madam, I beg your pardon; I did not mean to distress you. Can it be possible  that you were ignorant of this fact?&mdash;you, the owner of this house!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you sure it is a  fact?&rdquo; I gasped. I was trembling in every limb, but managed to close the door  behind us before I sank into a chair. &ldquo;I have lived in this house twenty years.  I know its rooms and halls as I do my own face, and never, never have I  suspected that there was a nook or corner in it which was not open to the light  of day. Yet&mdash;yet it is true that the rooms on this floor are smaller than those  above, this one especially.&rdquo; And I cast a horrified glance about me, that  reminded me, even against my will, of the searching and peculiar look I had  seen cast in the same direction by Mr. Urquhart sixteen years before.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see that I have  stumbled upon a bit of knowledge that has been kept from the purchasers of this  property,&rdquo; observed the old gentleman. &ldquo;Well, that does not detract from the  interest of the occasion. When I knew I was to pass this way, I said to myself  I shall certainly stop at the old inn with the secret chamber in it, but I did  not think I should be the first one to disclose its secret to the present  generation. But my information seems to affect you strangely. Is it such a  disturbing thing to find that one&rsquo;s house has held a disused spot within it,  that might have been made useful if you had known of its existence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I could not answer. I  was enveloped in a strange horror, and was only conscious of the one wish&mdash;that  Burritt had lived to help me through the dreadful hour I saw before me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let us see if my  information has been correct,&rdquo; continued Mr. Tamworth. &ldquo;Perhaps there has been  some mistake. The secret chamber, if there is one, should be behind this  chimney. Shall I hunt for an opening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I managed to shake my  head. I had not strength for the experiment yet. I wanted to prepare myself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me first how you  heard about this room?&rdquo; I entreated.</p>
  <p align="left">He drew his chair nearer  to mine with the greatest courtesy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is no reason why  I should not tell you,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;and as I see that you are in no mood for a  long story, I shall make my words as few as possible. Some years ago I had  occasion to spend a night in an inn not unlike this, on Long Island. I was  alone, but there was a merry crowd in the tap room, and being fond of good  company, I presently found myself joining in the conversation. The talk was of  inns, and many a stirring story of adventure in out-of-the-way taverns did I  listen to that night before the clock struck twelve. Each man present had some  humorous or thrilling experience to relate, with the exception of a certain  glum and dark-browed gentleman, who sat somewhat apart from the rest, and who  said nothing. His reticence was in such marked contrast to the volubility about  him that he finally attracted universal attention, and more than one of the  merry-makers near him asked if he had not some anecdote to add to the rest. But  though he replied with sufficient politeness, it was evident that he had no  intention of dropping his reserve, and it was not till the party had broken up  and the room was nearly cleared that he deigned to address any one. Then he turned  to me, and with a very peculiar smile, remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;A dull collection of  tales, sir. Bah! if they had wanted to hear of an inn that was really romantic,  I could have told them&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; I involuntarily  ejaculated. &lsquo;You will not torture me by suggesting a mystery you will not  explain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He looked very  indifferent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; he  declared, &lsquo;only I know of an inn&mdash;at least it is used for an inn now&mdash;which has  in its interior a secret chamber so deftly hidden away in the very heart of the  house that I doubt if even its present owner could find it without the minutest  directions from the man who saw it built. I knew that man. He was an  Englishman, and he had a fancy to make his fortune through the aid of smuggled  goods. He did it; and though always suspected, was never convicted, owing to  the fact that he kept all his goods in this hidden room. The place is sold now,  but the room remains. I wonder if any forgotten treasures lie in it.  Imagination could easily run riot over the supposition, do you not think so,  sir?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly did,  especially as I imagined myself to detect in every line of his able and crafty  face that he bore a closer relation to the Englishman than he would have me  believe. I did not betray my feelings, however, but urged him to tell me how in  a modern house, a room, or even a closet, could be so concealed as not to  awaken any one&rsquo;s suspicion. He answered by taking out pencil and paper, and  showing me, by a few lines, the secret of its construction. Then seeing me  deeply interested, he went on to say:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We find what we have  been told to search for; but here is a case where the secret has been so well  kept that in all possibility the question of this room&rsquo;s existence has never  arisen. It is just as well.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meantime I was studying  the plan.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;The hidden chamber  lies,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;between this room,&rsquo; designating one with my forefinger, &lsquo;and  these two others. From which is it entered?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He pointed at the one I  had first indicated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;From this,&rsquo; he  affirmed. &lsquo;And a quaint, old-fashioned room it is, too, with a wainscoting of  oak all around it as high as a man&rsquo;s head. It used to be called the oak parlor,  and many a time has its floor rung to the tread of the king&rsquo;s soldiers, who,  disappointed in their search for hidden goods, consented to take a drink at  their host&rsquo;s expense, little recking that, but a few feet away, behind the  carven chimneypiece upon which they doubtless set down their glasses, there lay  heaps and heaps of the richest goods, only awaiting their own departure to be  scattered through the length and breadth of the land.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And this house is now  an inn?&rsquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Curious. I should like  nothing better than to visit that inn.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You doubtless have.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is not this one?&rsquo; I  suddenly cried, looking uneasily about me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, no; it is on the  Hudson River, not fifty miles this side of Albany. It is called the Happy-Go-Lucky,  and is in a woman&rsquo;s hands at present; but it prospers, I believe. Perhaps  because she has discovered the secret, and knows where to keep her stores.&rsquo; And  with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the subject, with the remark: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t  know why I told you of this. I never made it the subject of conversation before  in my life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This was just before  the outbreak in Lexington, sixteen years ago, ma&rsquo;am, and this is the first time  I have found myself in this region since that day. But I have never forgotten  this story of a secret room, and when I took the coach this morning I made up  my mind that I would spend the night here, and, if possible, see the famous oak  parlor, with its mysterious adjunct; never dreaming that in all these years of  your occupancy you would have remained as ignorant of its existence as he  hinted and you have now declared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Tamworth paused,  looking so benevolent that I summoned up my courage, and quietly informed him  that he had not told me what kind of a looking man this stranger was.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he young?&rdquo; I asked.  &ldquo;Had he a blond complexion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo;  interrupted Mr. Tamworth, &ldquo;he was very dark, and, in years, as old or nearly as  old as myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I was disappointed. I  had expected a different reply. As he talked of the stranger, I had, rightfully  or wrongfully, with reason or without reason, seen before me the face of Mr.  Urquhart, and this description of a dark and well-nigh aged man completely  disconcerted me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you certain this  man was not in disguise?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Disguise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you certain that he  was not young, and blond, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; was the  dry interruption. &ldquo;No disguise could transform a young blood into the man I saw  that night. May I ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In my turn I interrupted  him. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I entreated, &ldquo;but an anxiety I will presently explain forces  another question from me. Were you and this stranger alone in the room when you  held this conversation? You say that it had been full a few minutes before.  Were there none of the crowd remaining besides your two selves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Tamworth looked  thoughtful. &ldquo;It is sixteen years ago,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I have a dim  remembrance of a man sitting at a table somewhat near us, with his face thrown  forward on his arms. He seemed to be asleep; I did not notice him particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you not see his  face?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he young?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And blond?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That I cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And he remained in that  attitude all the time you were talking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And continued so when  you left the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he within earshot?  Near enough to hear all you said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most assuredly, if he  listened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Tamworth,&rdquo; I now  entreated, &ldquo;try, if possible, to remember one other fact. If each man present  told a story that night, you must have had ample opportunity of noting each man&rsquo;s  face and observing how he looked. Now, of all that sat in the room, was there  not one of an age not exceeding thirty-five, of fair complexion and gentlemanly  appearance, yet with a dangerous look in his small blue eye, and a something in  his smile that took all the merriment out of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A short but telling  description,&rdquo; commented my guest. &ldquo;Let me see. Was there such a man among them?  Really, I cannot remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Think, think. Hair very  thin above the temples, mustache heavy. When he spoke he invariably moved his  hands; seemed to be nervous, and anxious to hide it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; was Mr.  Tamworth&rsquo;s sudden remark. &ldquo;That description of his hands recalls him to my  mind. Yes; there was such a man in the room that night. I even recollect his  story. It was coarse, but not without wit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I advanced and surveyed  Mr. Tamworth very earnestly. &ldquo;The man you thought asleep&mdash;the man who was near  enough to hear all the Englishman said&mdash;was he or was he not the same we have  just been talking about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I never thought of it  before, but he did look something like him&mdash;his figure, I mean; I did not see  his face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was he,&rdquo; I murmured,  with intense conviction, &ldquo;and the villain&mdash;&rdquo; But how did I know he was a  villain? I paused and pointed to the huge mantel guarding the fireplace. &ldquo;If  you know how to enter the secret room, do so. Only I should like to have a few  witnesses present besides myself. Will you wait till I call one or two of my  lodgers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He bowed with great  urbanity. &ldquo;If you wish to make the discovery public,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I, of course,  have no objection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But I saw that he was  disappointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can never confront  the secret of that room alone,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;I must have Dr. Kenyon here at  least.&rdquo; And without waiting for my impulses to cool, I sent a message to the  doctor&rsquo;s room, and was rewarded in a moment by the appearance at the door of  that excellent man.</p>
  <p align="left">It did not take many  words for me to explain to him our intentions. We were going to search for a  secret chamber which we had been told opened into the room in which we then  found ourselves. As I did not wish to make any mystery of the affair, and as I  naturally had my doubts as to what the room might disclose, I asked the support  of his presence.</p>
  <p align="left">He was gratified&mdash;the  doctor always is gratified at any token of appreciation&mdash;and perceiving that I  had no further reason for delay, I motioned to Mr. Tamworth to proceed.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page053.jpg" width="800" height="629"></p>
  <p align="left">How he discovered the  one movable panel in that old-fashioned wainscoting, I have never inquired.  When I saw him turn toward the fireplace and lay his ear to the wall, I  withdrew in haste to the window, feeling as if I could not bear to watch him,  or be the first to catch a glimpse of the mysterious depths which in another  moment must open before his touch. What I feared I cannot say. As far as I  could reason on the subject, I had no cause to fear anything; and yet my  shaking frame and unevenly throbbing heart were but the too sure tokens of an  excessive and uncontrollable agitation. The view from the window increased it.  Before me lay the river from whose banks sand and stone had been taken sixteen  years before to replace&mdash;what? I knew no more this minute than I did then. I  might know in the next. By the faint tapping that came to my ears I must&mdash;and it  was this thought that sent a chill through me, and made it so difficult for me  to stand. And yet why should it? Was not that old theory of ours, that the  Urquharts had brought treasure in their great box, still a plausible one? Nay,  more, was it not even a probable one, since we had discovered that the house  held so excellent a hiding place, unknown to the world at large, but known to  this man, as Mr. Tamworth&rsquo;s story so plainly showed? Yes; and yet I started  with uncontrollable forebodings, when I heard an exclamation of satisfaction  behind me, and hardly found courage to turn around, even when I knew that an  opening had been effected, and that they were only waiting for my approach to  enter it.</p>
  <p align="left">And it took courage,  both on my part and on theirs; for the air which rushed from the high and  narrow slit of darkness before us was stifling and almost deadly. But in a few  minutes, after one or two experiments with a lighted candle, Dr. Kenyon stepped  through the opening, followed by Mr. Tamworth, and, in a long minute afterward,  by myself.</p>
  <p align="left">Shall I ever forget my  emotions as I looked about me and saw, by the lamp which the doctor carried,  nothing more startling than an old oak chest in one corner, a pile of faded  clothing in another, and in a third&mdash;Heavens! what is it? We all stare, and then  a shriek escapes my lips as piercing and terror-stricken as any that ever  disturbed those fearful shadows; and I rush blindly from the spot, followed by  Mr. Tamworth, whose face, as I turn to look at him, gives me another pang of  fear, so white and sick it looks in the sudden glare of day.</p>
  <p align="left">Worse than I had  thought, worse than I had dreamed! I cannot speak, and fall into a chair,  waiting in mortal terror for the doctor, who stayed some minutes behind. When  his kindly but not undisturbed countenance showed itself again in the gap at  the side of the fireplace, I could almost have thrown myself at his feet.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page057.jpg" width="466" height="500"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;Tell  me at once. Is it a man or a woman or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is a woman. See!  here is a lock of her hair. Beautiful, is it not? She must have been young.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I stared at it like one  demented. It was of a peculiar reddish-brown, with a strange little kink and  curl in it. Where had I seen such hair before? Somewhere. I remembered perfectly  how the whole bright head looked with the firelight playing over it. Oh, no,  no, no, it was not that of Mrs. Urquhart. Mrs. Urquhart went away from this  house well and happy. I am mad, or this strand of gleaming hair is a dream. It  is not her head it recalls to me, and yet&mdash;my soul, it is!</p>
  <p align="left">The doctor, knowing me  well, did not try to break the silence of that first grewsome minute. But when  he saw me ready to speak, he remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is an old crime,  perpetrated, probably, before you came into the house. I would not make any  more of it than you can help, Mrs. Truax.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I scarcely heeded him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is there no bit of  clothing or jewelry left upon her by which we might hope to identify her?&rdquo; I  asked, shuddering, as I caught Mr. Tamworth&rsquo;s eye, and realized the nature of  the doubts I there beheld.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here is a ring I found  upon the wedding finger,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It was doubtless too small to be drawn  off at the time of her death, but it came away easily enough now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And he held out a plain  gold circlet which I eagerly took, looked at, and fell at their feet as  senseless as a stone.</p>
  <p align="left">On the inner surface I  had discovered this legend:</p>
  <p align="left">E. U. to H. D. Jan. 27,  1775.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    Questions And Answers</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Never have I felt such  relief as when, upon my resuscitation, I remembered that I had put upon paper  all the events and all the suspicions which had troubled me during that fatal  night of January the 28th, sixteen years before. With that in my possession, I  could confront any suspicion which might arise, and it was this thought which  lent to my bearing at this unhappy time a dignity and self-possession which  evidently surprised the two gentlemen.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You seem more shocked  than astonished,&rdquo; was Mr. Tamworth&rsquo;s first remark, as, mistress once more of  myself, I led the way out of that horrible room into one breathing less of  death and the charnel house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said I.  &ldquo;Mysteries which have troubled me for years are now in the way of being  explained by this discovery. I knew that something either fearful or precious  had been left in the keeping of this house or grounds; but I did not know what  this something was, and least of all did I suspect that its hiding place was  between walls whose turns and limitations I thought I knew as well as I do the  paths of my garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You speak riddles,&rdquo; Dr.  Kenyon now declared. &ldquo;You knew that something fearful or precious had been left  in your house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I  interrupted; &ldquo;I said house or grounds. I thought it was in the grounds, for how  could I think that the house could, without my knowledge, hold anything of the  nature I have just suggested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You knew, then, that a  person had been murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I persisted, with  a strange calmness, considering how agitated I was, both by my memories and the  fears I could not but entertain for the future; &ldquo;I know nothing; nor can I,  even with the knowledge of this discovery, understand or explain what took  place in my house sixteen years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And in a few hurried  words I related the story of the mysterious couple who had occupied that room  on the night of January 27, 1775.</p>
  <p align="left">They listened to me as  if I were repeating a fairy tale, and as I noted the sympathizing air with  which Dr. Kenyon tried to hide his natural incredulity, I again congratulated  myself that I had been a weak enough woman to keep an account of the events  which had so impressed me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You think I am drawing  upon my imagination,&rdquo; I quietly remarked, as silence fell upon my narration.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; the  doctor began, hurriedly; &ldquo;but the details you give are so open to question, and  the conclusions you expect us to draw from them are so serious, that I wish,  for your own sake, we had heard something of the Urquharts, and your doubts and  suspicions in their regard, before we had made the discovery which points to  death and crime. You see I speak plainly, Mrs. Truax.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You cannot speak too  plainly, Doctor Kenyon; and my opinion so entirely coincides with yours that I  am going to furnish you with what you ask.&rdquo; And without heeding their looks of  astonishment, I rang the bell for one of the girls, and sent her to a certain  drawer in my desk for the folded paper which she would find there.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; I exclaimed, as  the paper was brought, &ldquo;read this, and you will soon see how I felt about the  Urquharts on the evening of the day they left us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And I put into their  hands the record I had made of that day&rsquo;s experience.</p>
  <p align="left">While they were reading  it, I puzzled myself with questions. If this body which we had just found  sepulchered in my house was, as the initials in the ring seemed to declare,  that of Honora Urquhart, who was the woman who passed for her at the time of  the departure of this accused couple from my doors? I was with them, and saw  the lady, and supposed her to be the same I had entertained at my table the  night before. But then I chiefly noted her dress and height, and did not see  her face, which was hidden by her veil, and did not hear her voice beyond the  short and somewhat embarrassed laugh she gave at some little incident which had  occurred. But Hetty had seen her, and had even received money from her hand;  and Hetty could not have been deceived, nor was Hetty a girl to be bribed. How  was I, then, to understand the matter? And where, in case another woman had  taken Mrs. Urquhart&rsquo;s place, had that woman come from?</p>
  <p align="left">I thought of the low  window, and the ease with which any one could climb into it; and then, with a  flash of startled conviction, I thought of the huge box.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; I  ejaculated, feeling the hair stir anew on my forehead. &ldquo;Can it be that he  brought her in that? That she was with them all the time, and that the almost  hellish tragedy to which this ring points was the scheme of two vile and  murderous lovers to suppress an unhappy wife that stood in the way of their  desires?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I could not think it. I  could not believe that any man could be so void of mercy, or any woman so lost  to every instinct of decency, as to plan, and then coolly carry out to the end,  a crime so unheard of in its atrocity. There must be some other explanation of  the facts before us. Why, the date in the ring is enough. If that speaks true,  the marriage between Edwin Urquhart and the gentle Honora was but a day old,  and even the worst of men take time to weary of their wives before they take  measures against them. Yet, the look and manner of the man! His affection for  the box, and his manifest indifference for his wife! And, lastly, and most  convincing of all, this awful token in the room beyond! What should I, what  could I think!</p>
  <p align="left">At this point in my  surmises I grew so faint that I turned to Dr. Kenyon and Mr. Tamworth for  relief. They had just finished my record of the past, and were looking at each  other in surprise and horror.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It surpasses the most  atrocious deeds of the middle ages,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Tamworth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In a country deemed  civilized,&rdquo; finished the doctor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you think,&rdquo; I  tremblingly began&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That you have harbored  two demons under your roof, Mrs. Truax. There seems to be no doubt that the  woman who went away with Mr. Urquhart was not the woman who came with him. She  lies here, while the other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He paused, and Mr.  Tamworth took up the word.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It seems to have been a  strangely triumphant piece of villainy. The woman who profited by it must have  had great self-control and force of character. Don&rsquo;t you think so, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unquestionably,&rdquo; was  the firm reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You do not say how you  account for her presence here,&rdquo; I now reluctantly intimated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think she was hidden  in the great box. It was large enough for that, was it not, Mrs. Truax?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I nodded, much agitated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His care of it, his  call for a supper, the change in its weight, and the fact that its contents  were of a different character in going than coming, all point to the fact of  its having been used for the purpose we intimated. It strikes one as most  horrible, but history furnishes us with precedents of attempts equally daring,  and if the box was well furnished with holes&mdash;did you notice any breathing  places in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;but I  did not cast two glances at the box. I was jealous of it, for the young wife&rsquo;s  sake, though, as God knows, I had little idea of what it contained, and merely  noticed that it was big and clumsy, and capable of holding many books.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet you must have  noticed, even in a cursory glance, whether its top or sides were broken by  holes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They were not, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do remember, now,  that he flung his traveling-cloak across it just as the men went to lift it  from the wagon, and that the cloak remained upon it all the time it was in  their hands, and until after we had all left the room. But it was taken away  later, for when I went in the second time, I saw it lying across the chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was hidden by the foot  of the bed behind which he had dragged it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the cloak? Was it  over the box when it went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; but I have thought  since we have been talking, that the box might have been turned over after its  occupant left it. The holes, if there were any, would thus be on the bottom,  and would escape our detection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very possible, but the  sand with which we supposed the box had been filled would have sifted through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not if a good firm  piece of stuff was laid in first, and there were plenty of such in the secret  chamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is true. But  Burritt, you write, was listening at the door, and yet you mention no remarks  of his concerning any noises heard by him from within. And noise must have been  made if this was done, as it must have had to be done after the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know I do not,&rdquo; was  the hurried reply. &ldquo;But Burritt probably did not remain at the door all the  time. There is a window seat at the end of the corridor, and upon it he  probably lolled during the few hours of his watch. Besides, you must remember  that Burritt left his post some time before daylight. He had his duties to  attend to, some of which necessitated his being in the stables by four o&rsquo;clock,  at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see; and so the  affair prospered, as most very daring deeds do, and they escaped without  suspicion, or rather without suspicion pointed enough to lead to their being  followed. I wonder where they escaped to, and if in all the years that have  elapsed, they have for one moment imagined that they were happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; was my  horrified exclamation. &ldquo;Oh, if I could find them! If I could drag them both to  this room and make them keep company with their victim for a week, I should  feel it too slight a retribution for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heaven has had its eye  upon them. We have been through fearful crises since that day, and much  unrighteous as well as righteous blood has been shed in this land. They may  both be dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do not believe it,&rdquo; I  muttered. &ldquo;Such wretches never die.&rdquo; Then, with a renewed remembrance of Hetty,  I remarked: &ldquo;Curses on the duties that kept me out of this room on that fatal  morning. Had I seen the woman&rsquo;s face, this horrid crime would at least been  spared its triumph. But I was obliged to send Hetty, and she saw nothing  strange in the woman, though she received money from her hand, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is Hetty?&rdquo;  interrupted the doctor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is married, and  lives in the next town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So, so. Well, we must  hunt her up to-morrow, and see what she has to say about the matter now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But we soon found  ourselves too impatient to wait till the morrow, so after we had eaten a good  supper in a cheerful room, Dr. Kenyon mounted his horse, and rode away to the  farm house where Hetty lived. While he was gone, Mr. Tamworth summoned up  courage to re-enter that cave of horror, and bring out the contents of the oak  chest we had seen there. These were mostly stuffs in a more or less good state  of preservation, and all the assistance they lent to the understanding of the  tragedy that mystified us was the fact that the chest contained nothing, nor  the room itself, of sufficient substance to help the wicked Urquhart in giving  weight to the box which he had emptied of its living freight. This is doubtless  the reason he resorted to the garden for the sand and stone he found there.</p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Kenyon returned  about midnight, and was met at the door by Mr. Tamworth and myself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I cried, in  great excitement.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just as I supposed,&rdquo; he  returned. &ldquo;She did not see the lady&rsquo;s face either. The latter was in bed, and  the girl took it for granted that the arm and hand which reached her out a  silver piece from between the bed curtains were those of Mrs. Urquhart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My house is cursed!&rdquo;  was my sudden exclamation. &ldquo;It has not only lent itself to the success of the  most demoniacal scheme that ever entered into the heart of man, but it has kept  its secret so long that all hope of explaining its details or reaching the  guilty must be abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; quoth Mr.  Tamworth. &ldquo;Though an old man, I dedicate myself to this task. You will hear  again of the Urquharts.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    An Interim Of Suspense</b></h2>
  <p align="left">May 5, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">HOW fearful! To hear a  spade in the night and know that this spade is digging a grave! I sit at my  desk and listen to hear if any one in the house has been aroused or is  suspicious, and then I turn to the window and try to pierce the gloom to see if  anything can be discerned, from the house, of the grewsome act now being  performed in the garden. For after much consultation and several conferences  with the authorities, we have decided to preserve from public knowledge, not  only the secret of the room hidden in my house, but of the discovery which has  lately been made there. But while much harm would accrue to me by revelations  which would throw a pall of horror over my inn, and make it no better than a  place of morbid curiosity forever, the purposes of justice would be rather  hindered than helped by a publicity which would give warning to the guilty  couple, and prevent us from surprising them in the imagined security which the  lapse of so many years must have brought them.</p>
  <p align="left">And so a grave is being  dug in the garden, where, at the darkest hour of night, the remains of the  sweet and gentle bride are to be placed without tablet or mound.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile do there hide in  any part of this wicked world two hearts which throb with unusual terrors this  night? Or does there pass across the mirror of a guilty memory any unusual  shapes of horror prognostic of detection and coming punishment? It would  comfort my uneasy heart to know; for the spirit of vengeance has seized upon  me, and my house will never seem washed of its stain, or my conscience be quite  at rest as to the past, till that vile man and woman pay, in some way, the  penalty of their crime.</p>
  <p align="left">That we know nothing of  them but their names lends an interest to their pursuit. The very difficulty  before us, the hopelessness almost of the task we have set ourselves, have  raised in me a wild and well-nigh superstitious reliance on Providence and the  eternal justice, so that it seems natural for me to expect aid even from such  sources as dreams and visions, and make the inquiry in which I have just  indulged the reasonable expression of my belief in the mysterious forces of  right and wrong, which will yet bring this long triumphant, but now secretly  threatened, pair to justice.</p>
  <p align="left">Dr. Kenyon, who is as  practical as he is pious, smiles at my confidence; but Mr. Tamworth neither  mocks nor frowns. He has shouldered the responsibility of finding this man, and  has often observed, in his long life, that a woman&rsquo;s intuitions go as far as a  man&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>
  <p align="left">To-morrow he will start  upon his travels.</p>
  <p align="left">June 12, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">It is foolish to put  every passing thought on paper, but these sheets have already served me so well  that I cannot resist the temptation of making them the repositories of my  secret fears and hopes. Mr. Tamworth has been gone a month, and I have heard  nothing from him. This is all the more difficult to bear that Dr. Kenyon also  has left me, thus taking from my house all in whom I can confide or to whom I  can talk. For I will not place confidence in servants, and there are no guests  here at present upon whose judgment I can rely concerning even a lesser matter  than this which occupies all my thoughts.</p>
  <p align="left">I must talk, then, to  thee, unknown reader of these lines, and declare on paper what I have said a  thousand times to myself&mdash;what a mystery this whole matter is, and how little  probability there is of our ever understanding it! Why was it that Edwin  Urquhart, if he loved one woman so well that he was willing to risk his life to  gain her, would subject himself to the terrors which must follow any crime, no  matter how secretly performed, by marrying a woman he must kill in twenty-four  hours? Marriages are not compulsory in this country, and any one must  acknowledge that it would be easier for a strong man&mdash;and he certainly was no  weakling&mdash;to refuse a woman at the nuptial altar than to undertake and carry out  a scheme so full of revolting details and involving so much risk as this which  we have been forced to ascribe to him.</p>
  <p align="left">Then the woman, the  unknown and fearful creature who had allowed herself to be boxed up and  carried, God knows, how many fearful miles, just for the purpose of assuming a  position which she seemingly might have obtained in ways much less repulsive  and dangerous! Was it in human nature to go through such an ordeal, and if it  were, what could the circumstances have been that would drive even the most  insensible nature into such an adventure! I question, and try to answer my own inquiries,  but my imagination falters over the task, and I am no nearer to the  satisfaction of my doubts than I was in the harrowing minute when the knowledge  of this tragedy first flashed upon me.</p>
  <p align="left">I must have patience.  Mr. Tamworth must write to me soon.</p>
  <p align="left">August 10, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">News, news, and such  news! How could I ever have dreamed of it! But let me transcribe Mr. Tamworth&rsquo;s  letter:</p>
  <p align="left">To Mrs. Clarissa Truax,<br>
  &nbsp;Mistress of the Happy-go-lucky Inn:<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Respected Madam: After a  lengthy delay, occupied in researches, made doubly difficult by the changes  which have been wrought in the country by the late conflict, I have just come  upon a fact that has the strongest bearing upon the serious tragedy which we  are both so interested in investigating. It is this:</p>
  <p align="left">That every year the  agent of a certain large estate in Albany, N. Y., forwards to France a large  sum of money, for the use and behoof of one Honora Quentin Urquhart, daughter  of the late Cyrus Dudleigh, of Albany, and wife of one Edwin Urquhart, a  gentleman of that same city, to whom she was married in her father&rsquo;s house on  January 27, 1775, and with whom she at once departed for France, where she and  her husband have been living ever since.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus by chance, almost,  have I stumbled upon an explanation of the tragedy we found so inexplicable,  and found that clew to the whereabouts of the wretched pair which is so  essential to their apprehension and the proper satisfaction of the claims of  justice.</p>
  <p align="left">With great consideration  I sign myself,</p>
  <p align="left">Your obedient servant,<br>
  &nbsp;Anthony Tamworth.</p>
  <p align="left">August 11, 8 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p align="left">I was so overwhelmed by  the above letter that I found it impossible at the time to comment upon it.  To-day it is too late, for this morning a packet arrived from Mr. Tamworth  containing another letter of such length that I am sure it must be one of  complete explanation. I burn to read it, but I have merely had time to break  the seal and glance at the first opening words. Will my guests be so kind as to  leave me in peace to-night, so that I may satisfy a curiosity which has become almost  insupportable?</p>
  <p align="left">Midnight.</p>
  <p align="left">No time to-night; too  tired almost to write this.</p>
  <p align="left">August 12.</p>
  <p align="left">The packet is read. I am  all of a tremble. What a tale! What a&mdash; But why encumber these sheets with words  of mine? I will insert the letter and let it tell its own portion of the  strange and terrible history which time is slowly unrolling before us.</p>
  <h2><a name="Chapter_6"></a><b>Chapter 6<br>
  The Recluse</b></h2>
  <p align="left">To Mrs. Clarissa Truax,<br>
  &nbsp;of the Happy-go-lucky Inn:</p>
  <p align="left">Respected Madam: Appreciating  your anxiety, I hasten to give you the particulars of an interview which I have  just had with a person who knew Edwin Urquhart. They must be acceptable to you,  and I shall make no excuse for the length of my communication, knowing that  each detail in the lives of the three persons connected with this crime must be  of interest to one who has brooded upon the subject as long as you have.</p>
  <p align="left">The person to whom I  allude is a certain Mark Felt, a most eccentric and unhappy being now living  the life of a recluse amid the forests of the Catskills. I became acquainted  with his name at the time of my first investigation into the history of the  Dudleigh and Urquhart families, and it was to him I was referred when I asked  for such particulars as mere neighbors and public officials found it impossible  to give.</p>
  <p align="left">I was told, however, at  the same time, that I should find it hard to gain his confidence, as for  sixteen years now he had avoided the companionship of men, by hiding in the  caves and living upon such food as he could procure through the means of gun  and net. A disappointment in love was said to be at the bottom of this, the  lady he was engaged to having thrown herself into the river at about the time  of the marriage of his friend.</p>
  <p align="left">He was, notwithstanding,  a good-hearted man, and if I could once break through the reserve he had  maintained for so many years, they thought I would be able to surprise facts  from him which I could never hope to reach in any other way.</p>
  <p align="left">Interested by these  insinuations, and somewhat excited, for an old man, at the prospect of bearding  such a lion in his den, I at once made up my mind to seek this Felt; and  accordingly one bright day last week crossed the river and entered the forest.  I was not alone. I had taken a guide who knew the location of the cave which  Felt was supposed to inhabit, and through his efforts my journey was made as  little fatiguing as possible. Fallen brambles were removed from my path, limbs  lifted, and where the road was too rough for the passage of such faltering feet  as mine, I found myself lifted bodily, in arms as strong and steadfast as  steel, and carried like a child to where it was smoother.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus I was enabled to  traverse paths that at first view appeared inaccessible, and finally reached a  spot so far up the mountain side that I gazed behind me in terror lest I should  never be able to return again the way I had come. My guide, seeing my alarm,  assured me that our destination was not far off, and presently I perceived  before me a huge overhanging cliff, from the upper ledges of which hung down a  tangle of vines and branches that veiled, without wholly concealing, the  yawning mouth of a cave.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is where the man  we are seeking lives, eats, and sleeps,&rdquo; quoth my guide, as we paused for a  moment to regain our breath. And immediately upon his words, and as if called  forth by them, we perceived an unkempt and disheveled head slowly uprear itself  through the black gap before us, then hastily disappear again behind the vines  it had for a moment disturbed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will encounter him  alone,&rdquo; I thereupon declared; and leaving the guide behind me, I pushed forward  to the cliff, and pausing before the entrance of the cave, I called aloud:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mark Felt, do you want  to hear news from your friend Urquhart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For a moment all was  still, and I began to fear that my somewhat daring attempt had failed in its  effect. But this was only for an instant, for presently something between a  growl and a cry issued from the darkness within, and the next moment the wild  and disheveled head showed itself again, and I heard distinctly these words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is no friend of  mine, your Edwin Urquhart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I returned,  without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;do you want to hear news of your enemy?&mdash;for I  have some, and of the rarest nature, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The wild eyes flashed as  if a flame of fire had shot from them, and the head that held them advanced  till I could see the whole bearded countenance of the man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; he asked,  with an eagerness and underlying triumph in the voice that argued well for the  presence of those passions upon the rousing of which I relied for the  revelations I sought.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but death  is looking his way. With a little more knowledge of his early life and a little  more insight into his character at the time he married Honora Dudleigh, the law  will have so firm a hold upon him that I can safely promise any one who longs  to see him pay the penalty of his evil deeds a certain opportunity of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page083.jpg" width="800" height="599"></p>
  <p align="left">The vines trembled and  suddenly parted their full length, and Mark Felt stepped out into the sunshine  and confronted me. What he wore I cannot say, for his personality was so strong  I received no impression of anything else. Not that he was tall or picturesque,  or even rudely handsome. On the contrary, he was as plain a man as I had ever  seen, with eyes to which some defect lent a strange, fixed glare, and a mouth  whose under jaw protruded so markedly beyond the upper that his profile gave  you a shock when any slight noise or stir drew his head to one side and thus  revealed it to you. Yet, in spite of all this, in spite of tangled locks and a  wide, rough beard, half brown, half white, his face held something that fixed  the attention and fascinated the eye that encountered it. Did it lie in his  eyes? How could it, with one looking like a fixed stone of agate and the other  like a rolling ball of fire? Was it in his smile? How could it be when his  smile had no joy in it, only a satisfaction that was not of good, but evil, and  promised trouble rather than relief or sympathy? It must be in the general  expression of his features, which seemed made only to mirror the emotions of a  soul full of vitality and purpose&mdash;a soul which, if clouded by wrongs and  embittered by heavy memories, possessed at least the characteristic of force  and the charm of an unswerving purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">He seemed to recognize  the impression he had made, for his lips smiled with a sort of scornful triumph  before he said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These are peculiar  words for a stranger. May I ask your name and whose interests you represent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His speech was quick,  and had an odd halt in it, such as might be expected from one who had not  conferred with his fellows for years. But there was no rudeness in its tone,  nor was there any mistaking the fact that he was, both by nature and education,  a gentleman. I began to take an interest in him apart from my mission.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Felt,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;my  name is Tamworth. I am from Virginia, and only by chance have I become involved  in a matter near to you and the man who, you tell me, is, or was, your enemy.  As for the interests I represent, they are those of justice, and justice only;  and it is in her behalf and for the triumph of law and righteousness that I now  ask you for your confidence and such details concerning your early intercourse  with Edwin Urquhart as will enable me to understand a past that will certainly  yield us a clew to the present. Are you willing to give them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will I give them?&rdquo; he  laughed. &ldquo;Will I break the seal which guards the tablets of my youth, and let a  stranger&rsquo;s eyes read lines to which I have shut my own for these many years! Do  you not know that for me to tell you what I once knew of Edwin Urquhart is to  bare my own breast to view, and subject to new sufferings a heart that it has  taken fifteen years of solitude to render callous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I gave no answer to  this, only looked at him and stood waiting.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have hunted me out,  you have touched the last string that ceases to vibrate in a man&rsquo;s breast&mdash;that  of a wild desire for vengeance&mdash;and now you ask me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To ease your memories  of a burden. To drag into light the skeleton of old days, and by the light thus  thrown upon it to see that it is only a skeleton, that, once beheld, should be  buried and its old bones forgotten. You are too much of a man, Felt, to waste  away in these wilds. Come! forget I am a stranger, and relieve yourself and me  by opening these tablets you speak of, even if it does cost you a pang of the  old sorrow. The talk we have had has already made a flutter in the long-closed  leaves, and should I leave you this minute you could not smother the thoughts  and memories to which our conversation has given rise. Then why not think to  purpose and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He raised one hand and  stopped me. The gesture was full of fire, and so was the eye he now turned away  from me to gaze up at the overhanging steeps above, with their great gorges and  magnificent play of light and shadow; at the valley beneath, with its broad  belt of shining water winding in and out through fertile banks and growing  towns, and finally at the blue dome of the sky, across which great clouds went  sailing in shapes so varied and of size so majestic that it was like a vision  of floating palaces on a sea of translucent azure.</p>
  <p align="left">Gasping in a strange  mood between delight and despair, he flung up his arms.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! I have loved these  hills. Of all the longings and affections that one by one have perished from my  heart, the solitary passion for nature has alone remained, unlessened and  undisturbed. I love these trees with their countless boughs; these rocks, with  their hidden pitfalls and sudden precipices. The sky that bends above me here is  bluer than any other sky; and when it frowns and gathers its storms together,  and hurls them above these ledges and upon my uncovered head, I throw up my  arms as I do now and exult in the tumult, and become a part of it, till the  hunger in my soul is appeased, and the blood in my veins runs mildly again. And  now I must quit all this. I must give to men thoughts that have been closely  wedded to Nature. I must tear her image from my heart, and in her pure place  substitute interests in a life I thought forever sacrificed to her worship. It  is a bitter task, but I will perform it. There are other calls than those which  reverberate from yon peaks. I have just heard one, and my feet go down once  more into the valleys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His arms fell with the  last words, and his eyes returned again to my face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come into the cave,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I cannot tell my story in the sight of these pure skies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I followed him without a  word. He had affected me. The invocation in which he had indulged, and which,  from another man, and other circumstances, would have struck me as a theatrical  attempt upon my sympathy as forced as it was unnatural, was in him so  appropriate, and in such keeping with the grandeur of the scene by which we  were surrounded, that I was disarmed of criticism, and succumbed without  resistance to his power.</p>
  <p align="left">The cave, once entered,  was light enough. On the ground were spread in profusion leaves and twigs of  the sweet-smelling cedar, making a carpet as pleasing as it was warm and  healthful. On one side I saw a mound of the same, making a couch, across which  a great cloak was spread; while beyond, the half-defined forms of a rude seat  and table appeared, lending an air of habitableness to the spot, which, from  the exterior, I had hardly expected to find. A long slab of stone served as a  hearth, and above it I perceived a hole in the rock, toward which a thin column  of smoke was rising from a few smouldering embers that yet remained burning  upon the great stone below. Altogether, it was a home I had entered; and awed a  little at the remembrance that it had been the refuge of this solitary man  through years pregnant with events forever memorable in the history of the  world as those which gave birth to a new nation, I sank down upon the pile of  cedar he pointed out to me, and waited in some impatience for him to begin his  tale.</p>
  <p align="left">This he seemed in no  hurry to do. He waited so long with his chin sunk in his two hands and his eyes  fixed upon vacancy, that I grew restless and was about to break the silence  myself, when, without moving, he suddenly spoke.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    Two Women</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You want to hear about  Edwin Urquhart. Well, you shall, but first I promise you that I shall talk much  less of him than of another person. Why? because it is on account of this other  person that I hate him, and solely because of this other person that I avenge  myself, or seek to assist others in avenging the justice you say he has  outraged.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were friends from  boyhood. Reared in the same town and under the same influences, there was a  community of interests between us that threw us together and made us what is  called friends. But I never liked him. That is, I never felt a confidence in  him which is essential to a mutual understanding. And, though I accepted his  companionship, and was much with him at the most critical time of my life, I  always kept one side, and that the better side, of my nature closed to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was a gentleman with  no expectations; I the inheritor of a small fortune that made my friendship of  temporary use to him, even if it did not offer him much to rely on in the  future. We lived, he with an uncle who was ready to throw him off the moment he  was assured that he would not marry one of his daughters, and I in my own  house, which, if no manor, was at least my own, and for the present free from  debt. I myself thought that Urquhart intended to marry one of the girls to whom  I have just alluded. But it seems that he never meant to do this, and only  encouraged his uncle to think so because he was not yet ready to give up the  shelter he enjoyed with him. But of this, as I say, I was ignorant, and was  consequently very much astonished when, one nightfall, in passing the great  Dudleigh place, he remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;How would you like to  drink a glass with me in yonder? Better than in the Fairfax kitchen, eh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought he was  joking. &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a fine old house,&rsquo; I observed. &lsquo;No doubt its wines are good. But  it is no tavern, and I question if Miss Dudleigh would make either of us very  welcome.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You do! Then you don&rsquo;t  know Miss Dudleigh,&rsquo; he vaunted, with a proud swelling of his person, and a  lift of his head that almost took my breath away. For, though he was a handsome  fellow&mdash;too handsome for a man no worthier than he&mdash;I should no more have  presumed to have associated him in my thoughts with Miss Dudleigh than if he  had been a worker in her fields. Not so much because she was rich&mdash;very rich for  that day and place&mdash;or that her family was an old one, and his but a mushroom  stock, as that she was a being of the gentlest instincts and the purest  thoughts, while he was what you may have gathered from my words&mdash;vain, coarse,  cowardly and mean; an abject cur beside her, who was, and is, one of the  sweetest women the sun ever shone upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this expression of  admiration on the part of the hermit, which proved him to be in entire ignorance  of the crime which had been perpetrated against this woman, I found myself  struck so aghast that I could not forbear showing it. But he was too engrossed  in his reminiscences to notice my emotion, and presently continued his story by  saying:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I probably betrayed my  astonishment to Urquhart, for he gave a great laugh, and forced me about toward  the gates.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We will not be turned  out,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Let us go in and pay our respects.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I stammered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo;  he pursued. &lsquo;The fair lady is of age and has the privilege of choosing her  future husband. I shall live in clover, eh? Well, it is time I lived in  something. I have had a hard enough time of it so far, for a none too homely  fellow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was overwhelmed; more  than that, I was sickened by these words, whose import I understood only too  well. Not that I had any special interest in Miss Dudleigh; indeed, I hardly  knew her; but any such woman inspires respect, and I could not think of her as  allied to this man without a spasm of revolt that almost amounted to fear.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are going to marry  her, this white rose!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;I should as soon have thought of your  marrying a princess of the royal house. I hope you appreciate your unbounded  good fortune.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He pointed to the great  chimneys and imposing facade of the fine structure before us. &lsquo;Do you think I  am so blind as not to know the advantage of being the master in a house like  that? You must not think me quite a fool if I am not as clever a fellow as you  are. Remember that I am a poorer one and like my ease better.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;But Miss Dudleigh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a trifle  peaked and dull, but she&rsquo;s fond and not too exacting.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was angry, but had no  excuse for showing it. Righteous indignation he could never have understood,  and to have provoked a quarrel without any definite end in view would have been  folly. I remained silent, therefore, but my heart burned within me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It had not lost its  heat when we entered her house, and when my eyes fell upon her seated at her  spinet in front of a latticed window that brought out her gentle figure in all  its sweet simplicity, I felt like clutching, and flinging back over the  threshold, which his desecrating foot should never have crossed, the  hollow-hearted being at my side, who could neither see her beauty nor estimate  the worth of her innocent affection.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There was an aunt or  some such relative in the room with her, but this did not hinder the glad smile  from rising to her lips as she saw us&mdash;or rather him, for she hardly seemed to  notice my presence. I learned afterward that this aunt had been greatly  instrumental in bringing these incongruous natures together; that for reasons  of her own, which I have never attempted to fathom, she thought Edwin Urquhart  the best husband that her niece could have, and not only introduced him into  the house, but stood so much his friend during the first days of his courtship  that she gradually imparted to her niece her own enthusiasm, till the poor girl  saw&mdash;or thought she saw&mdash;the ideal of her dreams in the base and shallow being  whom I called my friend.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;However that may be,  she certainly rose from her spinet that night in a pretty confusion that made  her absolutely lovely, and advancing with the mingled dignity of the heiress  and the tender bashfulness of the maiden in the presence of him she loved, she  tendered us a courtesy whose grace put me out of ease with myself, so much it  expressed the manners of people removed from the sphere in which it had  hitherto been my lot to move.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Urquhart showed no  embarrassment. His fine figure&mdash;he had that&mdash;bent forward with the most courtly  of bows, and after the introduction of my humble self to her notice, he entered  into a conversation which, if shallow, was at least bright, and for the moment  interesting. As I had no wish to talk, I gave myself up to watching her, and  came away at last more fixed than ever in my belief of her extreme worthiness  and of his extreme presumption in thinking of calling so perfect a creature  his.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Would to God she was  as poor as Janet Fairfax,&rsquo; I thought to myself. &lsquo;Then she would never have  attracted his attention, and might have known what happiness was with some man  who could appreciate her. Now she is doomed, and being fatherless and  motherless, will rush on to her fate, and no one can stop her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thus I thought, and  thus I continued to think as chance and Urquhart&rsquo;s stubborn will led me more  and more to her house, and within the radius of her gentle influence. But my  thoughts never went further. I never saw her, even in my dreams, fostered by  me, or soothed of an old grief by my love and affection. For though she was a  dainty and gracious being, with beauty enough to delight the eyes and warm the  heart, she was not the one destined to move me, and awake the tumultuous  passions that lay dormant in my own scarcely understood nature. Urquhart,  therefore, was not acting unwisely in taking me there so often, though, if I  could have foreseen what was likely to be the result of those visits, I should  have leaped from my house&rsquo;s roof on to the stones below before I had passed  again under those fatal portals.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And yet&mdash;would I? Do we  fear suffering or apathy most? Is it from experience or the monotony of a  commonplace existence that we quickest flee? A man with passions like mine must  love; and if that love comes girt with flame and mysterious death, he still  must embrace it, and rise and fall as the destinies will.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I talk riddles. I  have not yet told you of her; and yet speak of fire and death. I will try to be  more coherent, if only to show that the years have brought me some mastery over  myself. One day&mdash;it was a fall day and beautiful as limpid sunshine and a world  of yellowing woods could make it&mdash;I went to Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s house to apologize  for my friend, who had wished to improve the gorgeous sunshine elsewhere.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I had by this time lost  all fear of her, as well as of her rich and spacious surroundings, and passed  through the hospitable door and along the wide halls to the especial room in  which we were wont to find her, with that freedom engendered by an intimacy as cordial  as it was sincere. It was the room where first I had seen her, the room with  the wide latticed window at the back, and the spinet beneath it, and the old  carven chair of oak in which her white-clad form had always looked so ethereal;  and I entered it smiling, expecting to see her delicate figure rise from the  window, and advance toward me with that look of surprise and possible  disappointment which the absence of Urquhart would be apt to arouse in this too  loving nature. But the room was empty and the spinet closed, and I was about  turning to find a servant, when I felt an influence stealing over me so subtile  and so peculiar that I stood petrified and enthralled, hardly knowing if it  were music that held me spell-bound or some unknown and subduing perfume, that,  filling my senses, worked upon my brain, and made me feel like a man  transported at a breath from the land of reality into a land of dreams.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So potent the spell, so  inexplicable its action, that minutes may have elapsed before I wrenched myself  free from its power and looked to see what it was that so moved me. When I did,  I found myself at a loss to explain it. Whether it was music or perfume, or  just the emanation from an intense personality, I have never determined. I only  know that when I turned, I saw standing before me, in an attitude of waiting, a  woman of such marvelous attractions, and yet of an order of beauty so bizarre  and out of keeping with the times and the place in which she stood, that I  forgot to question everything but my own sanity and the reality of a vision so  unprecedented in all my experience. I therefore simply stood like her,  speechless and lost, and only came to myself when the figure before me suddenly  melted from a statue into a woman, and, with a deep and graceful courtesy,  almost daring in its abandonment, said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You must be Master  Felt, I take it. Master Urquhart would never be so thrown off his balance by a  simple girl like me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are voices that  pierce like arrows and sink deep into the heart, which closes over their  sweetness forever. So it was with this voice. From its first sound to its last  it held me enthralled, and had she shown but half the beauty she did, those  accents of hers would have made me her slave. As it was, I was more than her  slave. I instantly became all and everything to her. I breathed but as she  breathed, and in the absorbing delight which from that moment took hold of me I  lost all sense of the proprieties and conventionalities of social intercourse,  and only thought of drinking in at one draught the strange and mysterious  loveliness which I saw revealed before me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was not a tall  woman, no taller than Miss Dudleigh. Nor was she of marked carriage or build.  Her form, indeed, seemed only made to express suppleness and passion, and was  as speaking in its slight proportions as if it had breathed forth the nobler  attributes of majesty and strength. Her dress was dark, and clung to every  curve with a loving persistence bewildering in its effect upon an eye like  mine. Upon the bust, and just below the white throat, burned a mass of gorgeous  flowers as ruddy as wine; and from one delicate hand a long vine trailed to the  floor. But it was in her face that her power lay; in her eyes possibly, though  I scarcely think so, for there were curves to her lips such as I have never  seen in any other, and a delicate turn to her nostril that at times made me  feel as if she were breathing fire. Her skin was pale, her forehead broad and  low, her nose straight, and her lips of a brilliant vermilion. I, however, saw  only her eyes, though I may have been influenced by the rest of her bewildering  physiognomy; they were so large, so changeful, so full of alternating flames  and languor, so indeterminate in color, and yet so persistent in their effect  upon the eye and the feelings. Looking at them, I swore she was an anomaly.  Gazing into them, I resolved that she was this only because she let herself be  natural and sought to smother none of the fires which had been enkindled by a  bountiful nature within her soul.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;While I was reasoning  thus, she made me another mock courtesy, and explaining her presence by saying  she was a cousin of Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s, ventured to remark that, if Master Felt  would be kind enough to state his errand, she would be glad to carry it to Miss  Dudleigh. I answered confusedly, but with a fervor she could not fail to  understand, and following up this effort by another, led her into a  conversation in which my responses gradually became such as she should expect  from a gentleman and an equal.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For with her,  notwithstanding her beauty, and the sense of splendor and luxury which breathed  from her mysterious presence, I never felt that sense of personal inferiority I  experienced at first with Miss Dudleigh. Whether I recognized then, as now, the  lack of those high qualities which lift one mortal above another, I do not  know. I am only certain that, while I regarded her as a woman to be obeyed, to  be loved, to be followed through life, through death, into whatsoever regions  of horror, danger, and pain she might lead me, I never looked upon her as a  being out of my world or beyond my reach, except so far as her caprice might  carry her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was therefore with  the fixed determination to force from her some of the interest she had awakened  in me, that I grasped at this first opportunity of conversation; and in spite  of her unrest&mdash;she did not want to linger&mdash;held her to the spot till I had made  her feel that a man had come into her life whose will meant something, and to  whom, if she did not subdue the light of her glances, she must give account for  every added throb she caused to beat in his proud heart.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This done I let her go,  for Miss Dudleigh was not well and needed her, and the door closed behind her  mysterious smile, and the sound of her steps died out in the hall, and in fancy  only could I behold her supple, dark-clad form go up the broad staircase,  projecting itself now against the golden daylight falling through one window,  and now against the clustering vines that screened another, till she disappeared  in regions of which I knew nothing and whither even my daring imagination  presumed not to follow. And the vision never left my eyes nor her form my  heart, and I went out in my turn, a burning, eager, determined man, where in a  short half hour before I had entered cold and self-satisfied, without hope and  without exaltation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This was the beginning.  In a week the earth and sky held nothing for me but that woman. Her name, which  I had not learned at our first interview, was Marah Leighton&mdash;a fitting  watch-word for a struggle that could terminate only with my life! For I had got  to the pass that this woman must be mine. I would have her for my wife or see  her dead; she should never leave the town with another. Yes; homely as I was,  without recommendation of family, or more means than enough to keep a wife from  want, I boldly entered upon this determination, and in the face of some dozen  lovers, that at the first revelation of her beauty began to swarm about her  steps, pressed my claims and pushed forward my suit till I finally gained a  hearing, and after that a promise, which, if vague, was more than any of her  other lovers could boast of, or why did they all gradually withdraw from the  struggle, leaving me alone in my homage?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The uncertainties of  her position (she was an orphan and dependent upon Miss Dudleigh for  subsistence) had added greatly to my tenderness for her. It also added to my  hope. For if I were poor, she was poorer, and ought to find in the managing of  my humble home a satisfaction she could not experience in the enjoyment of a  relative&rsquo;s bounty, even if that relative was a woman like Honora Dudleigh. And  yet one doubts an exultant happiness; and as I grew to know her better, I  realized that if I ever did succeed in making her mine, I must see to it that  my fortunes bettered, as she would never be happy as a poor man&rsquo;s wife, even if  that man brought her independence and love.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She loved splendor, she  loved distinction, she loved the frivolities of life. Not with a childish  pleasure or even a girlish enthusiasm, but with a woman&rsquo;s strong and determined  spirit. I have seen her pace through and through those great halls just for the  pleasure of realizing their spaciousness; and though the sight made my heart  cringe, I have admired her step and the poise of her head as much as if she had  been the queen of it all, and I her humblest vassal. Then her luxury! It showed  as plainly in her poverty as it could have done in wealth. If it were flowers  she handled, it was as a goddess would handle them. None were too beautiful, or  too costly, or too rare for her restless fingers to pluck, or her dainty feet  to tread on. Had she possessed jewels, she would have worn them like roses, and  flung them away almost as freely if they had displeased her or she had grown  weary of them. Love was to her a jewel, and she wore it just now because it  suited her fancy to do so; but would not the day come when she would grow tired  of it or demand another, and so fling it and me to the dogs?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not ask. I was  permitted to walk at her side, and pay her my court, and now and then, when the  humor took her, to press her hand or drop a kiss upon the rosy palm; and while  I could do this, was it for me to question a future which seemed more likely to  hold fewer pleasures than more?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I grow diffuse; I  must return to facts. Honora Dudleigh, who saw my devotion, encouraged it. I  wondered at it sometimes, for she knew the smallness of my fortune, and must  have known the nature of the woman I expected to share it. But as time passed I  wondered less, for her woman&rsquo;s intuition must have told her, what observation  had as yet failed to tell me, that there was trouble in the air, and that Marah  needed a protector.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The day that I first  recognized this fact made an era in my life. I had been so happy, so at ease  with myself, so sure of her growing confidence and of my coming happiness. That  I had cause for this, the conduct of her friends and the jealousy of her lovers  seemed to prove. Though she gave no visible token of her regard, she clung to me  as to a support, and allowed my passion the constant feast of her presence and  the stimulation of her voice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her enchantments, and  they were innumerable, were never spared me, nor did she stint herself of a  smile that could allure, nor of a glance that could arouse or perplex.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was happy, and  questioned only the extent of my patience, which I felt fast giving way as the  preparations for Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s marriage proceeded without my seeing any  immediate prospect of my own. You can realize, then, the maddening nature of  the shock which I received when, coming quietly into the house as I did one  day, I beheld her face disappearing through one of the doorways, with that look  upon it which I had always felt was natural to it, but which no passion of mine  had ever been able to evoke, and then perceived in the shadow from which she  had just glided, Edwin Urquhart, pale as excessive feeling could make him, and  so shaken by the first real emotion which had ever probably moved his selfish  soul that he not only failed to see me when I advanced, but hastened by me, and  away into the solitudes of the garden, without noticing my existence, or  honoring with a reply the words of wrath and confusion which, in my misery and  despair, I threw after him.&rdquo;</p>

    A Sudden Betrothal</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As for myself,&rdquo;  continued Mark Felt, &ldquo;I stood crushed, and after the first torrent of emotion  had swept by, lifted my head like a drowning man and looked wildly about, as  if, in the catastrophe which overwhelmed me, all nature must have changed, and  I should find myself in a strange place. The sight of the door through which  Marah Leighton had passed stung me into tortured existence again. With a roar  of passion and hate I sprang toward it, burst it open, and passed in. Instantly  silence and semi-darkness fell upon me, through which I felt her presence  exhaling its wonted perfume, though I could see nothing but the dim shapes of  unaccustomed articles of furniture grouped against a window that was almost  completely closed from the light of day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Advancing, I gazed upon  chair after chair. They were all empty, and not till I reached the further  corner did I find her, thrown at full length upon a couch, with her head buried  in her arms, and motionless as any stone. Confused, appalled even, for I had  never seen her otherwise than erect and mocking, I stumbled back, and would  have fled, but that she suddenly arose, and flinging back her head, gave me one  look, which I felt rather than saw, and bursting into a peal of laughter,  called me to account for disturbing the first minute of rest she had known that  day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was dumfounded. If  she had consulted all her wiles, and sought for the one best way to silence me,  she could not have chanced on one surer than this. I gazed at her quite  helpless, and forgot&mdash;actually forgot&mdash;what had drawn me into her presence, and  only asked to get a good glimpse of her face, which, in the dim light, was more  like that of a spirit than of a woman&mdash;a mocking spirit, in whom no love could  lodge, whatever my fancy might have pictured in the delirium of the moment that  had just passed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She seemed to  comprehend my mood, for she flung back the curtain and drew herself up to her  full height before me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Did you think I was  playing the coquette?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Well, perhaps I was; women like me must have  their amusements; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! the languishment in  that but.  I shut my eyes as I heard it. I could neither bear its sound, nor the sight of  her face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You listened to him.  He was making love to you&mdash;he, the promised husband of another; and you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She forced me to open  my eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And I?&rsquo; she repeated,  with an indescribable emphasis that called up the blushes to my cheek.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And you,&rsquo; I went on,  answering her demand without hesitation, &lsquo;the beloved of an honest man who  would die to keep you true, and will die if you play him false!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She sighed. Softness  took the place of scorn; she involuntarily held out her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was amazed; she had  never done so much before. I seized that hand, I pressed it wildly, hungrily,  and with lingering fondness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Do you not know that  you are everything to me?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;That to win you I am ready to do  everything, barter anything, suffer anything but shame! You are my fate, Marah;  will you not let me be yours?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was silent; she had  drawn her hand from mine and had locked it in its fellow, and now stood with  them hanging down before her, fixed as a statue, in a reverie I could neither  fathom nor break.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are beautiful,&rsquo; I  went on, &lsquo;too beautiful for me; but I love you. You are proud, also, and would  grace the noblest palaces of the old world; but they are far away, and my home  is near and eager to welcome you. You are dainty and have never taught your  hands to toil, or your feet to walk our common earth; but there are affections  that sweeten labor, and under my roof you will be so honored, so aided and so  beloved, that you will soon learn there are pleasures of the fireside that can  compensate for its cares, and triumphs of the affections that are beyond the  dignities of outside life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her lip curled and her  hands parted. She lifted one rosy palm and looked at it, then she glanced at  me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I shall never work,&rsquo;  she said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My heart contracted,  but I could not give her up. Madness as it was to put faith and life in the  grasp of such a woman, I was too little of a man or too much of a one to turn  my back upon a hope which, even in its realization, could bring me nothing but  pain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You shall not work,&rsquo; I  declared. And I meant it. If I died she should not handle anything harsher than  rose leaves in her new home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You want me?&rsquo; She  breathed it. I stood in a gasp of hope and fear.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;More than I want  heaven! Or, rather, you are my heaven.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We will be married  before Honora,&rsquo; she murmured. And gliding from my side before I had recovered  from the shock of a promise so unexpected, a bliss so unforeseen and immediate,  she vanished from my sight, and nothing but the perfume which lingered behind  her remained to tell me that it was not all a dream, and I the most  presumptuous being alive.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And so the hour that  opened in disaster ended in joy; and from the heart of what I deemed an  irredeemable disaster rose a hope that for several days put wings to my feet.  Then something began to tarnish my delight, an impalpable dread seized me, and  though I worked with love and fury upon my house, which I had begun adorning  for my bride, I began to question if she had played the coquette in smiling  upon Edwin Urquhart, and whether in the mockery of the laugh with which she had  dismissed my accusations there had not been some regret for a love she dared  not entertain, but yet suffered to lose. The memory of the glow in her eyes, as  she turned away from him at my step, returned with growing power, and I decided  that if this were coquetry, it were sweeter than love, and longed to ask her to  play the coquette with me. But she never did, and though she did not smile upon  him again in my presence, I felt that her beauty was more bewildering, her  voice more enchanting, when he was in the room with us than when chance or my  purpose found us alone. To settle my doubts, I left watching her and began to  watch him, and when I found that he betrayed nothing, I turned my attention  from them both and bestowed it upon Miss Dudleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    Marah</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Great heaven! why had I  not noticed Miss Dudleigh before! In her changed face, and in the wasting of  her delicate form, I saw that my fears were not all vain, inasmuch as they were  shared by her; and shocked at evidences so much beyond my expectations, I knew  not whether to shed the bitter tears which rose to my eyes in pity for her or  in rage for myself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were sitting all  together, and I had a full opportunity to observe the mournful smile that now  and then crossed her lips as Marah uttered some brighter sally than common or  broke&mdash;as she often did&mdash;into song that rippled for a minute through the heavy  air and then ceased as suddenly as it had begun. She looked much oftener at  Marah than at Urquhart, and seemed to be asking in what lay the charm that  subdued everybody, even herself. And when she seemed to receive no answer to  her secret questioning, her eyes fell and a sigh stirred her lips, which, if  unheard by the preoccupied man at her side, rang on in my ears long after I had  bidden farewell to her and the siren whose smiles, intentionally or  unintentionally, seemed destined to bring shipwreck into three lives.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was not the last  time I heard that sigh. As the weeks progressed it fluttered oftener and  oftener from between those pale lips, and at last the change in Miss Dudleigh  became so marked that people stopped in the midst of their talk about the stamp  act to remark upon Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s growing weakness, and venture assertions  that she would never live to be a bride. And yet the preparations for her  bridal and for mine went on, and the day set apart for the latter drew  bewilderingly near.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Marah saw my perplexity  and her cousin&rsquo;s grief, but did nothing to dispel the one or assuage the other.  She seemed to be too busy. She was embroidering a famous stomacher for herself,  and while a sprig of it remained unworked she had neither eyes nor attention  for anything else, even for the bleeding hearts around her. She would smile&mdash;O  yes, smile upon me, smile upon Honora, and not smile upon him; but she would  not meet her cousin&rsquo;s true eyes, nor would she grant me one minute apart from  the rest in which I could utter my fears or demand the breaking of that spell  whose effects were so visible, even if its workings were secret and  imperceptible. But at last the stomacher was finished, and as it dropped from  her hands I threw myself at her feet, and from this position, looking into her  eyes, I whispered:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;This is the last thing  that shall ever flaunt itself between us. You are to be mine now, and in token  of your truth come with me into the conservatory, for I have words to utter that  will not be put off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are cruel,&rsquo; she  murmured, &lsquo;you are tyrannical. This is a time of revolt; shall I revolt, too?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maddened, for her eyes  were not looking at me, but at him, I leaped to my feet, and, regardless of  everything but my determination to end this uncertainty then and there, I  lifted her and carried her out of the room into another, where I could have her  alone, and without the humiliating sense of his presence.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page119.jpg" width="800" height="489"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My bold act seemed to  frighten her, for she stood very still where I had placed her, only trembling  slightly when I looked at her and cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Did you ask that  question of me? Am I to understand you want to break your fetters?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She plucked a rose from  her breast and crumpled it to atoms between her hands.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;O why are they not  golden ones!&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;I am miserable because we must be poor;  because&mdash;because I want to ride in a carriage, because I want to wear jewels and  own a dozen servants, and trample on the pride of women plainer than myself. I  hate your humble home, I hate your stiff Dutch kitchen, I hate your sordid ways  and the decent respectability that is all you can offer me. Were you beautiful  as Adonis, it would make no difference. I was born to drink wine and not water,  and I shall never forgive you for forcing me to take your crystal goblet in my  hands, while, if I had waited&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She stopped, panting. I  let my whole pent-up jealousy out in a word.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Edwin Urquhart has not  even a crystal goblet to offer you. He is poorer than I am, and will remain so  till he has actually married Miss Dudleigh.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it!&rsquo; she  flashed out. &lsquo;If it had been otherwise do you think&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She had the grace or  the wisdom to falter. I regret it now. I regret that she did not go on and  reveal her whole soul to me in one fell burst of feeling. As it was, I trembled  with jealousy and passion, but I did not cast her from me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Then you acknowledge&mdash;&rsquo;  I cried.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But she would  acknowledge nothing. &lsquo;I love no one,&rsquo; she asserted, &lsquo;no one. I want what I  want, but none of you can give it to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then blame me as you  will, I took a great resolve. I determined to give her what she craved;  convinced of her sordid nature, convinced of her heartlessness and the folly of  ever thinking she could even understand, much less reciprocate my passion, I  was so much under her sway at that moment that I would have flung at her feet  kingdoms had I possessed them. Flushing, I seized her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You do not know what a  man in love can do,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Trust me; give me yourself as you have promised,  and sooner or later I will give you what you have asked. I am not a weak man or  an incompetent one. Politics opens a vast field to an ambitious nature, and if  war breaks out, as we all expect it will, you will see me rise to the front, if  I have you for my wife and inspiration.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The scorn in her eyes  did not abate. &lsquo;O you men!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;You think you give us everything with a  promise. A war! What is the history of wars? Demolished homes, broken fortunes,  rack, ruin and desolation. Is there gold, or honor, or ease in these? A war! It  will not be a war. It will be a struggle in which men will fight barefoot and  on empty stomachs for the privilege of calling themselves free. I have no  sympathy with such a war. It robs us of comfort in the present and brings  nothing worth waiting for in the future. Were I to have my will, I would take  the arm of the first officer returning to England and remain there. I hate this  country, so new, so crude, so democratic! I should like to live where I could  ride over the necks of common people.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A tory and an  aristocrat! Another gulf between us. I looked at her in horror, but, alas! the  horror was strangely mixed with admiration. She was such a burning embodiment  of pride. Her peculiar beauty&mdash;the source of which I have never to this day been  able to fathom&mdash;lent itself so readily to the expression of fury and disdain,  that, recoil as I would from her principles, I could not shut my eyes to the  fascination of her glance or the torturing charm that hid in the corners of her  pouting lips. She was a queen. Oh, yes, but the queen of some strange realm in  a distant oriental land, where right and wrong were only words, and the sole  end of beauty was delight, without reference to God or one&rsquo;s fellows. I saw it  all, I felt it all, yet I lingered. She was to be my wife in three days, and  the intoxication of this prospect was in my blood and brain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You will do so and so,&rsquo;  were her next words. &lsquo;You will give me what I ask when you have won it. But I  cannot wait for the winning; I want it now. Do you know what I would do to get  the wealth I was born to? I would risk life! I would walk on burning  plowshares! I would&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She stopped, and I saw  the lines come out in her forehead. She was thinking&mdash;thinking deeply. I felt  the shadow of a great horror creeping over me. I caught her impetuously in my  arms. I kissed her passionately to drive away the demons. I begged and implored  her to forget her evil thoughts, and be the woman I could love and cherish; and  finally I moved her. She shook herself free, but she also shook the shadow from  her brow. She even found a smile to bestow upon me; and was it a tear? Could it  have been a tear I saw for a moment glisten in her eye as she turned half  petulantly, half imperiously away? I have never known, but the very suspicion  filled my heart to overflowing, and the great sobs rose in my breast; and&mdash;fool  that I was&mdash;I was about to beg her pardon, when she gave me one other look, and  I merely faltered out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Where will you find  another love like mine, Marah? If you got your gold, you would soon miss  something which only comes with love. You would be unhappy, and curse the day  you left my arms. I am your master, Marah; why not make me a happy one?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I expect,&rsquo; she  murmured, &lsquo;to marry you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And then?&rsquo; I could not  help it; the words sprang to my lips involuntarily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her eyes opened wide;  she literally flashed them upon me. I felt their lightnings play all about my  doubtful nature, and scorch it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I will be your wife,&rsquo;  she uttered gravely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I fell at her feet. I  kissed the hem of her robe. In that moment I adored her. &lsquo;O best and fairest!&rsquo;  I cried, &lsquo;I will make you happy. I will fill your hopes to the full. You shall  ride in a carriage, and your will shall be a law to those who smile in scorn  upon you now, and you will be&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Mistress Felt, of most  honorable degree,&rsquo; she finished, with the half laughing disdain she could never  keep long out of her words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And thus I became again  her slave, and lived in that sweet, if servile, condition till the hour of our  nuptials came, and I went to conduct her to the church where, in sight of half  the town, she was to be made my wife. Shall I ever forget that morning? It was  a December day, but the heavens were blue and the earth white, and not a cloud  bespoke a rising storm. As for me, I walked on air, all the more that I knew  Urquhart was out of town and would not be present at the wedding. He had gone  away on some behest of Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s immediately after the last interview I  have mentioned, and would not come back, or so I had been told, till after Miss  Leighton had been Mistress Felt for a week. So there was nothing to mar my day  or make my entrance into Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s house anything but one of promise. I  saw Miss Dudleigh first. She was standing in the vast colonial hall when I  entered, and in her gala robes, and with the sunshine on her head, she looked  almost happy. Yet she was greatly changed from her old self, and I felt much  like pouring out my soul to her and bidding her to break a tie that would never  bring her peace, or even honor. But I feared to shatter my own hopes. Selfish  being that I was, I dreaded to have her made free, lest&mdash; What? My thoughts did  not interpret my fears, for at that moment a sunbeam struck down the stairs and  through my heart, and, looking up, I saw Marah descending, and thought and  reason flew to greet her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She had been robed by  her cousin&rsquo;s bounteous hand, and her dress of stiff yellow brocade burned in  the morning light with almost as much brilliance as the sunshine itself. Folded  across her bust was the wonderful stomacher, under whose making I had suffered  so many emotions that each sprig of work upon it seemed to have its own tale of  misery for my eyes, and fixed against this and her white throat were those  masses of flowers without which her beauty never seemed quite complete. In her  hair, which was piled high above her forehead, flashed a huge golden comb, and  upon her arm gleamed two bracelets, whose exquisite workmanship was well known  to me, for they had been an heirloom in my family for years. She was fair as a  dream, proud as a queen, cold as a statue, but she was mine! Was not the  minister waiting for us at the church? and were not the horses that were to  take us there even now champing their bits before the door?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She rode with me. Four  white horses had been attached to Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s coach, and behind these we  passed in state out through the noble park that separated this lordly house  from the rest, into the closely packed streets, where hundreds waited to catch  a glimpse of the most beautiful woman in Albany, going to be made a bride.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Dudleigh rode  behind us in another coach, and the murmur which greeted our appearance did not  die out till after she had passed, for they knew she would soon be riding the  same road with even greater state, if not with so much beauty; and the people  of Albany loved Honora Dudleigh, for she was ever a beneficent spirit to them,  and more than ever, since a shadow had fallen upon her happiness, and she had  come to know what misery was.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And thus we passed on,  Marah with a glowing flush of triumph burning on her cheek and I in one of  those moods of happiness whose rapture was so unalloyed that I scarcely heard  the half-laughing comments of those who saw with wonder how plain was the man  who had succeeded in carrying off this well-known beauty. And the greater part  of the way was traversed, and the bells of the old North Church became audible,  and in a moment more we should have seen the belfry of the church itself rising  before us, when, suddenly, the woman that I loved, the woman whose nuptials the  minister was waiting to celebrate, gave a great start, and, turning quickly  toward me, cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Turn the horses&rsquo;  heads! I do not go to the church with you to-day. Not if you kill me, Mark  Felt!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have heard of stray  bullets coming singing from some unknown quarter and striking a person seated  at a feast. Such a bullet struck me then. I looked at her in horror.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    At The Foot Of The Stairs</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You think I am  playing with you,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;I am not. I have sickened of these nuptials  and am going back. If you want to, you may kill me where I sit. You carry a  dagger, I know; one more red blossom will not show on my breast. Give it to me  if you will, but turn the horses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She meant it, however  much my lost heart might cry out for its happiness and honor. Leaning forward,  I told the pompous driver that Miss Leighton had been taken very ill, and bade  him drive back; and then with the calmness born of utter despair and loss, I  said to her:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;In pity for my pride  drop your head upon my shoulder. I have said you were sick, and sick you must  be. It is the least you can do for me now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She obeyed me. That  head on which in fancy I had set the crowns of empires, for whose every hair my  heart had given a throb, sank coldly down till it rested upon the heart she had  broken; and while I steadied my nerves to meet the changed faces of the crowd,  the carriage gave a sudden turn, and amid murmurings that fell almost unheeded  on my benumbed senses, we wheeled about and faced again the gates through which  we had so lately issued.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She is ill,&rsquo; I shouted  to Miss Dudleigh, as we passed her carriage. But she gave me no reply. She was  gazing over the heads of the crowd at some distant object that enthralled her  every look and sense; and moved by her expression as I thought never to be  moved by anything again, I followed her glance, and there, on the outskirts of  the crowd, crouching amid branches that yet refused to hide him, I saw Edwin  Urquhart; and the miserable truth smote home to my heart that it was he who had  stopped my marriage&mdash;he, whom I had thought far distant, but who had now come to  hinder, by some secret gesture or glance, my bride on her path to the altar.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A dagger was hidden in  my breast, and I still wonder that I did not leap from the carriage, burst  through the crowd, and slay him where he crouched in cowardly ambush. But I let  the moment go by, perhaps because I dreaded to bring the shadow of another woe  into Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s white face, and almost immediately the throng had surged  in thickly between us, and Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s carriage had turned after ours, and  there was nothing further to do but to ride back, with the false face pressed  in seeming insensibility to my breast, and that false heart beating out its  cold throbs of triumph upon mine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I bore it, glancing  down but once upon her. Had the ride before me been one of miles I should have  gone on in the same mechanical way, for my very being was petrified. Rage,  fear, sorrow and despair, all seemed like dreams to me. I wondered that I had  ever felt anything, and stared on and on at the blue sky before me, conscious  of but one haunting thought that repeated itself again and again in my  brain&mdash;that her power lay not in her eyes, as I had always been assured, but in  those strange curves about her mouth. For her eyes were closed now, and yet I  was coldly conscious of the fact that she had never looked more beautiful or  more fitted to move a man, if a man had any heart left to be moved.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The stopping of the  carriage before the great door of Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s house roused me to the  necessity for action.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I must carry you in,&rsquo;  I whispered. &lsquo;I beg your pardon for it, but it is necessary to the farce.&rsquo; And  following up my words by action, I lifted her from the seat, cold and  unresponsive as a stone, and carried her into the house and set her down before  the astonished eyes of such servants as had remained to guard the house in our  absence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Miss Leighton has not  been married,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;She was taken ill on the way to church, and I have  brought her back. She needs no attendance.&rsquo; And I waved them all back, for  their startled, gaping countenances infuriated me, and threatened to shatter  the dreadful calmness which was my only strength.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As they disappeared,  murmuring and peering, Miss Dudleigh entered. I gave her one glance and dropped  my eyes. She and I could not bear each other&rsquo;s looks yet. Meantime Marah stood  erect in the center of the hall, her face pale, her lips set, her eyes fixed  upon vacancy. Not a word passed our three mouths. At last a petulant murmur  broke the dreadful silence, and Marah, tossing her head in disdain, turned away  before our eyes and began to mount the stairs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I felt my blood, which  for many minutes had seemed at a standstill, pour with a rush through vein and  artery, and darting to her side, I caught her by the hand and held her to her  place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You shall not go up,&rsquo;  I cried, &lsquo;till you and I have understood each other. You have refused to marry  me to-day. Was it some caprice that moved you, or&mdash;&rsquo; I paused and looked behind  me; Miss Dudleigh had shrunk from sight into one of the rooms&mdash;&rsquo;or because you  saw Edwin Urquhart in the crowd and followed his commanding gesture?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The hand which I held  grew cold as ice. She drew it away and looked at me haughtily, but I saw that I  had frightened her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Edwin Urquhart is  nothing to me,&rsquo; came in low but emphatic tones from her lips. &lsquo;I did not want  to marry any one, and I said so. It would be better if more brides hesitated on  the threshold of matrimony instead of crossing it to their ruin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I could have killed  her, but I subdued myself. I knew that I had lost her; that in another moment  she would be gone, never to enter my presence again as my promised wife; but I  uttered no word, honored her with no glance; merely made her a low bow and  stepped back, as I thought, master of myself again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But in that final  instant one last arrow entered my breast, and darting back to her side, I  whispered, in what must have been a terrible voice:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Go, falsest of the  false! I have done with you! But if you have lied to me&mdash;if you think to trip up  Edwin Urquhart in his duty, and break Honora Dudleigh&rsquo;s noble heart, and shame  my honor&mdash;I will kill you as I would a snake in the grass! You shall never  approach the altar with another as nearly as you have this day with me!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And with the last  mockery of a look, in which every detail of her beauty flashed with almost an  unbearable insistence upon my eyes, I turned my back upon her and strode toward  the outer door.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    Honora</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I did not pass it.  A sound struck my ear. It was that of a smothered sob, and it came from the  room where I had first seen Miss Dudleigh. Instantly a vision of that sweet  form bowed in misery struck upon my still palpitating heart; and moved at a  grief I knew to be well nigh as bitter as my own, I stopped before the  half-closed door, and gently pushed it open.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Dudleigh at once  advanced to meet me. Tears were on her cheeks, but she walked very firmly, and  took my hand with an inquiry in her soft eyes that almost drove me distracted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; I  cried to myself. &lsquo;Tell this woman to beware, or leave her to fight her battles  alone?&rsquo; No answer came from my inmost soul. I was appalled by her weakness and  my own selfishness, and bowed my head and said nothing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;A strange ending to  the hopes of this day,&rsquo; were the words that thereupon fell from her lips. &lsquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;Marah  ill, or did one of her strange moods overtake her?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I do not understand  Miss Leighton,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;The time I have spent in the study of her character  has been wasted. I shall never undertake to open the book again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she faltered,  and an absolute terror grew in her eyes, &lsquo;you are going to leave her. She is  going to be free, and&mdash;&rsquo; The white cheeks grew scarlet. She evidently feared  that she had shown me her heart.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Affected, but  irresolute still, I took her hand and carried it to my lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Let me thank you,&rsquo;  said I, &lsquo;for glimpses into a nature so noble and womanly that I am saved in  this hour from cursing all womankind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, how she sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are good,&rsquo; she  murmured. &lsquo;You have deserved a better fate. But it is the lot of goodness and  truth ever to meet with misappreciation and disdain. Here, here, only,&rsquo; and she  struck her breast with her clenched right hand, &lsquo;lie the rewards for honesty, long-suffering,  and tenderness. In the world without there is nothing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tears, which I could  not restrain, welled up to my eyes. I could never have wept for my own  suffering, but for hers it seemed both natural and real. Ah, why had she thrown  the treasures of her heart away upon a fool? Why had she given the trust of her  heart to a villain? I opened my lips to speak; she saw his name faltering on my  tongue, and stopped me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she breathed. &lsquo;I  know what you would say and I cannot bear it. I was motherless, fatherless,  almost friendless, and I relied upon the wisdom of an aunt, whose judgment was,  perhaps, not all that it should have been. But it is too late now for regrets.  I have launched my boat, and it must sail on; only&mdash;you are an honest man and will  respect my confidence&mdash;was it Mr. Urquhart I saw on the outskirts of the crowd  to-day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I bowed. I knew she had  not asked because she had any doubts as to the fact of his being there, but  because she wanted to see if I had recognized him and owed any of my misery to  that fact.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It was he,&rsquo; said I,  and said no more.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The mask fell from her  countenance. She clasped her hands together till they showed white as marble.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh! we are four  miserable ones!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;He&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was my turn to stop  her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I would rather you did  not say it,&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;I can bear much, but not to hear another person  utter words that will force me to think of the dagger I carry always in my  breast. Besides, we may be mistaken.&rsquo; I did not believe it, but I forced myself  to say it. &lsquo;She declares he is nothing to her, and if that is so, you might  wish to have kept silent.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She says! Ah! can you  believe her? do you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I must&mdash;or go mad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Then I will believe  her, too. I am so slightly tied to this world that has deceived me, that I will  trust on a little while longer, even if my trust lands me in my grave. I had  rather die than discover deceit where I had looked for honesty and gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was a coward,  perhaps, but I did not try to dissuade her. Though she was fatherless and motherless,  and loverless and friendless, I let her grasp at this wisp of hope and cling to  it, though I knew it would never hold, and that her only chance for happiness  was passing from her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;If he were not poor,&rsquo;  she now breathed rather than whispered, &lsquo;I would find it easier to rend myself  free. But he has nothing but what lies in my future, and if I should make a  mistake and do injustice to a man that is merely suffering under a temporary  intoxication, I should rob him of his only hope, without adding one chance to  my own.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I bowed, and made a  movement toward the door. I could not stand much more of this strain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are going?&rsquo; she  cried. &lsquo;Well, I cannot keep you. But that dagger! You will promise me to throw  it away? You do not need it in defense, and you do not want to kill me before  my time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no; I did not want  to kill her. Grief was doing that fast enough; so I thought at that time.  Shuddering, but resolute, I drew the tiny steel from my breast and laid it in  her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is all I can give you  to show you my appreciation of your goodness.&rsquo; And not trusting myself to  linger longer lest I should take it again from her hand, I went out and walked  hastily from the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you asked me what  road I took, or through what streets I passed, or whose eye I encountered in my  next hour&rsquo;s walking through the town, I could not tell you. If jeers followed  me, I heard them not; if I was the recipient of sympathizing looks and  wondering conjectures, they were all lost upon eyes that were blind and ears  that were deaf. I did not even feel; and did not realize till night that I had  been wandering for hours without my cloak, which I had left in the carriage and  forgotten to take again when I went out. The first knowledge I had of my  surroundings was when I found an obstruction in my path, and looking up, saw  myself in front of my own door, and not two feet from me, Edwin Urquhart.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Edwin Urquhart</b></h2>
  <p align="left">IN that moment Mark Felt  paused and cast a glance toward the Hudson far below us. Then he resumed his  narrative.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I drew back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and  clenched my hands to keep myself from strangling Urquhart. Then I broke into  hurried pants, that subsided gradually into words of perplexity and amazement  as I met his eye, and realized that it contained nothing but a rude sort of  sympathy and good fellowship.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;How? Why? What do you  mean by coming back?&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;You said you would be gone a week. You swore&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A gay laugh interrupted  me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And must a man keep  every oath he makes, especially when it separates him from a charming  betrothed, and a friend who swore that he would make this day his wedding one?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Urquhart!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Felt!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Are you a monster or  are you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;A self-possessed man  who is going to take in charge a crazy one. Come into the house, Mark, a dozen  eyes can see us here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He took me in charge;  he piloted me into my own dwelling&mdash;he whose whole body I had always esteemed  weaker than my little finger; my enemy too, or so I considered him; the cause  of half my grief, of all my shame, the beginning and end of my hatreds.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When we were closeted,  as we soon were in the room I had expended so much upon to make worthy of my  bride, he came and stood before me and uttered these unexpected words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Felt, I like you. You  are the only friend I have, and I am indebted to you. Now, what have you  against me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was astonished. His  whole look and bearing were so different from what I had expected, so different  from anything I had ever seen in him before. I began to question my doubts, and  dropped my eyes as he pursued:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You have been  disappointed in your marriage, I hear; but that need not make you as downcast  as this. A woman as capricious as Miss Leighton might easily imagine she was  too ill to go through the ceremony to-day. But she must have repented of her  folly by this time, and in a week will reward you as your patience deserves.  But what have I got to do with it? For incredible as it appears, your every  look and tone assures me that you blame me for this mishap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he daring me? If  so, he should find me his equal. I raised my eyes and surveyed him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Shall I tell you why  this is so&mdash;why I associate Miss Leighton&rsquo;s caprice with your return, and regard  both with suspicion? Because I have seen you look on her with love; because I  have surprised the passion in your face and beheld her&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The tone was  indescribable. It was as if a hand had taken me by the throat and choked me. I  drew off and was silent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He seized the word at  once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You have seen nothing.  If you think you have, then have you deceived yourself. Marah Leighton has  beauty, but it is not a kind that moves me&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He paled. Was it horror  of the lie he was uttering? I have never known, never shall know.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;The woman I am going  to marry is Honora Dudleigh.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I gazed at him,  determined to find the truth if it were in him. He bore my look unflinchingly,  though his color did not return, and his hands trembled nervously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You love her?&rsquo; I  asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I love her,&rsquo; he  returned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And your wedding day&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Is set.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;May it have no  interruptions,&rsquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He laughed&mdash;an uneasy  laugh, I thought&mdash;but jealousy was not yet dead within me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And yours?&rsquo; he  inquired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I have had mine,&rsquo; I  returned. &lsquo;I shall never have another.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He shook his head and  looked at me inquisitively. I repeated my assertion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I shall never approach  the altar again with a woman. I am done with such things, and done with love.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He finished his laugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Wait till you see  Marah Leighton smile again,&rsquo; he cried; and with the first reappearance of his  old manner that I had seen in him since the beginning of this interview, he  caught up a wine glass off the table, and filling it with wine, exclaimed  jovially: &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to our future wives! May they be all that love paints them!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought his mirth  indecent, his manner out of keeping with the occasion, and the whole situation  atrocious. But I saw he was about to leave, and said nothing; but I did not  drink his toast. When he was gone, I broke his glass by flinging it at my own  reflection, in a glass I had bought to mirror her beauty; and before the day  was spent, I had destroyed every destructible article in the house whose value  or whose prettiness spoke of the attempt I had made to alter my home from a  bachelor&rsquo;s abode to the nest I had thought in keeping with the dove I had  failed to place there. As I did it I filled the house with mocking laughter;  that I should have thought that this or that would please her, who would have  found a palace open to criticism, and the splendors of a throne room scarce  grand enough for her taste! I was but suffering the stings of a lifetime  compressed into a day, and was miserable because I could see no prospect but  further addition to my suffering.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    Before The Wedding</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two weeks after this I  was sitting beside my solitary hearth, musing upon my misery and longing for  the blessed relief of sleep. There was no one with me in the house. I had  dismissed every servant; for I would have no spies about me, prying into my  misery; and though I could not keep the world of men and women from my doors, I  could at least refuse to admit them; and this I did&mdash;living the life of a  recluse almost as much as I do here, but with less ease, because the wind would  bring whispers, and the walls were not thick enough to shut out from my fancy  the curious glances I felt to be cast upon them by every passer-by that  wandered through the street.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On this night I had  been thinking of Miss Dudleigh, of whose visibly failing health various murmurs  had reached me, and I felt, notwithstanding my determination to hold myself  aloof from every one and everything that could in any way reopen my still  smarting wound, I could more easily find the sleep I longed for if some word  from the great house would relieve the suspense in which my ignorance kept me.  But I would not go there if I died of my anxiety, nor would I stoop to question  any of the market men or women, who were the only persons admitted now within  my doors.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The clock was striking,  and the strange sense of desolation which is inseparable from this sound to a  solitary man (you see I have no clock here) was stealing over me, when I heard  a tap on one of the windows overlooking my small garden, and a voice came  through the lattice, crying:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Massa&mdash;Massa Felt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I knew the voice at  once. It was that of one of Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s servants, an honest black, who had  always been devoted to me from the day he did me some trifling service with  Miss Leighton. Hearing it now, and after such thoughts, I was so moved by the  promise it gave of news from the one quarter I desired, that I stumbled as I  rose, and found difficulty in answering him. Nor did I recover my  self-possession for hours; for the story he had to tell&mdash;after numerous  apologies for his presumption in disturbing me&mdash;was so significant of coming  evil that my mind was thrown again into turmoil, and the passions which I had  tried to smother were roused again into action.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was simply this:  That one evening after Mr. Urquhart&rsquo;s departure, and the extinguishing of all  the lights in the house, he had occasion to cross the garden. That in doing  this he had heard voices, and, stepping cautiously forward, perceived, lying  upon the snow-covered ground, near a certain belt of evergreens, the shadows of  two persons, whose forms were hidden from his sight. Being both curious and  concerned, he halted before coming too close and, listening, heard Mr. Urquhart&rsquo;s  voice, and presently that of Miss Leighton, both speaking very earnestly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Will you undertake it?  Can you go through with it without shrinking?&rsquo; was what the former had said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I will undertake it,  and I can go through with it,&rsquo; was what the latter had replied.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Frightened at a  discovery which might mean nothing and which might mean misery to a mistress  the day of whose marriage was scarcely a month away, the negro held his breath,  determined to hear more. He was immediately rewarded by catching the words: &lsquo;You  are a brave girl and my queen!&rsquo; and then something like a prayer for a kiss, or  some such favor, as a seal to their compact. But to this she returned a  vigorous &lsquo;No,&rsquo; followed by the mysterious sentence: &lsquo;I shall give you nothing  till I am dead, and then I will give you everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;After which they made a  move as if to separate, which action so alarmed the now deeply disconcerted  negro that he drew back in haste, hiding behind some neighboring bushes till  they had passed him and disappeared, he out of the gate, and she through the  small side entrance into the house. This was the previous night, and for nearly  twenty-four hours the poor negro had tortured himself as to what he should do  with the information thus surreptitiously gained. He lacked the courage to tell  his mistress, and finally he had thought of me, who was her best friend, and  who must have known there was something amiss with Miss Leighton, or why had I  not married her when everything was ready and the minister waiting with his  book in his hand?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not answering this  insinuation, I put to him one or two of the many questions that were burning in  my brain. Had he told any of the other servants what he had seen? And did Miss  Dudleigh look as if she suspected there was anything wrong?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He answered that he had  not dared to speak a word of it even to his wife; and as for Miss Dudleigh, she  was ill so much of the time that it was hard to tell whether she had any other  cause for uneasiness or not. He only knew that she was greatly changed since  this miserable deceiver came into the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I believed him, and  amid all my struggle and wrath tried to fix my mind upon her alone. I succeeded  only partially, but enough to enable me to write this line, which I entreated  him to carry to her:</p>
  <p align="left">&lsquo;Honored  Miss Dudleigh&mdash;You will forgive me if I overstep the bounds of friendship  in yielding to the inner voice which compels me to say that if before or on  your marriage day you need advice or protection, you may command both from</p>
  <p align="left">Your respectful servant,</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
  &nbsp;&lsquo;Mark Felt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not expect a  reply to this note, and I did not receive any. I thought I went as far as my  position toward her allowed, but I have questioned it since&mdash;questioned if I  should not have told her what the negro had heard and seen, and let her own  judgment decide her fate. But I was not in my right mind in those days. I was  too much a part of all this misery to be a fair judge of my own duty; and then  the mysterious nature of Miss Leighton&rsquo;s remark, the incomprehensibility of the  words&mdash;&rsquo;I shall give you nothing till I am dead, and then I shall give you  everything&rsquo;&mdash;added such unreality to the scene, and awakened such curious  conjectures, that I did not know where any of us stood, or to what especial  misery the future pointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Till she was dead!&rsquo;  What could she, what did she mean? She would then give him everything! Ah!  ah!&mdash;when she was dead! Well, so be it. Meanwhile, there was no prospect of  death for any one, unless it was for Miss Dudleigh, whom rumor acknowledged to  be still fading, though everything was being done for her comfort, and  physician after physician employed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I saw C&aelig;sar once again  in these days. I met him in the street, seemingly greatly to his delight, for  he smiled till his teeth shone from ear to ear, and made haste to remark, in  quite a jovial voice:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I specs it&rsquo;s all  right, massa. Massa Urquhart never looks at Miss Leighton now, but always doin&rsquo;  his best for missus, making her smile quite happy when she isn&rsquo;t coughing that  dreadful cough. We will have a gay wedding yet. Yes; Miss Leighton seems to  spect that; for she all de time making pretty things and trying them on missus,  and laughing and cheering her up, just as if she didn&rsquo;t spect any one to die.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but this change of  manner frightened me. I grew feverishly anxious, and spent night and day in  asking myself unanswerable questions. Nor did these in any way abate when one  day I was startled by the tidings that all preparations for refitting the great  house had stopped; that the doctors had decided that Miss Dudleigh must remove  to a warmer climate, and that accordingly upon her marriage she and her husband  would set sail for the Bermudas, there to take up their abode till her health  was quite restored. I doubted my ears; I doubted the facts; I doubted Urquhart,  and I doubted one other most of all whose name I find it hard to mention even  to myself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet I should not have  doubted her; I should have remembered the flame that was always burning in the  depths of her eyes, and had confidence in that, if in nothing else. What if she  had always been cold to me; she was not cold to him, and I should have known  this and prepared myself. But I did not. I knew neither the extent of his  villainy nor that of her despair. Had I done so, I might not have been  crouching here a disappointed and hopeless man, while she&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I am running beyond  my tale. After the news I had just imparted, I heard nothing more till the very  week of the wedding. Then one of Miss Dudleigh&rsquo;s servants came to me with a  note, the result of which was, that I walked out in the afternoon, and that she  passed me in her carriage, and seeing me, stopped the horses and took me in,  and that we rode on a short distance together.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I wish to talk to you,&rsquo;  she said. &lsquo;I wish to proffer you a request; to beg of you a favor. I want you,&rsquo;  she stammered and her eyes filled with tears, &lsquo;to see me married.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I opened my eyes with a  quick denial, but I closed them again without speaking. After all, why not  please her? Could I suffer more at this wedding than in thinking over it in my  dungeon of a room at home? She would be there, of course, but I need not look  at her; and if he or she meditated any treachery, where ought I to be but in  the one place where my presence would be most useful? I decided to gratify Miss  Dudleigh, almost before the inquiry in her eyes had changed to a look of  suspense. &lsquo;Yes, I will come,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She drew a deep breath,  and smiled with tender sweetness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I thank you,&rsquo; she  rejoined. &lsquo;I thank you most deeply and most truly. I do not know why I desired  it so much. Possibly because I feel something like a sister to you, possibly  because I feel afraid&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She stopped, blushing. &lsquo;I  do not mean afraid. Why should I feel afraid? Edwin is very good to me; very  good. I did not know he could be so attentive.&rsquo; And she sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I felt that sigh go  through and through me. Looking at her I took a sudden resolution.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Honora,&rsquo; I said (I had  never called her by her first name before), &lsquo;do not give your happiness into  Edwin Urquhart&rsquo;s keeping. You have yet three days before you for  reconsideration. Break your bonds, and, unhampered by uncongenial ties, seek in  another climate for that peace of mind you will never enjoy here or elsewhere  as his wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She stared at me for a  moment with wide-open and appealing eyes; then she shook her head, and answered  quietly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;One broken-off wedding  in the family is enough. I cannot shock society with another. But, oh, Mark!  why did you not warn me at first? I think I would have listened; I think so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Forgive me,&rsquo; I  entreated. &lsquo;You know it would have been presumptuous in me at first; afterward  she stood in the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; she answered,  and turned away her head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I saw she did not wish  me to leave her yet; so I said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are going away;  you are going to leave Albany.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I must, or so Edwin  thinks. He says I will never recover in this climate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Do you wish to go?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Yes; I think I do. I  can never be happy here, and perhaps when we are far away, and have only each  other to think of, the love and confidence of which I have dreamed may come. At  all events, I comfort myself with that hope.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;But it is a long, long  sea voyage. Have you strength enough to carry you through?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;If I have not,&rsquo; she  intimated, with a mournful smile, &lsquo;he will be free, and I released without  scandal from a marriage that fills you with apprehension.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;would I  were your brother indeed! This should never go on.&rsquo; Then impelled by what I  thought to be my duty, I inquired: &lsquo;And your money, Honora?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She flushed, but answered  in the same spirit in which I had spoken.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;As little of it as may  be will remain with him. That much my old guardian insisted upon. Do not ask me  any more questions, Mark.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;None of a nature so  personal,&rsquo; I promised. &lsquo;But there is one thing&mdash;can you not guess what it  is?&mdash;which I ought to know. It is about Marah.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The words came with  effort, and hurt her as much as me. But she answered bravely:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She returns to  Schenectady the same day that we depart. I hoped she would not linger to the  wedding, but she seems to have a strange desire to face again the people who  have talked about her so freely these last few weeks. So what can I say to  dissuade her?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Let her stay,&rsquo; I  muttered; &lsquo;but let her beware how she behaves on that day, for there will be  two eyes watching her, prompt to see any treachery, and prompt, too, to avenge  it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You will have nothing  to avenge,&rsquo; murmured Honora; &lsquo;that is all in the past.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I prayed to Heaven she  might be right, and ere long bowed in adieu and left her. I saw neither herself  nor any one else again till I entered the Dudleigh mansion three days later to  witness her nuptials.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    A Cassandra At The Gate</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Dudleigh, moved,  perhaps, by the unpleasant eclat which had followed the broken-off marriage of her  cousin, chose to celebrate her own wedding in her own house, and with as little  ceremony as possible. Only her most intimate friends, therefore, were invited,  but these were numerous enough to fill the halls and most of the lower rooms.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When I entered there  was a sudden cessation of conversation; but this I had expected. If anything  could add to the interest of the occasion, certainly it was my presence; and,  feeling this, I made them all a profound obeisance, and, neither shirking their  glances nor inviting them, I took my place in the spot I had chosen for myself,  and waited, with a face as impassive as a mask, but with a heart burning with  fury and love, not for the coming of the bride, but of her who in this hour  ought to have been standing at my side as my wife.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I miscalculated if  I thought she would enter with them. Even her bold and arrogant spirit shrank  from a position so conspicuous, and it was not till they had presented  themselves and taken their places in front of the latticed window so associated  with my past, that I felt that peculiar sensation which always followed the  entrance of Marah into the same room with myself, and, yielding to the force  that constrained me, I searched the throng with eager looks, and there, where  the crowd was thickest, and the shadow deepest, I saw her. She was gazing  straight at me, and there was in her great eyes a look which I did not then  understand, and about which I have since tortured myself by asking again and  again if it were remorse, entreaty, farewell, or despair that spoke through it.  Sometimes I have thought it was fear. Sometimes&mdash; But why conjecture? It was an  unreadable expression to me then, and even in remembrance it is no clearer.  Whatever it betokened, my pride bent before it, and a flood of the old feeling  rushed over my heart, making me quite weak for a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I conquered myself,  as far as all betrayal of my feelings was concerned, and turning from the spot  that so enthralled me, I fixed my gaze upon the bride.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was looking  beautiful; more beautiful than any one had seen her look for weeks. A bright  color suffused her delicate cheeks, and in her eyes burned a strange  excitement, which did the work of happiness in lighting up her face. But it was  a transient glow which faded imperceptibly but surely, as the ceremony  proceeded, and passed completely away as the last inexorable words were uttered  which made her the wife of the false being at her side.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He, on the contrary,  was pale up to that same critical moment&mdash;very pale, when one remembers his  naturally florid complexion; but as her color went, his rose, and when the  minister withdrew, and friends began to crowd around them, he grew so jovial  and so noisy that more than one person glanced at him with suspicion, and cast  pitying looks at the now quiet and immobile young wife.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meantime I sought with  eager anxiety to catch one more glimpse of Marah. But she had shrunk from  sight, and was not to be found. And the gayety ran high and the wine was poured  freely, and the bridegroom drank with ever-increasing excitement, toasting his  bride, but never looking at her, though her eyes turned more than once upon him  with an appeal that affected painfully more than one person in the crowd. At  last she rose, and, at this signal, he put down his glass, and, with a low bow  to the company, prepared to follow her from the room. They passed close to the  place where I stood, and I caught one glance from his eyes. It was a laughing  one, but there was uneasiness in it. There might have been something more, but  I had not time to search for it, for at that moment I felt her dress brush  against my sleeve, and turned to give her the smile which I knew her friendly  heart demanded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You will wait till we  go?&rsquo; fell in a whisper from her lips; and I nodded with another smile, and they  went on and I stood where they had left me, in one of those moods which made  me, as far as all human intercourse is concerned, as much of an isolated being  as I am in these mountains. I did not wake again from this abstraction till  that same premonitory feeling, of which I have so often spoken, told me that  something in which I was deeply interested was about to happen. Looking up, I  found myself in the room alone. During the hour of my abstraction the guests  had gone out, and I had neither noticed their departure nor the gradual  cessation of the noise which at one time had filled my ears with hubbub. But  the bride had not gone. She was at that moment coming down the stairs, and it  was this fact which had pierced to my inner consciousness, and aroused once  more in me a vivid sense of my surroundings. He was with her, and behind them,  gliding like a wraith from landing to landing, came Marah, clad like the bride  in a traveling dress, but without the bonnet which betokened an instant  departure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not anticipating her  presence so near, I felt my courage fail, and pushing forward, joined the group  of servants at the door. They, seeing in this departure of their mistress a  possibly endless separation, were weeping and uttering exclamations that not  only showed their devotion, but their fears. Shocked lest these words should  reach her ears, I quieted them; and then seeing that the carriage which stood  outside had a stranger for a driver, and that there was no accompanying wagon  filled with their body servants and baggage, I asked the friendly C&aelig;sar, who  had pressed close to my side, if Mrs. Urquhart was not going to take a maid  with her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The negro at once  growled out an injured &lsquo;No!&rsquo; and when I expressed my astonishment, he explained  that &lsquo;There was no one here good enough to please Massa Urquhart. That he was  going to pick up with some one in New York. That, though missus was sick, he  would not even let her have her own gal go wid her as far as the city; said he  would do everything for her hisself&mdash;as if any man could do for missus like her  own Sally, who had been wid her ever since &lsquo;fore she was born!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And the baggage?&rsquo; I  asked, troubled more than I can say by what certainly augured anything but  favorably for her future.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, massa send dat  round to his house. He got books, an&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; things to add to it. Dere&rsquo;s  enough o&rsquo; dat; an&rsquo; den more went down de ribber on a sloop a week an&rsquo; more ago.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;So! so! And they are  going to ride?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Yes, sah. You see, dey  want to catch de ship w&rsquo;at set sail for Bermudas, an&rsquo; got to hurry; so massa  says.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By this time Urquhart  and his bride had reached the door. He was still gay and she was still quiet.  But in her eye glistened a tear, while in his there gleamed nothing softer than  that vague spark of triumph which one might expect to see in a man who had just  married the richest heiress in Albany.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Good-by! good-by!  good-by!&rsquo; came in soft tones from her lips; and she was just stepping over the  threshold, when there suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps an old crone,  so seamed and bowed with age, so weird and threatening of aspect, that we all  started back appalled, and were about to draw Mrs. Urquhart out of her path,  when the unknown creature raised her voice, and pointing with one skinny hand  straight into the bride&rsquo;s face, shrieked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Beware of oak walls!  Beware of oak walls! They are more dangerous to you than fire and water! Beware  of oak walls!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A shriek interrupted  her. It came, not from the bride, but from the interior of the well-nigh  forsaken hall behind us.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Instantly the old crone  drew herself up into an attitude more threatening and more terrible than  before.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page167.jpg" width="800" height="552"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And you,&rsquo; she cried,  pointing now beyond us toward a figure which I could feel shrinking in  inexplicable terror against the wall. &lsquo;And you cannot trust them either! There  is death within oak walls. Beware! beware!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A curse, a rush, and  Edwin Urquhart had flung himself at the old witch&rsquo;s throat. But he fell to the  pavement without touching her. With the utterance of her last word, she had  slipped from before our eyes and melted into the crowd which curiosity and  interest had drawn within the gates, to watch this young couple&rsquo;s departure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Who was that creature?  Let me have her! Give her up, I say!&rsquo; leaped from the infuriated bridegroom&rsquo;s  lips, as he rushed up and down before the crowd with threatening arms and  flashing eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But there was no  response from the surging throng; while from his frightened wife such an  appealing cry rung out that he returned from the vain pursuit, and regaining  his place at Honora&rsquo;s side, put her into the carriage. But as he did so he  could not refrain from casting a stealthy look behind him, which betrayed to  me, if to no one else, that his anger was more on account of the words uttered  to Marah than to the tender being clinging to his arm. And a jealous fury took  hold of me also, and I should not have been sorry if I had seen him fall then  and there, the victim of a thunderbolt more certain, if not more terrible, than  that which had just overwhelmed the two women nearest to our hearts.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Good-by! good-by!  good-by!&rsquo; came again from the bride&rsquo;s pale lips; and this time I felt that the  words were for me, and I waved my hand in response, but could not speak. And so  they rode away, followed by the lamentations of the servants, from whom the old  crone&rsquo;s ominous outburst had torn the last semblance of self-control.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Another carriage for  Miss Leighton!&rsquo; I now heard uttered somewhere like a command. And startled at  the pang it caused me, I darted back into the house, determined to have one  parting word with my lost love.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was not there, nor  could she be found by any searching.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    The Catastrophe</b></h2>
  <p align="left">I HAVE but little more  to tell,&rdquo; Mark Felt continued, &ldquo;but that little is everything to me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When we became  positively assured that Miss Leighton had disappeared from the house and would  not be on hand to take the stage to Schenectady, the excitement, which had been  increasing on all sides since the ceremony, culminated, and the whole town was set  agog to find her, if only to solve the mystery of a nature whose actions had  now become inexplicable.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was the first to  start the pursuit. Haunted by her last look, and thrilled to every extremity by  the terror of the shriek she had uttered, I did not wait for the alarm to  become public, but rushed immediately up stairs at the first intimation of her  disappearance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Though I had never  pierced those regions before, my good or evil fate took me at once to a room  which I saw at one glance to be hers. The boxes waiting to be carried down, the  tags and ends of ribbons that I recognized, the nameless something which speaks  of one particular personality and no other, all were there to assure me that I  stood in the chamber which for six months or more had palpitated with the  breath of the one being I loved.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But of that I dared not  think; it was no time for dreams; and only stopping to see that her bonnet had  been taken, but her gloves left, I hurried down again and out of the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An impulse which I  cannot understand took me to Edwin Urquhart&rsquo;s house, or, rather, to that  portion of a house which he had hired for his use since he had been looking  forward to his marriage with Miss Dudleigh. Why I should go there I cannot say,  unless jealousy whispered that only in this place could she hope for one final  word with him, as he and his bride stopped at the door for his portion of the  baggage. Be this as it may, I turned neither to right nor left till I came to  his house, and when I had reached it I found that, with all my haste, I was too  late, for not a soul was in its empty rooms, while far down the street which  leads to the bridge I saw a carriage disappearing, which, from the wagon  following it so closely, I knew to be the one containing Urquhart and his bride.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She has not been here,&rsquo;  thought I, &lsquo;or I should have met her, unless&mdash;&rsquo; and my eye stole with a certain  shrinking terror toward the river which skirted along the garden at the back&mdash;&rsquo;unless&rsquo;&mdash;  But even my thoughts stopped here. I would not, could not, think of what, if it  were true, would end all things for me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leaving this place, I  wandered aimlessly through the streets, studying each face that I met for  intimations which should guide me in my search. If not a madman, I was near  enough to one to make the memory of that hour hideous to me; and when at last,  worn out as much by my emotions as by the countless steps I had taken, I  returned to my house for a bite and sup, something in the sight of its  desolation overpowered me, and yielding to a despair which assured me that I  should never again see her in this world, I sank on the floor inert and  powerless, and continued thus till morning, without movement and almost without  consciousness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fatal repose! And yet I  do not know if I should call it so. It only robbed me of a few hours less of  conscious misery. For when I roused, when I became again myself, and looked  about my house, there on the floor, underneath a curtain window which had been  left unlatched, I saw a letter containing these words:</p>
  <p align="left">&lsquo;Honored  and Much Abused Friend:&mdash;When you read this, Marah will be no more. After  all that has passed&mdash;after our broken marriage and the departure of my  cousin&mdash;life has become insupportable; and, believing that you would rather know  me dead than miserable, I ventured to write you these words, and ask you to  forgive me, now that I am gone.</p>
  <p align="left">&lsquo;I loved him: let that  explain everything.</p>
  <p align="left">&lsquo;Despairingly yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&lsquo;Marah Leighton.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With shrieks I tore  from the house. Marah dying! Marah dead! I would see about that. Racing down to  the gate, I paused. Some one was leaning on it. It was C&aelig;sar, and at the first  glimpse I had of his face I knew I was too late&mdash;that all was over, and that the  whole town knew it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh, massa, I wanted to  go in, but I was frightened. I&rsquo;s been waiting here an hour, sah; when dey told  me dat dey had found her bonnet floating on de ribber, I know&rsquo;d how you&rsquo;d feel,  sah, and so I come here and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I found words to ask  him a question. &lsquo;When was this found, and where?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;This morning, sah, at  daybreak. It was caught by one of the strings to that old log, sah, that lies  out in the ribber back of&mdash;&rsquo; he hesitated&mdash;&rsquo;Massa Urquhart&rsquo;s house, sah.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I knew; and I had  glanced that way just as her bright head was perhaps sinking under the water. I  threw up my arms in anguish and stumbled back into the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Then every one knows&mdash;&rsquo;  I managed to say on the threshold.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Dat she cared for him?  Yes, sah; I fear so. How could dey help it, sah? Mor&rsquo;n one person saw her run  down de street and go into massa&rsquo;s old house just before de carriage stopped  thar, and as she didn&rsquo;t come out again, I &lsquo;specs it was from dat big log at the  foot of the garden she jumped into de ribber. All de folks pities you very  much, sah&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I choked him off with a  look.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Who has been sent  after Mr. and Mrs. Urquhart to inform them of what has happened?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;No one yet, sah. But  Massa Hatton&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Mr. Hatton is an old  man. We must have a young one for this business. Go saddle me the quickest  horse in your stables. I will ride after them, and overtake them, too, before  they can reach Poughkeepsie. He shall know&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A glance from the negro&rsquo;s  eye warned me to be careful. I smothered my impatience and let only my  earnestness appear.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Mrs. Urquhart ought to  know that her cousin is dead,&rsquo; I declared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Massa  Hatton,&rsquo; said the black.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But my caution was now  too much aroused for me to make Mr. Hatton the medium of my request&mdash;he was Mrs.  Urquhart&rsquo;s old guardian and future agent; and subduing the extreme fury of my  feelings, I obtained his permission to act as his messenger. Had he known of  the letter which had been thrown into my window, he might not have given his  consent so freely; but I had told no man of that, and he and others saw me ride  away without a seeming suspicion of the murderous thoughts that struggled with  my grief, and almost overwhelmed it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For to me her death&mdash;if  she were dead&mdash;was the result of a compact entered into with the despicable  Urquhart, who, if he could not have her for himself, was willing she should go  where no other man could have her. Though the idea seemed quixotic, though it  be an anomaly in human experience, for a woman thus to sacrifice herself, I  could not ascribe any other motive to her deed; for the memory of that  interview she had held with her cousin&rsquo;s future husband in the garden was still  fresh in my mind. Do you remember the words as told me by the negro who  overheard them? First, the question from his lips: &lsquo;Will you undertake it? Can  you go through with it without shrinking and without fear?&rsquo; And the reply from  hers: &lsquo;I will undertake it, and I can go through with it,&rsquo; followed by that  assurance which struck me as being so inexplicable at the time, and which, with  all the light that this late horrible event has thrown upon it, still preserves  its mystery for me. &lsquo;I shall give you nothing till I am dead, and then I will  give you everything.&rsquo; If the conclusions I drew seemed wild, were they not  warranted by these words? Did she not speak of death, and did he not encourage  her?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If she were not  dead&mdash;and sometimes this thought would cross my burning brain&mdash;then she was with  him, forced into the company of his unwilling wife in that last interview which  they must have held in his cottage. In either case he was a villain and a  coward, deserving of death; and death he should have, and from the hand of him  whom he had doubly outraged.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page179.jpg" width="800" height="551"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But as I rode out of  town and came in sight of the river, I found myself seized by terrifying  thoughts. Should I have to ride by the place where I could see them stooping  with boat hooks they had brought up from the river bottom? Could I endure to  face this picture, then to pass it, then to ride on, feeling it ever at my  back, blackening the morning, destroying the noontide, making more horrible the  night? Could I go from this place till I knew whether or not the sullen waters  would yield up their beautiful prey, and would my body proceed while my heart  was on this river bank, and my jealousy divided between the wretch who had  urged her on to death and these other men who might yet touch her unconscious  form and gaze upon her disfigured beauty? And the answer which welled up from  within me was, yes, I could go; I could pass that picture; I could feel it  glooming ever and ever upon me from behind my back, and never turn my  head;&mdash;such an impetus of hate was upon me, driving me forward after the wretch  fleeing in self-complacency and triumph into a future of wealth and social  consideration.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But when I had done all  this, when my too fleet horse had carried me beyond sight of the city, and  nature, with its irresistible beauty, had begun to influence my understanding,  other thoughts came trooping in upon me, and a vision of Honora Dudleigh&rsquo;s face  as she took the dagger from my hands and an implied promise from my lips, rose  before me till I could see nothing else. Honora, Honora, Honora who trusted me!  who had suffered everything but the sight of blood! who was a bride, and whom  it would be base ingratitude for me to plunge into the depths of dishonor and  despair! And the struggle was so fierce, and the torture of it so keen, that  ere long my brain succumbed to the strain, and from the height of anguished  feeling I sank into apathy, and from apathy into unconsciousness, till I no  longer knew where I was or possessed power to guide my horse. In this condition  I was found wandering in a field and thence carried to a farm house, where I  remained a prey to fever. When I returned to consciousness, three weeks had  elapsed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As soon as I could be  moved, I went back to Albany. I found the community there settled in the belief  that I had joined in death the woman I so much loved, and was shown a letter  which had been sent me, and which had been opened by the authorities after all  hope had been given up of my return. It was from Mrs. Urquhart, and related how  they had changed their plans upon reaching New York. Having found a ship on the  point of sailing for France, they had determined to go there instead of to the  Bermudas, and, consequently, requested me to inform Mr. Hatton of the fact, and  also assure him that he would hear from them personally as soon as a letter  could reach him from the other side. As she was in haste&mdash;in truth, was writing  this in the post office on the way to the ship&mdash;she would only add that her  health had been improved by her long journey down the river, and that when I  heard from her again, she was sure she would be able to write that all her  fondest hopes had been fully realized.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And so Marah was in the  river, and Urquhart on the seas. I had been robbed of everything, even  vengeance, and life had nothing for me, and I was determined to leave it, not  in the vulgar way of suicide, but by cloistering myself in the great forests.  As no one said me nay, I at once carried out this scheme; and to show you how  dead I had become to the world, I will tell you that as I turned the lock of my  door and took my first step forward on the road which led to this spot, a great  shout broke out in the market place:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;The farmers of  Lexington have fired upon the king&rsquo;s troops!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I did not even turn  my head!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    A Dream Ended</b></h2>
  <p align="left">There was silence in the  cave. Mark Felt&rsquo;s story was at an end.</p>
  <p align="left">For a moment I sat and  watched him; then, as I realized all that I must yet gather from his lips, I  broke the stillness by saying, in my lowest and most suggestive tone, these two  words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Marah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The name did not seem  unwelcome. Striking his breast, he cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She lies here! Though  she despised me, deceived me, broke my heart in life, and in death betrayed a  devotion for another that was at once my dishonor and the downfall of my every  hope, I have never been able to cast her out of my heart. I love her, and shall  ever love her, and so I am never lonely. For in my dreams I imagine that death  has changed her. That she can see now where truth and beauty lie; that she  would fain come back to them and me; and that she does, walking with softened  steps through the forest, beaming upon me in the moon rays and smiling upon me  in the sunshine till&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Great sobs broke from  the man&rsquo;s surcharged breast. He flung himself down on the floor of the cave and  hid his face in his hands. He had forgotten that I had come on an errand of  vengeance. He had forgotten the object of that vengeance; he had forgotten  everything but her.</p>
  <p align="left">I saw the mistake I had  made, and for the moment I quailed before the prospect of rectifying it. He had  shown me his heart. I had peered into its depths, and it seemed an impossible  thing to tear the last hope from his broken life; to show her in her true light  to his horrified eyes; to tell him she was not dead; that it was Honora  Urquhart who was dead; and that the woman he mourned and beheld in his visions  as a sanctified spirit was not only living upon the fruits of a crime, but  triumphing in them; that, in short, he had thrown away communion with men to  brood upon a demon.</p>
  <p align="left">My feelings were so  strong, my shrinking so manifest, that he noticed them at last. Rising up, he  surveyed me with a growing apprehension.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How you look at me!&rdquo; he  cried. &ldquo;It is not only pity for the past I see in your eyes, but fear for the  future. What is it? What can threaten me now of importance enough to call up  such an expression to your face? Since Marah is dead&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;First  let me ask if Marah is dead.&rdquo; His face, which was turned toward me, grew so  pale I felt my own heart contract.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If&mdash;Marah&mdash;is&mdash;dead!&rdquo; he  gasped, growing huskier with each intonation till the last word was almost  unintelligible.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I continued,  ignoring his glance and talking very rapidly; &ldquo;her body was never found. You  have no proof that she perished. The letter that she wrote you may have been a  blind. Such things have happened. Try and remember that such things have  happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He did not seem to hear  me. Turning away, he looked about him with wide-open and questioning eyes, like  a child lost in a wood.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot follow you,&rdquo;  he murmured. &ldquo;Marah living?&rdquo; His own words seemed to give him life. He turned  upon me again. &ldquo;Do you know that she is living?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is it this you have  come to tell me? If so, speak, speak! I can bear the news. I have not lost all  firmness. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He stopped and looked at  me piteously. I saw I must speak, and summoned up my courage.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Marah may not be  living,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but she did not perish in the river. It would have been  better for you, though, and infinitely better for her if she had. She only  lived to do evil, Mr. Felt. In bemoaning her you have wasted a noble manhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The cry came suddenly,  and rang through the cavern like a knell. I could not bear it, and hurried  forward my revelation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You tell me that you  received a letter from Mrs. Urquhart before she set sail for France. Was it the  only letter which she has ever sent you? Have you never heard from her since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; He looked at me  almost in anger. &ldquo;I did not want to. I bade the postmaster to destroy any  letters which came for me. I had cut myself loose from the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you that letter?  Did you keep it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; I gave it back to  the men who opened it. What was it to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mark Felt,&rdquo; I now  asked, &ldquo;did you know Honora Dudleigh&rsquo;s writing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. Why should  you question it? Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And was this letter in  her writing? written by her hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course&mdash;of course;  wasn&rsquo;t it signed with her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the handwriting?  Couldn&rsquo;t it have been an imitation? Wasn&rsquo;t it one? Was it not written by Marah,  and not Honora? She was a clever woman, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Written by Marah? By  Marah? Great heavens, did she go with them, then? Were my secret doubts right?  Is she lost to me in eternity as well as here? Is she living with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was living with  him, and there is good reason to believe she is doing so still. There is a Mr.  Urquhart in Paris, and a Mrs. Urquhart. As Marah is the woman he loved, she  must be this latter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Must be? I do not see  why you should say must be! Is Honora dead? Is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora is dead&mdash;has been  dead for sixteen years. The woman who sailed with Mr. Urquhart called herself  Honora, but she was not Honora. She who rightfully bore this name was dead and  hidden away. It is of crime that I am speaking. Edwin Urquhart is a murderer,  and his victim was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was not necessary to  say more. In the suddenly outstretched hand, with its open palm; in the white  face so drawn that his mother would not have known it; in the gradual sinking  and collapsing of the whole body, I saw that I had driven the truth home at  last, and that silence now was the only mercy left to show him.</p>
  <p align="left">I was silent, therefore,  and waited as we wait beside a death bed for the final sigh of a departing  spirit. But life, and not death, was in the soul of this man before me. Ere  long he faintly stirred, then a smothered moan left his lips, followed by one  word, and that word was the echo of my own:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The sound it made seemed  to awake whatever energy of horror lay dormant within him. Bestirring himself,  he lifted his head and repeated again that fearsome word:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then he leaped to his  feet, and his aspect grew terrible as he looked up and shouted, as it were,  into the heavens that same dread word:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Filled with horror, I  endeavored to take him by the arm, but he shook me off, and cried in a terrible  voice:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A fiend, a demon, a  creature of the darkest hell! I have worshiped her, pardoned her, dreamed of  her for fifteen years in solitudes dedicated to God! O Creator of all good!  What sacrilege I have committed! How shall I ever atone for a manhood wasted on  a dream, and for thoughts that must have made the angels of Heaven veil their  faces in wonder and pity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must have a story  to tell,&rdquo; he now said, turning toward me, with the first look of natural human  curiosity which I had seen in his face since I came.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have;  but it will not serve to lessen your horror; it will only add to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing can add to it,&rdquo;  was his low reply. &ldquo;And yet I thank you for the warning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Encouraged by his  manner, which had become strangely self-possessed, I immediately began, and  told him of the visit of this bridal party at your inn; then as I saw that he  had judged himself correctly, and that he was duly prepared for all I could  reveal, I added first your suspicions, and then a full account of our fatal  discovery in the secret chamber.</p>
  <p align="left">He bore it like a man  upon whom emotion has spent all its force; only, when I had finished, he gave  one groan, and then, as if he feared I would mistake the meaning of this  evidence of suffering, he made haste to exclaim:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor Honora! My heart  owes her one cry of pity, one tear of grief. I shall never weep for any one  else; though, if I could, it would be for myself and the wasted years with  which I have mocked God&rsquo;s providence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Relieved to find him in  this mood, I rose and shook his hand cordially.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will come back to  Albany with me?&rdquo; I entreated. &ldquo;We have need of you, and this spot will never be  a home to you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The echo was unexpected,  but welcome. I led the way out of the cave.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See! it is late,&rdquo; I  urged.</p>
  <p align="left">He shook his head and  cast one prolonged look around him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do I not leave  behind me here? Love, grief, dreams. And to what do I go forward? Can you tell  me? Has the future in it anything for a man like me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It has vengeance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He gave a short cry.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In which she is  involved. Talk to me not of that! And yet,&rdquo; he presently added, &ldquo;what it is my  duty to do, I shall do. It is all that is left to me now. But I will do nothing  for vengeance. That would be to make a slave of myself again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I had no answer for  this, and therefore gave none. Instead I shouted to my guide, and after  receiving from him such refreshments as my weary condition demanded, I gave  notice that I was ready to descend, and asked the recluse if he was ready to  accompany me.</p>
  <p align="left">He signified an instant  acquiescence, and before the sun had quite finished its course in the west we  found ourselves at the foot of the mountains. As civilization broke upon us Mr.  Felt drew himself up, and began to question me about the changes which the revolution  had made in our noble country.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p align="left">I will not weary you, my  dear Mrs. Truax, with the formalities which followed upon our return to Albany.  I will merely add that you may expect a duly authorized person to come to you  presently for such testimony in this matter as it may be in your power to give;  after which a suitable person will proceed to France with such papers as may  lead to the delivering up of these guilty persons to the United States  authorities; in which case justice must follow, and your inn will be avenged  for the most hideous crime which has ever been perpetrated within our borders.</p>

    Strange Guests</b></h2>
  <p align="left">September 29, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">Two excitements to-day.  First, the appearance at my doors of the person of whose coming I was advised  by Mr. Tamworth. He came in his own carriage, and is a meager, hatchet-faced  man, whose eye makes me restless, but has not succeeded in making me lose my  self-possession. He stayed three hours, all of which he made me spend with him  in the oak parlor, and when he had finished with me and got my signature to a  long and complicated affidavit, I felt that I would rather sell my house and  flee the place than go through such another experience. Happily it is likely to  be a long time before I shall be called upon to do so. A voyage to France and  back is no light matter; and what with complications and delays, a year or more  is likely to elapse before the subject need be opened again in my hearing. I  thank God for this. For not only shall I thus have the opportunity of regaining  my equanimity, which has been sorely shaken by these late events, but I shall  have the chance of adding a few more dollars to my store, against the time when  scandal will be busy with this spot, and public reprobation ruin its excellent  character and custom.</p>
  <p align="left">The oak parlor I have  shut and locked. It will not be soon entered again by me.</p>
  <p align="left">The other excitement to  which I referred was the coming of two new guests from New York, elegant  ladies, whose appearance and manners quite overpowered me in the few minutes of  conversation I held with them when they first entered my house.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p align="left">Good God! what is that?  I thought I felt something brush my sleeve. Yet there is no one near me, and  nothing astir in the room! And why should such a sudden vision of the old oak  parlor rise before my eyes? And why, if I must see it, should it be the room as  it looked to me on that night when the two Urquharts sat within it, and not the  room as I saw it to-day!</p>
  <p align="left">Positively I must throw  away the key of that room; its very presence in my desk makes me the victim of  visions.</p>
  <p align="left">October 5, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">Why is it that we  promise ourselves certain things, even swear that we will perform such and such  acts, and yet never keep our promises or hold to our oaths? Sixteen years ago I  expressed a determination to refit the oak parlor and make it look more  attractive to the eye; I never did it. A year since I declared in language as  strong as I knew how to employ, not that I would refit the oak parlor, but that  I would tear it from the house, even at the cost of demolishing the whole  structure.</p>
  <p align="left">And now, only a week  since, I promised myself, as my diary will testify, that I would throw away the  key of this place, if only to rid myself of unpleasant reminders. But the key  is still with me, and the room intact. I have neither the power nor the  inclination to touch it. The ghost of the woman who perished there restrains  me. Why? Because we are not done with that room. The end of its story is not  yet. This I feel; and I feel something further; I feel that it will be entered  soon, and that the person who is to enter it is already in my house.</p>
  <p align="left">I have spoken of two  ladies&mdash;God knows with but little realization of the fatal interest they would  soon possess for me. They came without servants some four days ago, and saying  they wished to remain for a short time in this beautiful spot, at once accepted  the cheerful south room which I reserve for such guests as these. As they are  very handsome and distinguished-looking, I felt highly gratified at their  patronage, and was settling down to a state of complacency over the prospects  of a profitable week, when something, I cannot tell what, roused in me a spirit  of suspicion, and I began to notice that the elder lady was of a very uneasy disposition,  exhibiting a proneness to wander about the house and glide through its  passages, especially those on the ground floor, which at first made me question  her sanity, and then led me to wonder if through some means unknown to me she  had not received a hint as to our secret chamber. I watch, but cannot yet make  out. Meanwhile a description of these women may not come amiss.</p>
  <p align="left">They are both beautiful,  the younger especially. When I first saw them seated in my humble parlor, I  thought them the wife and daughter of one of our great generals, they looked so  handsome and carried themselves so proudly. But I was presently undeceived, for  the name they gave was a foreign one, which my English tongue finds it very  hard even yet to pronounce. It is written Letellier, with a simple Madame  before it for the mother, and Mademoiselle for the daughter, but how to speak  it&mdash;well, that is a small matter. I do speak it and they never smile, though the  daughter&rsquo;s eye lights up at times with a spark of what I should call mirth, if  her lips were not so grave and her brow so troubled.</p>
  <p align="left">Yes; troubled is the  word, though she is so young. I find it difficult to regard her in any other  light than that of a child. Though she endeavors to appear indifferent and has  a way of carrying herself that is almost noble, there is certainly grief in her  eye and care on her brow. I see it when she is alone, or rather before she  becomes aware of another&rsquo;s presence; I see it when she is with her mother; but  when strangers come in or she assembles with the rest of the household in the  parlor or at the table, then it vanishes, and a sweet charm comes that reminds  me&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">But this is folly, sheer  folly. How could she look like Mrs. Urquhart? Imagination carries me too far.  Equal innocence and a like gentle temper have produced a like result in  sweetening the expression. That is all, and yet I remember the one woman when I  look at the other, and shudder; for the woman who calls this child daughter has  her eye on the oak parlor, and may meditate evil&mdash;must, if she knows its secret  and yet wishes to enter it. But my imagination is carrying me too far again.  This woman, whatever her faults, loves her daughter, and where love is there  cannot be danger. Yet I shudder.</p>
  <p align="left">Madame Letellier merits  the description of an abler pen than mine. I like her, and I hate her. I admire  her, and I fear her. I obey her, and yet hold myself in readiness for  rebellion, if only to prove to myself that I will be strong when the time  comes; that no influence, however exerted, or however hidden under winning  smiles or quietly controlling glances, shall have power to move me from what I  may consider my duty, or from the exercise of such vigilance as my secret fears  seem to demand. I hate her; let me remember that. And I distrust her. She is  here for evil, and her eye is on the oak parlor. Though it is locked and the  key hidden on my person, she will find means to possess herself of that key and  open that door. How? We will see. Meantime all this is not a description of  Madame Letellier.</p>
  <p align="left">She is finely formed;  she is graceful; she is youthful. She dresses with a taste that must always  make her conspicuous wherever she may be. You could not enter a room in which  she was without seeing her, for her glance has a strange power that  irresistibly draws your glance to it, though her eyes are lambent rather than  brilliant, and if large, rarely opened to their full extent. Her complexion is  dark; that is, in comparison with her daughter&rsquo;s, which is of a marble-like  purity. But it has strange flushes in it, and at times seems almost to sparkle.  Her hair is brown, and worn high, with a great comb in it, setting off the  contour of her face, which is almost perfect. But it is in the expression of  her mouth that her fascination lies. Without sweetness, except when it smiles  upon her daughter, without mirth, without any expression speaking of good-will  or tenderness, there is yet a turn to the lips that moves the gazer peculiarly,  making it dangerous to watch her long unless you are hardened by doubts, as I  am. Her hands are exquisite, and her form beauty itself.</p>
  <p align="left">The daughter is  statuesque; not in the sense of coldness or immobility, but in the regularity  of her features and the absence of any coloring in her cheeks. She is lovely,  and there breathes through every trait a gentle soul that robs my admiration of  all awe and makes my old and empty heart long to serve her. Her eyes are gray  and her hair a reddish brown, with kinks and curls in it like&mdash; But, pshaw!  there comes that dream again! Was Honora Urquhart&rsquo;s hair so very unique that a  head of wavy brown hair should bring her up so startlingly to my mind?</p>
  <p align="left">They are stopping here  on their way to Albany&mdash;so the elder lady says. They came from New York. So they  did, but if my intuitions are not greatly at fault, the place they started from  was France. The fact that the marks and labels have all been effaced from their  baggage is suspicious in itself. Can they be friends of the two miserable  wretches who dishonored my house with a ghastly crime? Is it from them that madame&rsquo;s  knowledge comes, if she has any knowledge? The thought awakens my profoundest  distrust. Would that Mr. Tamworth were within reach! I think I will write him.  But what could I write that would not look foolish on paper? I had better wait  a while till I see something or hear something more definite.</p>

    Mrs. Truax Talks</b></h2>
  <p align="left">October 7, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">THIS morning I was  exceedingly startled by one of my guests suddenly asking me before several of  the others, if my inn had a ghost.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A ghost!&rdquo; I cried, for  the moment quite aghast.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;it  has the look of a house which could boast of such a luxury. Don&rsquo;t you think so,  Mr. Westgate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This is a newcomer who  had just been introduced.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed the  latter, &ldquo;as I have seen only this room, and as this room is anything but  ghostlike at the present moment, I hardly consider myself competent to judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the exterior!  Surely you noticed the exterior. Such a rambling old structure; such a beetling  top to it, as if it had settled down here to brood over a mysterious past. I  never see it, especially at twilight, that I don&rsquo;t wonder what lies so heavily  upon its conscience. Is it a crime? There would be nothing strange about it if  it was. Such old houses rarely have a clean past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was nonchalantly said,  but it sank deep into my heart. Not that I felt that he had any motive in  saying it&mdash;I knew the young scapegrace too well&mdash;but that I was conscious from  his first word of two eyes burning on my face, which robbed me of all  self-possession, though I think I sat without movement, and only paled the  slightest in the world.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A house that dates back  to a time when the white men and the red fought every inch of the territory on  which it stands would be an anomaly if it did not have some drops of blood upon  it,&rdquo; I ventured to say, as soon as I could command my emotions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True,&rdquo; broke in a low,  slow voice&mdash;that of Madame Letellier. &ldquo;Do you know of any especial tragedy that  makes the house memorable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I turned and gave her a  look before replying. She was seated in the shadows of a remote corner, and had  so withdrawn herself behind her daughter that I could see nothing of her face.  But her hands were visible, and from the force with which she held them clasped  in her lap I perceived that the subject we were discussing possessed a greater  interest for her than for any one else in the room. &ldquo;She has heard something of  the tragedy connected with this house,&rdquo; was my inward comment, as I prepared to  answer her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; I began,  and paused. Something of the instinct of the cat with the mouse had entered  into me. I felt like playing with her suspense, cruel as it may seem.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, tell us!&rdquo; broke in  the daughter, a sudden flush of interest suffusing for a moment her white  cheek. &ldquo;That is, if it is not too horrible. I never like horrible stories; they  frighten me. And as for a ghost&mdash;if I thought you kept such a creature about  your house, I should leave it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have no ghosts,&rdquo; I  answered, with a gravity that struck even myself unpleasantly, it was in such  contrast to her mellow and playful tones. &ldquo;Ghosts are commonplace. We  countenance nothing commonplace here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; broke in a voice  from the crowd of young men. &ldquo;The house is above such follies. It must have  some wonderful secret, then. What is it, Mrs. Truax? Do you own a banshee? Have  you a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mamma, you hurt me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The cry was involuntary.  Madame had caught her daughter by the hand and was probably unaware what  passion she had put into her clasp. Mademoiselle Letellier blushed again at the  sound of her own voice, and prayed her mother&rsquo;s pardon with the most engaging  of smiles. As she did so, I caught a glimpse of that mother&rsquo;s face. It was  white as death. &ldquo;Decidedly, she knows more than she ought to,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;And  yet she wants to know more. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The Happy-Go-Lucky Inn,&rdquo;  I observed, as soon as the flutter caused by this incident had subsided, &ldquo;is no  more haunted by a banshee than by a ghost. But that is not saying it should not  be. It is old enough, it is respectable enough; it has traditions enough. I  could tell you tales of its owners, and incidents connected with the coming and  going of the innumerable guests who have frequented it both before and during  the revolution, that would keep you here till morning. But the one story I will  tell must suffice. We should lose our character of mystery if I told you all.  Besides, how could I tell all? Who could ever tell the complete story of such a  house as this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried  another young man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Years ago&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped  again, wickedly stopped. &ldquo;Madame, will you not come forward where it is  lighter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; Madame  Letellier responded.</p>
  <p align="left">She rose deliberately  and came forward, tall, mute and commanding. She sat down in the light; she  looked me in the face; she robbed me even of my doubts. I felt my heart turn over  in my breast and wondered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You do not proceed,&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said I; and  assuming a nonchalance I was far from feeling, I commenced again. I had played  with her fears. I would play with them further. I would see how much she could  bear. I resumed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Years ago, when I was  younger and had been mistress of this place but a short time, there entered  this place one evening, at nightfall, a young couple. Did you speak, madame?  Excuse me, it was your daughter, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in the  latter, coming forward and taking her stand by the mother, greatly to the  delight of the young gentlemen present, who asked for nothing better than an  opportunity to gaze upon her modest but exquisite face. &ldquo;Yes; it was I. I am  interested, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I began to hate my role,  but went on stolidly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They were a handsome  pair, and I felt an interest in them at once. But this interest immeasurably  heightened when the young man, almost before the door had closed upon them,  drew me apart and said: &lsquo;Madame, we are an unhappy couple. We have been married  just four hours.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here I paused for  breath, and to take a good look at madame.</p>
  <p align="left">She was fixed as a  stone, but her eyes were burning. Evidently she expected the relation of a  story which she knew. I would disappoint her. I would cause in her first a  shock of relief, and then I would reawaken her fears and probe her very soul.  Slowly, and as if it were a matter of course, I proceeded to say:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was a run-away  match, and as the young husband remarked, &lsquo;a great disappointment to my wife&rsquo;s  father, who is an English general and a great man. My wife loves me, and will  never allow herself to be torn from me; but she is not of age, and her father  is but a few minutes&rsquo; ride behind us. Will you let us come in? We dare not risk  the encounter on the road; he would shoot me down like a dog, and that would  kill my young wife. If we see him here, he may take pity on our love, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He needed to say no  more. My own compassion had been excited, as much by her countenance as by his  words, and I threw open the doors of this very room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Go in,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I  have a woman&rsquo;s heart, and cannot bear to see young people in distress. When the  general comes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We shall hear him,&rsquo;  cried the girl; &lsquo;he has half a dozen horsemen with him. We saw them when we  were on the brow of the hill.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Take comfort, then,&rsquo; I  cried, as I closed the door, and went to see after the solitary horse which had  brought them to this place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But before I could  provide the meal with which I meant to strengthen them for the scene that must  presently ensue, I heard the anticipated clattering of hoofs, and  simultaneously with it, the unclosing of this door and the cry of the young  wife to her husband:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I cannot bear it. At  his first words I should fall in a faint; and how could I resist him then? No;  let me fly; let me hide myself; and when he comes in, swear that you are here  alone; that you brought no bride; that she left you at the altar&mdash;anything to  baffle his rage and give us time.&rsquo; And the young thing sprang out before me,  and lifting her hands, prayed with great wide-open eyes that I would assist the  lie, and swear to her father, when he came in, that her husband had ridden up  alone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was not as old then  as I am now, I say, and I was very tender toward youthful lovers. Though I  thought the scheme a wild one and totally impracticable, she so governed me by  her looks and tones that I promised to do what she asked, saying, however, that  if she hid herself she must do it well, for if she were found my reputation for  reliability would be ruined. And standing there where you see that jog in the  wall, she promised, and giving just one look of love to her companion, who  stood white but firm on the threshold, she sped from our sight down the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A moment later the  general&rsquo;s foot was where hers had been, and the general&rsquo;s voice was filling the  house, asking for his daughter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She is not here,&rsquo; came  from the young man in firm and stern accents. &lsquo;You have been pleased to think  she was with me all these miles, but you will not find her. You can search if  you please. I have nothing to say against that. But it will be time wasted.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We will see about  that. The girl is here, is she not?&rsquo; the father asked, turning to me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was my firm  reply; &lsquo;she is not.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do not know how I  managed the lie, but I did. Something in the young man&rsquo;s aspect had nerved me.  I began to think she would not be found, though I could see no good reason for  this conclusion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Scatter!&rsquo; he now  shouted to his followers. &lsquo;Search the house well. Do not leave a nook or cranny  unpenetrated. I am not General B&mdash; for nothing.&rsquo; And turning to me, he added: &lsquo;You  have brought this on yourself by a lie. I saw my daughter in this fellow&rsquo;s arms  as they passed over the ridge of the hill. She is here, and in half an hour  will be in my hands.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the clock on the  staircase struck not only the half hour, but the hour, and yet, though every  room and corridor, the cellar and the garret, were searched, no token was found  of the young wife&rsquo;s presence. Meanwhile the husband stood like a statue on the  threshold, waiting with what seemed to me a strange certitude for the return of  the father from his fruitless search.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Has she escaped from  one of the windows?&rsquo; I asked, moved myself to a strange curiosity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He looked at me, but  made no reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is dark; it is  late. If the general chooses to remain here to-night&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;He will not find her,&rsquo;  was the reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was frightened&mdash;I know  not why, but I was frightened. The young man had a supernatural air. I began to  think of demon lovers, and was glad when the general finally appeared, storming  and raving.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is a conspiracy!&rsquo;  was his cry. &lsquo;You are all in league to deceive me. Where is my daughter, Mrs.  Truax? I ask you because you have a character to lose.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is impossible for  me to tell you,&rsquo; was my reply. &lsquo;If she was to be found in my house, you must  have found her. As you have not, there is but one conclusion to draw. She is  not within these walls.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She is not outside of  them. I set a watch in the beginning, at the four corners of the house. None of  my men have seen so much as a flutter of her dress. She is here, I say, and I  ask you to give her up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;This I am perfectly  willing to do,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;but I do not know where to find her. Let that but  once be done, and I shall not stand in the way of your rights.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I  will not search further to-night; but to-morrow&mdash;&rsquo; A meaning gesture finished  his sentence; he turned to the young man. &lsquo;As for you,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;you will  remain here. Unpleasant as it may be for us both, we will keep each other&rsquo;s  company till morning. I do not insist upon conversation.&rsquo; And without waiting  for a reply, the sturdy old soldier took up his station in the doorway, by  which action he not only shut the young man in, but gave himself a position of  vantage from which he could survey the main hall and the most prominent  passages.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The rest were under  charge of his followers, whom he had stationed all through the house, just as  if it were in a state of siege. One guarded the east door and another the west,  and on each landing of the staircase a sentinel stood, silent but alert, like a  pair of living statues.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not sleep that  night; the mystery of the whole affair would have kept me awake even if my  indignation had let me rest. I sat in the kitchen with my girls, and when the  morning came, I joined the general again with offers of a breakfast.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he would eat  nothing till he had gone through the house again; nor would he, in fact, eat  here at all; for his second search ended as vainly as his first, and he was by  this time so wroth, not only at the failure to recover his child, but at the  loss which his dignity had suffered by this failure, that he had no sooner  reached this spot, and found the young husband still standing where he had left  him, than with a smothered execration, leveled not only at him, but the whole  house, he strode out through the doorway, and finding his horse ready saddled  in front, mounted and rode away, followed by all his troop.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And now comes the  strangest part of the tale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was no sooner gone,  and the dust from his horse&rsquo;s hoofs lost in the distance, than I turned to the  young husband, and cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And now where is she?  Let us have her here at once. She must be hungry, and she must be cold. Bring  her, my good sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I do not know where  she is. We must be patient. She will return herself as soon as she thinks it  safe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I could not believe my  ears.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You do not know where  she is?&rsquo; I repeated. &lsquo;How could you be so self-possessed through all these  hours and all this maddened searching if you did not know she was safe?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I did know she was  safe. She swore to me before she set foot on your doorstep that she could so  hide herself in these walls that no one could ever find her till she chose to  reveal herself; and I believed her, and felt secure.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not know what to  say.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;But she is a stranger,&rsquo;  I murmured. &lsquo;What does she know about my house?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She is a stranger to  you,&rsquo; he retorted, &lsquo;but she may not be a stranger to the house. How long have  you lived here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I could not say long.  It was at the most but a year; so I merely shook my head, but I felt strangely  nonplussed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This feeling, however,  soon gave way to one much more serious as the moments fled by and presently the  hours, and she did not come. We tried to curb our impatience, tried to believe  that her delay was only owing to extra caution; but as morning waxed to noon,  alarm took the place of satisfaction in our breasts, and we began to search the  house ourselves, calling her name up and down the halls and through the empty  rooms, till it seemed as if the very walls must open and reveal us the being so  frantically desired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;She is not in the  house,&rsquo; I now asserted to the almost frenzied bridegroom. &lsquo;Our lies have come  back upon our heads, and it is in the river we must look for her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he would not agree  with me in this, and repeated again and again: &lsquo;She said she would hide here.  She would not deceive me, nor would she have sought death alone. Leave me to  look for her another hour. I must, I can, I will find her yet!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he never did. After  that last fond look with which she turned down that very hall you see before  you, we saw her no more; and if my house owns no ghost and never echoes to the  sound of a banshee&rsquo;s warning, it is not because it does not own a mystery which  is certainly thrilling enough to give us either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried out several  voices, as I ceased, &ldquo;is that all? And what became of the poor bridegroom? And  did the father ever come back? And haven&rsquo;t you ever really found out where the  poor thing went to? And do you think she died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For reply I rose. I had  never taken my eye off madame, and the strain upon us both had been terrible;  but I let my glance wander now, and smiling genially into the eager faces which  had crowded around me, I remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I never spoil a good  story by too many explanations. You have heard all you will from me to-night.  So do not question me further. Am I not right, madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; came in her  even tones. &ldquo;And I am sure we are all very much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I bowed and slipped away  into the background. I was worn out.</p>
  <p align="left">An hour later I was  passing through the hall above on my way to my own room. As I passed madame&rsquo;s  door, I saw it open, and before I had taken three steps away I felt her soft  hand on my arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your pardon, Mrs. Truax,&rdquo;  were her words; &ldquo;but my daughter has been peculiarly affected by the story you  related to us below. She says it is worse than any ghost story, and that she  cannot rid herself of the picture of the young wife flitting out of sight down  the hall. I am really afraid it has produced a very bad effect upon her, and  that she will not sleep. Is it&mdash;was it a true story, Mrs. Truax, or were you  merely weaving fancies out of a too fertile brain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I smiled, for she was  smiling, and shook my head, looking directly into her eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your daughter need not  lose her sleep,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;on account of any story of mine. I saw they wanted  something blood-curdling, so I made up a tale to please them. It was all  imagination, madame; all imagination. I should not have told it if it had been  otherwise. I think too much of my house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you had nothing to  found it upon? Just drew upon your fancy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I smiled. Her light tone  did not deceive me as to the anxiety underlying all this; but it was not in my  plan to betray my powers of penetration. I preferred that she should think me  her dupe.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I returned, as  ingenuously as if I had never had a suspicious thought, &ldquo;I do not find it  difficult to weave a tale. Of course such a story could not be true. Why, I  should be afraid to stay in the inn myself if it were. I could never abide  anything mysterious. Everything with me must be as open as the day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And with me,&rdquo; she  laughed; but there was a false note in her mirth, though I did not appear to  notice it. &ldquo;I did not suppose the story was real, but I thought you must have  some old tradition to found it upon; some old wife&rsquo;s tale or some secret  history which is a part and parcel of the house, and came to you with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But I shook my head,  still smiling, and answered, quite at my ease:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No old wife&rsquo;s tale that  I have ever heard amounts to much. I can make up a better story any day than  those which come down with a house like this. It was all the work of my  imagination, I assure you. I tried to please them, and I hope I did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her face changed at  once. It was as if a black veil had been drawn away from it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My daughter will be so  relieved,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind such lugubrious tales myself, but she is  young and sensitive, and so tender-hearted. I am sure I thank you, Mrs. Truax,  for your consideration, and beg leave to wish you a good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I returned her civility,  and we passed into our several rooms. Would I could know with what thoughts,  for my own were as much a mystery to me as were hers.</p>
  <p align="left">October 9, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">Madame never addresses  her daughter by her first name. Consequently we do not know it. This is a  matter of surprise to the whole house, and many are the conjectures uttered by  the young men as to what it can be. I have no especial curiosity about it&mdash;I  would much rather know the mother&rsquo;s, and yet I frequently wonder; for it seems  unnatural for a mother always to address her child as mademoiselle. Is she her  mother? I sometimes think she is not. If the interest in the oak parlor is what  I think it is, then she cannot be, for what mother would wish to bring peril to  her child? And peril lies at the bottom of all interest there; peril to the  helpless, the trusting and the ignorant. But is she as interested there as I  thought her? I have observed nothing lately to assure me of it. Perhaps, after  all, I have been mistaken.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    In The Halls At Midnight</b></h2>
  <p align="left">October 10, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">I was not mistaken.  Madame is not only interested in, but has serious designs upon the oak parlor.  Not content with roaming up and down the hallway leading to it, she was  detected yesterday morning trying to open its door, and when politely  questioned as to whom she was seeking, answered that she was looking for the  sitting room, which, by the way, is on the other side of the house. And this is  not all. As I lay in my bed last night resting as only a weary woman can rest,  I heard a light tap at my door. Rising, I opened it, and was astonished to see  standing before me the light figure of mademoiselle.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Excuse me for troubling  you,&rdquo; said she, in her pure English&mdash;they both speak good English, though with a  foreign accent&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry to wake you, but I am so anxious about my mother.  She went to bed with me, and we fell asleep; but when I woke a little while ago  she was missing, and though I have waited for her a long time, she does not  return. I am not well, and easily frightened! Oh, how cold it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I drew her in, wrapped a  shawl about her, and led her back to her room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your mother will return  speedily,&rdquo; I promised. &ldquo;Doubtless she felt restless, and is taking a turn or  two up and down the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps; for her  dressing gown and slippers are gone. But she never did anything like this  before, and in a strange house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A slight trembling  stopped the young lady from continuing.</p>
  <p align="left">Urging her to get into  bed, I spoke one or two further words of a comforting nature, at which the  lovely girl seemed to forget her pride, for she threw her arms about my neck  with a low sigh, and then, pushing me softly from her, observed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are a kind woman;  you make me feel happier whenever you speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Touched, I made some  loving reply, and withdrew. I longed to linger, longed to tell her how truly I  was her friend; but I feared the mother&rsquo;s return&mdash;feared to miss the knowledge  of madame&rsquo;s whereabouts, which my secret suspicion made important; so I subdued  my feelings and hastened quickly to my room, where I wrapped myself in a long,  dark cloak. Thus equipped, I stole back again to the hall, and gliding with as  noiseless a step as possible, found my way to the back stairs, down which I  crept, holding my breath, and listening intently.</p>
  <p align="left">To many who read these  words the situation of those back stairs is well known; but there may be others  who will not understand that they lead directly, after a couple of turns, to  that hall upon which opens the oak parlor. Five steps from the lower floor  there is a landing, and upon this landing there is a tall Dutch clock, so  placed as to offer a very good hiding place behind it to any one anxious to  gaze unobserved down the hall. But to reach the clock one has to pass a window,  and as this looks south, and was upon this night open to the moonlight, I felt  that the situation demanded circumspection.</p>
  <p align="left">I, therefore, paused  when I reached the last step above the platform, and listened intently before  proceeding further. There was no noise; all was quiet, as a respectable house  should be at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Yet from the hall below came an  undefinable something which made me feel that she was there; a breathing  influence that woke every nervous sensibility within me, and made my  heart-beats so irregular that I tried to stop them lest my own presence should  be betrayed. She was there, a creeping, baleful figure, blotting the moonshine  with her tall shadow, as she passed, panther-like, to and fro before that closed  door, or crouched against the wall in the same attitude of listening which I  myself assumed. Or so I pictured her as I clung to the balustrade above, asking  myself how I could cross that strip of moonlight separating me from that  vantage-point I longed to gain. For that I knew her to be there was not enough.  I must see her, and learn, if possible, what the attraction was which drew her  to this fatal door. But how, how, how? If she were watching, as secrecy ever  watches, I could not take a step upon that platform without being discerned.  Not even if a friendly cloud came to obscure the brightness of the moon, could  I hope to project my dark figure into that belt of light without discovery. I  must see what was to be seen from the step where I stood, and to do this I knew  but one way. Taking up the end of my long cloak, I advanced it the merest  trifle beyond the edge of the partition that separated me from the hall below.  Then I listened again. No sound, no stir. I breathed deeply and thrust my arm  still further, the long cloak hanging from it dark and impenetrable to the  floor below. Then I waited. The moonlight was not quite as bright as it had  been; surely that was a cloud I saw careering over the face of the sky above  me, and in another moment, if I could wait for it, the hall would be almost  dark. I let my arm advance an inch or so further, and satisfied now that I had  got the slit which answers for an arm-hole into a position that would afford me  full opportunity of looking through the black wall I had thus improvised, I  watched the cloud for the moment of comparative darkness which I so confidently  expected. It came, and with it a sound&mdash;the first I had heard. It was from far  down the hall, and was, as near as I could judge, of a jingling nature, which  for an instant I found it hard to understand. Then the quick suspicion came as  to what it was, and unable to restrain myself longer I separated the slit I  have spoken of with the fingers of my right hand, and looked through.</p>
  <p align="left">There she was, standing  before the door of the oak parlor, fitting keys. I knew it at my first glimpse,  both from her attitude and the slight noise which the keys made. Taken aback,  for I had not expected this, I sank out of sight, cloak and all, asking myself  what I should do. I finally decided to do nothing. I would listen, and if the  least intimation came to prove that she had succeeded in her endeavor, I would  then spring down the steps that separated us and hold her back by the hair of  her head. Meanwhile I congratulated myself that the lock of that room was a  peculiar one, and that the only key I knew of that would unlock it was under  the pillow of the bed I had just left.</p>
  <p align="left">She worked several  minutes; then the moon came out. Instantly all was still. I knew whither she  had gone. Near the door she was tampering with is a short passageway leading to  another window. Into this she had slipped, and I could look out now with  impunity, sure that she would not see me.</p>
  <p align="left">But I remained  immovable. There was another cloud rushing up from the south, and in another  moment I was confident that I should hear again the slight clatter of the key  against the lock. And I did, and not only once, but several times, which fact  assured me that she had not only brought a handful of keys with her, but that  these keys must have come from some more distant quarter than the town; that  indeed she had come provided to the Happy-Go-Lucky for this nocturnal visit,  and that any doubts I might cherish were likely to have a better foundation in  fact than is usual with women circumstanced like myself.</p>
  <p align="left">She did not succeed in  her efforts. Had she brought burglar&rsquo;s tools I hardly think she would have been  able to open that lock; as it was, there was no hope for her, and presently she  seemed to comprehend this, for the slight sounds ceased and, presently, I heard  a step, and peering recklessly from my corner, I perceived her gliding away  toward the front stairs. I smiled, but it could not have been in a way she  would have enjoyed seeing, and crept noiselessly to my own room, and our doors  closed simultaneously.</p>
  <p align="left">This morning I watched  with some anxiety for her first look. It was slightly inquiring. Summoning up  my best smile, I gave her a cheerful good-morning, and then observed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am glad to see you  look so well this morning! Your daughter seemed to be concerned about you in  the night because you had left your bed. But I told her I was sure all was  right, that you were feeling nervous, and only wanted a breath of the fresh air  you would find in the halls.&rdquo; And my glance did not flinch, nor my mouth lose  its smile, though she surveyed me keenly with eyes whose look might penetrate a  stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You understand your own  sex,&rdquo; was her light reply, after this short study of my face. &ldquo;Yes; I was very  nervous. I have cares on my mind, and, though my daughter does not realize it,  I often lie awake at her side, longing for space to breathe in and freedom to  move as freely as my uneasiness demands. Last night my feelings were too much  for my self-control, and I arose. I hope I did not seriously disturb you, or  awaken anybody, with my restless pacing up and down the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I assured her that it  took more than this to disturb me, and that after quieting her daughter I had  immediately fallen asleep; all of which she may have believed or may not; I had  no means of reading her mind, as she had no means of reading mine.</p>
  <p align="left">But whether she was  deceived or whether she was not, she certainly looked relieved, and after some  short remarks about the weather, turned from me with the most cheerful air in  the world, to greet her daughter.</p>
  <p align="left">As for me, I have made  up my mind to change my room. I shall not say anything about it or make any  fuss on the subject, but to-night, and for some nights to come, I intend to  take up my abode in a certain small room in the west wing, not very far removed  from the dreadful oak parlor.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    The Stone In The Garden</b></h2>
  <p align="left">October 11, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">This morning the post  brought two letters for my strange guests. Being anxious to see how they would  be received, I carried them up to Madame Letellier&rsquo;s room myself.</p>
  <p align="left">The ladies were sitting  together, the daughter embroidering. At the sight of the letters in my hand  they both rose, the daughter reaching me first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me have them!&rdquo; she  cried, a glad, bright color showing for a moment on her cheek.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From your father?&rdquo;  asked the mother, in a tone of nonchalance that did not deceive me.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl shook her head.  A smile as exquisite as it was sad made her mouth beautiful. &ldquo;From&mdash;&rdquo; she began,  but stopped, whether from an instinct of maidenly shame or some secret signal  from her mother, I cannot say.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; the  mother exclaimed, and turned away toward the window in a manner that gave me my  dismissal.</p>
  <p align="left">So I went out, having  learned nothing, save the fact that mademoiselle had a lover, and that her lips  could smile.</p>
  <p align="left">They did not smile  again, however. Next day she looked whiter than ever, and languid as a broken  blossom.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is ill,&rdquo; declared  madame. &ldquo;The stairs she has to climb are too much for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; thought I to  myself. &ldquo;That is the first move,&rdquo; and waited for the next development.</p>
  <p align="left">It has not come as soon  as I expected. Two days have passed, and though Mademoiselle Letellier grows  paler and thinner, nothing more has been said about the stairs. But the time  has not passed without its incident, and a serious enough one, too, if these  women are, as I fear, in the secret of the hidden chamber.</p>
  <p align="left">It is this: In the  garden is a white stone. It is plain-finished but unlettered. It marks the  resting-place of Honora Urquhart. For reasons which we all thought good, we  have taken no uninterested person into the secret of this grave, any more than  we have into that of the hidden chamber.</p>
  <p align="left">Consequently no one in  the house but myself could answer Madame Letellier, when, stopping in her short  walk up and down the garden path, she asked what the white stone meant and what  it marked. I would not answer her. I had seen from the window where I stood the  quick surprise with which she had come to a standstill at the sight of this  stone, and I had caught the tremble in her usually steady voice as she made the  inquiry I have mentioned above. I therefore hastened down and joined her before  she had left the spot.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are wondering what  this stone means,&rdquo; I observed, with an indifferent tone calculated to set her  at her ease. Then suddenly, and with a changed voice and a secret look into her  face, I added: &ldquo;It is a headstone; a dead body lies here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She quivered, and her  lids fell. For all her self-possession&mdash;and she is the most self-possessed  person I ever saw in my life&mdash;she showed a change that gave me new thoughts and  made me summon up all the strength I am mistress of, in order to preserve the  composure which her agitation had so deeply shaken.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page235.jpg" width="800" height="569"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You shock me,&rdquo; were her  first words, uttered very slowly, and with a transparent show of indifference. &ldquo;It  is not usual to find a garden used for a burial place. May I ask whose body  lies here? That of some faithful black or of a favorite horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not that of a  horse,&rdquo; I returned, calmly. And greatly pleased to find that I had placed her  in a position where she would be obliged to press the question if she would  learn anything more, I walked slowly on, convinced that she would follow me.</p>
  <p align="left">She did, giving me short  side glances, which I bore with an equanimity that much belied the tempest of  doubt, repugnance and horror that were struggling blindly in my breast. But she  did not renew the subject of the grave. Instead of that, she opened one of her  most fascinating conversations, endeavoring by her wiles and graces to get at  my confidence and insure my good will.</p>
  <p align="left">And I was hypocrite  enough to deceive her into thinking she had done so. Though I showed her no  great warmth, I carefully restrained myself from betraying my real feelings,  allowing her to talk on, and giving her now and then an encouraging word or an  inviting smile.</p>
  <p align="left">For I felt that she was  a serpent and must be met as such. If she were the woman I thought her, I  should gain nothing and lose all by betraying my distrust, while if she felt me  to be her dupe I might yet light upon the secret of her interest in the oak  parlor.</p>
  <p align="left">Her daughter was waiting  for us in the doorway when we reached the house. At the sight of her pure face,  with its tender gray eyes and faultless features, a strong revulsion seized me,  and I found it difficult not to raise my arms in protest between her beauty and  winning womanliness and the subtile and treacherous-hearted being who glided so  smoothly toward her. But the movement, had I made it, would have been in vain.  At the sight of each other&rsquo;s faces a lovely smile arose on the daughter&rsquo;s lips,  while on the mother&rsquo;s flashed a look of love which would be unmistakable even  on the countenance of a tiger, and which was at this moment so vivid and so  real that I never doubted again, if I had ever doubted before, that  mademoiselle was her own child&mdash;flesh of her flesh, and bone of her bone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, mamma,&rdquo; cried one  soft voice, &ldquo;I have been so lonesome!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; returned the  other, in tones as true and caressing, &ldquo;I will not leave you again, even for a  walk, till you are quite well.&rdquo; And taking her by the waist, she led her down  the hall toward the stairs, looking back at me as she did so, and saying: &ldquo;I  cannot take her to Albany until she is better. You must think what we can do to  make her strong again, Mrs. Truax.&rdquo; And she sighed as she looked up the short  flight of stairs her daughter had to climb.</p>
  <p align="left">October 15, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">That stone in the garden  seems to possess a magnetic attraction for madame. She is over it or near it  half the time. If I go out in the early morning to gather grapes for dinner,  there she is before me, pacing up and down the paths converging to that spot,  and gazing with eager eyes at that simple stone, as if by the force of her will  she would extract its secret and make it tell her what she evidently burns to  know. If I want flowers for the parlor mantel, and hurry into the garden during  the heat of the day, there is madame with a huge hat on her head, plucking  asters or pulling down apples from the low-hanging branches of the trees. It is  the same at nightfall. Suspicious, always suspicious now, I frequently stop, in  passing through the upper western hall, to take a peep from the one window that  overlooks this part of the garden. I invariably see her there; and remembering  that her daughter is ill, remembering that in my hearing she promised that  daughter that she would not leave her again, I feel impelled at times to remind  her of the fact, and see what reply will follow. But I know. She will say that  she is not well herself; that the breeze from the river does her good; that she  loves nature, and sleeps better after a ramble under the stars. I cannot  disconcert her&mdash;not for long&mdash;and I cannot compete with her in volubility and  conversational address, so I will continue to play a discreet part and wait.</p>
  <p align="left">October 17, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">Madame has become  bolder, or her curiosity more impatient. Hitherto she has been content with  haunting the garden, and walking over and about that one place in it which  possesses peculiar interest for her and me. But this evening, when she thought  no one was looking, when after a hurried survey of the house and grounds she  failed to detect my sharp eyes behind the curtain of the upper window, she  threw aside discretion, knelt down on the sod of that grave, and pushed aside  the grass that grows about the stone, doubtless to see if there was any marks  or inscription upon it. There are none, but I determined she should not be sure  of this, so before she could satisfy herself, I threw up the window behind  which I stood, making so much noise that it alarmed her, and she hastily rose.</p>
  <p align="left">I met her hasty look  with a smile which it was too dark for her to see, and a cheerful good evening  which I presume fell with anything but a cheerful sound upon her ears.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is a lovely evening,&rdquo;  I cried. &ldquo;Have you been admiring the sunset?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, so much!&rdquo; was her  quick reply, and she began to saunter in slowly. But I knew she left her  thoughts out there with that mysterious grave.</p>
  <p align="left">12 m.</p>
  <p align="left">Another midnight  adventure! Late as it is, I must put it down, for I cannot sleep, and to-morrow  will bring its own story.</p>
  <p align="left">I had gone to bed, but  not to sleep. The anxieties under which I now labor, the sense of mystery which  pervades the whole house, and the secret but ever-present apprehension of some  impending catastrophe, which has followed me ever since these women came into  the house, lay heavily on my mind, and prevented all rest. The change of room  may also have added to my disturbance. I am wedded to old things, old ways, and  habitual surroundings. I was not at home in this small and stuffy apartment,  with its one narrow window and wretched accommodations. Nor could I forget near  what it lay, nor rid myself of the horror which its walls gave me whenever I  realized, as I invariably did at night, that only a slight partition separated  me from the secret chamber, with its ghastly memories and ever to be remembered  horrors.</p>
  <p align="left">I was lying, then,  awake, when some impulse&mdash;was it a magnetic one?&mdash;caused me to rise and look out  of the window. I did not see anything unusual&mdash;not at first&mdash;and I drew back. But  the impulse returned, and I looked again, and this time perceived among the  shadows of the trees something stirring in the garden, though what I could not  tell, for the night was unusually dark, and my window very poorly situated for  seeing.</p>
  <p align="left">But that there was  something there was enough, and after another vain attempt to satisfy myself as  to its character, I dressed and went out into the hall, determined to ascertain  if any outlet to the house was open.</p>
  <p align="left">I did not take a light,  for I know the corridors as I do my own hand. But I almost wished I had as I  sped from door to door and window to window; for the events which had blotted  my house with mystery were beginning to work upon my mind, and I felt afraid,  not of my shadow, for I could not see it, but of my step, and the great gulfs  of darkness that were continually opening before my eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">However, I did not draw  back, and I did not delay. I tried the front door, and found it locked; then  the south door, and finally the one in the kitchen. This last was ajar. I knew  then what had happened. Madame has had more than one talk with Chloe lately,  and the good negress has not been proof against her wiles, and has taught her  the secret of the kitchen lock. I shall talk to Chloe to-morrow. But, meantime,  I must follow madame.</p>
  <p align="left">But should I? I know  what she is doing in the garden. She is wandering round and round that grave.  If I saw her I could not be any surer of the fact, and I would but reveal my  own suspicions to her by showing myself as a spy. No; I will remain here in the  shadows of the kitchen, and wait for her to return. The watch may be weird, but  no weirder than that of a previous night. Besides, it will not be a long one;  the air is too chilly outside for her to risk a lengthy stay in it. I shall  soon perceive her dark figure glide in through the doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">And I did. Almost before  I had withdrawn into my corner I heard the faint fall of feet on the stone  without, then the subdued but unmistakable sound of the opening door, and  lastly the locking of it and the hasty tread of footsteps as she glided across  the brick flagging and disappeared into the hall beyond.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She has laid the ghost  of her unrest for to-night,&rdquo; thought I. &ldquo;To-morrow it will rise again.&rdquo; And I  felt my first movement of pity for her.</p>
  <p align="left">Alas! does that unrest  spring from premeditated or already accomplished guilt? Whichever it may be&mdash;and  I am ready to believe in either or both&mdash;she is a burdened creature, and the  weight of her fears or her intentions lies heavily upon her. But she hides the  fact with consummate address, and when under the eyes of people smiles so  brightly and conducts herself with such a charming grace that half the guests  that come and go consider her as lovely and more captivating than her daughter.  What would they think if they could see her as I do rising in the night to roam  about a grave, the unmarked head-stone of which baffles her scrutiny?</p>
  <p align="left">October 18, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">This morning I rose at  daybreak, and going into the garden, surveyed the spot which I had imagined  traversed by Madame Letellier the night before. I found it slightly trampled,  but what interested me a great deal more than this was the fact that, on a  certain portion of the surface of the stone I have so often mentioned, there  were to be seen small particles of a white substance, which I soon discovered  to be wax.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus the mystery of her  midnight visit is solved. She has been taking an impression of what, in her one  short glimpse of yesterday evening, she had thought to be an inscription. What  a wonderful woman she is! What skill she shows; what secrecy and what purpose.  If she cannot compass her end in one way, she will in another; and I begin to  have, notwithstanding my repugnance and fear, a wholesome respect for her ability  and the relentless determination which she shows in every action she performs.</p>
  <p align="left">When she finds that her  wax shows her nothing but the natural excrescences and roughnesses of an unhewn  stone, will she persist in her visits to the garden? I think not.</p>
  <p align="left">October 19, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">My last surmise was a  true one. Madame has not spent a half hour all told in the garden since that  night. She has turned her attention again to the oak parlor, and soon we shall  see her make some decided move in regard to it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    In The Oak Parlor</b></h2>
  <p align="left">October 20, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">THE long expected move  has been made. This morning madame asked me if I had not some room on the  ground floor which I could give to her daughter and her in exchange for the one  they now occupy. Her daughter had been accustomed to living on one floor, and  felt the stairs keenly.</p>
  <p align="left">I answered at first&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Then I appeared to bethink me, and told her, with seeming reluctance, that  there was one room below which I sometimes opened to guests, but that just now  it was in such a state of dilapidation I had shut it up till I could find the  opportunity of repairing it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she replied,  subduing her eagerness to the proper point, &ldquo;you need not wait for that. We are  not particular persons. Only let me see the roses come back to my daughter&rsquo;s  cheeks, and I can bear any amount of discomfort. Where is this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I pretended not to hear  her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It would take two days  to get it into any sort of condition fit for sleeping in,&rdquo; I murmured  reflectively. &ldquo;The floor is so loose in places that you cannot walk across it  without danger of falling through. Then there is the chimney&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She was standing near me  and I heard her draw her breath quickly, but she gave no other sign of emotion,  not even in the sound of her voice as she interrupted me with the words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! if you have got to  make the room all over, we might as well not consider the subject. But I am  sure it is not necessary. Do let me see it, and I can soon tell you whether we  can be comfortable there or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I had sworn to myself  never to enter that room again, but such oaths are easily broken. Leaving her  for a moment, I procured my key, and taking her with me down the west hall, I  unlocked the fatal door and bade her enter.</p>
  <p align="left">She hesitated for an  instant, but only for an instant. Then she walked coolly in, and stood waiting  while I crossed the floor to the window and threw it open. Her first glance  flashed to the mantel and its adjacent wainscoting; then, finding everything  satisfactory in that direction, it flew over the desolate walls and stiff,  high-backed chairs, till it rested on the bare four-poster, denuded of its  curtains and coverlets.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A gloomy place!&rdquo; she  declared; &ldquo;but you can easily make it look inviting with fresh curtains and a  cheerful fire. I am sure that, dismal as it is, it will be more welcome to my  daughter than the sunny room up stairs. Besides, the window looks out on the  river, and that is always interesting. You will let us come here, will you not?  I am sure, if we are willing, you ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I gasped inwardly, and  agreed with her. Yet I made a few more objections. But as I intended that she  should sleep in this room, I finally cleared my brow, and announced that the  room should be ready for her occupancy on Friday; and with this she had to be  content.</p>
  <p align="left">October 21.</p>
  <p align="left">Bless God that I am  mistress in my own house! I can order, I can have performed whatever I choose,  without fuss, without noise, and without gossip. This is very fortunate just  now, for while I am openly having the floor mended in the oak parlor, I am  secretly having another piece of work done, which, if once known, would arouse  suspicions and awaken conjectures that would destroy all my plans concerning  the mysterious guests who insist upon inhabiting the accursed oak parlor.</p>
  <p align="left">What this work is can be  best understood by a glance at the accompanying diagram, which is a copy of the  one drawn up by the Englishman for Mr. Tamworth.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page251.jpg" width="963" height="924"></p>
  <p align="left">Here you see that the  secret chamber lies between the rooms A and B. A is the parlor and B is the  small room in which I had put up my bed after the nocturnal adventure of  October 10. It has always been used as a store room until now, and as no one  handles the keys of this house but myself, the fact of my using it for any  other purpose is known only to Margery and a certain quiet and reticent workman  from Cruger&rsquo;s shop, to whom I have intrusted the task of opening a passage at D  through the wall. For I must have proper means of communication with this room  before I can allow Madame Letellier and her daughter to take up their abode in  it. Though the former&rsquo;s plans are a mystery to me; though I feel that she loves  her daughter, and, therefore, cannot meditate evil against her, still my doubts  of her are so great that I must know her intentions, if possible, and to do  this I contemplate keeping a watch over that den of wicked memories which will  be at once both unsuspected and vigilant.</p>
  <p align="left">The flooring of the  parlor is nearly completed, and to-night will see the door of communication  between my room and the secret chamber hung and ready for use.</p>
  <p align="left">October 22.</p>
  <p align="left">A month ago, if any one  had told me that I would not only walk of my own free will into the secret  chamber, but take up my abode in it, eat in it and sleep in it, I would have  said that person was mad. And yet this is just what I have done.</p>
  <p align="left">The result of my first  vigil was unexpected. I had looked for&mdash;well, I hardly know what I did look for.  My anticipations were vague, but they did not lead me in the right direction.  But let me tell the story. After I had installed my guests in their new  apartment, I informed them that I would have to say good-by for a season, as I  had an affection of the eyes&mdash;which was true enough&mdash;which at times compelled me  to shut myself up in a dark room and forego all company. That I felt one of  these spells coming on&mdash;which was not true&mdash;and that by a speedy resort to  darkness and quiet, I hoped to prevent the attack from reaching its usual point  of distress. Mademoiselle Letellier looked disappointed, but madame ill  disguised her relief and satisfaction. Convinced now beyond all doubt that she  had some plan in mind which made her dread my watchfulness, I made such final  arrangements as were necessary, and betook myself at once to my new room. Once  there, I moved immediately into the dark chamber, and walking with the utmost  circumspection, crossed to the wall adjoining the oak parlor, and laying my ear  against the opening into that room, I listened.</p>
  <p align="left">At first I heard  nothing, probably because its inmates were still. Then I caught an exclamation  of weariness, and soon some words of desultory conversation. Relieved beyond  expression, not only because I could hear, but because they talked in English,  I withdrew again into my own room. The most difficult problem in the world was  solved. I had found the means by which I could insinuate myself, unseen and  unsuspected, into the secret confidences of two women, at moments when they  felt themselves alone and at the mercy of no judgment but that of God. Should I  learn enough to pay me for the humiliation of my position? I did not weary  myself by questioning. I knew my motive was pure, and fixed my mind upon that.</p>
  <p align="left">Several times before the  day was over did I return to the secret chamber and bend my ear to the wall.  But in no instance did I linger long, for if the two ladies spoke at all it was  on trivial subjects, and in such tones as indicated that neither their passions  nor any particular interests were engaged. For such talk I had no ear.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It will not be always  so,&rdquo; I thought to myself. &ldquo;When night comes and the heart opens, they will  speak of what lies upon their minds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And so it happened. As  the inn grew quiet and the lights began to disappear from the windows, I crept  again to my station against the partition, and in a darkness and atmosphere  that at any other time in my life would have completely unnerved me, hearkened  to the conversation within.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma,&rdquo; were the  first words I heard, uttered in English, as all their talk was when they were  moved or excited, &ldquo;if you would only explain! If you would only tell me why you  do not wish me to receive letters from him! But this silence&mdash;this love and this  silence are killing me. I cannot bear it. I feel like a lost child who hears  its mother&rsquo;s voice in the darkness, but does not know how to follow that voice  to the refuge it bespeaks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Time was when daughters  found it sufficient to know that their parents disapproved of an act, without  inquiring into their reasons for it. Your father has told you that the marquis  is not eligible as a husband for you, and he expects this to content you. Have  I the right to say more than he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the right, perhaps,  mamma. I do not appeal to your sense of right, but to your love. I am very  unhappy. My whole life&rsquo;s peace is trembling in the balance. You ought to see  it&mdash;you do see it&mdash;yet you let me suffer without giving me one reason why I  should do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The mother&rsquo;s voice was  still.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; the daughter  went on again, after what seemed like a moment of helpless waiting. &ldquo;Though my  arms are about you, and my cheek pressed close to yours, you will not speak. Do  you wonder that I am heart-broken&mdash;that I feel like turning my face to the wall  and never looking up again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wonder at nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Was that madame&rsquo;s voice?  What boundless misery! what unfathomable passion! what hopeless despair!</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If he were unworthy!&rdquo;  her daughter here exclaimed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It you could point to  anything he lacks. But he has wealth, a noble name, a face so handsome that I  have seen both you and papa look at him in admiration; and as for his mind and  attainments, are they not superior to those of all the young men who have ever  visited us? Mamma, mamma, you are so good that you require perfection in a  son-in-law. But is he not as near it as a man may be? Tell me, darling, for in  my dreams he always seems so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I heard the answer,  though it came slowly and with apparent effort.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The marquis is an  admirable young man, but we have another suitor in mind whose cause we more  favor. We wish you to marry Armand Thierry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A shop-keeper and a  revolutionist! Oh, mamma!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is why we brought  you away. That is why you are here&mdash;that you might have opportunity to bethink  yourself, and learn that the parents&rsquo; views in these matters are the truest  ones, and that where we make choice, there you must plight your troth. I assure  you that our reasons are good ones, if we do not give them. It is not from  tyranny&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here the set, strained  voice stopped, and a sudden movement in the room beyond showed that the mother  had risen. In fact, I presently heard her steps pacing up and down the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it is not  tyranny,&rdquo; the daughter finished, in the soft tones that were so great a  contrast to her mother&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Tyranny I could have understood; but it is mystery,  and that is not so easily comprehended. Why should you and papa be mysterious?  What is there in our simple life to create secrecy between persons who love  each other so dearly? I see nothing, know nothing; and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The word struck me like  a blow. &ldquo;Honora!&rdquo; Great heaven! was that the name of this young girl?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are giving too free  range to your imagination. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I did not hear the rest.  I was thinking of the name I had just heard, and wondering if my suspicions  were at fault. They would never have called their child Honora. Who were these  women, then? Friends of the Dudleighs? Avengers of the dead? I glued my ear  still closer to the wall.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have cherished you.&rdquo;  The mother was still speaking. &ldquo;We have given you all you craved, and more than  you asked. From the moment you were born we have both lavished all the  tenderness of our hearts upon you. And all we ask in return is trust.&rdquo; The hard  voice, hard because of emotion, I truly believe, quavered a little over that  word, but spoke it and went on. &ldquo;What we do for you now, as always, is for your  best good. Will you not believe it, Honora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The last appeal was  uttered in a passionate tone. It seemed to move the daughter, for her voice had  a sob in it as she replied:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes; but why not  enlighten me as to your reasons for a course so remarkable? Most parents desire  their daughters to do well, but you, on the contrary, not only wish, but urge  me to do ill. A noble lover sues for my hand, and his cause is slighted; an  ignoble one requests the same favor, and you run to grant it. Is there love in  this? Is there consideration? Perhaps; but if so, you should be able to show  where it lies. I am not a child, young as I am; I will understand any reasons  you may advance. Then let me have your confidence; it is all I ask, and surely  it is not much, when you see how I suffer from my disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The restless steps  ceased. I heard a groan close to my ear; the mother was evidently suffering  frightfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Papa is prosperous,&rdquo;  the daughter pleadingly continued. &ldquo;I know your decision cannot be the result  of financial difficulties. And then, if it were, the marquis is rich, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora!&rdquo;&mdash;the mother had  turned. I heard her advance toward her daughter&mdash;&ldquo;do you really love the  marquis? You have seen him but a few times, have held hardly any intercourse  with him, and at your age fancy often takes the place of love. You do not love  him, Honora, my child; you cannot; you will forget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma! Oh, mamma!  Oh, mamma!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The tone was enough.  Silence reigned, broken at last by Mademoiselle Letellier saying: &ldquo;It is not  necessary to see such a man as he is very many times in order to adjudge him to  be the best and noblest that the world contains. But, mamma, you are not  correct in saying that I scarcely know him. Though you will not be frank with  me, I am going to be frank with you and tell you something that I have hitherto  kept closely buried in my breast. I did not think I should ever speak of it to  any one, not even to you. Some dreams are so sweet to brood upon alone. But the  shadow which your silence has caused to fall between us has taught me the value  of openness and truth. I shall never hide anything from you again; so listen,  sweet mamma, while I open to you my heart, and learn, as you can only learn  from me, how your Honora first came to know and appreciate the Marquis de la  Roche-Guyon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it not,&rdquo;  interrupted the mother, &ldquo;at the great ball where he was formally introduced to  us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Madame sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Girls are all alike,&rdquo;  she cried. &ldquo;You think you know them, and lo! there comes a day when you find  that it is in a stranger&rsquo;s hand you must look for a key to their natures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And is not this what  God wills?&rdquo; suggested the child. &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, you must blame nature and not  me. I did not want to deceive you. I only found it impossible to speak.  Besides, if you had looked at me closely enough, you would have seen yourself  that I had met the marquis before. Such blushes do not come with a first  introduction. I remember their burning heat yet. Are my cheeks warm now? I feel  as if they ought to be. But there is nothing to grieve you in these blushes. It  is only the way a loving heart takes to speak. There is no wicked shame in  them; none, none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Did the daughter hear  that bitter exclamation? She did not appear to; for her voice was quite calm,  though immeasurably loving, as she proceeded in these words:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was always a  mother-girl. From the first day I can remember, I have known nothing sweeter  than to sit within reach of your fondling hand. You were always so tender with  me, mamma, even when I must have grieved you or disappointed your hopes or your  pride. If I were in the way I never saw it, nor can I remember, of all the  looks which have sometimes puzzled me in your face, one that spoke of  impatience or lack of sympathy with my pleasures or my griefs. With papa it was  not always so. No; don&rsquo;t stop me. You must let me speak of him. Though he has  never been unkind to me, he has a way of frowning at times that frightens me.  Whether he is displeased or simply ill I cannot say, but I have always felt a  dread of papa&rsquo;s presence which I never felt of yours; and yet you frown, too,  at times, though never upon me, mamma, dear&mdash;never upon me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A pause that was filled  in by a kiss, and then the tender voice went on:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can imagine, then,  what a turmoil was aroused in my breast when one day, while leaning from the  window, I saw a face in the street below that awakened within me such strange  feelings I could not communicate them even to my mother. I who had hitherto  confessed to her every trivial emotion of my life, shrank in a moment, as it  were, from revealing a secret no deeper than that I had looked for one half  minute upon the form of a passing stranger, and in that minute learned more of  my own heart and of the true meaning of life than in all the sixteen years I  had hitherto lived. You have seen him since, and you know he possesses every  grace that can render a man attractive; but to me that day he did not look like  a man at all, or if I thought of him as such, I thought of him as one who set a  pattern to his fellows, while retaining his own immeasurable superiority. He  did not see me. I do not know that I wished him to. I was quite content to  watch him from where I stood, and note his lordly walk and kindly mien, and  dream&mdash;oh, what did I dream that day! The memory of your own girlhood must tell you,  mamma. I did not know his name; I did not suspect his rank; but from his youth  I judged him to be single, from his bearing I knew him to be noble, and from  his look, which called out a reflected brightness on every face he chanced to  pass, I was assured that he was happy and that he was good. And what does a  girl&rsquo;s fancy need more? Still a glimpse so short might not have had such deep  consequences if it had not been followed by an event which rendered those first  impressions indelible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An event, Honora?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, mamma. You  remember the day you sent me with Cecile to take my first lessons in tambour  work of Madame Douay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Remember? Oh, my child,  that awful day when you came near losing your life! When the house fell with  you in it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes, mamma, and I  came home looking so pale you thought I was hurt, and fainted away, and would  have died yourself if I had not kissed you back to life. Well, mamma, dear, I  was hurt, but not in my body. It was my heart that had received a wound&mdash;a wound  from which I never shall recover, for it was made by the greatness, the  goodness, the noble self-sacrifice of the marquis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora! And you never  mentioned his name&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know, I know, mamma;  but you have already forgiven me for that. You know it was from no unworthy  motive. Think how you felt when you first saw papa. Think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A hurried movement from  the mother interrupted her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do not keep me in  suspense,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;let me hear what you have to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you are cold; you  shudder. Let me get a shawl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no, child, I am not  cold, only impatient. Go on with your story&mdash;go on. How came you to meet the  marquis in that place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried the  daughter, &ldquo;it was a strange occurrence. It all came about through a mistake of  Cecile&rsquo;s. Madame Douay, as we were told by the concierge, lived on the fourth  floor, but Cecile made a miscount and we went up to the fifth, and as there was  a Madame Douay there also, we did not detect our error, but went into her  apartments and were seated in the small salon to await madame&rsquo;s presence. We  had not told our errand, so we could not blame the maid who admitted us, nor,  though madame failed to appear, did we ever remember to blame any one, for  presently through the open window near which we sat there came the sound of  voices from the room above, and a drama began of such startling interest that  we could think of nothing else.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two men were talking.  Young men they seemed, and though I could not see them, I could tell from the  fresh, fine voice of the one that he was a true man, and from the sneering,  smothered tones of the other that he was not only a cynic, but of vicious  tendencies. The first one was saying, &lsquo;I never suspected this,&rsquo; when my  attention was first called to their words, and the answer which came was as  follows: &lsquo;If you had, I should not have had the pleasure of seeing you here.  Men are not apt to rush voluntarily upon their deaths, and that you are a dead  man you already know; for I have sworn to kill you as the clock strikes three,  and it is but ten minutes of that time, and you have not a weapon with which to  defend yourself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mamma, you can imagine  my feelings at hearing these words, though they were uttered by a person I  could not see, to another person equally unknown to me? I looked at Cecile and  she looked at me, but we could neither of us move. Every faculty seemed  paralyzed save that of hearing. We held our breaths and listened for the reply.  It came instantly and without a thrill in its clear accents.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are a gentleman,  and no common assassin. How can you reconcile such an act as this with your  honor, or with what sophistries quiet the stings of your conscience when time  shall have shown you the sin of so unprovoked an onslaught?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is not unprovoked,&rsquo;  was the harsh and bitter reply. &lsquo;You promised to marry Mademoiselle de  Fontaine, and yesterday, at three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;ah, I was there!&mdash;you formally  renounced your claims. This is an insult that calls for blood, and blood it  shall have. Twenty-four hours have elapsed less ten minutes, since you cast  this slur upon a noble lady&rsquo;s good name. When the hour is ripe, you will pay  the penalty it requires with your life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; urged his young  companion, &lsquo;Mademoiselle de Fontaine had herself requested the breaking off of  this contract. I am but following the lady&rsquo;s behests in withdrawing from a  position forced upon us against our will, and in direct opposition to her  happiness.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And by what right do  you presume to follow the behests of a lady still under age? Has she not  guardians to consult? Should not I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Pardon me, I have not  introduced myself, it seems. I am the Marquis de la Roche-Guyon.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Honora paused; her  mother&rsquo;s exclamation had stopped her:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The marquis! Oh!  Honora, and you have always said he was so good!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait, mamma; remember  it is the cynical voice which is speaking, and the marquis&rsquo;s voice is not  cynical. The words, however, are what I have told you; &lsquo;I am the Marquis de la  Roche-Guyon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, not knowing  either party, nor this name, least of all realizing that it was the one by  which the gentleman addressed was himself known, I did not understand why it  should create so great an impression. But that it did was evident, not only  from the momentary hush that followed, but from the violent exclamation that  burst from the young man&rsquo;s lips. &lsquo;You scoundrel!&rsquo; was his cry. But instantly he  seemed to regret the word, for he said almost with the same breath: &lsquo;Your  pardon, but there is but one man in the world besides myself who could, under  any circumstances, have a right to that name.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And that man?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Is my cousin, the  deceased marquis&rsquo;s son, long esteemed dead also, and now legally accepted as  such.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And what assures you  that I am not he? Your eyes? Well, I am changed, Louis, but not so changed that  a good look should not satisfy you that I am the man I claim to be. Besides,  you should know this mark on my forehead. You gave it to me&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Isidor!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I could not comprehend  it then, but I have learned since that the marquis&mdash;our marquis, I mean&mdash;had only  just come into his title; that the son of the preceding Marquis de la  Roche-Guyon had been so long missing that the courts had finally adjudged him  dead, and given up his inheritance to his cousin; that the first act of the new  marquis was to liberate the Demoiselle de Fontaine from an engagement that stood  in the way of her marriage with one more desirable to her; and that the  unexpected appearance of the real heir in this sudden and mysterious manner was  as great a surprise to him as any mortal circumstance could be. Yet to me, who  waited with palpitating heart and anxious ears for what should be said next,  there was no evidence of this in his tone. With the politeness we are  accustomed to in Frenchmen he observed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;You are welcome,  Isidor;&rsquo; and then, as if struck himself by the incongruity between this phrase  and the look and manner of his companion, he added, in slow tones&mdash;&rsquo;even if you  do bring a sword with you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The other, the real  marquis, as I suppose, seemed to hesitate at this, and I began to hope he was  ashamed of his dreadful threats and would speedily beg the other&rsquo;s pardon. But  I did not know the man, or realize the determination which lay at the bottom of  his furious and uncompromising words. But he soon made it evident to us.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Louis,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;you  have always been my evil genius. From our childhood you have stood in my way  with your superior strength, beauty, prowess and address. When I was young I  simply shrank from you in shame and distaste, but as I grew older I learned to  detest you; and now that I see you again, after five years of absence, handsome  as ever, taller than ever, and radiant, notwithstanding your nearness to death,  with memories such as I have never known, nor can know, and beliefs such as I  have never cherished nor will cherish, I hate you so that I find it difficult  to wait for the five minutes yet to elapse before my word will let me lift my  pistol and fire upon you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Then it is your hate  of me, and not your fondness for your sister, that has led you to lay this trap  for me?&rsquo; exclaimed the other. &lsquo;I should think your hate would be satisfied by  the change which your return will make in my prospects. From the marquisate of  La Roche-Guyon to a simple captaincy in his majesty&rsquo;s guards is quite a step,  Isidor. Will it not suffice to soothe an antagonism which I never shared?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Nothing can soothe it,  not even your death! You have robbed me of too much. First, of the world&rsquo;s  esteem, then of my mother&rsquo;s confidence, and, lastly, of my father&rsquo;s love. Yes;  deny it if you will, my father loved you better than he did me. This was the  reason he sent me from home; and when, shipwrecked and captured by savages, I  found myself thrown into an Eastern dungeon, half my misery and all my rage  were in the thought that he would not consider my loss a misfortune, but die in  greater peace and hope from knowing that his family honors would devolve upon  one more after his own heart than myself. Oh! I have had cause, and I have had  time to nourish my hate. Five years in a dungeon affords one leisure, and on  every square stone of that wall, and upon every inch of its relentless  pavement, I have beaten out this determination with my bare hands and manacled  feet, that if I ever did escape, and ever did return to the home of my fathers,  I would have full pay for the suffering you have caused me, even if I had it in  your blood. I have returned, and I find my father dead, and in his place  yourself, happy, insolent, and triumphant. Can you blame me for remembering my  vows, for resenting what will ever seem an insult to my sister, and for wishing  to hurry the time that moves so slowly toward the fatal stroke of three?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I do not blame you,  because you are a madman. I do not fear you, because, having no one in the  world to love, I do not greatly dread a sudden release from it. But I pity you  because you have suffered, and will defend myself because your sufferings will  be increased rather than diminished by the success of your crazy intentions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The answer came, quick  and furious:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I do not want your  pity, and I scorn any defense which you can make. Do you think I have not made  my calculations well? There is nothing here which can give you hope. We are  alone on the sixth story. Beneath us are only women, and if you call from the  window, I can shoot you dead before your voice can reach the street. Perhaps,  though, you do not think of saving yourself, but of ensnaring me. Bah! as if  the sight of the headsman would stop me now. Besides, I am prepared for flight.  Have you looked at this house? It is not like other houses; it is double, and  the room in which we stand has other foundations and walls from this one behind  me which I guard with my pistol. Let the deed be once done&mdash;and the clock, as  you see, gives us but one minute more&mdash;and I leap into this other apartment,  down another flight of stairs from those you came up, and so to another door  that opens upon another street. Then shout, if you will; I am safe. As to your  life, it is as much at my command as if my bullet were already in your heart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;We will see!&rsquo; was the  thundering reply, and with these words a rush was made that shook the floor  above our heads, and scattered bits of plaster down upon us. Released by the  action from the fearful spell which had benumbed my limbs, I felt that I could  move at last, and, leaping to my feet, I uttered scream after scream. But they  perished in my throat, smothered by a new fear; for at this moment my arm was  caught by Cecile, and following, with horrified gaze, the pointing of her  uplifted hand, I saw the straight line of the window-ledge before me dip and  curve, and yielding to the force of her agonized strength, I let myself be  dragged across the floor, while before us, beneath us, above us, all was one  chaos of heaving and crashing timbers, which, in another instant, broke into a  thunder of confused sounds, and we beheld beneath us a pit of darkness, death,  and tumult, where, but an instant before, were all the appurtenances of a  comfortable and luxurious home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were safe, for we  had reached the flooring of the second house before that of the first had  completely fallen, but I could not think of myself, narrow as my escape had  been, and marvelous as was the warning which had revealed to Cecile the only  path of safety. For in the clouded space above me, overhanging a gulf I dared  not measure with my eyes or sound with my imagination, I saw clinging by one  arm to a beam the awful figure of a man, while crouching near him on a portion  of flooring that still clung intact to the wall, I beheld another in whose  noble traits, distorted though they were by the emotions of the moment, I  recognized him who, but a month before, had changed the world for me with his  look.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! mamma, and a  thousand deaths lay between us; and we could neither reach him nor give any  alarm, for the space in which we found ourselves was small and shut from the  outer world by a door which was locked. How it became locked I never knew, but  I have thought that the maid in flying might have turned the key behind her,  under some wild impression that by this means she would shut out destruction.  However that may be, we were helpless and threatened by death. But our own  situation did not alarm us, for theirs was so much more terrible, especially  that of the man whose straining arm clung so frantically to a support that  threatened every moment to slip from his grasp. I could not look at him, and  scarcely could I look at the other. But I did, for in his face there was such a  high and noble resolve that it made me forget his danger, till suddenly I heard  him speak high above the sounds that arose in a tempest from the street:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Do not despair,  Isidor. I think I can reach you and pull you up upon the beam. You shall not  die a dog&rsquo;s death if I can help it. Hold on and I will come.&rsquo; And he began to  move and raise himself upon the narrow platform on which he stood, and I saw  that he meant what he said, and involuntarily and with but little reason I  cried:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it! He is  your enemy. Save yourself; he is but a murderer; let him go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I said that; I who  never had a cruel thought before in my life. But he, without looking to see  whence this voice came, answered boldly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;It is because he is my  enemy that I wish to save him. I could never enjoy a safety won at the expense  of his death. Isidor, you must live! So hold on, my cousin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700621h-images/page277.jpg" width="800" height="556"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And without saying  anything further, this brave man set about a task that seemed to me at that  moment not only superhuman but impossible. Gathering himself up, he prepared to  make a spring, and in another instant would have launched himself toward that  rocking beam, if Cecile, driven to extremity by the slow tottering of the floor  upon which we stood, had not shrieked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;And to save him you  would leave us to perish?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He paused and gave one  look. &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;God help you, but you look like innocent women, while  he&mdash;&rsquo; The leap was made. He lay clinging to the beam. His cousin, who had not  fallen, cast one glance up; their eyes met, and Isidor, as he was called, gave  one great sob. &lsquo;Oh, Louis!&rsquo; he murmured, and was silent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And then, mamma, there  began a struggle for rescue such as I dare not even recall. I saw it because I  could not look elsewhere, but I crushed its meaning from my consciousness, lest  I should myself perish before I saw him safe. And all the while the figure  hanging over us swayed with the rocking of the beam, and gave no help until  that last terrible moment when his cousin, reaching down, was able to sustain  him under the arm till he could get his other hand up and clasp it around the  beam. Then it all looked well, and we began to hope, when suddenly and without  warning the nearly rescued man gave a great shriek, and crying, &lsquo;You have  conquered!&rsquo; unloosed his grasp, and fell headlong into the abyss.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mamma, I did not faint.  An unnatural strength seemed given to me. But I looked at the marquis, and for  the first time he looked at me, and I saw the expression of horrified amaze  with which he had beheld his cousin disappear gradually change to one of the  softest and divinest looks that ever visited a noble visage, and knew that even  out of that pit of death love had arisen for us two, and that henceforth we  belonged to each other, whether our span of life should be cut short in a  moment or extended into an eternity of years. His own heart seemed to assure  him of the same sweet fact, for the next moment he was renewing his superhuman  efforts, but this time for our rescue and his own. He worked himself along that  beam; he gave another leap; he landed at our side, and tore a way for us  through that closed door. In another five minutes we were in the street, with  half Paris surging about us, but before the crowd had quite seized upon me, he  had found time to whisper in my ear:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo; &lsquo;I am the Marquis de la  Roche-Guyon. It will always be a matter of thankfulness to me that I was not  left to sacrifice the fairest woman in the world to the rescue of a thankless  coward.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mamma, do you blame me  for giving such a man my heart, and do you wonder that what I have dedicated to  this hero I can never yield to any other man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The mother was  silent&mdash;for a long time silent. Was she horror-stricken at the story of a danger  she had never fully comprehended till now? Or were her thoughts busy with her  own past, and its possible incommunicable secrets of blood and horror? The cry  she gave at last betrayed anguish, but did not answer this question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My child! my child! my  child!&rdquo; That was all, but it seemed torn from her heart, that bled after it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was not long in  seeking me out, mamma, dear. With grace and consideration he paid me his court,  and I was happy till I saw that you and papa frowned upon an alliance that to  me seemed laden with promise. I could not understand it, nor could I understand  our hurried departure from France, nor our secret journey here. All has been a  mystery to me; but your will is my will, and I dare not complain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pure heart!&rdquo; broke from  the mother&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Would to God&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, dear mamma?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That you had been moved  by a lesser man than the Marquis de la Roche-Guyon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A lesser man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With Armand Thierry,  since he is the one you will have to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall not marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shall not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If I cannot give my  hand where my heart is, I remain unmarried. I dishonor no man with unmeaning  marriage vows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I may never be happy,  but I will never be base. You yourself cannot wish me to be that. You, who  married for love, must understand that a woman loses her title to respect when  she utters vows to one man while her heart is with another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You did marry for love,  didn&rsquo;t you, sweet mamma? I like to think so. I like to think that papa never  cared for any other woman in all the world but you, and that from the moment  you first saw him, you knew him to be the one man capable of rousing every  noble instinct within you. It is so sweet to enshrine you in such a pure  romance, mamma. Though you have been married sixteen years&mdash;ah, how old I am!&mdash;I  see you sit and look at papa sometimes, for a long, long time without speaking,  and though you do not smile, I think, &lsquo;She is dreaming of the days when life  was pure joy, because it was pure love,&rsquo; and I long to ask you to tell me about  those days, because I am sure, if you did, you would tell me the sweetest story  of mutual love and devotion. Isn&rsquo;t it so, mamma mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Would that mother  answer? Could she? I seemed to behold her figure pausing petrified in the  darkness, drawing deep breaths, and scarcely knowing whether to curse or pray.  I listened and listened, but it was long before the answer came. Then it was  short and hurried, like the pants of one dying.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora, you hurt me.&rdquo;  Another silence. &ldquo;You make my task too hard. If I know what love is&mdash;&rdquo; She found  it hard to go on; but she did&mdash;&ldquo;all the more anguish it must cost me to deny you  what is so deeply desired. I&mdash;I would make you happy if I could. I will make you  happy if it is in my power to do so, but I can hold out no hope&mdash;none, none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor tell me why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor tell you why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mamma, you suffer. I  see it now, and somehow it makes it easier for me to bear my own suffering. You  do not willfully deny me what is as much as my life to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Willfully! Honora!  Listen.&rdquo; The mother had stopped in her walk, for I heard her restless tread no  more. &ldquo;You say that I suffer, child. I have never had one happy day. Whatever  romance you have woven about me, I have never known, from the hour of my birth  till now, one moment of such delight as you experienced when you saw the  character of the marquis unfold before you so grandly. The nearest I have ever  come to bliss was when you were first placed in my arms. Then, indeed, for one  wild moment, I felt the baptism of true love. I looked at you, and my heart  opened. Alas! it was to take in pain as well as joy. You had the face&mdash; Oh,  Heaven! what am I saying? This darkness unnerves me, Honora. Let us have light,  light, anything to keep my reason from faltering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mother, mother, you are  ill!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I am simply weak. I  always am when I recall your birth and the first few days that followed it. I  was so glad to have something I could really love; so glad to feel that my  heart beat, and to know that it beat for one so innocent, so sweet, so helpless  as yourself. What if I had pains and hours of darkness, did I not have your  smile, also, and, later on, your love? Child, if there has been any good in my  life&mdash;and sometimes I have thought there was a little&mdash;it came from you. So,  never even question again if I could hurt you willfully. I not only could not  do this and live, but to save you from pain I would dare&mdash; What would I not  dare? Let man or angels say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Before such passion as  this young Honora sank helpless.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma, mamma,&rdquo; she  moaned, &ldquo;forgive me. I did not know&mdash;how could I know? Don&rsquo;t sob, mamma, dear;  let me hold you&mdash;so; now lay your cheek against mine and simply love me. I will  lie quite still and ask no questions, and you will rest, too; and God will  bless us, as he always blesses the loving and the true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But madame did not  comply with this endearing request. Satisfying her daughter with a few kisses  and some words that the paroxysm of her grief was past, she resumed her walk up  and down the room, pausing every now and then as if to listen, and hastily  resuming her walk as some slight exclamation from the bed assured her that  mademoiselle was not yet asleep. As these pauses always took place when she was  near the wall behind which I crouched, I frequently heard her breath, which  came heavily, and once the rustle of her gown. But I did not stir. As long as  her uneasy form flitted about the room, I clung to the partition, listening,  determined that nothing should move me&mdash;not even my own terrors. And though  night presently merged into midnight, and the silence and horror of the spot  became frightful, I kept my post, for the stealthy tread continued, and so did  the desultory scraps of conversation, which proved that, if the mother was  waiting for the daughter to sleep, the daughter was equally waiting for the  mother to retire. And so daylight came, and with it exhaustion to more than one  of us three watchers.</p>
  <p align="left">And this is the record  of the first night spent by me in the secret chamber.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    A Surprise For Honora</b></h2>
  <p align="left">October 22, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">EVENTS crowd. This morning  the one girl I have taken into my confidence came to my room with a strange  tale. A stranger had arrived, an elegant young gentleman of foreign appearance,  who had not yet given his name, but who must be a person of importance, if  bearing and address go for anything. He came on horseback, attended by his  valet, and his first word, after some directions in regard to his horse, was a  request to see the landlady. When told she was ill, he asked for the clerk, and  to him was about to put some question, when an exclamation from the doorway  interrupted them. Turning, they saw madame standing there, her face petrified  into an expression of terrified surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; sprang from the  lady&rsquo;s lips before he could finish his exclamation; and advancing, she laid her  hand on his arm, saying, in French, which, by the way, my clerk understands: &ldquo;If  you hope anything from us, do not speak the name that is faltering on your  tongue. For reasons of our own, for reasons of a purely domestic nature, we are  traveling incognito. Let me ask you as a gentleman to humor our whim, and to  know us at present as Madame and Mademoiselle Letellier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He bowed, but flushed  with embarrassment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And mademoiselle? She  is well, I trust?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite well, also. May I  ask what has brought you into these parts, whom we thought in another and  somewhat distant country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Need you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They had drawn a little  apart by this time, and the clerk heard no more; but their manner&mdash;the lady&rsquo;s  especially&mdash;was so singular that he thought I ought to know that she was here  under a false name, and so had sent Margery to me with the news. As for the  gentleman and Madame Letellier, they were still conversing in the lowest tones  together.</p>
  <p align="left">Interested intensely in  this new development in the drama hourly unfolding before my eyes, I dismissed  Margery with an instruction or two, and passed into the hidden chamber, where I  again laid my ear to the wall. The mother would have something to say when she  returned, and I determined to hear what it was.</p>
  <p align="left">I had to wait a long  time, but was rewarded at last by the sound of voices and the distinct  exclamation from the daughter&rsquo;s lips:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma! what has  happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The mother&rsquo;s reply was  delayed, but it came at last:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My face is becoming  strangely communicative. You will read all my thoughts next. What makes you  think anything has happened? Is this a place for occurrences?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma! you cannot  deceive me. Your very limbs are trembling. See, you can hardly stand; and then,  how you look at me! Oh, mamma, dear! is it good news or bad? for from your eyes  it might be either. Has he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He, he&mdash;always he!&rdquo; the  mother passionately interrupted. &ldquo;You do not love your mother. You are thinking  always of one whom you never saw till a year ago. My doubts, my fears, my  sufferings are nothing to you. I might die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush! hush! Whenever  did you speak like this before, mamma? Love you! Did ever a child love her  mother more? But our affection is sure, while that of him you do not like me to  mention is threatened, and its existence forbidden. I cannot help but think,  mamma, and of him. If I could, I were a traitor to the noblest instincts that  sway a woman&rsquo;s heart. I may not marry him&mdash;you say I never will&mdash;but think of him  I must, and pray for him I will, till the last breath has left my lips. So,  what is your news, dear mamma? Has papa written?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is too early for the  mail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True, true. Some one  has come, then; a messenger, perhaps, from New York. M. Dubois&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dubois is a traitor. He  has not kept the secret of our whereabouts. We have to settle with Monsieur and  Madame Dubois, meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Honora, can I trust  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Trust me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! who is trembling  now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I! I! But how can I  help it! You glance toward the door; you seem afraid some one will come.  You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tut! do not mind me!  Answer what I ask. Could you see the marquis&mdash;talk to him, hear him urge his  love and plead for yours, without forgetting that your obedience is mine, and  that you are not to give him so much as the encouragement of a glance, till I  either give you permission to do so or command from you his immediate and  unqualified dismissal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See him?&rdquo; It was all  the poor girl had heard.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes; see him. You have  come from Paris&mdash;why not he? Since Dubois has proved himself a traitor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; came now in  great sobs, &ldquo;you are not playing with me. He has come; he is here; the horse I  heard stop at the door&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was that of the  marquis,&rdquo; acknowledged the mother. &ldquo;He is in the sitting room, child, but he  does not expect you at present. This evening you shall see him if you will  promise me what I have asked. Otherwise he must go. I will have no  complications arising out of a secret betrothal. If you have not sufficient  strength&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I have strength,  mamma! I have strength. Only let me see him, and prove to myself that he is not  worn by trouble and suspense, and I will do all you ask of me. Ah, how well I  feel! What a beautiful&mdash;what a lovely day this is! Must I not go out till  evening? May I not take one wee walk in the garden?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not one, my child. At  nine o&rsquo;clock you may go to the sitting room for a half hour. Till then, think  over what I have said, and prepare your lips to be dumb and your eyes to remain  downcast; for I am firm in my demands, and nothing will make me change them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may trust me.&rdquo;  There was despair in the tones now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
  <p align="left">As they talked but  little after this, and as I was greatly interested in seeing the young man who  had been heralded by such glowing descriptions, I stole back to my room, and,  putting on a green shade, hastened to join my guests in the front part of the  house. One glance from beneath my hurriedly uplifted shade was sufficient to  assure me as to which of the gentlemen there assembled was the one I sought. So  frank a face, so fine a form, so attractive a manner, were not often seen in my  inn, and prepossessed at once in his favor, I advanced to the owner of all  these graces, and, calling him by name, bade him welcome to my house.</p>
  <p align="left">He must understand our  language well, for he immediately turned with gentle urbanity, and discerning,  perhaps, something in my face which assured him of my sympathy and respect,  entered into a fluent conversation with me that at once increased my admiration  and awakened my pity. For I saw that his nature was strong and his feelings  deep, and as the future could have nothing but shame and misery, I  instinctively felt oppressed by the fate which awaited him.</p>
  <p align="left">He did not seem to feel  any apprehension himself. His eyes were bright; his smile beaming; his bearing  full of hope. Now and then his glance would steal toward the door or through  the open windows, as if he longed to catch a glimpse of some passing face or  form; and at last, swayed by that sympathy which we women all feel for true  love in man or woman, I asked him to accompany me into the garden, promising  him a view that would certainly delight him. As the garden was plainly visible  from the oak parlor, you can readily understand to what view I alluded. But he  had no suspicion of my meaning, and followed me with some reluctance.</p>
  <p align="left">But his aspect changed  materially when, in walking up and down the paths, I casually remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is the least  inhabited side of the inn. Only one room is occupied, and that by two  foreigners&mdash;Madame and Mademoiselle Letellier. Yet it has a pleasant outlook, as  you yourself can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is she&mdash;are they behind  those windows?&rdquo; he asked, with an impetuosity I could not but admire in a man  with so much to recommend him to the consideration of others. &ldquo;I beg your  pardon,&rdquo; he added, a moment later, after a stolen glance at the house. &ldquo;I know  those ladies, and anything in connection with them is interesting to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I believed it, and had  hard work to hide my secret trouble. But his preoccupation assisted me, and at  length I found courage to remark:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They are from Paris, I  understand. A fine woman, Madame Letellier. Must be much admired in her own  land?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He seemed to have no  reason for resenting my curiosity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; was his quick  reply. &ldquo;She is not only admired, but respected. I have never heard her name  mentioned but with honor. I am happy to be known as her friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I gave him one quick  look. Good God! What lay before this man! And he so unconscious! I felt like  wishing the inn would fall to atoms before our eyes, crushing beneath it the  sin of the past and his false hopes for the future. He saw nothing. He was  smiling upon a rose which he had plucked and was holding in his hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This inn is one of the  antiquities,&rdquo; I now observed, anxious to know if any hint of its secrets had  ever reached his ears. &ldquo;They say it is one of the first structures reared on  the river. Have you ever heard any of the traditions connected with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;The  Happy-Go-Lucky is quite a stranger to me. You cherish up all its legends,  though, I have no doubt. Are there any tales of ghosts among them? I can easily  imagine certain disembodied spirits wandering through its narrow halls and up  and down its winding staircases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What spirits?&rdquo; I asked,  convinced, however, by his manner that he was talking at random, with the  probable aim of prolonging our walk within view of the window behind which his  darling might stand concealed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Madame must inform me.  I have too little acquaintance with this country to venture among its  traditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is a story,&rdquo; I  began; but here a finely modulated but piercing voice rang musically down the  paths from the house, and we heard:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your eyes will  certainly suffer, Mrs. Truax, if you let the hot sun glare upon them so  mercilessly.&rdquo; And, turning, we saw madame&rsquo;s smiling face looking from her  casement with a meaning that struck us both dumb and led me to shorten our walk  lest my interest in the romance then going on should be suspected and my  usefulness thus become abridged.</p>
  <p align="left">Was it to forestall my  suspicions, rid herself of my vigilance, or to insure herself against any  forgetfulness on her daughter&rsquo;s part, that madame, some two hours later, sent  me the following note:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dear  Mrs. Truax: I can imagine that after your walk in the blazing sunlight  you do not feel very well this evening. I must nevertheless request of you a  favor, my need being great and you being the only person who can assist me. The  Marquis de la Roche-Guyon, with whom I saw you promenading, has come to this  place with the express intention of paying court to my daughter. As I am not  prepared to frown upon his suit, and equally unprepared to favor it, I do not  feel at liberty to refuse him the pleasure of an interview with my daughter,  and yet do not desire them to enjoy such an interview alone. As I am ill, quite  ill, with a sudden and excruciating attack of pain in my right hip, may I ask  if you will fulfill the office of chaperon for me, and, without embarrassment  to either party, take such measures as will prevent an absolute confidence  between them, till I have obtained the sanction of my husband to an intimacy  which I myself dare not encourage?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very truly your debtor,  if you accomplish this,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madame Letellier.&rdquo;</p>

    In The Secret Chamber</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Have only twenty-four  hours elapsed? Is it but yesternight that all the terrible events took place,  the memory of which are now making my frame tremble? So the clock says, and yet  how hard it is to believe it. Madame Letellier&mdash; But I will preserve my old  method. I will not anticipate events, but relate them as they occurred.</p>
  <p align="left">To go back then to the  note which I received from madame. I did not like it. I did not see its  consistency, and I did not mean to be its dupe. If she intended remaining in  the oak parlor, then over the oak parlor I would keep watch; for from her alone  breathed whatever danger there might be for any of us, and to her alone did I  look for the explanation of her mysterious presence in a spot that should have  held a thousand repellent forces for her and hers. As for her sudden illness,  that was nonsense. She was as well as I was myself. Had I not seen her standing  at the window an hour or two before?</p>
  <p align="left">But here I made a  mistake. Madame was really ill, as I presently had occasion to observe. For not  only was a physician summoned, but word came that she wished to see me, also;  and when I went to her room I found her in bed, her face pallid and distorted  with pain, and her whole aspect betraying the greatest physical suffering.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a rheumatic  attack, affecting mainly her right limb, and made her so helpless that, for a  moment, I stood aghast at what looked to me like a dispensation of Providence.  But in another instant I began to doubt again; for though I knew it was beyond  anybody&rsquo;s power to simulate the suffering under which she evidently labored, I  was made to feel, by her penetrating and restless looks, that her mind retained  its hold upon its purpose, whatever that purpose might be, and that for me to  relax my vigilance now would be to give her an advantage that would be  immediately seized upon.</p>
  <p align="left">I therefore held my  sympathies in check; and, while acting the part of the solicitous landlady,  watched for that glance or word which should reveal her secret intentions. Her  daughter, whose eyes were streaming with tears, stood over her like a pitying  angel, and not till we had done all we could to relieve her mother, and subdue  her pain, did she allow her longing eyes to turn toward the clock that beat out  the passing moments with mechanical precision. It was just a quarter to nine.</p>
  <p align="left">The mother saw that  glance, and hid her face for a moment; then she took mademoiselle by the hand,  and drawing her down to her, whispered audibly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I expect you to keep  your appointment. Mrs. Truax will send one of the girls to sit with me.  Besides, I feel better, and as if I could sleep. Only remember your promise, dear.  No look, no hint of your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mademoiselle flushed  scarlet. Stealing a look at me, she drew back embarrassed, but oh! how joyous.  I felt my old heart quiver as I surveyed her, and in spite of the dread form of  the redoubtable woman stretched before me, in spite of the grewsome room and  its more than grewsome secrets, something of the fairy light of love seemed to  fall upon my spirit and lift the darkness from the place for one short and  glowing moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look in the glass,&rdquo; the  mother now commanded. &ldquo;You need to tie up your curls again and to put a fresh  flower at your throat. I do not wish you to show weariness. Mrs. Truax&rdquo;&mdash;these  words to me in low tones, as her daughter withdrew to the other side of the  room&mdash;&ldquo;you received my note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I nodded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will do what I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I nodded again.  Deliberate falsehood it was, but I showed no faltering.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I will excuse you  now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I rose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And do not send any one  to me. I wish to sleep, and another&rsquo;s presence would disturb me. See, the pain  is almost gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She did look better.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your wishes shall be  regarded,&rdquo; I assured her. &ldquo;If you do feel worse, ring this bell and Margery  will notify me.&rdquo; And placing the bell rope near her hand, I drew back and  presently quitted the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Lingering in the hall  just long enough to see the lovely Honora flit across the threshold of the  sitting-room which I had purposely ordered vacant for her use, I hurried to my  room.</p>
  <p align="left">It was dark, dark as the  secret chamber into which I now stole with the lightest and wariest of steps.  Horror, gloom, and apprehension were in the air, which brooded stiflingly in  the narrow spot, and had it not been for the righteous purpose sustaining me, I  should have fallen at this critical moment, crushed beneath the terrible weight  of my own feelings.</p>
  <p align="left">But one who has to  listen, straining every faculty to catch the purport of what is going on behind  an impenetrable wall, soon forgets himself and his own sensations. As I pressed  my ear to the wall and caught the sound of a prolonged and painful stir within,  I only thought of following the movements of madame, who, I was now sure, had  left her bed and was dragging herself, with what difficulty and distress I  could but faintly judge by the involuntary groans which now and then left her,  across the floor toward the door, the key of which I presently heard turn.</p>
  <p align="left">This done, a heavy  silence followed, then the slow, dragging sound began again, interrupted now by  weary pants and heavy sobs that at first chilled me and then shook me with such  fear that it was with difficulty that I could retain my place against the wall.  She was crawling in my direction, and at each instant I heard the pants grow  louder.</p>
  <p align="left">I gradually withdrew,  step by step, till I found myself pressed up against the wall in the remotest  corner I could find. And here was I standing, enveloped in darkness and dread,  when the sounds changed to that of a shuddering, rushing noise which I had  heard once before in my life, and from a narrow gap through which the faint  light in the room beyond dimly shone in a thread of lesser darkness, the  aperture grew, till I could feel rather than see her form, crawling, not  walking, through the opening, and hear, distinct enough, her horrible, gurgling  tones as she murmured:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall have to grope  for what I want&mdash;touch it, feel it, for I cannot see. O God! O God! What horror!  What punishment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Nearer, nearer over the  floor she came, dragging her useless limb behind her. Her outstretched arm  groped, groped about the floor, while I stood trembling and agonized with  horror till her hand touched the skirt of my dress, when, with a great shriek  of suddenly liberated feeling, I pushed her from me, and crying out, &ldquo;Murderess!  do you seek the bones of your victim?&rdquo; I flung open the door against which I  stood and let the light from my own room stream in upon us two.</p>
  <p align="left">Her face as I saw it at  that moment has never left my memory. She had fallen in a heap at my first  move, and now lay crushed before me, with only her wide-staring eyes and  shaking lips to tell me that she lived.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You thought I did not  know you,&rdquo; I burst forth. &ldquo;You thought, because I had never seen your face, you  could come back here, bringing your innocent daughter with you, and cast  yourself into the very atmosphere of your crime without awakening the suspicion  of the woman whose house you had made a sepulcher of for so many years. But  crime was written too plainly on your brow. The spirit of Honora Urquhart,  breaking the bounds of this room, has walked ever beside you, and I knew you  from the first moment that you strayed down this hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Broken sounds,  unintelligible murmurings, were all that greeted me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are punished,&rdquo; I  went on, &ldquo;in the misery of your daughter. Nemesis has reached you. The blood of  Honora Urquhart has called aloud from these walls, and not yourself only, but  the still viler being whose name you have so falsely shared, must answer to man  and God for the life you so heartlessly sacrificed and the rights you so  falsely usurped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; came in one  quick gasp from the crushed heap of humanity before me.</p>
  <p align="left">But I was inexorable. I  remembered Honora Urquhart&rsquo;s sweet face, and at that moment could think of  nothing else. So I went on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have had years of  triumph. You have borne your victim&rsquo;s name, worn your victim&rsquo;s clothes, sported  with your victim&rsquo;s money. And he, her husband, has looked on and smiled. Day  after day, month after month, year after year, you have gone in and out before  your friends, unmolested and unafraid; but God&rsquo;s vengeance, though it halts, is  sure and keen. Across land and across water the memories of this room have  drawn you, and not content with awakening suspicion, you must make suspicion  certainty by moving a spring unknown even to myself, and entering this spot,  from which the bones of your victim were taken only two months ago, Marah Leighton!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moved by the name, she  stood up. Tottering and agonized with pain, but firm once more and determined,  she towered before me, her face turned toward the room she had left, her hand  lifted, her whole attitude that of one listening.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a knock, a faint,  low, trembling knock that we heard, then the word &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo; came in muffled  accents from the hallway.</p>
  <p align="left">A convulsion crossed the  countenance of the miserable woman before me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, God! my daughter,  my daughter!&rdquo; she cried. And falling at my feet, she groveled in anguish as she  pleaded:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you kill her? She  knows nothing, suspects nothing. The whole fifteen years of her life are pure.  She is a flower. I love her&mdash;I love her, though she looks like the woman I hated  and killed. She bears her name&mdash;why, I do not know&mdash;I could not call her anything  else; she is my living reproach, and yet I love her. Do you not see it was for  her I crossed the water, for her I plunged my living hand into this tomb to  learn if our secret had ever been discovered, and if there was any hope that  she might yet be made happy? Ah, woman, woman, you are not a wretch&mdash;a demon!  You will not sentence this innocent soul to disgrace and misery. Even if I must  die&mdash;and I swear that I will die if you say so&mdash;leave to my child her hopes; keep  secret my sin, and take the blessing of the most miserable being that crawls  upon the earth, as a solace for your old age. Hear me; hear a wretched mother&rsquo;s  plea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; I  broke in. &ldquo;Even were I silent there are others upon your track. I doubt if your  husband does not already know that the day of his prosperity is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She gave a low cry, and  tottered from the place. Entering her own room, she threw herself upon the bed.  I followed, drawing the curtains about her. Then closing the door of  communication between the oak parlor and the chamber beyond, I passed to the  door behind which we could yet hear her daughter&rsquo;s soft voice calling, and,  unlocking it, let the radiant creature in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I  could not keep my word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But here I held up my  hand, and drawing her softly out, told her that her mother needed rest just  now, and that if she would come to my room for a little while it would be best;  and so prevailed upon her that she promised to do what I asked, though I saw  her cast longing glances through the partly opened door toward the somber bed  so like a tomb, and which at that moment was a tomb, had she known it&mdash;a tomb of  hope, of joy, of peace for evermore.</p>
  <p align="left">I was just going out,  when a slight stir detained me. Looking back, I saw a hand thrust out from  between the falling curtains. Just a hand, but how eloquent it was! Pointing it  out to mademoiselle, I said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s hand.  Give it a kiss, mademoiselle, but do not part the curtains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She smiled and crossed  to that ominous bed. Kneeling, she kissed the hand, which thereupon raised  itself and rested on her head. In another instant it was drawn slowly away,  and, with a startled look, the half-weeping daughter rose and glided again to  my side.</p>
  <p align="left">As I closed the door I  thought of those words: &ldquo;And the sins of the father shall be visited upon the  children to the third and fourth generation.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    The Marquis</b></h2>
  <p align="left">But the events of the  night are not over. As soon as I had seen mademoiselle comfortably ensconced in  my old room up stairs, I returned to the sitting room, where the marquis still  lingered. He was standing in the window when I entered, and turned with quite a  bright face to greet me. But that brightness soon vanished as he met my glance,  and it was with something like dismay that he commented upon my paleness, and  asked if I were ill.</p>
  <p align="left">I told him I was ill at  ease; that events of a most serious nature were transpiring in the house; that  he was concerned in them heavily, grievously; that I could not rest till I had  taken him into my confidence, and shown him upon what a precipice he was  standing.</p>
  <p align="left">He evidently considered  me demented, but as he looked at me longer, and noted my steady and unflinching  gaze, he gradually turned pale, and uttered, in irrepressible anxiety, the one  word&mdash;&ldquo;Honora!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Urquhart is well,&rdquo;  I began, &ldquo;and is as ignorant as yourself of the shadows that hover over her.  She is all innocence and truth, sir. Honor, candor and purity dwell in her  heart, and happiness in her eyes. Yet is that happiness threatened by the worst  calamity that can befall a sensitive human being, and if you hold her in  esteem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ma foi!&rdquo; he broke in, with  violent impetuosity. &ldquo;I do not esteem her; I love her. What are these dreadful  secrets? How is her happiness threatened? Tell me without hesitation, for I  have entreated her to be my wife, and she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She thinks it is a  parent&rsquo;s whim, alone, which keeps her from responding fully to your wishes,&rdquo; I  finished. &ldquo;But madame&rsquo;s objections have deeper ground than that. Miserable  woman as she is, she has some idea of honor left. She knew her daughter could  not safely marry into a high and noble family, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is this you say?&rdquo;  came again in the quick and hurried tones of despair. &ldquo;Mrs. Urquhart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I broke in. &ldquo;You  call her Mrs. Urquhart, but she has no claim to that title. She and Edwin  Urquhart have never been married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He recoiled sharply,  with a gesture of complete disbelief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he  demanded. &ldquo;They are strangers to you. I have known them in their own home. All  the world credits their marriage, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All the world does not  know what transpired in this house sixteen years ago, when Edwin Urquhart  stopped here with his bride on his way to France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He stared, seemed  shaken, but presently hastened to remark:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, madame, you  acknowledge that she is his wife. You said bride. One does not call a woman by  that name without acknowledging a marriage service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The woman he brought  here was his bride. Edwin Urquhart is no common criminal, Marquis de la Roche-Guyon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was hard to make him  understand. It was hard to undermine his trust, step by step, inch by inch,  till he found no hope, no shred of doubt to cling to. But it had to be done. If  only to avert worse calamities and more heart-rending scenes, he must know at  once, and before he took another step in relation to Miss Urquhart, just what  her position was, and to what shame and suffering he was subjecting himself by  accepting her love and pledging his own.</p>
  <p align="left">The task was not done  till I had shown him this diary of mine, and related all that had just occurred  in the room below. Then, indeed, he seemed to comprehend his position, and  completely crushed and horror-stricken, subsided into a dreadful silence before  me, the lines of years coming into his face as I watched him, till he became  scarcely recognizable for the lordly and light-hearted cavalier whose dreams of  love I had so fearfully interrupted some half hour or so before. From this  lethargy of despair I did not seek to rouse him. I knew when he had anything to  say he would speak, and till he had faced the situation and had made up his  mind to his duty, I could wait his decision with perfect confidence in his fine  nature and nice sense of honor.</p>
  <p align="left">You may, therefore,  imagine my feelings when, after a long delay&mdash;an hour at least&mdash;he suddenly  remarked:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have been a proud  family. From time immemorial we have held ourselves aloof from whatever could  be thought to stain our honor or impeach our good name. I cannot drag the  unfathomable disgrace of all these crimes into a record so pure as that of the  Roche-Guyon race. Though I had wished to bestow upon my wife a name and  position of which she could be proud, I must content myself with merely giving  her the comfort of a true heart and such support as can be provided by a loving  but unaccustomed hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Marquis&mdash;&rdquo; I commenced.</p>
  <p align="left">But he cut my words  short with a firm and determined gesture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My name is Louis de  Fontaine,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Henceforth my cousin will be known as the marquis. It  is the least I can do for the old French honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&lsquo;Twas so simply, so  determinedly done that I stood aghast as much at the serenity of his manner as  the act which required such depth of sacrifice from one of his traditions and  rearing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you continue to  consider yourself the suitor of Miss Urquhart,&rdquo; I stammered. &ldquo;You will marry  her, though her parents may be called upon to perish upon the scaffold in an  ignominy as great as ever befell two guilty mortals?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The answer came  brokenly, but with unwavering strength:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you not say that  she was innocent? Is she to be crushed beneath the guilt of her parents? Am I  to take the last prop from one so soon to be bereft of all the supports upon  which she has leaned from infancy? If I cling to her, she may live through her  horror and shame; but should I fail her&mdash;great heavens! would we not have  another life to answer for before God? Besides,&rdquo; he added, with the simplicity  which marked his whole bearing, &ldquo;I love her. I could not do otherwise if I  would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To this final word I  could make no rejoinder. With a reverence unmingled with the taint of  compassion, I took my departure, and being anxious by this time to know how my  young charge was bearing her seclusion, I went to the room where I had left  her, and softly opened the door.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    Mark Felt</b></h2>
  <p align="left">SUBJECTED as I have been  in the last three hours to distress and turmoil, I was delighted to find  mademoiselle asleep, and to behold her peaceful face. Gazing at it, and noting  the happy smile which unconsciously lingered on her lips, I could not but feel  that, despite the hideous revelations which lay before her, her lot was an  enviable one, allied as it promised to be with that of one of such high  principles as the marquis. Though I am old now and have had my day, the love of  the innocent and pure is sacred to me, and in this case it certainly has the  charm of a spotless lily blooming in the jaws of hell.</p>
  <p align="left">As it was late and I was  almost exhausted, I began to think of rest. But my uneasiness in regard to  madame would not let me sleep till I had made another visit to her room. So,  leaving the gentle sleeper lapped in serenest dreams, I proceeded to descend  once more. As I passed the great clock on the stairs, I noticed that it was  almost midnight and began to hasten my steps, when I heard a loud knock at the  front door.</p>
  <p align="left">This is not an  infrequent sound with us, but it greatly startled me this night. I even  remember pausing and looking helplessly up and down the hall, as if it were a  question whether I should obey the unwelcome summons. But such knocking as  speedily followed could not be long ignored. So, subduing my impatience, I  hastened to the door, and unlocking it, threw it open. A gust of rain and wind  greeted me.</p>
  <p align="left">This was my first  surprise, for I had not even noticed that the weather was unpleasant, so  completely had I been absorbed by what had been going on in the house. My next  was the bearing and appearance of the stranger who demanded my hospitality. For  though both face and form were unknown to me, there was that in his aspect  which stirred recollections not out of keeping with the unhappy subject then  occupying all my thoughts. Yet I could not speak his name, or put into words  the anticipations that vaguely agitated me, and led him through the hall and  into the comfortable sitting room so lately vacated by the marquis, with no  more distinct impression in my mind than that something was about to happen  which would complete rather than interrupt the horrors of this eventful night.</p>
  <p align="left">And when the light fell  full upon him, and I could see his eager eyes, this feeling increased, and no  sooner had his cloak fallen from his shoulders and his hat left his head, than  I recognized the prominent jaw and earnest face, and putting no curb on my  impetuosity, I exclaimed at once, and without a doubt:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Felt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The utterance of this  name seemed to cause no surprise to my new guest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and  you are Mrs. Truax, of course. Mr. Tamworth has described you to me, also this  inn, till I feel as if I knew its every stone. I did not wish to visit it, but  I could not help myself. An unknown influence has been drawing me here for  days, and though I resisted it with all my strength, it finally became so  powerful that I rose from my bed at night, saddled my horse, and started in  this direction. I have been twenty hours on the road, but part of these I have  spent in the thicket just over against you on the opposite side of the road.  For the sight of the house awakened in my mind such a disturbance that I feared  to show myself at the door. A voice out of the air seemed to cry, &lsquo;Not yet! not  yet!&rsquo; Nevertheless I could not go back nor leave the spot, which, once seen,  possessed for me a fatal fascination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I was speechless. Good  God! were the old psychological influences at work, and had they acted upon him  at forty miles distance?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You come from Albany?&rdquo;  I at last stammered forth. &ldquo;You must have had a wet time of it; it storms  heavily, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Storms?&rdquo; he repeated,  glancing at the cloak he had thrown off. &ldquo;Great Heaven! my cloak is saturated,  and I did not even know it rained. A touch of the old spell,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Something  is about to happen to me; something has drawn me with purpose to this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I felt awe-struck. Would  he guess next what that something was?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he  went on, with the abstracted air of one recalling an experience, &ldquo;I felt a pang  shoot through my breast. I had been looking steadfastly at these walls, and  somewhere about the building a light seemed to go out, for a pall of darkness  suddenly settled upon it, simultaneously with the cessation of that imaginary  cry which had hitherto detained me. Where was that light, Mrs. Truax, and what  has happened here that I should feel myself called upon to cross this threshold  to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I did not answer at  once, for I was trembling. Was I to be subjected to another such an ordeal as I  had experienced earlier in the evening and be forced to prepare, by such means  as lay in my power, a much abused man for a most dreadful revelation? It began  to look so.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What has called me  here?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Danger to her or death to him? They are thousands of miles  away, and Tamworth could not have yet reached them, but peril of some deadly  nature menaces them, I know. A stroke has gone home to him or her, and it is in  this place I am to learn it; is it not so, Mrs. Truax?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I tremblingly  assented. &ldquo;There is a gentleman here from France who may be able to tell you  something of the man and the woman you mean. Would it affect you very much to  hear disastrous news of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; he  answered; &ldquo;it should not. Mr. Tamworth tells me that he has acquainted you with  the story of my life. Do you think I should feel overwhelmed at any retribution  following a crime that was committed almost as much against me as against the  pure and noble being who was the visible sufferer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shrink from  answering,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;the human heart is a curious thing. If he alone were  to suffer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, he!&rdquo; was the bitter  ejaculation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or if she,&rdquo; I  proceeded, &ldquo;were bound by no ties appealing to the sympathies! But she is a  mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I had not thought it  would affect him so, and stood appalled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A mother!&rdquo; he repeated;  &ldquo;she! she! the tigress, the heartless one, with no more soul than the naked  dagger I should have plunged into her breast and did not! Great Heaven! and  this child has lived, I suppose; is grown up and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is the sweetest,  purest, most unworldly of beautiful women that these eyes have ever rested  upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I thought he would  spring upon me, he leaned forward with so much impetuosity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he  asked, and my heart stood still at the question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because I have seen  her,&rdquo; I presently rejoined. &ldquo;Because I have had opportunities for studying her  heart. She is called Honora, and she is like Miss Dudleigh, only more beautiful  and with more claims to what is called character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He did not seem to take  in my words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have been to  France?&rdquo; he declared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I corrected; &ldquo;Miss  Urquhart has been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He fell back, then  started forward again, opened his lips and stared wildly, half fearfully about  the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; he repeated,  evidently overcome at the idea. &ldquo;Why did they send her here? I should as soon  have expected them to send her into the murk of the bottomless pit. A girl, an  innocent girl, you say, and sent here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They had reason;  besides, she did not come alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This time he understood  me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;she  in the house. I might have known it,&rdquo; he went on more calmly; &ldquo;I did, only I  would not believe it. Her crime has drawn her to the place of its perpetration.  She could not resist the magnetic influence which all places of blood have upon  the guilty. She has come back! And he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I shook my head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The man had less  courage,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;Perhaps because he was more guilty; perhaps because he  had less love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was love for the daughter  which drew the mother here, not the spell of her crime or the accusing spirit  of the dead. The woman who wronged you has some heart; she was willing to risk  detection, and with it her reputation and life, to see if by any possibility  she could venture to give happiness to the one being whom she really loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Explain; I do not  understand. How could she hope to find happiness for her child here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By settling the  question which evidently tortured her. By determining once for all whether the  crime of sixteen years back had ever been discovered, and if she found it had  not, to satisfy at once her own pride and her daughter&rsquo;s heart by giving that  daughter to as noble a gentleman as ever carried a sword.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And they are here now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They are here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And she has discovered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The futility of all her  hopes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He drew back, and his  heavy breath echoed in deep pants through the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What an end for Marah  Leighton!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What an end! And she is  here!&rdquo; he went on, after a moment of silent emotion&mdash;&ldquo;under this roof! No wonder  I felt myself called hither. And she knows her crime is detected? How came she  to know this? Did you recognize her and tell her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I recognized her and  told her. There was no other course. We met in the secret chamber, whither she  had come to make her own terrible investigations; and the sight of her there,  on the spot where she had left the innocent to die, was too much for my sense  of justice. I accused her to her face, and she crouched before me as under the  lash. There was no possibility of denial after that, and she now lies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he cried,  catching me painfully by the arm. &ldquo;When was this day? To-day&mdash;to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His brow took on a look  of awe.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;she  has power over me yet. When her hope broke, something snapped within me here. I  abhor her, but I feel her grief. She was once all the world to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I recognized his right  to emotion, and did not profane it by any words of mine. Instead of that I  sought to leave him, but he would not let me go till he had asked me another  question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the daughter?&rdquo; he  urged. &ldquo;Does she know of the opprobrium which must fall upon her head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She sleeps,&rdquo; I replied,  &ldquo;with a smile of the shyest delight upon her lips. Her lover has followed her  to this place, and the last words she heard to-night were those of his  devotion. Her suffering must come to-morrow; yet it will be mitigated, for he  will not forsake her, whatever shame may follow his loyalty. I have his word  for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then the earth holds  two lovers,&rdquo; was Mark Felt&rsquo;s rejoinder. &ldquo;I thought it held but one.&rdquo; And with a  sigh he let go my arm and turned to the window, with its background of driving  rain and pitiless flashes of lightning.</p>
  <p align="left">I took the opportunity  to excuse myself for a few minutes, and hurrying again into the hall, hastened,  with nervous fear and an agitation greatly heightened by the unexpected  interview I had just been through, to the now oft-opened door leading into the  oak parlor.</p>
  <p align="left">I found it closed but  not locked, and pushing it open, listened for a moment, then took a glance  within. All was quiet and ghostly. A single candle guttering on the table at  one end of the room lent a partial light by which I could discern the funereal  bed and the other heavy and desolate-looking articles of furniture with which  the room was encumbered. Honora&rsquo;s flowers, withering on the window seat, spoke  of tender hopes not yet vanished from her tender dreams, but elsewhere all was  hard, all was dreary, all was inexorably forbidding and cold. I shuddered as I  looked, and shuddered still more as I approached the bed and paused firmly  before it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Madame Letellier&rdquo;&mdash;it  was the only name by which I could bring myself to address her at that instant&mdash;&ldquo;there  is one gleam of brightness in your sky. The marquis knows the story of your  guilt, yet consents to marry your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I received no reply.</p>
  <p align="left">Shaken by fresh doubts,  and moved by an inexplicable terror, I stood still for a moment gathering up my  strength, then I repeated my words, this time with sharp emphasis and scarcely  concealed importunity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the  marquis knows your guilt, yet consents to marry your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But the silence within  remained unbroken, and not a movement displaced the somber falling curtains.</p>
  <p align="left">Agitated beyond  endurance, I stretched forth my hands and drew those curtains aside. An  unexpected sight met my eyes. There was no madame there; the bed was empty.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    For The Last Time</b></h2>
  <p align="left">My eyes turned  immediately in the direction of the secret chamber. Its entrance was closed,  but I knew she was hidden there as well as if the door had been open and I had  seen her.</p>
  <p align="left">What should I do? For a  moment I hesitated, then I rushed from the room and hastened back to Mr. Felt.  I found him standing with his face to the door, eagerly awaiting my return.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he  asked, importunately. &ldquo;Your face is as pale as death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because death is in the  house. Madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lies not in her bed,  nor is she to be found in her room. There is another place, however, in which  instinct tells me we shall find her, and if we do, we shall find her dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In her daughter&rsquo;s room?  At her daughter&rsquo;s bedside?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; in the secret  chamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He gazed at me with wild  and haggard aspect.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he  hoarsely assented. &ldquo;Let us go; let us seek her; it may not be too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The entrance to this  hidden room was closed, as I have said, and as I had never assisted at its  opening, I did not know where to find the hidden spring by means of which the  panel was moved. We had, therefore, to endure minutes of suspense while Mr. Felt  fumbled at the wainscoting. The candle I held shook with my agitation, and  though I had heard nothing of the storm before, it seemed now as if every gust  which came swooping down upon the house tore its way through my shrinking  consciousness with a force and menace that scattered the last remnant of  self-possession. Not an instant in the whole terrible day had been more  frightful to me, no, not the moment when I first heard the sliding of this very  panel and the sound of her crawling form approaching me through the darkness.  The vivid flashes of lightning that shot every now and then through the cracks  of the closely shuttered window, making a skeleton of its framework, added not  a little to its terror, there being no other light in the room save that and  the flickering, almost dying flame, with which I strove to aid Mr. Felt&rsquo;s  endeavors and only succeeded in lighting up his anxious and heavily bedewed  forehead.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; was my moan; &ldquo;this  is terrible! Let us quit it or go around to my own room, where there is an open  door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But he did not hear me.  His efforts had become frantic, and he tore at the wainscoting as if he would  force it open by main strength.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You cannot reach her  that way,&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;Perhaps my hand may be more skillful. Let me try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But he only increased  his efforts. &ldquo;I am coming, Marah; I am coming!&rdquo; he called, and at once, as if  guided by some angel&rsquo;s touch, his fingers slipped upon the spring. Immediately  it yielded, and the opening so eagerly sought for was made.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;go  in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And so it was that the  fate which had forced me against my will, and in despite of such intense  shrinking, to pass so frequently into that hideous spot, where death held its  revel and Nemesis awaited her victim, drove me thither once again, and, as I  now hope, for the last time. For, there upon the floor, and almost in the same  spot where we had found lying the remains of innocent Honora Urquhart, we saw,  as my premonition had told me we should, the outstretched form of the unhappy  being who had usurped her place in life, and now, in retribution of that act,  had laid her head down upon the same couch in death. She was pulseless and  quite cold. Upon her mouth her left hand lay pressed, as if, with her last  breath, she sought to absorb the pure kiss which had been left there by the  daughter she so much loved.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    A Last Word</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Did Marah Leighton will  the coming of her old lover to my inn on that fatal night? That is the question  I asked, when, with the first breaking of the morning light, I discovered lying  on the table under an empty phial, a letter addressed, not to her husband, nor  to her child, but to him, Mark Felt. It is a question that will never be  answered, but I know that he comforts himself with the supposition, and allows  the trembling hope to pass, at times, across his troubled spirit, that in the  bitterness of those last hours some touch of the divine mercy may have moved  her soul and made her fitter for his memory to dwell upon.</p>
  <p align="left">The letter I afterward  read. It was as follows:</p>
  <p align="left">To the Man Who Gave All,  Bore All, and Reaped Nothing but Suffering:</p>
  <p align="left">I am not worthy to write  you, even with the prospect of death before me. But an influence I do not care  to combat drives me to make you, of all men, the confidant of my remorse.</p>
  <p align="left">I did not perish sixteen  years ago in the Hudson River. I lived to share in and profit by a crime that  has left an indelible stain upon my life and an ineffaceable darkness within my  soul. You know, or soon will know, what that crime was and how we prospered in  it. Daring as it was dreadful, I heard its fearful details planned by his lips,  without a shudder, because I was mad in those days, mad for wealth, mad for  power, mad for adventure. The only madness I did not feel was love. This I say  to comfort a pride that must have been sorely wounded in those days, as sorely  wounded as your heart.</p>
  <p align="left">Edwin Urquhart could  make my eyes shine and my blood run swiftly, but not so swiftly as to make me  break my troth with you, had he not sworn to me that through him I should gain  what moved me more than any man&rsquo;s love. How he was to accomplish this I could  not see in the beginning, and was so little credulous of his being able to keep  his oaths that I let myself be drawn by you almost to the church door.</p>
  <p align="left">But I got no further.  There in the crowd he stood with a command in his eyes which forbade any  further advance. Though I comprehended nothing then, I obeyed his look and went  back, for my heart was not in any marriage, and it was in the hopes to which  his looks seemed to point. Later he told me what those hopes were. He had been  down to Long Island, and, while there, had chanced to hear in some tavern of  the Happy-Go-Lucky Inn and its secret chamber, and he saw, or thought he saw,  how he could make me his without losing the benefit of an alliance with Miss  Dudleigh. And I thought I saw also, and entered into his plans, though they  comprised crime and entailed horrors upon me from which woman naturally  shrinks. I was hard as the nether millstone of which the Bible speaks, and went  determinedly on in the path of dissimulation and crime which had been marked  out for me, till we came to this inn. Then, owing, perhaps, to my long  imprisonment in the dreadful box, I began to feel qualms of physical fear and  such harrowing mental forebodings that more than once during that terrible  evening I came near shouting for release.</p>
  <p align="left">But I was held back by  apprehensions as great as any from which a premature release from my place of  hiding could have freed me. I dared not face Honora, and I dared not subject  Edwin Urquhart to the consequences of a public recognition of our perfidy, and  so I let my opportunity go by, and became the sharer, as I was already the  instigator, of the unheard-of crime by which I became, in the eyes of the  world, his wife.</p>
  <p align="left">What I suffered during  its perpetration no word of mine can convey. I cringed to her moans; I shook  under the blow that stifled them. And when all was over, and the bolts which  confined me were shot back, and I found myself once more on my feet and in the  free air of this most horrible of rooms, I looked about, not for him, but her,  and when I did not see her or any token of her death, I was seized by such an  agony of revulsion that I uttered a great and irrepressible cry which filled  the house, and brought more than one startled inquirer to our door.</p>
  <p align="left">For retribution and  remorse were already busy within me, and in the lurking shadows about the  fireplace I thought I saw the long and narrow slit made by the half-closed  panel standing open between me and the secret place of her entombment. And  though it was but an optical delusion, the panel being really closed, it might  as well have been the truth, for I have never been able to rid myself of the  sight of that chimerical strip of darkness, with its suggestions of guilt and death.  It haunted my vision; it ruined my life; it destroyed my peace. If I shut my  eyes at night, it opened before me. If I arrayed myself in jewels and rich  raiment, and paused to take but a passing look at myself in the glass, this  horror immediately came between me and my own image, blotting the vision of  wealth from my eyes; so that I went into the homes of the noble or the courts  of the king a clouded, miserable thing, seeing nothing but that black and  narrow slit closing upon youth and beauty and innocence forever and forever and  forever.</p>
  <p align="left">My child came. Ah! that  I should have to mention her here! I do it in penance; I do it in despair;  since with her my heart woke, and for her that heart is now broken, never to be  healed again. Oh, if the knowledge of my misery wakens in you one thought that  is not of revenge, cast a pitying eye upon this darling one, left in a hateful  country without friends, without lover, without means. For friends and lover  and means will all leave her with the revelations which the morning will bring,  and unless Heaven is merciful to her innocence as it has been just to my guilt,  she will have no other goal before her than that which has opened its refuge to  me.</p>
  <p align="left">As for her father, let  Heaven deal with him. He gave me this darling child; so I may not curse him,  even if I cannot bless.</p>
  <p align="left">Marah.</p>
  <p align="left">October 23, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">I have seen one bright  thing to-day, and that was the faint and almost unearthly gleam which shot for  a moment from beneath Honora&rsquo;s falling lids as I told her what love was and how  the marquis only awaited her permission to speak to assure her of his boundless  affection and his undying purpose to be true to her even to the point of  assuming her griefs and taking upon himself the protection of her innocence.</p>
  <p align="left">If it had not been for this,  I should have felt that the world was too dark to remain in, and life too  horrible to be endured.</p>
  <p align="left">November 30, 1791.</p>
  <p align="left">I thought that when  Honora Urquhart left my house to be married to M. De Fontaine, in the church  below the hill, peace would return to us once more.</p>
  <p align="left">But there is no peace.  This morning another horrible tragedy defiled my doorstep.</p>
  <p align="left">I was sitting in the  open porch waiting for the mail coach, for it seemed to me that it was about  time I received some word from Mr. Tamworth. It was yet some minutes before the  time when the rumble of the coach is usually heard, and I was brooding, as was  natural, over the more than terrible occurrences of the last few weeks, when I  heard the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs, and looking up and down the road, saw a small  party of men approaching from the south. As they came nearer, I noticed that  one of the riders was white-haired and presumably aged, and was interesting  myself in him, when he came near enough for me to distinguish his features, and  I perceived it was no other than Mr. Tamworth.</p>
  <p align="left">Rising in perturbation,  I glanced at the men behind and abreast of him, and saw that one of these rode  with lowered head and oppressed mien, and was just about to give that person a  name in my mind when the horse he bestrode suddenly reared, bolted, and dashed  forward to where I sat, flinging his rider at the very threshold of my house,  where he lay senseless as the stone upon which his head had fallen.</p>
  <p align="left">For an instant both his  companions and myself paused aghast at a sight so terrible and bewildering;  then, amid cries from the road and one wild shriek from within, I rushed  forward, and turning over the head, looked upon the face of the fallen man. It  was not a new one to me. Though changed and seamed and white now in death, I  recognized it at once. It was that of Edwin Urquhart.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
  <p align="left">This noon I took down  the sign which has swung for twenty years over my front door. &ldquo;Happy-Go-Lucky&rdquo;  is scarcely the name for an inn accursed by so many horrors.</p>
  <p align="left">February 3, 1792.</p>
  <p align="left">This week I have  fulfilled the threat of years ago. I have had the oak parlor and its hideous  adjunct torn from my house.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, perhaps, I can  sleep.</p>
  <p align="left">March 16.</p>
  <p align="left">News from Honora. The  distant relative who succeeded to the estates and the title of the Marquis de  la Roche-Guyon has fallen a victim to the guillotine. Would this have been the  fate of Honora&rsquo;s husband had he forsaken her and returned home? There is reason  to believe it. At all events, she finds herself greatly comforted by this news  for the sacrifice which her husband made to his love, and no longer regrets the  exile to which he has been forced to submit for her sake. Wonderful, wonderful  Providence! I view its workings with renewed awe every day.</p>
  <p align="left">September 5, 1795.</p>
  <p align="left">I have been from home. I  have been on a visit to New York. I have tasted of change, of brightness, of  free and cheerful living, and I can settle down now in this old and  fast-decaying inn with something else to think about than ruin and fearful  retribution.</p>
  <p align="left">I have been visiting  Madame De Fontaine. She wished me to come, I think, that I might see how amply  her married life had fulfilled the promise of her courtship days. Though she  and her noble husband live in peaceful retirement, and without many of the  appurtenances of wealth, they find such resources of delight in each other&rsquo;s  companionship that it would be hard for the most exacting witness of their  mutual felicity to wish them any different fate, or to desire for them any  wider field of social influence.</p>
  <p align="left">The marquis&mdash;I shall  always call him thus&mdash;has found a friend in General Washington, and though he is  never seen at the President&rsquo;s receptions, or mingles his voice in the councils  of his adopted country, there are evidences constantly appearing of the  confidence reposed in him by this great man, which cannot but add to the exile&rsquo;s  contentment and satisfaction.</p>
  <p align="left">Honora has developed  into a grand beauty. The melancholy which her unhappy memories have necessarily  infused into her countenance have given depth to her expression, which was  always sweet, and frequently touching. She looks like a queen, but like a queen  who has known not only grief, but love. There is nothing of despair in her  glance, rather a lofty hope, and when her affections are touched, or her  enthusiasm roused, she smiles with such a heavenly brightness in her  countenance, that I think there is no fairer woman in the world, as I am  assured there is none worthier.</p>
  <p align="left">Her husband agrees with  me in this opinion, and is so happy that she said to me one day:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I sometimes wonder how  my heart succeeds in holding the joy which Heaven has seen fit to grant me. In  it I read the forgiveness of God for the unutterable sins of my parents; and  though the shadows will come, and do come, whenever I think upon the past, or  see a face which, like yours, recalls memories as bitter as ever overwhelmed an  innocent girl in her first youth, I find that with every year of love and  peaceful living the darkness grows less, as if, somewhere in the boundless  heavens, the mercy of God was making itself felt in the heart of her who once  called herself my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And hearing her speak  thus, I felt my own breast lose something of the oppression which had hitherto  weighed it down. And as the days passed, and I experienced more and more of the  true peace that comes with perfect love and perfect trust, I found my tears  turned to rejoicing and the story of my regrets into songs of hope.</p>
  <p align="left">And so I have come back  comforted and at rest. If there are yet ghosts haunting the old inn, I do not  see them, and though its walls are dismantled, its custom gone, and its renown  a thing of the past, I can still sit on its grass-grown doorstep and roam  through its fast-decaying corridors without discovering any blacker shadow  following in my wake than that of my own figure, bent now with age, and only  held upright by the firmness of the little cane with which I strive to give aid  to my tottering and uncertain steps.</p>
  <p align="left">The grace of God has  fallen at last upon the Happy-Go-Lucky Inn.</p>
