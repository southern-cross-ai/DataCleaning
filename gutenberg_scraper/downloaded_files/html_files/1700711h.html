<p>He was  coming from the altar when the tocsin rang alarm, <br>
  With his fair young wife beside him, lovely in her bridal charm; <br>
  But he was not one to palter with a duty, or to slight <br>
  The trumpet-call of honor for his vantage or delight. </p>
<p>Turning  from the bride beside him to his stern and martial train, <br>
  From their midst he summoned to him the brothers of Germain; <br>
  At the word they stepped before him, nine strong warriors brave and true, <br>
  From the youngest to the eldest, Enguerrand to mighty Hugh. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sons of  Germain, to your keeping do I yield my bride to-day. <br>
  Guard her well as you do love me; guard her well and holily. <br>
  Dearer than mine own soul to me, you will hold her as your life, <br>
  &lsquo;Gainst the guile of seeming friendship and the force of open strife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We will  guard her,&rdquo; cried they firmly; and with just another glance <br>
  On the yearning and despairing in his young wife&rsquo;s countenance, <br>
  Gallant Beaufort strode before them down the aisle and through the door, <br>
  And a shadow came and lingered where the sunlight stood before. </p>
<p>Eight  long months the young wife waited, watching from her bridal room <br>
  For the coming of her husband up the valley forest&rsquo;s gloom. <br>
  Eight long months the sons of Germain paced the ramparts and the wall, <br>
  With their hands upon their halberds ready for the battle-call. </p>
<p>Then  there came a sound of trumpets pealing up the vale below, <br>
  And a dozen floating banners lit the forest with their glow, <br>
  And the bride arose like morning when it feels the sunlight nigh, <br>
  And her smile was like a rainbow flashing from a misty sky. </p>
<p>But the  eldest son of Germain lifting voice from off the wall, <br>
  Cried aloud, &ldquo;It is a stranger&rsquo;s and not Sir Beaufort&rsquo;s call; <br>
  Have you ne&rsquo;er a slighted lover or a kinsman with a heart <br>
  Base enough to seek his vengeance at the sharp end of the dart?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is  Sassard of the Mountains,&rdquo; answered she without guile, <br>
  &ldquo;While I wedded at the chancel, he stood mocking in the aisle; <br>
  And my maidens say he swore there that for all my plighted vow, <br>
  They would see me in his castle yet upon Morency&rsquo;s brow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is  Sassard and no other then,&rdquo; her noble guardian cried; <br>
  &ldquo;There is craft in yonder summons,&rdquo; and he rung his sword beside. <br>
  &ldquo;To the walls, ye sons of Germain! and as each would hold his life <br>
  From the bitter shame of falsehood, let us hold our master&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you  hold her, can you shield her from the breezes that await?&rdquo; <br>
  Cried the stinging voice of Sassard from his stand beside the gate. <br>
  &ldquo;If you have the power to shield her from the sunlight and the wind, <br>
  You may shield her from stern Sassard when his falchion is untwined.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We can  hold her, we can shield her,&rdquo; leaped like fire from off the wall, <br>
  And young Enguerrand the valiant, sprang out before them all. <br>
  &ldquo;And if breezes bring dishonor, we will guard her from their breath, <br>
  Though we yield her to the keeping of the sacred arms of Death.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And with  force that never faltered, did they guard her all that day, <br>
  Though the strength of triple armies seemed to battle in the fray, <br>
  The old castle&rsquo;s rugged ramparts holding firm against the foe, <br>
  As a goodly dyke resisteth the whelming billow&rsquo;s flow. </p>
<p>But next  morning as the sunlight rose in splendor over all, <br>
  Hugh the mighty, sank heart-wounded in his station on the wall, <br>
  At the noon the valiant Raoul of the merry eye and heart, <br>
  Gave his beauty and his jestings to the foeman&rsquo;s jealous dart. </p>
<p>Gallant  Maurice next sank faltering with a death wound &lsquo;neath his hair, <br>
  But still fighting on till Sassard pressed across him up the stair. <br>
  Generous Clement followed after, crying as his spirit passed, <br>
  &ldquo;Sons of Germain to the rescue, and be loyal to the last!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Gentle  Jaspar, lordly Clarence, Sessamine the doughty brand, <br>
  Even Henri who had yielded ne&rsquo;er before to mortal hand; <br>
  One by one they fall and perish, while the vaunting foemen pour <br>
  Through the breach and up the courtway to the very turret&rsquo;s door. </p>
<p>Enguerrand  and Stephen only now were left of all that nine, <br>
  To protect the single stairway from the traitor&rsquo;s fell design; <br>
  But with might as &lsquo;twere of thirty, did they wield the axe and brand, <br>
  Striving in their desperation the fierce onslaught to withstand. </p>
<p>But what  man of power so godlike he can stay the billow&rsquo;s wrack, <br>
  Or with single-handed weapon hold an hundred foemen back! <br>
  As the sun turned sadly westward, with a wild despairing cry, <br>
  Stephen bowed his noble forehead and sank down on earth to die. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo;  then cried cruel Sassard with his foot upon the stair, <br>
  &ldquo;Have I come to thee, my boaster?&rdquo; and he whirled his sword in air. <br>
  &ldquo;Thou who pratest of thy power to protect her to the death, <br>
  What think&rsquo;st thou now of Sassard and the wind&rsquo;s aspiring breath?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What I  think let this same show you,&rdquo; answered fiery Enguerrand, <br>
  And he poised his lofty battle-ax with sure and steady hand; <br>
  &ldquo;Now as Heaven loveth justice, may this deathly weapon fall <br>
  On the murderer of my brothers and th&rsquo; undoer of us all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With one  mighty whirl he sent it; flashing from his hand it came, <br>
  Like the lightning from the heavens in a whirl of awful flame, <br>
  And betwixt the brows of Sassard and his two false eyeballs passed, <br>
  And the murderer sank before it, like a tree before the blast. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye  minions of a traitor if you look for vengeance, come!&rdquo; <br>
  And his voice was like a trumpet when it clangs a victor home. <br>
  But a cry from far below him rose like thunder upward, <br>
  &ldquo;Nay! Let them turn and meet the <i>husband</i> if they hunger for the fray.&rdquo; </p>
<p>O the  yell that sprang to heaven as that voice swept up the stair, <br>
  And the slaughter dire that followed in another moment there! <br>
  From the least unto the greatest, from the henchman to the lord, <br>
  Not a man on all that stairway lived to sheath again his sword. </p>
<p>At the  top that flame-bound forehead, at the base that blade of fire&mdash; <br>
  &lsquo;Twas the meeting of two tempests in their potency and ire. <br>
  Ere the moon could falter inward with its pity and its woe, <br>
  Beaufort saw the path before him unencumbered of the foe. </p>
<p>Saw his  pathway unencumbered and strode up and o&rsquo;er the floor, <br>
  Even to the very threshold of his lovely lady&rsquo;s door, <br>
  And already in his fancy did he see the golden beam<br>
  Of her locks upon his shoulder and her sweet eyes&rsquo; happy gleam: </p>
<p>When  behold a form upstarting from the shadows at his side. <br>
  That with naked sword uplifted barred the passage to his bride; <br>
  It was Enguerrand the dauntless, but with staring eyes and hair <br>
  Blowing wild about a forehead pale as snow in moonlit glare. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah my  master, we have held her, we have guarded her,&rdquo; he said, <br>
  &ldquo;Not a shadow of dishonor has so much as touched her head. <br>
  Twenty wretches lie below there with the brothers of Germain, <br>
  Twenty foemen of her honor that I, Enguerrand, have slain. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But one  other foe remaineth, one remaineth yet,&rdquo; he cried, <br>
  &ldquo;Which it fits this hand to punish ere you cross unto your bride. <br>
  It is I, Enguerrand!&rdquo; shrieked he;&rdquo;and as I have slain the rest, <br>
  So I smite this foeman also!&rdquo;&mdash;and his sword plunged through his breast. </p>
<p>O the  horror of that moment!&rdquo;Art thou mad my Enguerrand?&rdquo; <br>
  Cried his master, striving wildly to withdraw the fatal brand. <br>
  But the stern youth smiling sadly, started back from his embrace, <br>
  While a flash like summer lightning, flickered direful on his face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a  traitor worse than Sassard;&rdquo; and he pointed down the stair, <br>
  &ldquo;For my heart has dared to love her whom my hand defended there. <br>
  While the others fought for honor, I by passion was made strong, <br>
  Set your heel upon my bosom for my soul has done you wrong. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  and here he swayed and faltered till his knee sank on the floor, <br>
  Yet in falling turned his forehead ever toward that silent door; <br>
  &ldquo;But your warrior hand my master, may take mine without a stain, <br>
  For my hand has e&rsquo;er been loyal, and your enemy is slain.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThroughTheTrees"></a>Through The Trees</b></h2>
<p>If  I had known whose face I&rsquo;d see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the hedge, beside the rose;<br>
  If I had known whose voice I&rsquo;d hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make music where the wind-flower blow&rsquo;s,&mdash;<br>
  I had not come; I had not come.</p>
<p>If  I had known his deep &ldquo;I love &ldquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could make her face so fair to see;<br>
  If I had known her shy &ldquo;And I&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could make him stoop so tenderly,&mdash;<br>
  I had not come; I had not come.</p>
<p>But  what knew I? The summer breeze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped not to cry &ldquo;Beware! beware!&rdquo;<br>
  The vine-wreaths drooping from the trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught not my sleeve with soft &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo;<br>
  And so I came, and so I came.</p>
<p>The  roses that his hands have plucked,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sweet to me, are death to me;<br>
  Between them, as through living flames<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass, I clutch them, crush them, see!<br>
  The bloom for her, the thorn for me.</p>
<p>The  brooks leap up with many a song&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once could sing, like them could sing;<br>
  They fall; &lsquo;tis like a sigh among<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world of joy and blossoming.&mdash;<br>
  Why did I come? Why did I come?</p>
<p>The  blue sky burns like altar fires&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sweet her eyes beneath her hair!<br>
  The green earth lights its fragrant pyres;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild birds rise and flush the air;<br>
  God looks and smiles, earth is so fair.</p>
<p>But  ah! &lsquo;twixt me and yon bright heaven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bended heads pass darkling by;<br>
  And loud above the bird and brook<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear a low &ldquo;I love,&rdquo; &ldquo;And I &ldquo;&mdash;<br>
  And hide my face. Ah God! Why? Why? </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheNightingale"></a>The  Nightingale</b></h2>
<p>And  now soft night hath ta&rsquo;en her seat on high,<br>
  Outbreathing balmy peace o&rsquo;er all the land;<br>
  Silent in sleep the dimpled meadows lie<br>
  Like tired children soothed by mother&rsquo;s hand.<br>
  Throughout the valley hums the zephyr bland,<br>
  Charming the roses from their passionate dreams,<br>
  To hear the wild and melancholy streams<br>
  Pulse to the waving of its mystic wand;<br>
  While large and low eans down the mellow moon,<br>
  Whose whitely blazing urn doth make a silver noon.</p>
<p>But  hark! what heavenly sound is this that now<br>
  Steals like a dream adown the fragrant vale,<br>
  Or like a thought across a maiden&rsquo;s brow,<br>
  That brings a lambent flush upon the pale?<br>
  It is the heart-song of the nightingale,<br>
  Which yearns forever upward in a mist<br>
  Of subtle sadness, clouding all who list,<br>
  With softened shadows of her secret ail;<br>
  And now so purely fills the silence clear,<br>
  Great Nature seems to hush her beating heart to hear, </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheTowerOfBouverie"></a>The Tower Of  Bouverie</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fill  the horn unto the brim!&rdquo;<br>
  Cried the Lord of Bouverie;<br>
  &ldquo;Courtier gay and warrior grim,<br>
  All who feast this day with me,<br>
  Whatsoever his degree,<br>
  Fill ye, fill to Bouverie!&rdquo;<br>
  Bounteously the red wine ran;<br>
  Up they rose unto a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  to triumph in the wars!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to pleasure in our halls!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to Turkish scimitars<br>
  Hanging on our English walls!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to peace! and here&rsquo;s to see<br>
  Ere another week can flee,<br>
  A fair bride in Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud  the answering shout goes up,<br>
  Man by man they drain the cup.<br>
  Monteith&rsquo;s earl and Duffield&rsquo;s lord,<br>
  Hamon of the bloody sword,<br>
  Even gentle Hugh of Dee,<br>
  And the squire of Enderby,<br>
  All, all drink to Bouverie. </p>
<p>All,  say I? Hold, I am wrong;<br>
  One there was amid that throng,<br>
  One, just one, who started back,<br>
  Tossed to heaven his tresses black,<br>
  Would not drink to Bouverie:<br>
  One alone; ah, who is he<br>
  Dares slight pledge of Bouverie?</p>
<p>Is  it stalwart Clarimaux<br>
  Of the giant arm and knee?<br>
  Holbert&rsquo;s earl, or scornful Vaux?<br>
  Jasper, prince of chivalry?<br>
  No, ah no; too young to be<br>
  One amongst such warriors free,<br>
  Neither lord nor chieftain he.</p>
<p>Rupert,  then, of careless eye,<br>
  Reckless if he live or die?<br>
  Eustace, loving more his wit<br>
  Than the head producing it?<br>
  No, ah no, not one of these<br>
  With their jests and mummeries,<br>
  But a simple squire, no more,<br>
  Is the man who thus before<br>
  All the world dares Bouverie.<br>
  Just a simple squire, but oh,<br>
  What a fire his glances show!<br>
  What a gesture of command<br>
  Speaks in his uplifted hand<br>
  As he puts the beaker back,<br>
  Crying, &ldquo;Bring no pledge to me!<br>
  Though the castle fall in wrack<br>
  Drink I no such mockery.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But  the master with a bound<br>
  Grasps the slighted goblet round,<br>
  Draws his sword, and, &ldquo;Drink or die!&rdquo;<br>
  Cries aloud and threateningly,<br>
  Whirling up his blade on high.</p>
<p>From  the goblet&rsquo;s tempting rim<br>
  To the falchion fierce and grim,<br>
  Quickly passed the stripling&rsquo;s eye.<br>
  Sweet is life to youthful hearts,<br>
  Chill the dreaded angel&rsquo;s darts;<br>
  Sweet is life and harsh is death,<br>
  Sweet the sunshine&rsquo;s fervid breath,<br>
  And the winds that round us fly.<br>
  In his hand he took the cup&mdash;<br>
  Like a wave the cry leaps up&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Long live Bouverie to wield<br>
  Sword of might in hall and field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pledge  and drink!&rdquo; the baron cried.<br>
  &ldquo;I will pledge,&rdquo; the youth replied;<br>
  And his eye flashed like a star<br>
  In the gulf of night afar.<br>
  &ldquo;I will pledge;&rdquo; and o&rsquo;er his head<br>
  Raised the goblet gleaming red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  to triumph in the wars!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to pleasure in our halls!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to Turkish scimitars<br>
  Hanging on our English walls!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s  to peace! and here&rsquo;s to see<br>
  Ere another week can flee,<br>
  A <i>dead</i> bride in Bouverie.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Clanging  loud the goblet falls;<br>
  He has flung it at the walls,<br>
  And a silence like a pall<br>
  For a moment shrouds the hall.<br>
  Then a sudden cry of &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo;<br>
  Curls about him like a flame,<br>
  And &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; shriek they all,<br>
  &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s imp or dog abhorred,<br>
  Hissing snake or church-yard ghoul,<br>
  That you come to scare the soul<br>
  Of the baron at his board?&rdquo;<br>
  But the master cries aloud<br>
  With a glance and gesture proud,<br>
  &ldquo;Whosoever he may be,<br>
  Fool or devil, by my sword<br>
  He shall straight undo that word,<br>
  Or I am no Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  thy life and by thy sword<br>
  But I&rsquo;ll not undo my word!<br>
  Gentle dame and fair is she,<br>
  Surly lord and spiteful he;<br>
  Better see her beauty dead<br>
  Than such sorrow on her head!<br>
  Die, then, lady, die and be<br>
  Laid to rest in Bouverie,<br>
  Ere such evil come to thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O,  to slay him where he stood!<br>
  Eager flashed an hundred swords,<br>
  But the baron&rsquo;s potent mood<br>
  Held them back withouten words.<br>
  &ldquo;Demon imp or earth-born fool,<br>
  Scum of hell or Paynim&rsquo;s tool,<br>
  What to you is he or she?<br>
  What to you her misery?<br>
  What, the maid of Bouverie? &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  the shrine is to the priest,<br>
  What his shield is to the knight,<br>
  What the sun is to the east,<br>
  Wearying for the morning light;<br>
  What the star is to the sea,<br>
  To my humbleness is she,<br>
  Glorious star of Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O  ho!&rdquo; then the baron cried,<br>
  With a laugh of scornful pride,<br>
  &ldquo;By the mem&rsquo;ry of our sires,<br>
  But he loves, this squire of squires,<br>
  Loves our child of Bouverie!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;O ho!&rdquo; laughed they down the hall,<br>
  Knights and courtiers, one and all,<br>
  &ldquo;Loves our Lady Bouverie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  my troth,&rdquo; cried he again,<br>
  &ldquo;But my lord of Everden<br>
  Little recketh in his pride<br>
  What a rival eyes his bride.<br>
  Doughty warrior though he be,<br>
  He would tremble, sirs, pardie!<br>
  Could he see the youthful squire<br>
  That sits down before his fire.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Ho, ho,&rdquo; laughed they in their glee,<br>
  &ldquo;Rival claims in Bouverie!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Youthful  squires have hearts of steel,&rdquo;<br>
  Quoth the stripling lifting higher<br>
  His pure brow of lambent fire,<br>
  With a look of dauntless zeal.<br>
  &ldquo;Not a noble in the land<br>
  Would do for the lady&rsquo;s hand,<br>
  What  the simple youth you see <br>
  Would for her of Bouverie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you tilt a knightly lance<br>
  &lsquo;Gainst yon chapel&rsquo;s broad expanse?<br>
  Mount the master&rsquo;s steed and clear<br>
  With one bound the narrow wier,<br>
  That you boast so loud and free?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I would die for her,&rdquo; said he;<br>
  &ldquo;Tender maid of Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho  then, it were surely ill<br>
  One should balk you in your will;&rdquo;<br>
  Sneering cried his fiery lord,<br>
  Raising high his mighty sword.<br>
  But the youth with smile of scorn,<br>
  And an aspect like the morn,<br>
  Met its sheen unflinchingly.<br>
  &ldquo;You do show me grace,&rdquo; cried he,<br>
  &ldquo;Haughty chief of Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it so?&rdquo; and in disdain<br>
  Fell that falchion once again.<br>
  &ldquo;Then by Heaven that made us all,<br>
  Will we tip that grace with gall;&rdquo;<br>
  And his gaze ran down the hall.<br>
  &ldquo;Hugh of Elbert to the tower!<br>
  Rouse my daughter in her bower;<br>
  Tell her we would see her here<br>
  Ere yon eagle circling high<br>
  O&rsquo;er our walls can disappear<br>
  In his realm of upper sky.<br>
  Woman&rsquo;s scorn has stinging point,<br>
  Pierces keenly through the joint;<br>
  We will see if he who eyes<br>
  All unmoved the falchion rise,<br>
  Can with equal spirit dare<br>
  The disdain of lady fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the young man with a cry<br>
  Is already at his knee<br>
  Lifting hands impetuously.<br>
  &ldquo;Baron Bouverie, let me die;<br>
  Slay me if thou wilt,&rdquo; he said;<br>
  &ldquo;But O spare the tender maid,<br>
  Spare the maid of Bouverie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you fear her scorn so much?&rdquo;<br>
  Cried the baron, while a smile<br>
  Or what men would fain call such,<br>
  Smote his iron lip the while.<br>
  &ldquo;More than death,&rdquo; the young man said;<br>
  And a shadow dark and dread<br>
  Fell upon his youthful head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think that she will be<br>
  All so harsh?&rdquo; quoth Hugh of Dee<br>
  In the ear of Enderby.<br>
  &ldquo;Frail as harebell swinging &lsquo;lone<br>
  On some turret&rsquo;s crumbling stone&mdash;<br>
  Do you think that he need fear<br>
  Such right bitter words to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the baron&rsquo;s awful eye<br>
  Gloomed upon him for reply;<br>
  And as if a spell were hung<br>
  On each daring lip and tongue,<br>
  Silent grew both knight and lord,<br>
  Every eye with one accord<br>
  Fixed in close expectancy<br>
  On the face of Bouverie.</p>
<p>When,  hark, hark, from where the door<br>
  Wavers restless o&rsquo;er the floor,<br>
  Breaks a rustle and a stir<br>
  Like the breeze in mountain fir;<br>
  And there welleth into view<br>
  From the darkness dim and drear,<br>
  A fair face of light and dew,<br>
  And the noble maid is here.</p>
<p>O is  this the haughty dame<br>
  Whose proud part it is to shame,<br>
  With her scorn, the stripling&rsquo;s love,<br>
  And his heart with anguish move?<br>
  This shy maiden, pale and sweet,<br>
  With the timid stepping feet,<br>
  And an eye like violets hid<br>
  Underneath each fearful lid?</p>
<p>Pausing  in the narrow door,<br>
  Full within the view of all,<br>
  One slow smile she sends before<br>
  Her fair presence, down the hall. </p>
<p>Then  as floats a cloud of snow<br>
  Into some fierce sunset&rsquo;s glow,<br>
  Through the crowd she softly sped,<br>
  And bent low her gentle head<br>
  &lsquo;Gainst her haughty father&rsquo;s knee.<br>
  Fair and frail&mdash;ah, who is he<br>
  Would cast shadow over thee,<br>
  Beauteous flower of Bouverie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child  of Bouverie, and heir<br>
  To the broad lands of Quermair;<br>
  Mistress of Dumont&rsquo;s fair bowers,<br>
  Gaverson and Heathcote&rsquo;s towers;<br>
  I have called you here to fling<br>
  Scorn upon a worthless thing.&rdquo;<br>
  Straight she looked up wondering.</p>
<p>If  it be a worthless thing,<br>
  As you say, Lord Bouverie,<br>
  Little need is there to fling<br>
  Scorn upon it,&rdquo; murmured she.<br>
  &ldquo;If I call you from your dreams<br>
  To set down my cup, it &lsquo;seems<br>
  You to do so,&rdquo; thundered he.</p>
<p>Like  a summer snowdrop spurned<br>
  By a wind too strong for it,<br>
  Tremblingly her forehead turned<br>
  From that bitter-blowing wit.<br>
  &ldquo;Let me know your will,&rdquo; she said,<br>
  And her lovely modest head<br>
  On her bosom faltered. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is this;&rdquo; and heavily<br>
  On her arm his right hand fell;<br>
  &ldquo;If you be of mine, &lsquo;tis well,<br>
  You will answer worthily.<br>
  Some one in this company<br>
  Hath dared boast his love for thee,<br>
  Heiress of proud Bouverie.&rdquo;<br>
  Flushed her cheek like red-rose tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a lord&mdash;&rdquo; The long lash fell,<br>
  Fell like leaf across its flower<br>
  &ldquo;Not a warrior&mdash;&rdquo; Ah, what spell<br>
  Holds the maiden in its power?<br>
  &ldquo;Warrior-lord had met my sword,<br>
  But a woman&rsquo;s mocking word<br>
  Is the only answer meet<br>
  For a spurless squire, I weet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  a spurless squire! oh<br>
  How her lips and forehead glow!<br>
  How the mounting rapture flies<br>
  From her chin unto her eyes!<br>
  Turning round with eager gaze,<br>
  On the youth she casts her eye,<br>
  And her smile is like a haze<br>
  Spreading o&rsquo;er a roseate sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  my soul!&rdquo; the baron cries;<br>
  &ldquo;But this scorn wears curious guise!&rdquo;<br>
  And his teeth with iron grip<br>
  Close upon his nether lip.<br>
  O the sire is dread to see,<br>
  But a high tranquillity<br>
  Shrines the maid of Bouverie. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you curse him, girl, or no?&rdquo;<br>
  Shrieked the baron looming o&rsquo;er her,<br>
  &ldquo;Curse me, lady;&rdquo; whispered low<br>
  He who knelt in homage &lsquo;fore her.<br>
  But the tender maiden stood<br>
  Trembling in the rushing flood<br>
  Whelming her sweet womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tis  but shame,&rdquo; quoth Hugh of Dee,<br>
  &ldquo;Let her pass, Lord Bouverie;<br>
  Not for stars is it I ween<br>
  To proclaim their state serene.&rdquo;<br>
  But the baron straight replied,<br>
  &ldquo;Stars that tremble where they bide<br>
  Are not stars with which to crown<br>
  Ancient Bouverie&rsquo;s proud renown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  which like some lily waking<br>
  From its moonlit dreams to find<br>
  Earth and air around it quaking<br>
  In a rage of gusty wind,<br>
  From her breast the maiden raised<br>
  To his face her glance amazed,<br>
  And her lips paled visibly.<br>
  Kneeling lowly at his knee,<br>
  &ldquo;Ask me what you will,&rdquo; said she,<br>
  &ldquo;Much would Claire of Bouverie do,<br>
  But this one thing, father, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  and like a tiger stung<br>
  By the hunter&rsquo;s bitter dart,<br>
  From her side he backward sprung,<br>
  Eyes to heaven and hand to heart. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What!  and have I then come back<br>
  From the Paynim&rsquo;s fierce attack<br>
  To find treason in my home?<br>
  Saints of heaven! have I come<br>
  From the desert&rsquo;s wasting dearth,<br>
  From the raging of the sea,<br>
  From the tempest&rsquo;s enmity,<br>
  To find shame upon my hearth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame?  not so!&rdquo; cried Hugh of Dee:<br>
  &ldquo;Never shame,&rdquo; said Enderby;<br>
  &ldquo;Love and patience, hope and truth,&rdquo;<br>
  Spake in haste the gallant youth,<br>
  &ldquo;But not shame, Lord Bouverie.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Love and sorrow,&rdquo; whispered she;<br>
  &ldquo;Only that, Lord Bouverie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  as he might spurn a cur,<br>
  From his side he spurned her.<br>
  &ldquo;Shame and worse than shame to me,<br>
  May the heavens right instantly<br>
  Smite thee, curse of Bouverie!&rdquo;<br>
  Then while horror falls on all<br>
  In that dismal crowded hall.<br>
  Loud he clanked his ringing spur<br>
  With an awful look at her,<br>
  Through the dizzy moment&rsquo;s blur.<br>
  &ldquo;Take her hence!&rdquo; he loudly cried,<br>
  &ldquo;Everden has lost his bride;<br>
  Fit for nought but death,&mdash;her shame<br>
  Ne&rsquo;er shall soil a warrior&rsquo;s name.<br>
  Take her hence; no more to me<br>
  Than this broken sword is she,<br>
  Henceforth here in Bouverie.&rdquo;<br>
  And his mighty blade he drew,<br>
  Brake it on his knee in two,<br>
  Cast it from him down the hall,<br>
  Lifted voice above them all,<br>
  &ldquo;No more than that sword to me,<br>
  As I am Lord Bouverie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  at that an awful joy<br>
  Flushed the forehead of the boy;<br>
  &ldquo;What the master flings aside,<br>
  One may surely have,&rdquo; he cried;<br>
  And with just a single bound,<br>
  Plucked the falchion from the ground.<br>
  &ldquo;What the father gives to shame,<br>
  Love may freely, fully claim;&rdquo;<br>
  And in sight of each man there<br>
  To his breast he drew her fair,<br>
  Wild, wan face with passionate care.</p>
<p>But  the baron leaping back,<br>
  Struck that yearning twain apart,<br>
  As the lightning in its track <br>
  Open smites the sunset&rsquo;s heart.<br>
  &ldquo;Do you claim her so, pardie?<br>
  By my life but we will see,<br>
  Daring cur of Bouverie,<br>
  Flowers like these though warped and dead,<br>
  Are not weeds,&rdquo; he fiercely said.<br>
  &ldquo;If you think to pluck from me<br>
  This same rose of Bouverie,<br>
  By my life and by my wit<br>
  You will have to climb for it.&rdquo;<br>
  And he raised his hand on high,<br>
  Pointed through the casement nigh<br>
  To his turrets &lsquo;gainst the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the top of yonder tower<br>
  Lies my lady daughter&rsquo;s bower;<br>
  If you love her as you say,<br>
  Mount and pluck her thence away.<br>
  Scarce so high as stars may be,<br>
  It will do, I wot,&rdquo; quoth he,<br>
  And his smile gloomed fearfully.</p>
<p>Mount  the tower! from each man&rsquo;s tongue<br>
  One fierce cry of horror sprung.<br>
  Mount the tower, why it is death<br>
  And the maiden&rsquo;s startled breath<br>
  On her pale lip faltereth.<br>
  But the young man looming higher<br>
  Eyes his lord with glance of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you give her me to wife<br>
  If I win that steep with life?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Freely as yon heaven yields<br>
  Rain and sunshine to the fields.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Then as Heaven loveth truth,<br>
  Cometh joy or cometh ruth,<br>
  Will I dare it!&rdquo; cried the youth.</p>
<p>O will  heaven look upon<br>
  Such a deed beneath the sun!<br>
  Ninety awful feet the steep<br>
  Towers above the donjon keep;<br>
  Ninety feet of rugged stone,<br>
  Crumbling, old, and ivy-grown&mdash;<br>
  And each foot from top to pave,<br>
  A relentless, yawning grave!</p>
<p>But  the young man at its base,<br>
  Sees no more that steep surface,<br>
  Sees no more the eager death<br>
  Biding him with hungry breath;<br>
  For upon the turret&rsquo;s height<br>
  They have placed the lady bright,<br>
  And his gaze is fixed upon<br>
  That dear head against the sun,<br>
  Whither all his hopes have run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O  Lord Bouverie, swear to me,<br>
  If I win her thus from thee,<br>
  She shall be mine own for aye,<br>
  Wife and mistress from this day.&rdquo;<br>
  If you win her thus from me,&rdquo;<br>
  Answered he of Bouverie,<br>
  &ldquo;By my life but she shall be<br>
  Thine unto the judgment day.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Then may Heaven be my aid,<br>
  And the right prevail!&rdquo; he said,<br>
  And he laid his hand in power<br>
  On the base of that rude tower.<br>
  Through the crowd an icy chill<br>
  Shot and passed, and all was still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I fail, let no man ever<br>
  Say I flinched from the endeavor;&rdquo;<br>
  And he drew his body&rsquo;s weight<br>
  Up beyond the massive gate.<br>
  &ldquo;If I fail, let no man&rsquo;s lip<br>
  Dare to taunt her with the slip;&rdquo;<br>
  And he mounted &lsquo;fore their eyes<br>
  Unto where the turrets rise.<br>
  &ldquo;If I fail&mdash;&rdquo; but at that word<br>
  Her sweet voice above was heard,<br>
  And he brake his speech in two;&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;But I will not fail, look you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  with deathless zeal he bent<br>
  Will and strength to the ascent,<br>
  Setting now a steady foot<br>
  On the ivys&rsquo; clinging root,<br>
  Grasping now the slippery edge<br>
  Of some narrow casement&rsquo;s ledge,<br>
  Arm upstretched and head backthrown,<br>
  As if her dear eyes alone<br>
  Drew him up those heights of stone.</p>
<p>O ye  Heavens, what abyss!<br>
  If his daring hand should miss!<br>
  If the ivy&rsquo;s treacherous root<br>
  Should give way beneath his foot!<br>
  Many a gleam of horror flies<br>
  Through that watching maiden&rsquo;s eyes;<br>
  Many a noble heart below<br>
  Shudders in an awful woe&mdash;<br>
  If that daring hand should miss,<br>
  Saints of Heaven, what abyss!</p>
<p>But  he mounts up yet for all<br>
  Past the gap within the wall,<br>
  Past the barbican&rsquo;s high crest,<br>
  Past the swallow&rsquo;s hidden nest;<br>
  Up, till heart and watching eye<br>
  Faint and follow wearily,<br>
  Till the swallows swooping whirl<br>
  Round and round in dizzy swirl,<br>
  And the clouds swim dreamily.</p>
<p>Slower  now, but steady still,&mdash;<br>
  How the vines about him thrill!<br>
  Up another foot, and lo!<br>
  How his form sways to and fro!<br>
  Up one more, and he whose breast<br>
  Touch of gentleness doth know,<br>
  Drops his eyelids from the rest.</p>
<p>Further  still, and lord and knight<br>
  Sink to ground in wild affright;<br>
  Only he of iron will,<br>
  Baron Bouverie, dares look still,<br>
  Dares to mark that figure high,<br>
  Swinging between earth and sky,<br>
  Past their help and past recall,<br>
  Eighty feet above them all.</p>
<p>He  has gained the turret&rsquo;s brow,<br>
  Just beneath the lady now,<br>
  And his yearning arms reach high,<br>
  And her yearning arms reach low,<br>
  But their two hands&mdash;ah, so nigh,<br>
  Cannot join. &ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; then cries<br>
  The fierce lord, without disguise,<br>
  &ldquo;In another moment more<br>
  This same silly sport is o&rsquo;er!&rdquo;<br>
  And he trims his iron lip<br>
  For the chill and awful smile<br>
  That shall hail the fatal slip<br>
  From that huge terrific pile.<br>
  But a sudden curse instead<br>
  Forces way betwixt his teeth,<br>
  For the maiden overhead<br>
  Leaning to the youth beneath,<br>
  Hath let down her scarf&rsquo;s deep fold,<br>
  And by its same help, behold,<br>
  He has struggled upward now<br>
  Level to the turret&rsquo;s brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O  Lord Bouverie, swear to me<br>
  That he lives,&rdquo; cried Hugh of Dee.<br>
  &ldquo;Fifty candles, large and white,<br>
  To our Lady&rsquo;s shrine to-night,<br>
  If he wins the turrets height!&rdquo;<br>
  Clamored noble Enderby.</p>
<p>But  the baron with his eyes<br>
  Stretched and fixed upon the skies,<br>
  Answers not by deed or word<br>
  Anxious knight or fearful lord.<br>
  All his gaze is on the man<br>
  Struggling, fainting in the span<br>
  Of his lady&rsquo;s arms, upon<br>
  That last awful verge of stone,<br>
  Will he clear it? dare he?<br>
  Can It indeed be done by man?<br>
  Ha, he slips, he falls; but no<br>
  It was but the final throw<br>
  Of his body ere he put<br>
  O&rsquo;er the ledge his fainting foot,</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tis  no squire of mine,&rdquo; then cried<br>
  The fierce master in his pride,<br>
  &ldquo;But some imp from hell we see<br>
  This same day in Bouverie.&rdquo;<br>
  But another moment, and<br>
  With a twist of foot and hand,<br>
  The brave stripling clears the edge<br>
  Of the turret&rsquo;s battled ledge,<br>
  And they see him leaning warm<br>
  On his lovely lady&rsquo;s arm,<br>
  Blessed at last and safe from harm.</p>
<p>O was  ever such emprise<br>
  Seen before by mortal eyes!<br>
  Like the rising of the sea<br>
  Sprang the shout of victory;<br>
  Like the rising of the sea<br>
  When the heart of nature breaks,<br>
  Or the thunder when it speaks.</p>
<p>But  the baron with a bound,<br>
  Jump&rsquo;d in anger from the ground,<br>
  And his glance flashed fiercely round.<br>
  &ldquo;Ah, but ye do well to shout<br>
  Ere the sport is full played out!<br>
  He has mounted up, I own,<br>
  And a gallant deed &lsquo;tis too,<br>
  But, my lords, remember yon,<br>
  That he has not yet <i>come down!</i>&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble  sir, what would you do?&rdquo;<br>
  Cried out Vaux and Hamori too,<br>
  Leaping swiftly into view.<br>
  But the baron smiting-hard<br>
  With his feet upon the sward,<br>
  Cried, &ldquo;As he has gone, I swear<br>
  He shall come again, or ne&rsquo;er<br>
  Set his foot again to ground<br>
  From yon turret&rsquo;s narrow bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  at that brave Clarimaux,<br>
  Seizing hold of mighty Vaux,<br>
  Sprang before him in the way.<br>
  &ldquo;Baron Bouverie,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &ldquo;You must o&rsquo;er my body tread,<br>
  If you close that door to-day.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Yes and mine!&rdquo; re-echoed wide,<br>
  And stern Duffield leaped beside;<br>
  &ldquo;We can look on gallant deeds,<br>
  Noble contests, lordly meeds,<br>
  But by Heaven that base heart bleeds<br>
  That would force these eyes to see<br>
  Grievous wrong and perjury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think, then,&rdquo; cried his lord,<br>
  &ldquo;That we bend to such as ye?<br>
  That because we lack our sword,<br>
  We will do your will?&rdquo; shrieked he;<br>
  And with just one mighty bound<br>
  Cleft the swaying crowd around,<br>
  And stood breathing death before<br>
  The grim turret&rsquo;s narrow door,</p>
<p>When&mdash;ah,  what is this that meets<br>
  Him upon the threshold stone?<br>
  What this vision fair which greets<br>
  Him with tender arms outthrown?<br>
  Eye of fire and cheek of rose,<br>
  Lip where every rapture glows,&mdash;<br>
  Can this be the maiden frail<br>
  That but one short hour before<br>
  Lay like broken lily pale<br>
  On the castle&rsquo;s stony floor?<br>
  With a cry he backward sped,<br>
  But the maiden, springing, laid<br>
  On his breast her joyous head,<br>
  Smiling on him undismayed.<br>
  &ldquo;Father, father, will you be<br>
  Harsher, then, than destiny?&rdquo;<br>
  And her clinging, eager arm<br>
  Crept about him live and warm<br>
  With a wild and nameless charm.</p>
<p>But  he like some rock that feels<br>
  All unmoved the wind&rsquo;s appeals,<br>
  For a moment stood unswayed,<br>
  Gazing down upon the maid.<br>
  But as closer to his breast<br>
  That pure cheek and forehead pressed,<br>
  Gentler aspects took the place<br>
  Of the frowns upon his face,<br>
  And a something like a sigh<br>
  Shook his bosom heavily.<br>
  Starting back with sudden speed,<br>
  From his neck her arms he freed,<br>
  And upon that crowd around<br>
  Fixed his haughty glance profound.<br>
  &ldquo;Noble lords and sirs,&rdquo; he cried,<br>
  &ldquo;We have looked this day upon<br>
  A great deed beneath the sun,<br>
  And our soul is satisfied.<br>
  But one thing remaineth yet<br>
  Which &lsquo;twere treason to forget;&rdquo;<br>
  And he caught with fervor up<br>
  From the page beside, his cup:<br>
  &ldquo; &lsquo;Tis the pledge which crowneth all<br>
  Gallant acts in field and hall.&rdquo;<br>
  Then while each man held his breath<br>
  In a doubt &lsquo;twixt life and death,<br>
  Back he tossed his head on high,<br>
  Raised the goblet towards the sky,<br>
  And spake out right potently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  to triumph in the wars!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to pleasure in our halls!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to Turkish scimitars<br>
  Hanging on our English walls!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to courage, though it be<br>
  In a squire of low degree!<br>
  Here&rsquo;s to love! and here&rsquo;s to see,<br>
  Ere another day can flee,<br>
  These two wed in Bouverie!&rdquo; </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winds are abroad;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waves of the ford<br>
  Boom out a dismal lay.</p>
<p>Shrine  wet with dew and tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here will I rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easing a breast<br>
  Worn by despair and fears. </p>
<p>Not  on the brow of her<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who walks in light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I in night,<br>
  Let thy long shadow stir.</p>
<p>Rather  across this heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be laid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shade after shade,<br>
  Gloom hath with her no part.</p>
<p>While  in his sight her soul<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatens and glows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till her heart&rsquo;s rose<br>
  Opes at his fond control;</p>
<p>I clasp  the cross and cry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Strength, Holy Rood!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiss the cold wood<br>
  While at its foot I lie.</p>
<p>Angel,  whose wings I see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shift &lsquo;mongst the stars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make these chill bars<br>
  Ladders of light for me. </p>

  From Him To Her</b></h3>
<p>SWEET,  when I gave my troth to you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved you&mdash;or imagined so;<br>
  But winds may change, and clouds that blew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Eastward at the morn, may blow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the West, by noon, you know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tis  not that you are grown less fair;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose is e&rsquo;er a rose to me;<br>
  But he who wanders on to where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pensive violet clusters are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May chance forget the rose, you see,</p>
<p>And  I have wandered: there, &lsquo;tis out!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However fickle, false, or wrong,<br>
  You cannot say I gave to doubt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master music of that song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy sings in breasts where hopes belong.</p>
<p>You  cannot say I was not true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To truth, if not to constancy;<br>
  That I still sought to quaff the dew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From off the rose, while secretly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I groped for what more pleased me. </p>
<p>Nor  will you, being sweet as fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemn that other fair one&rsquo;s sweetness;<br>
  Nor by those charms which make so rare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own pure face, disdain the meetness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of loving grace in its completeness.</p>
<p>For  beauty, beauty is; and&mdash;well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man must worship where he must;<br>
  Yet if you chose to hold me, Belle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I am yours; I would be just;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pledged, and will fulfill my trust.</p>
<p>And  if I wed I will be true;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need, not fear; the wave which holds<br>
  A lily up to all men&rsquo;s view,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce spots the silver of its folds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With restless wash of secret molds.</p>
<p>Then  tell me, sweet; is&rsquo;t yes or no&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marriage ring, or short farewell?<br>
  Do you still love me, or love so<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can forgive?&mdash;The wedding bell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Gins ringing&mdash;then what say you? tell.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>2<br>
  From Her To Him</b></h3>
<p>What  should I say but farewell; is the rose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing too slight to stand alone and still<br>
  When the wind leaves it? Shall a flower that grows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In God&rsquo;s clear light, more dearly love the thrill<br>
  Of its own petals, than the happy sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of breezes singing, though their songs should be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some sweet other blossom  far away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is no rose to lose them? No; the bliss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of him to whom I gave my bliss  one day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is much more precious than his troth to me:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scarce would wish his face  again to see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its happy smile and tender shine to miss;<br>
  Then of the twain it is not yes, but no,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the no, farewell. May she, your love,<br>
  So live in joy and so in beauty move,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never may in all your dreams forget<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven blooms for you within the violet,</p>

  From Him To Her</b></h3>
<p>Ah,  rose, my rose, my love, my queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gentle, faithful, tender heart;<br>
  The one fair woman I have seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With soul to feel for other&rsquo;s smart;<br>
  Didst think that I who once had known<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy wild-rose touch could wander on?</p>
<p>That  any blossom &lsquo;neath the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though crowned with heavenly grace and power,<br>
  Could fairer seem to me than one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose blushes are the summer&rsquo;s dower?<br>
  That daintiest violets in the world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could rival rose-buds half unfurled? </p>
<p>Didst  think&mdash;but no, thou didst not think&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou didst but love! O sweet! O wife!<br>
  My one firm hold upon the brink<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that deep gulf which we call life,<br>
  Would thou couldst know my joy to find<br>
  This angel living in thy mind.</p>
<p>For,  sweet, I love thee, loved thee so;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh! so feared to trust my love,<br>
  Who am no saint, and needs must know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How false the fairest face can prove;<br>
  How oft beneath the softest sigh<br>
  Heaves woman&rsquo;s heart of vanity.</p>
<p>And  soul yields not but to its own;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I did love thee with my soul;<br>
  A stream sings on by weed and stone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ocean billows long to roll<br>
  The strength and glory of the seas,<br>
  Upon their shore of mysteries.</p>
<p>And  thou wert shore and all to me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My star, my crown, my calm retreat;<br>
  So dear that I could bear to pain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy heart to learn its secret sweet.<br>
  Canst pardon then? O sunny shore,<br>
  A whole sea waits to tell thee more.</p>
<p>Thou  wilt not scorn me? Ah, my pen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slips at the wild thought to the floor;<br>
  Nought else but eyes can plead, love, whe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of death stands in the door;<br>
  Then read what I have writ, and say<br>
  If love can pardon love alway, </p>
<p>Thou  dost not speak. O sweet! O love!<br>
  It were not much to die for thee,<br>
  But live and know not God above<br>
  Could give my heaven back to me&mdash;<br>
  Ah, canst thou doom it? What, yes? <i>no!<br>
  </i>O God, mayst Thou but pardon so!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PaulIsham"></a>Paul Isham</b></h2>
<p>WHEN  first Paul Isham crossed the fields to woo<br>
  Sweet Gladys Darrell in her humble home,<br>
  &lsquo;Twas  deemed the veriest marvel of the year<br>
  By all our country gossips. &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said they,<br>
  &ldquo;She has some beauty, is not quite devoid<br>
  Of grace in speech and bearing; is both young<br>
  And gentle tempered, but despite all this,<br>
  A match unworthy of his name and wealth,<br>
  His varied learning and a culture won<br>
  By years of foreign travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  it was<br>
  Who built the sumptuous mansion which you see<br>
  Rise in the vale below us. There in state<br>
  As lonely as methinks &lsquo;tis cheerful now,<br>
  He lived on his return from o&rsquo;er the seas,<br>
  Respected, courted somewhat, but unmoved<br>
  By woman&rsquo;s smile from his accustomed mien<br>
  Of proud composure, till his glances fell<br>
  On pretty Gladys where she stood one day<br>
  Amid her fellows. As a wilding rose <br>
  Discovered in a garden draws the gaze<br>
  And seems in its meek loveliness more fair<br>
  Than all its prouder sisters, so to him<br>
  She seemed the choicest blossom of them all,<br>
  A treasure past computing. For a year<br>
  He wooed her, then, as doth the strong man woo<br>
  His last and dearest blessing from the fates,<br>
  And at the year&rsquo;s end won her. Then to him<br>
  Returned the morning freshness of his youth,<br>
  Hope and the joy of life. She was to him<br>
  A breath of spring across the winter rime,<br>
  And in her beauty he was wont to see<br>
  Something akin to all that sweetest is<br>
  In Nature&rsquo;s handiwork, when from the snow<br>
  The crocus blossoms, and the earth, beguiled,<br>
  Yields up her hoarded treasures to the sun<br>
  And all mankind rejoices.</p>
<p>But  of late<br>
  He had perceived a certain change in her;<br>
  The bud which gazes fearless on the sky<br>
  Droops as its being richens; so with her<br>
  Across whose girlish merriment had crept<br>
  The hush of feeling and the calm of thought.<br>
  Less often rang the songs that once had seemed<br>
  Surcharged with laughter like the voice of brooks;<br>
  But if by chance they fell upon the ear<br>
  They lingered there, like waves which vainly seek<br>
  To utter all the story of the sea<br>
  And die in music with the tale untold.<br>
  Less frequent shone the smile upon her lips;<br>
  But when it came &lsquo;twas sweeter than before,<br>
  As the lone ray that wanders through a glen,<br>
  Suggesting beauties it but half reveals,<br>
  Is lovelier than the sunshine on the lea.<br>
  And when Paul Isham saw all this he said,<br>
  &ldquo;The summer grows upon my darling&rsquo;s heart,<br>
  Ripening her woman&rsquo;s nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June  was here,<br>
  And in a month &lsquo;twas thought the marriage peal<br>
  Would ring from Benton church-bells. In the house<br>
  Beyond the maples there was heard at times<br>
  Unwonted sounds, as though its generous lord<br>
  Was making preparation for his bride;<br>
  And every evening when the sun was low<br>
  And earth and air were radiant, he was seen<br>
  Crossing the meadow to his Gladys&rsquo; home<br>
  Beneath the mountain. Oft he passed alone,<br>
  But oftener still in company with Ralph,<br>
  A youthful brother, who had haply come<br>
  Some two months since from his far home in town,<br>
  To stray again among remembered scenes,<br>
  And with man&rsquo;s eyes behold the sacred spots<br>
  Where in his dreamy childhood he had stood<br>
  And seen the visions of his future life<br>
  Flit by in sun and shadow.</p>
<p>But  this eve<br>
  It pleased Paul Isham to go forth alone<br>
  To meet with Gladys, For all through the day<br>
  The thought of her had called a rainbow forth<br>
  From every cloud of care, and much he yearned<br>
  For her dear presence. O the toils of life!<br>
  How small they seem when love&rsquo;s resistless tide<br>
  Sweeps brightly o&rsquo;er them! Like the scattered stones<br>
  Within a mountain streamlet, they but serve<br>
  To strike the hidden music from its flow<br>
  And make its sparkle visible.</p>
<p>A  copse<br>
  Full of soft shadows and sun-lighted glades<br>
  Lay in his path. Here he was wont to pause<br>
  And cull some woodland blossom from the mould<br>
  To lay within her palm, that it might speak<br>
  Such words as he in his heart-reverence found<br>
  Halt in the utterance. But to-night his thoughts<br>
  Sprang wing&egrave;d to his lips; his very love<br>
  Seemed given for inspiration, and he trod<br>
  Hastily onward, feeling in his soul<br>
  A yearning like the yearning of a wave<br>
  That sees the shore stretch beautiful beyond it.<br>
  He found her pacing o&rsquo;er the sunlit lawn,<br>
  Lost in a dream that brought the fitful blood<br>
  In tremor to her cheek, and lent withal<br>
  To her high bearing such a tender grace&mdash;<br>
  No moonbeam sleeping in a chancels dusk,<br>
  Amid the splendor of emblazoned gules,<br>
  Could be more fair, or sweetlier blend in one<br>
  The light of heaven and the glow of earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladys,&rdquo;  he said, and smiling drew her hand<br>
  Closely in his; &ldquo;my heart is full to-night,<br>
  Full of true love for you, dear, as mine eyes<br>
  Are full of your rare beauty. Scarce can I<br>
  In my great happiness and glad content,<br>
  Believe that I have known you but a year,<br>
  Who now are joy, love, hope, and heaven to me,<br>
  That once knew none of these. For I have had<br>
  Through all my years a lonesome life and dark,<br>
  With overmuch of sorrow, and I stand<br>
  Just now where yonder hills stood at the dawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&lsquo;Twixt night and sunshine: in the future <i>thee</i>,<br>
  But in the past a long array of griefs,<br>
  Crushed hopes, ambitions lost, sweet friendship made<br>
  A mockery and a snare&mdash;a life of woe<br>
  Without a love to comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  a fancy,<br>
  A strange wild fancy, that we two were friends<br>
  Long, long ago, in an existence past,<br>
  And now but half remembered. In your face<br>
  I found no strangeness when I first beheld you,<br>
  Only the blossoming of some vague dream<br>
  Into sweet life and glad reality.<br>
  I do remember how in vain that day<br>
  I sought for that which had suggested you<br>
  And made your glance familiar; how my thoughts<br>
  Flew back in wavering flight along the years,<br>
  E&rsquo;en to the smile upon my mother&rsquo;s lips,<br>
  When in her arms I lay, a little child<br>
  Unconscious of my bliss, and felt my thoughts<br>
  Float on the music of her voice until<br>
  They stranded on the flowery shores of sleep.<br>
  But though her loveliness was like a breath<br>
  Of sunset glory on a silver cloud,<br>
  It was not yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  lost your mother, Paul!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Yes, Gladys, and with her the roseate hues<br>
  Which make the morn of childhood beautiful.<br>
  Thereafter life took sterner shades and thrilled<br>
  But to one touch, Ambition&rsquo;s. &lsquo;I will be <br>
  Great!&rsquo; was my watchword for the day;<br>
  And when at eve I laid my head to rest,<br>
  &lsquo;Twas still, &lsquo;I will be great!&rsquo; And so I toiled,<br>
  Struggled and anguished for a space of years<br>
  Along the rugged steeps which lead to Fame,<br>
  Feeling the need of love wax strong within<br>
  As my ways thickened. Why, in those hard days<br>
  The least child&rsquo;s smile would stir me to the heart<br>
  Like far off music, and a gentle word<br>
  Uttered in merest welcome or farewell,<br>
  Had power to soothe me like a breeze which brings<br>
  The south up on its pinions. Marvel not<br>
  That such slight things had power to move me; know<br>
  That he who steps on stones is glad to feel<br>
  The smallest spray of moss beneath his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  Gladys, I was pressing with the crowd<br>
  And with the crowd I faltered. Not for me<br>
  To jostle bruised and bruising to the goal<br>
  Where, on the rocky pinnacles of Fame,<br>
  Cluster the living garlands. So that hope<br>
  Died also, and I buried it and stood<br>
  Awhile above its grave, then went my way<br>
  Still without love or comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ceasing  there,<br>
  He gazed a moment on her half-turned cheek<br>
  And lowered lashes, marveling at the tears <br>
  Within her eyes, but finding her withal<br>
  More lovely to behold than when the rose<br>
  Lived in perpetual summer on her cheek.<br>
  For beauty such as hers is like a breath<br>
  Of distant music stealing through the hush<br>
  Of fragrant gardens, and like music draws<br>
  It&rsquo;s rarest charm from gentle melancholy.<br>
  But even a pearl will flush with sudden lights<br>
  If but the sun fall on it; so the cheek<br>
  Which but a moment since was pale as snow,<br>
  Grew dazzling with its shifting play of flame<br>
  Ev&rsquo;n as he gazed upon it, and the lips<br>
  Which had been very silent, woke and said.<br>
  And was there not one, then, of all your friends,<br>
  Whose frank affection could redeem the loss<br>
  Of these sad years? Though joy and hope were gone.<br>
  You had a brother, Paul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,  Gladys, true;<br>
  But we were bred in separate homes, and he<br>
  Has ever lived &lsquo;neath happier skies than I,<br>
  And known less sorrow. Born for joy alone.<br>
  He thrids the world as sunshine thrids a wood.<br>
  And all men love him, as in weal or woe<br>
  They never yet have loved or cherished me.<br>
  But child, you weep! Ah, have I then with words<br>
  Moved you so deeply. Gladys? Know you not<br>
  That such a joy as lives within me now.<br>
  Can, like the strings of an &AElig;olian harp.<br>
  Draw music from the roughest wind that blows<br>
  From those past hours of sorrow? Weep no more.<br>
  Or weep for joy alone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;The eye that pierces straightly to the future<br>
  Can never weep for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  future, Gladys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  and a sad smile flickered through her tears<br>
  Like a faint rainbow from a summer shower,<br>
  Which ere it arches &lsquo;gins to fade away.<br>
  &ldquo;Yon sky blooms very rosily,&rdquo; she said,<br>
  &ldquo;But look you where the shadowy palm of night<br>
  Steals up to pluck its roses. Hark,&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;Hear how the brooks below us in the woods<br>
  Twang on the stones! Like strings of silver bells<br>
  They laugh and sport as if all time were theirs,<br>
  Whereas already by their careless waves<br>
  The hot-mouthed Summer stoops her down to drink<br>
  The draught that is their death. Oh!&rdquo; she said,<br>
  &ldquo;Full many a vessel threads the gates of morn,<br>
  With spreading sails and gold upon its prow,<br>
  That ere the eve will bend beneath the storm.<br>
  And we&mdash;how know we if our moments run<br>
  To break on joy or sorrow? We can hope,<br>
  But hope itself is born of doubt, my friend,<br>
  Always in bud, but never quite a flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,  Gladys; but the trouble in your eyes<br>
  Hath borrowed darkness from a surer fear<br>
  Than this vague terror of an unknown morrow.<br>
  Then trust me with it, let me bear it for you;<br>
  Have I not vowed within mine inmost soul<br>
  To hold you much more precious than the world,<br>
  Yes, as the very blood within my veins,<br>
  And will you not then trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust  you?&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;Would unto God,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;would to God<br>
  All things came easy as my trust in you,&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Then  speak, I do constrain you; by your love<br>
  I do constrain you, Gladys. Silent yet?<br>
  Nay then,&rdquo; he said, and smiling, laid his hands<br>
  With tender care on either troubled cheek,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read your sorrows where I&rsquo;ve read your joys,<br>
  &nbsp;Ev&rsquo;n in your eyes, beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  she, like one<br>
  Struck to the heart by some quick shame or grief,<br>
  Shrank trembling back, nor met his gaze with hers,<br>
  But bowed her head and prayed him to forbear,<br>
  Saying that on the morrow; if he willed,<br>
  She would disclose him all her secret care,<br>
  But that for this one day she must crave patience.</p>
<p>But  ah, when morrow came and he returned<br>
  To that same spot beneath the woodland trees,<br>
  It was to find not Gladys, but a letter<br>
  Lying upon their simple rustic seat,<br>
  In which with many cries for his forgiveness,<br>
  She told him all her heart. How for long weeks<br>
  The truth had grown upon her as a cloud<br>
  Grows o&rsquo;er the sun, that not as he loved her<br>
  Could she love him. That liking and respect<br>
  Were not what he desired, nor what she<br>
  Had hoped alone to give him when she pledged<br>
  Hand unto hand and willing heart to heart,<br>
  And yet that these were all she truly had<br>
  To give for so great love as he gave her.<br>
  And how this knowledge had o&rsquo;ershadowed her,<br>
  Filling her nights with anguish and her days<br>
  With heavy shame and struggle, till her life<br>
  Grew bitter to her, and his words like swords<br>
  Cleft her and left deep wounds that would not heal.<br>
  And how in honor to his noble faith<br>
  She could no more deceive him, though her heart,<br>
  Her woman&rsquo;s fearful, trembling heart should break<br>
  With anguish for his sorrow. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she wrote,<br>
  &ldquo;Far liever had I died in my first youth,<br>
  Than lived to be a heavy grief to one<br>
  So noble and so loving. Blame me not;<br>
  For I have wrestled with my heart as one<br>
  Wrestles with fate itself; and all in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was a deadly blow! A blow like that<br>
  Which swooping unawares from out the night<br>
  Dashes a man from some high starlit peak<br>
  Into a void of cold and hurrying waves.<br>
  &lsquo;Twas not the loss alone. In that wild hour<br>
  Of first resistance, anguish, and despair,<br>
  He felt he could have borne her simple loss<br>
  So God had taken her. But loss of love!<br>
  Loss of belief in all the radiant past,<br>
  Of hope in years to come&mdash;ah, who but those<br>
  Whose lives have felt the shock of utter wreck,<br>
  Can rightly speak of what that hour of doom<br>
  Was to this man of sorrow!</p>
<p>Or  when later,<br>
  She with her sweet face worn by bitter tears,<br>
  Her young form trembling and her hands outstretched,<br>
  Came stealing through the forest to his side,<br>
  And kneeling at his feet entreated him<br>
  To look on her with pity and not blame,<br>
  For she had never meant to do him wrong,<br>
  What tongue can tell the feelings of his heart<br>
  As taking that bright head between his hands<br>
  He looked upon her face and gently said,<br>
  &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, I do not blame you, Gladys,<br>
  God knows I love you with too deep a love<br>
  To seek to rob you for my selfish ends<br>
  Of that dear right which gives to woman&rsquo;s vow<br>
  Its heart significance. Nor would I seek<br>
  By any plea of loss in hope or love<br>
  To make your loss the greater. But, dear child,<br>
  There yet is left to manhood one true plea,<br>
  The plea of your own happiness. For child,<br>
  I know That I can make you happy. There is that<br>
  Hid in this breast which needs must call from yours<br>
  Some echo in the years that are to come.<br>
  And Gladys, Gladys, though you know it not,<br>
  No other man can give what I have given,<br>
  Nor were it well he should. It is your youth<br>
  Which has been speaking. Youth has needs, I know,<br>
  And headlong yearnings like the mountain streams<br>
  That rush adown the nearest path they find<br>
  To meet the sounding river; but, oh child,<br>
  In womanhood the heart is like the sea,<br>
  Deep, deep, and self-contained, but yearning still<br>
  Through all its mighty billows for a shore<br>
  To break in strength upon. Remember this;<br>
  And by the stately womanhood I see<br>
  Budding within the gentle girl I love,<br>
  Pause ere it be too late.&rdquo; And with the gleam<br>
  Of something like a smile upon his lips,<br>
  He held his hand out, whispering in her ear,<br>
  &ldquo;If be you cannot answer me for tears,<br>
  But lay your hand, though e&rsquo;er so light, on mine,<br>
  And I shall understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  she as though<br>
  Made frantic by her helplessness and grief,<br>
  Struck her two palms together as in prayer,<br>
  And stood there murmuring with white lips,<br>
  &ldquo;O Christ,<br>
  Help me! Thou who renouncedst thy will and life,<br>
  Hear me this hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  unto him there came<br>
  An awful change, and from her side he turned<br>
  Away and hunted slowly for the sun<br>
  Like one whom God has blinded. &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;You have not told me all,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;I have not told you all.&rdquo; And bowing down<br>
  As though she fain had knelt before his face,<br>
  She whispered of another love than his<br>
  Which had, though all unconscious, caught her heart<br>
  Within its subtle radiance. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said,<br>
  &ldquo;I meant to be most true; but when he came,<br>
  And when he spake and looked on me and smiled,<br>
  I know not how but all my life seemed changed.<br>
  And yet he came, and I for very shame<br>
  Could not forbid his coming. How could I,<br>
  Since you were blind, and he had said no words<br>
  Save as friends speak or brothers! Bear with me;<br>
  I am most weak, but for your sake will strive,<br>
  Yes, and will conquer, so you send him hence<br>
  Where we may meet him never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send  him hence?<br>
  <i>I</i> send him hence? As friends speak or  as brothers?<br>
  You tremble so I cannot understand&mdash;<br>
  As brothers, Gladys, brothers?&rdquo; And she saw<br>
  A stony pallor steal across his face.<br>
  And felt his hand fall heavy on his breast<br>
  As he had had a blow too dread for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  my false heart, what hast thou done?&rdquo; she moaned,<br>
  And drawing nearer, touched his sleeve and strove<br>
  To look upon his face; and called him Paul,<br>
  Dear Paul, and laid her head against his arm<br>
  Sobbing, &ldquo;I am to be your wife; O Paul,<br>
  Hear me, your wife!&rdquo; But he, in nowise moved,<br>
  Answered her not save with a single word<br>
  That fell as hopes fall, or as if all life<br>
  Went with it, and that word was <i>Ralph</i>.</p>
<p>She  heard<br>
  And thrilled through all her being like a harp<br>
  Touched in the passing; while across her lip<br>
  A light passed and upon her tearful cheek<br>
  Rested, as though the very name had power<br>
  To rouse her beauty, as a tremulous wind<br>
  Opens unto its depths a wild-wood flower.<br>
  But he who bent above her shivered once<br>
  Through all his frame, and, glancing down, unloosed<br>
  Her hands from off his arm and turned away<br>
  Blindly toward the shadows. Then once more<br>
  Did Gladys in an ecstasy of pain<br>
  Entreat him for a word, a look, a sign<br>
  Of his forgiveness; striving hard to break<br>
  The spell which bound him, holding out her hands<br>
  And telling o&rsquo;er her simple tale again<br>
  With many words of sorrow and remorse<br>
  And hard self-accusation; till at last<br>
  He turned and looked upon her with a sigh<br>
  And said, &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; and still as in a dream,<br>
  Once more, &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; and so passed by and moved<br>
  Heavily away into the shadowy dusk.<br>
  And lo! as thus he went, far in the West<br>
  The last faint crimson died, while chill and keen<br>
  A wind came winging through the gates of night<br>
  And o&rsquo;er the valley blew, until the trees<br>
  Bowed down their heads and all was dark and drear,<br>
  Where but an hour ago was bloom and joy,<br>
  Sunshine and color and the song of birds.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>It  was the end; or e&rsquo;er three days had passed,<br>
  This letter, breathing love&rsquo;s renunciation,<br>
  Was placed in Gladys&rsquo; hand; &ldquo;Dear child;<br>
  You will forgive me that I do not come<br>
  To say farewell, since farewell must be said;<br>
  You will forgive me, Gladys, It is meet<br>
  That I should go. I love you, dear, too much</p>
<p>To  wed you. &lsquo;Twere not well, not well indeed,<br>
  That I who feel the pressure of my years<br>
  Heavily at times, should mate with one so young<br>
  The violets are blowing in her life.<br>
  Then take this boon from me and hold it choice,<br>
  As I have held it while I called it mine,<br>
  Take back yourself, dear; not in grief but peace,<br>
  For I am bless&egrave;d only in your joy,<br>
  Nor fear to yield your maiden troth again,<br>
  For he is very noble and will hold<br>
  You precious, else I had not left you, Gladys.<br>
  And he will make you happier far than I,<br>
  As he is happier-natured. Trust in him,<br>
  And his glad spirit like a golden bell<br>
  Will answer to the lightest touch of thine,<br>
  Filling your home with melody. And now<br>
  No less I bless you that I write this day<br>
  Against my name the tender title<br>
  Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
<p>But  Gladys, in whose gentle bosom glowed<br>
  The light of purest purpose, felt her soul<br>
  Recoil before this prospect of delight<br>
  Built on another&rsquo;s woe. &ldquo;What, go my ways<br>
  Girded with happiness and gay with hope,<br>
  While he whose hand hath clung to mine in troth,<br>
  Walks in the shadow cast by my delight,<br>
  An exile from his home! No, no, O no!<br>
  If hearts are weak, souls should at least be strong;<br>
  I cannot as true woman do this thing.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And  though with added thought and certain proof<br>
  That he had gone to come again no more,<br>
  Rose many shy sweet pictures of the bliss<br>
  Which might be hers would she but turn to meet<br>
  The passion glowing in young Isham&rsquo;s eyes,<br>
  She gave it as her final verdict out,<br>
  That while his brother lived she ne&rsquo;er should give<br>
  Her hand unto another, troth at least,<br>
  If not her heart, being her own to grant<br>
  Or to withhold as faith and duty prompted.<br>
  Nor though she was of gentlest mind and heart<br>
  Could she be moved from this by any plea<br>
  Wisdom or love could urge, but firm and true<br>
  Kept to her faith, though day by day her cheek<br>
  Paled, and the glance so proudly radiant once<br>
  Grew all so dim, that those who held her dear<br>
  Shrank as they looked upon her wan young face,<br>
  Crying within their hearts, &ldquo;The child will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  they were right; had there not come a change<br>
  Fair Gladys would have died. &lsquo;Twas not that love<br>
  Had built so firm a seat within her spirit,<br>
  That disappointment threatened all with ruin,<br>
  But that the seeds of wild remorse were there,<br>
  A grievous sense of wrong to those two hearts<br>
  So firm and generous in their deep devotion.<br>
  But ev&rsquo;n as life seemed bending &lsquo;neath its load,<br>
  There came to Benton tidings of the wreck,<br>
  With loss of all on board, of the good ship<br>
  In which Paul Isham voyaged to the East.<br>
  And keen as was the pang of grief his death<br>
  Brought to her faithful soul, the strain that bore<br>
  So hard upon her tender soul was eased;<br>
  And like a flower that shakes the first light snow<br>
  From its transparent leaves, she thrilled anew<br>
  To life and to a beauty more replete<br>
  For the faint hint of sorrow in its joy.</p>
<p>But  though young Ralph came wooing with the spring,<br>
  Fair Gladys would not listen till the year<br>
  Of widowhood and mourning was fulfilled.<br>
  &ldquo;For I was his betrothed,&rdquo; she whispered low,<br>
  &ldquo;And being such, should feel my shame complete,<br>
  If I should wind a wreath around my brow<br>
  Ere a year&rsquo;s stars could circle o&rsquo;er his grave.&rdquo;<br>
  But when the early Fall had surely brought<br>
  All spring hopes to fulfillment, these were wed,<br>
  And in the glow of their perfected love<br>
  Found happiness at last and full content<br>
  Beyond their fondest dreaming. Yet withal<br>
  There was a wave of sorrow in the joy<br>
  Of Gladys&rsquo; breast at least; a gentle wave<br>
  That yet made saddest music, when it throbbed<br>
  Across the hush of midnight or the swell<br>
  Of careless mirth in which she took no part.</p>
<p>For  now it was she &lsquo;gan to dream strange dreams<br>
  Of him whom they deemed perished, but whom she<br>
  Saw ever moving free amongst his kind,<br>
  A living, breathing man. So plain indeed<br>
  She saw this noble figure come and go<br>
  Amid the lighter fancies of her sleep,<br>
  She scarce could tell or that were life or this<br>
  First waking with the sun upon her cheek<br>
  And he no longer near. And still so oft<br>
  This single dream returned, she seemed to live<br>
  A double life beneath the skies, and give<br>
  One half to him she loved, and one to him<br>
  Who loving her had perished for her sake.<br>
  Yet not as though she met him face to face,<br>
  She saw him, dreaming; but as one who moved<br>
  Before her in a life which was not hers,<br>
  And yet was life with earnest hopes and cares<br>
  And duties manifold. And now as one<br>
  Who bends above the couches of the sick,<br>
  She saw him from afar, a steady light<br>
  Among a whirl of shadows; now as one<br>
  Who striveth with a heaving, threatening crowd<br>
  That beat about him restlessly and wild,<br>
  While he stands firm, a tower of stately strength,<br>
  Amid a sea of waves; and now again<br>
  Alone and musing o&rsquo;er an empty hearth,<br>
  With just a tress of gold within his hand&mdash;<br>
  She knows, ah, who so well! But whether thus,<br>
  Or whether moving in the hurrying crowd<br>
  Of street or church or mart, forever calm,<br>
  Forever with that smile upon his lips<br>
  Which spake of sorrow past and peace regained.<br>
  So deep this smile, so deep the faithful gaze<br>
  That sometimes turned upon her from afar,<br>
  Demanding not but blessing, that she woke<br>
  Ofttimes in tears, to find her arms stretched out<br>
  Across her husband to the silent stars,<br>
  And waking, shudders, that a dream should be<br>
  More vital true than life. And though at first<br>
  She fain had told her husband all her heart<br>
  And all her grief and yearning, yet as time<br>
  Rolled slowly by and brought her no relief,<br>
  She learned to hush her secret in her breast,<br>
  And ponder it in silence when the stars<br>
  Clomb slowly past the turrets of the house,<br>
  And lingered in the swaying trees beneath,<br>
  Like troops of steady watchers.</p>
<p>Thus  the years<br>
  Passed slowly by, but not until there lay<br>
  A second blooming infant on her knee,<br>
  Did she dare whisper to her soul and say,<br>
  Her friend Paul Isham lived. But even then<br>
  She spake not, seeing men so rarely trust<br>
  To woman&rsquo;s intuitions, but would sit<br>
  Ofttimes and muse, her chin within her palm,<br>
  Like one who looks on visions from afar,<br>
  No other eye can see.</p>
<p>And  now there came<br>
  A certain day when Gladys felt her doubts<br>
  Grow to a sure belief within her breast,<br>
  No after-thought might shake. She had been sitting<br>
  Beside an open casement where the vines<br>
  Slow creeping from below but half concealed<br>
  The rounded beauty of her cradling arms<br>
  And tender mother-smile. Across the hush<br>
  Of the calm twilight she could hear the voice<br>
  Of little Paul, as o&rsquo;er the lawn beneath<br>
  He fluttered half in view, when suddenly<br>
  There came a silence so assured and deep,<br>
  She felt as though a sudden gate had oped<br>
  Deep in her soul, through which a bursting light<br>
  Swift pouring, checked the breath upon her lips<br>
  In sacred wonder. Rising swiftly up,<br>
  She laid the sleeping infant from her arms,<br>
  And stood in all her loveliness revealed,<br>
  The light of feeling shimmering on her face<br>
  Like summer starlight on a trembling wave.<br>
  And lo! as thus she stood, there came a sound,<br>
  A whispered sigh, a sudden stifled moan,<br>
  That even as she listened passed away.<br>
  But when a little later she beheld<br>
  A muffled form emerge from out the trees<br>
  And vanish in the shadows of the lawn,<br>
  She felt a sudden fever smite her soul,<br>
  And bounding forward, let one single cry<br>
  Leap towards it through the vines, then tottering, sank<br>
  All helpless with her hands across the sill,<br>
  But with her face still turned the way he went,<br>
  As if her look alone might serve in power<br>
  To bring him back again.</p>
<p>And  thus it was<br>
  Her young son found her when he came in haste<br>
  To tell her of a stranger he had met<br>
  But now among the trees. &ldquo;So bowed,&rdquo; he cried,<br>
  &ldquo;I scarce could see his face, and yet so strong<br>
  He took me in his arms and kissed me, mother,<br>
  As I have seen you kiss the little cross<br>
  That was the gift of my dear uncle Paul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  she who listened bent her head once more,<br>
  And through the sacred tremor of her tears<br>
  Cried softly, &ldquo;Yes, my son, strong, strong indeed;<br>
  The earth holds no such other.&rdquo; Then in haste<br>
  Uprising, caused an instant hurried search<br>
  For one, a stranger, passed but now from view<br>
  Across the twilight grounds. But though they sought<br>
  From early evening till the stars were bright,<br>
  They found him not, and when the morrow came<br>
  &lsquo;Twas told her how the stranger seen last eve<br>
  Had passed away at midnight from the town,<br>
  To come again no more. And pondering this,<br>
  She felt the shadows lift from off the past,<br>
  And show her, as in some strange magic glass,<br>
  The story of the years, and how his heart<br>
  Had loved her so, he rather chose the ways<br>
  Of lonely exile than to cry as false<br>
  The dire report which, like an open gate<br>
  Had wooed her feet into the paths of joy.<br>
  And moved to the pure depths of her true heart,<br>
  She bowed her head and vowed, with God&rsquo;s high aid,<br>
  To make her life a blessing and a prayer,<br>
  That in the pure and freer world to come,<br>
  She might stand unrebuked by conscious wrong,<br>
  Betwixt the noble twain whose love had been<br>
  The grief and solace of her earthly years,<br>
  And looking up in either shining face,<br>
  See benediction there. And though from this<br>
  Her dreams forsook her to return no more,<br>
  There used to steal at times across her ear<br>
  A sound, a whisper, like a wave that broke<br>
  Far on a lonely shore: &ldquo;Grieve not for me,<br>
  For I am blessed only in your joy,<br>
  So for my sake be happy.&rdquo; </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="RosaDying"></a>Rosa, Dying</b></h2>

  I yet could pace the budding earth and find<br>
  No gladder angel singing in the wind.<br>
  To-night with ear turned vainly to the breeze,<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ATragedyOfSedan"></a>A Tragedy Of  Sedan</b></h2>
<p>I HAD  seen him in battle, and he was a man<br>
  To watch in a conflict&mdash;had seen him when death<br>
  Struck down at his feet the one comrade he loved&mdash;<br>
  But never before, upon field or in camp,<br>
  Had beheld on his face such a look of the grave,<br>
  As he brought yesternight to the door of my tent<br>
  When the evening guns sounded. So ghastly it was,<br>
  So dread in suggestion of anguish, I leapt<br>
  In dismay to my feet. Was he ill? Was he hurt?<br>
  But his eyes staring on without sight made me pause.<br>
  &lsquo;Twas not death, but despair; and I hastily cried,<br>
  &ldquo;The man has lost hope, is in grief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  at that<br>
  He was straight at my side with a bound: &ldquo;Ay, in grief!<br>
  And you talk of it, you! talk of grief! but &lsquo;tis easy.<br>
  We all talk of grief. I have heard of a man<br>
  Who looked at a scaffold above him and said&mdash;<br>
  Laughjng too as he spake&mdash;&lsquo;If by chance it should fall,<br>
  &lsquo;Twould crush me, no doubt.&rsquo; When a moment from that<br>
  It <i>did</i> fall, he shrieked. Ah, yes&mdash;&rdquo;  he went on,<br>
  &ldquo;Was it strange? Just as I could shriek now who behold&mdash;<br>
  But enough. I must tell you the whole from the first,<br>
  Or go mad before morning. My friend&mdash;&rdquo; and his eyes<br>
  Glared wildly on mine through his thick, fallen hair&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Have you loved? Yes,&rdquo; he went on more shrill, &ldquo;in the pause<br>
  Of the death-dealing guns one may ask&mdash;may he not?&mdash;<br>
  Such a question as that of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  reply<br>
  I drew from my bosom a curl that I kissed,<br>
  And put back on my heart without word. &lsquo;Twas enough.<br>
  He bent down at my side with a cry: &ldquo;Is she fair?<br>
  Hath she eyes like a dove and a step like a deer,<br>
  So gentle and wild? Do you love her&mdash;O Heaven!&mdash;<br>
  With the force of your body, your spirit, and heart?<br>
  With a flame and a star in your soul? Ah!&rdquo; he gasped,<br>
  &ldquo;It is folly to ask: a woman must die<br>
  Or turn false to be loved so. Pray God&mdash;&rdquo; and he paused<br>
  With a sudden quick clench of his hand&mdash;&ldquo;you may die<br>
  Ere you come to a passion like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking  down,<br>
  He took from his finger a ring which he wore,<br>
  Gazed on it a moment in anguish, then said:<br>
  &ldquo;She was pledged to me, friend; was my hope from a child;<br>
  Was my life, you might say. In the mesh of her glance<br>
  All my being was thralled. Not a dawn rose upon me<br>
  But I woke with the thought of her beauty. The sun<br>
  Was not more to mine eyes than her smile. Ah, I know<br>
  Such a love is not good&mdash;that its passion undoes<br>
  What its purity makes. But a man cannot choose<br>
  His fate from the heavens; and this love, as it was,<br>
  Was my fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  her heart gave response to my suit,<br>
  And we had been wedded two long years ago;<br>
  But love is ambitious. To give her a home<br>
  I left her, and far from her glance and her smile,<br>
  Worked my way up to fortune. Oh, oh, the long months!<br>
  But they passed, and at length, like a dawn on the night,<br>
  Came the day of return. Ah, that day! Like a flame<br>
  It flares ever before me; her looks and her smiles<br>
  Will not flit, will not fly. As we walked up the street<br>
  The bells brake out ringing. For three months of doom<br>
  I have heard them; they never have ceased in my ears <br>
  Day and night, night and day. But, strange as it seems,<br>
  At the moment they rang, I was deaf. &lsquo;Twas her voice<br>
  Whose music I listened to then. In her hand<br>
  She bore a white lily; and when at the fount<br>
  The children came down from the village to crown<br>
  Her locks with wild posies plucked up from the woods,<br>
  I scarcely do think I had heard yonder guns<br>
  Had they split at my side. Do you marvel, then, friend,<br>
  I was deaf to his voice, though he stood at her sleeve<br>
  Like a brother?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  no dwelling on that. &lsquo;Tis enough<br>
  I was happy that day; that its glory was like<br>
  The flushing of sunset across the wild waste<br>
  Of a billowy sea ere the night fell. Ah! ah!<br>
  You wonder what now!<br>
  You, sitting at ease, in your tent, with the tress<br>
  Of a tender, true woman like balm on your breast,<br>
  Wonder what could have turned all this rapture to woe<br>
  In a moment Ah, God! &lsquo;twas not much! Just a rent<br>
  In the woof of my fair nuptial garment! Not much;<br>
  Only this; When I rose in the dusk from my guests<br>
  (&lsquo;Twas my wedding-eve, friend; she had smiled on me, too,<br>
  But an instant before) my beloved was gone!<br>
  Yes, yes,&rdquo; he shrieked out, &ldquo;gone as certain as joy&mdash;<br>
  Gone, gone, gone, gone! Not a word of farewell,<br>
  Not a look: just that smile that was love, or like love,<br>
  And then this great gulf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  oh may the world<br>
  Grow old and shrink up in the hands of the Lord<br>
  Ere another night creep by like that!<br>
  Not till morn Did they tell me the whole&mdash;how for weeks he had been<br>
  In the town at her side; stealing up in the dusk<br>
  To drop a stray rose in her hand&mdash;how for weeks<br>
  She had drooped her sweet head and said never a word<br>
  When the neighbors would ply her with questions.<br>
  I say<br>
  It was not until morning they told me all this,<br>
  Meantime she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I lived&mdash;lived to seek him.<br>
  Do you know what that means? By the chances of war<br>
  You have been in your time the hunted, spent deer;<br>
  Have you e&rsquo;er been the hound? Can you reckon of days<br>
  When, with fire in your blood and revolt in your brain,<br>
  You wandered the world with your eyes on the face<br>
  Of each man that you met? And the nights&mdash;<br>
  The nights without sleep; and the dreams&mdash;<br>
  The visions that swam in the air, and made hot<br>
  The breath of the north wind; the doubts and the hopes,<br>
  The terror and longing; and all through the whole<br>
  The feel of the deadly cold steel on the breast?<br>
  And the women&mdash;the horrid, sick dread in the blood<br>
  Of their smiles, of their voices, the touch of their hands,<br>
  The thrill of their garments against you: and then<br>
  The frenzy of fear lest the next that you met<br>
  Should be <i>she;</i> the taste in the air,  on the tongue,<br>
  Of blood and of poison. And the shame!<br>
  Is it writ on the heavens or not? Is it spelled<br>
  On the pavement before you, or scrawled on the walls?<br>
  It is there, it is here, on the forehead, the hands,<br>
  In the blood, in the nostrils. And I loved her, I loved her,<br>
  Great Heaven! and did yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  was anguish, you say.<br>
  Ah, you think so? For three months I lived in it, friend,<br>
  And then came despair, I had missed him&mdash;&rsquo;twas done:<br>
  Let me be done, too. From the German frontier<br>
  Rose a clamor for soldiers. I heard, and grew calm.<br>
  &lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Men are shot in the field:<br>
  &nbsp;Let the enemy slay me.&rsquo; So I came to the  war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  paused here a moment, and drew from his breast<br>
  A crumpled white paper streaked over with blood,<br>
  And laid it before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  say this was anguish,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I say<br>
  It was nothing&mdash;just nothing, My friend, can you think <br>
  What it were, or might be, if the woman you love&mdash;<br>
  Nay, nay, hear me out&mdash;should be playing above<br>
  The horrid steep side of a gulf, and you saw<br>
  Her footsteps draw nearer and nearer, and yet<br>
  Were too far to shriek warning; and at last as you looked,<br>
  Beheld her slip over&mdash;those eyes that you love,<br>
  The forehead, the hair&mdash;saw her struggle and catch<br>
  At some dizzy small branch that would hold but a breath,<br>
  And you yet afar? Can you think what it were<br>
  To hear her shriek out with assurance you&rsquo;d heed<br>
  And would come, and that instant, while heaven and earth<br>
  Were one glare, and you rushed, to be caught, man, be caught<br>
  In a network of hell which you could not escape,<br>
  While she&mdash;she your heart&rsquo;s own&mdash;O death! yet is that<br>
  My soul-torment, look there!&rdquo; and his shaking hand smoothed<br>
  The white paper before me. &ldquo;Did you think she was false?<br>
  She was true, friend, was true; true as light, true as Heaven,<br>
  I have known it three hours. Was not false, was not base,<br>
  O my darling! my darling!</p>
<p>Beguiled,  do you see&mdash;<br>
  Wooed away from my side with some smooth, hurried tale,<br>
  Till the length of the garden lay &lsquo;twixt us. Ah! ah!<br>
  Is there vengeance in hell for such villains? The rest?<br>
  You can guess how it happened&mdash;his sudden appeal&mdash;<br>
  The carriage&mdash;the horses&mdash;her cry which we heard not&mdash;<br>
  The rapid strong whirl of her head on his breast&mdash;<br>
  Then the rush and the night. Do you doubt it is true?<br>
  It is all written here. See the tremulous lines<br>
  How they cross and recross. But she&rsquo;s true; &lsquo;tis enough,<br>
  Four whole months and yet true. She has sworn it, and now<br>
  Do you see all my anguish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  hand and with voice<br>
  I strove in my pity to calm him: but he,<br>
  Staggering backward, went on: &ldquo; &lsquo;Tis not all: she is held<br>
  In his power by his spies; he would wed her &mdash;great Heaven!<br>
  Make her countess or something; just stab her, I say!<br>
  And she calls me, entreats me, by all I adore,<br>
  To come quick, for she slips to destruction. Ha! ha!&rdquo;<br>
  And his awful laugh whirled on the night-wind; &ldquo;Come quick!<br>
  And I&rsquo;m bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  it came to this spot&mdash;when, I know not.<br>
  It was put in my hands as I strode from the field, <br>
  By some one who cried, &lsquo;If you hasten, perhaps<br>
  You have time still to save her.&rsquo; Away to the chief<br>
  I hurried, a madman. What was France to me now,<br>
  Or the world? I fell down at his feet in despair;<br>
  Told him all; showed my billet&mdash;in vain, all in vain!<br>
  And to-morrow&rsquo;s the day of the battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  in that<br>
  He had touched the whole depth of his woe, he flung up<br>
  His arms to the sky for a moment, and then<br>
  Sank down like one shot. When I rose from his side,<br>
  The dread morn of battle flamed high in the East.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Do  you ask me for more? Lift the end of that cloth,<br>
  And behold! It is calm now, you see, sirs, quite calm&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Twas not so yester eve. As he fell, all the din<br>
  Of the battle served not to o&rsquo;erwhelm from my ears<br>
  The shriek that he gave. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair pleasure-seeking France!<br>
  France of the laughing lip and careless eye!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the lamp to light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy footsteps through the night<br>
  Now day has fled and darkness fills the sky?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What crown of hope remaineth  now<br>
  The noontide flowers are dead upon thy chilling brow?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  strength hast thou to meet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unshod hurrying feet,<br>
  The rocky steeps and rugged paths of war?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the fields are past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavens overcast,<br>
  And north winds blow upon thee from afar?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What songs are left for thee to  sing<br>
  Now that the timbrel&rsquo;s hushed and clarion trumpets ring?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curse  not the bitter hour!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the full blown flower<br>
  Cometh the fruit; as sowing ye shall reap.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bearded corn shall shoot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up from the bramble&rsquo;s root,<br>
  And strength arise unshorn from sensual sleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the head of less than  Jove<br>
  Shall great Minerva spring and in full armor move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had  ye no ears to hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty warning clear,<br>
  &ldquo;Watch, for ye know not when the hour may come?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ye no eyes to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small cloud&rsquo;s prophecy<br>
  Writ on the face of heaven&rsquo;s cerulean dome?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there no threatening shade  forecast<br>
  Along thy sunny path from all the frowning past?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst  think that God could brook<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon thy sports to look<br>
  Forevermore nor stir upon His throne?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That through the measured beat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ceaseless dancing feet<br>
  No sounds arose in woeful undertone?<br>

  By day and night his echoing steps advance;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fling thy gilded baubles  down;<br>

  Shining in your lifted eyes?</p>
<p>What  new words are in the breeze?<br>
  What new whispers in the trees?<br>
  What soft language gently drips<br>
  From the roses&rsquo; crimson lips;</p>
<p>That  you wear so fresh a joy<br>
  In your smile&rsquo;s and glances coy;<br>
  That in every gesture fine<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="IsabelMaynor"></a>Isabel  Maynor</b></h2>
<p>I SAT  with Philip &lsquo;neath his own roof-tree,<br>
  Watching his children sporting on the lea,<br>
  And half in pleasure at a scene so bright,<br>
  And half in envy of their young delight,<br>
  Uttered a sigh which all unconscious, he,<br>
  My well-loved friend repeated after me;<br>
  But in so doing hesitated not<br>
  To turn and ask what genius of the spot<br>
  Had filled my soul so full of bliss or woe,<br>
  A single breath could make it overflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;possessed of every good<br>
  Which earth can lavish in her happiest mood;<br>
  A loving wife, a home where Pan might dwell<br>
  Forgetful of his flower-bespangled dell,<br>
  Can ask a houseless wanderer like me<br>
  In face of all this happiness I see,<br>
  What grief or joy can fill my spirit so,<br>
  A single breath can make it overflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  houseless wanderer has but to wed,<br>
  To taste himself these vaunted sweets,&rdquo; he said;<br>
  &ldquo;Fair women, friend, are not so scarce, I wot,<br>
  That one like you need mourn a lonely lot.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Fair women, Philip,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;bestrow<br>
  The world with smiles whichever way we go;<br>
  But ah, for me one fairest woman&rsquo;s face<br>
  Hath made me blind to every other&rsquo;s grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah  then, you love,&rdquo; he whispered; and a gray<br>
  &nbsp;Dull shadow fell upon his manner gay.<br>
  &ldquo;But hold!&rdquo; and flinging up the casement wide,<br>
  He sat again with forehead turned aside;<br>
  &ldquo;As we are friends, you shall the whole recall<br>
  From her first smile to the blank end of all,<br>
  I am in mood to hear somewhat of grief,<br>
  Perhaps to set mine own joy in relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitter  his smile, but sick of heart and worn<br>
  By a hard burden long in sorrow borne,<br>
  I only paused to cast one other glance<br>
  On those fair children in their mystic dance;<br>
  Then while their sweet tones trembled on the air<br>
  And mingled with my story unaware,<br>
  I told this tale of simple love and loss&mdash;<br>
  My daily memory and secret cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;far hence among the hills,<br>
  Where waves the birch and spring the mountain rills,<br>
  There stands a cottage whose four walls inclose<br>
  The sweetest maiden that this hard world knows.<br>
  Humble her home, but ah, the lowliest spot<br>
  May serve to hide the sweet forget-me-not;<br>
  The simplest glen that darkens in the woods,<br>
  Hold a shy moonbeam in its solitudes;<br>
  And Bella Maynor, though of humble birth.<br>
  Is fair to see as any flower of earth,<br>
  Ethereally pure, and full as bright<br>
  As softest moonbeam of a summer&rsquo;s night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was by chance I found her; sweetest things<br>
  Come often thus, as from the welkin springs<br>
  The evening star when we but look to see<br>
  The stretch and shine of blue immensity,<br>
  I had been wandering &lsquo;neath a summer&rsquo;s sun<br>
  All day among the mountains with my gun,<br>
  When, stooping wearily above a stream,<br>
  I saw a shadow quivering in its gleam,<br>
  And glancing up, beheld her standing there<br>
  Against my side, with softly bashful air,<br>
  Offering a cup, and saying, I confess,<br>
  Words which I heard not for her loveliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  took the cup; and, like the ocean shell<br>
  Which charmeth first by beauties visible,<br>
  She charmed that day, with lovely looks serene,<br>
  The tender harmony of face and mien;<br>
  But afterwards the music in the shell,<br>
  The sweetness of the soul made audible,<br>
  Grew on me and I vowed within my mind,<br>
  That she alone, of all fair womankind,<br>
  Should be mine own, and, by the name of wife,<br>
  Walk with me through the chance and change of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  as the summer days and evenings passed,<br>
  Swift as a wind with music on the blast,<br>
  I found her brightest fancies were but flowers<br>
  Wreathed o&rsquo;er the weariness of waiting hours.<br>
  She loved, I know not how the knowledge came<br>
  Unto me first&mdash;in coldness or in flame,<br>
  In gentle converse or abstracted look,<br>
  Beside the stream, or o&rsquo;er some poet&rsquo;s book.<br>
  Enough that time the certain knowledge brought<br>
  She held a secret in her inmost thought;<br>
  A secret which in shyly hiding, she<br>
  Revealed to all around unconsciously;<br>
  As timid violets lade the ambient air<br>
  With their heart&rsquo;s richest fragrance, unaware<br>
  The fragrance whispers that the flower is there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  as the weeks fled by us and there came<br>
  No one across my pathway to reclaim<br>
  The hand I took at morn and evening light<br>
  With joyful greeting or too sad good night,<br>
  I &lsquo;gan to think her love was but a dream,<br>
  A star to fade in morning&rsquo;s fervent beam,<br>
  And mine alone the worship worth the while<br>
  Of that deep glance and shy, ecstatic smile;<br>
  And thinking thus, began to hope and blend<br>
  The reverent lover with the earnest friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  ah, with the first hint of my desire,<br>
  She flashed one moment with indignant fire,<br>
  Then, slowly paling, told me that her faith<br>
  Was hers no more to grant this side of death;<br>
  And all unconscious of the light which lay<br>
  Upon her beauty in a vermeil ray,<br>
  Lifted her head and smiled, as if her eyes<br>
  Beheld afar the hills of Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I scarce waiting till the soft delight<br>
  Had flashed and faded from her forehead bright,<br>
  Bent to her ear and whispered, &lsquo;It is well,<br>
  But where is he who holds it, Isabel?<br>
  The summer comes; the tender summer goes;<br>
  The woods of Autumn blossom like the rose;<br>
  Winter descends; but he whose blessed right<br>
  It is to make your every season bright,<br>
  He only lingers; then as to a friend<br>
  Tell me in what far country he can wend,<br>
  Who holds in trust a heart so dear as this,<br>
  And yet can wander from his rightful bliss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  did not answer, but her very frame<br>
  Seemed breathing forth a bright ethereal flame;<br>
  I felt the sudden splendor of her gaze<br>
  Surround and hold me like a summer&rsquo;s haze,<br>
  Yet could not quite forbear to say again,<br>
  &lsquo;I would not doubt, but men are ever men,<br>
  And much I fear he may not love so well<br>
  As this pure trust deserveth, Isabel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;His  love to mine,&rsquo; she answered through a blush<br>
  As tremulous as rose upon its bush,<br>
  &lsquo;Is as the moon unto a timid star;<br>
  His shines, while mine but quivers from afar.<br>
  His love&mdash;it is as boundless as the sky,<br>
  And tender as the tear-drop in the eye,<br>
  As earnest as the sunlight upon earth,<br>
  As warm as leaping fire on the hearth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;And  yet&mdash;&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; she answered slow,<br>
  &lsquo;You see no evidence of this, I know.<br>
  But ah, for me it lies within my heart;<br>
  It is enough for me to feel the start<br>
  Of mine own blood, to know that he is true,<br>
  Though all the world should fail, that he is true,<br>
  And will come yet to take unto his side<br>
  The humble mountain maiden for his bride,<br>
  That sooner than had doubted him, had died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Twas  faith like that of saints for the dear Lord;<br>
  I felt my vain hopes perish at the word;<br>
  And bending o&rsquo;er that sacred head, I took<br>
  &nbsp;Her hand in mine with my last lover  look.<br>
  &lsquo;Bella,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;one word; but tell his name,<br>
  And I will trench no more upon his claim.&rsquo;<br>
  And looking in my face she told it me<br>
  As one deals coin from golden treasury,<br>
  But telling, flushed, as if her tongue had given<br>
  To mortal ears what but belonged to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I, with reverence in my eye and soul,<br>
  Bent o&rsquo;er her hand in lately learned control,<br>
  And praying God to bless her with His grace,<br>
  Went forth to hide the sorrow in my face;<br>
  Went forth to whisper to the brook and sky<br>
  The anguish of a love that could not die;<br>
  But which constrained me from that self-same day,<br>
  To seek in city street or mountain way,<br>
  The owner of the name I heard her say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  though for five long years I wandered wide<br>
  Through many a town, by many a fair hillside,<br>
  I have not found him, and my weary heart<br>
  Forgets not yet that moment&rsquo;s bitter smart;<br>
  Forgets not yet that form of tender grace,<br>
  The wild-flower loveliness of Bella&rsquo;s face,<br>
  Nor can forget till o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s fading hills<br>
  Descends the night that ends all human ills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Softly  I ceased; but he who sat beside<br>
  Rose to his feet and bending o&rsquo;er me, cried,<br>
  &ldquo;The name, what was it?&rdquo; And half wonderingly,<br>
  I answered, &ldquo;It was Philip, Philip Lee.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;And mine?&rdquo; &ldquo;And yours,&rdquo; I stammered under breath,<br>
  &ldquo;Is Philip Morton.&rdquo; &ldquo;Philip Lee,&rdquo; he saith.<br>
  &ldquo;Lee Morton, friend; ah, ah you did not know,<br>
  Nor she, poor child, who loved and trusted so,<br>
  A man could wear half names beside the hearth<br>
  Of her he held the dearest upon earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  while I sat confused, o&rsquo;ercome, dismayed,<br>
  He bowed his head upon his hands, and said,<br>
  &ldquo;I meant not to deceive her; by my life<br>
  I loved her, would have made the child my wife;<br>
  But time and fashion, and the social use<br>
  Of moneyed men, the world and its abuse,<br>
  Came in between us, and you see the end&mdash;<br>
  For me, remorse; for her&mdash;thy sorrows, friend.&rdquo; </p>

<p>WHEN  first I saw him, I but saw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow on his brow,<br>
  But, seeing that, forgot all else<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happiness or woe.</p>
<p>I  had been plucking early bloom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From where the brooklets run,<br>
  And stood just at the forest&rsquo;s verge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twixt shadow and the sun.</p>
<p>I  am not fair like Maud and Jeanne,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor gay like Clementine;<br>
  The glory lingering in their locks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgets to brighten mine.</p>
<p>My  footsteps pause amid the flowers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trample in their mirth;<br>
  For me a crown of mystic stars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies on the breast of earth.</p>
<p>Yet  as his eyes fell on my face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw his glance grow deep<br>
  As his who looks upon a lake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where moonbeams lie asleep. </p>
<p>And  though his smile half passed away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Twas like the fading light<br>
  Of stars that only fade because<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn lifts on the night,</p>
<p>A  maiden lovely as the first<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbutus-bloom of May,<br>
  Was with him when I next beheld<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him pass along that way.</p>
<p>The  boughs were waving o&rsquo;er their heads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunbeams at their feet<br>
  Lay like half-woven coronals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of blossoms rare and sweet.</p>
<p>Yet  when he came unto the spot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I had stood that day,<br>
  I saw him pause and cast one glance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wistfulness that way.</p>
<p>And  seeing, I upraised my voice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out the woodland&rsquo;s heart,<br>
  And sang like one to whom the heavens<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some vision fair impart.</p>
<p>I  sang of stars&mdash;and straight the sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed to grow still and dark,<br>
  And myriad burning jets of flame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoot from it spark by spark.</p>
<p>I  sang of bulbuls and the East&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the woods there pressed<br>
  A thousand spicy scents that blew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About my brow and breast.</p>
<p>And  then, and then, like leaping flame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passionate soul upsprang,<br>
  I loosed my spirit on the world,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>love, sweet  love</i>, I sang.</p>
<p>The  birds were cooing in the trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They grew as still as death;<br>
  The breeze that drinks the souls of flow&rsquo;rs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused on its perfumed breath.</p>
<p>And  still I sang; like doom I sang;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul arose in air;<br>
  I dropped the music from the clouds;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt my face grow fair.</p>
<p>And  when I ceased I saw afar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the setting sun,<br>
  His head sink slowly on his breast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one whose race is run.</p>
<p>And  though the mellow twilight soon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like purple-breasted dove,<br>
  Passed flying towards the blazoned west<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all was dark above,</p>
<p>I  did not stir, but sat like one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whom the world has sped;<br>
  My eyes upon the way he went,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows on my head.</p>
<p>Alas,  the days are long since then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many an eve gone by,<br>
  But still in dreams I sit and watch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That barren heath and sky. </p>

<p>CONFESS!  I will confess; but first as thou<br>
  Dost love thine holy office, rise and look<br>
  From yonder grating opening on the bay,<br>
  And tell me&mdash;for my chains drag heavily&mdash;<br>
  If far away where sky and billow meet,<br>
  You see a scarlet pennon floating free.<br>
  Yes? then draw near and I will tell you all<br>
  As if within a true confessional,<br>
  Contented thus to speak the truth and die.</p>
<p>She  was a dream to me, a gentle zephyr<br>
  Stealing across the fever of my life,<br>
  Sweet with all soothing fragrance; halting not,<br>
  But leaving in my ears, in fluttering by,<br>
  The wild sweet music of the birds and brooks,<br>
  Within my breast, the freshness of the summer.<br>
  I loved her, if men call it love to give<br>
  Their soul in worship to a star of heaven;<br>
  But whatso&rsquo;er you think&mdash;and holy men<br>
  Will have their thoughts&mdash;for all my love and worship,<br>
  I was not wont to gaze upon her much,<br>
  Not much, though every lineament of hers<br>
  Was precious unto me as mine own soul. </p>
<p>She  was my lord king&rsquo;s daughter, heir to crowns<br>
  And wearer of the purple from her birth,<br>
  While I&mdash;I was a simple musketeer,<br>
  A sword to be drawn freely in her cause,<br>
  But not to be wide brandished in her sight<br>
  Unless the hour demanded. Wherefore then<br>
  These chains, the gallows lifted in the court,<br>
  And all yon preparation for stem death?<br>
  Was I not found before her on my knees<br>
  Within the sacred precincts of her room?<br>
  I was.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  ere I lift the veil too high,<br>
  Look out once more and by the Christ you worship,<br>
  Tell me if yonder pennon which you see,<br>
  Holds on its course unstayed across the bay.<br>
  Yes? It is well; then listen.</p>
<p>For  a year<br>
  I held my station close against her door,<br>
  And heard her steps go by me morn and night,<br>
  And never raised an eyelid. But one day,<br>
  Just as she turned to glide adown the hall,<br>
  An impulse seized me like a stormy wind<br>
  To gaze upon the beauty which had been<br>
  My dream from early youth. But when, with just<br>
  One quick upgathering of my soul like that<br>
  With which a man dares flood or braves the fire,<br>
  I raised mine eyes and looked upon her face,<br>
  I did not see its beauty, did not feel<br>
  Its bright consummate charm of glance and smile,<br>
  Not then, not then; for, fainter than the shade<br>
  Which falls from heaven&rsquo;s fleeciest summer-cloud<br>
  Upon a swaying oleander-bud,<br>
  And melts away again ev&rsquo;n while you wonder<br>
  If &lsquo;tis a shadow or the blossom&rsquo;s richness,<br>
  A mist lay o&rsquo;er its lustre, and mine eyes<br>
  Saw but that mist, no more. And though, ere long,<br>
  She flitted from my side all gaiety,<br>
  I could not sleep my natural sleep that night.<br>
  For thinking of the veil of grief or care<br>
  Which lay so faintly on her loveliness</p>
<p>But  when, as week joined week I heard her step,<br>
  Drag slowlier and slowlier down the hall,<br>
  And the delicious murmur of her laugh<br>
  Fall faintlier and faintlier on the ear,<br>
  My heart turned cold within me. Was it death?<br>
  Or marking how the gallants of the court<br>
  Crowded like moths of summer at her coming,<br>
  That evil worse than death, a hopeless love,<br>
  Laying a hand of ice upon my heart<br>
  I bent myself to watch. But although earth<br>
  Had lent her noblest, loftiest, and best <br>
  To make our court the stateliest in the world,<br>
  And gallants were as plenty as the pearls<br>
  Upon the royal diadem, she passed<br>
  Among them all as smiling and serene<br>
  As the high moon amid the clouds of even.<br>
  &ldquo;It is not love,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it must be death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  on the morrow as I stood and watched<br>
  With heavy gaze the self-same crowd go by,<br>
  A quick form brushed me and a blossom fell<br>
  As from a restless hand against my foot,<br>
  And looking up, I saw the Count di Ferra<br>
  Turn for an instant from the crowd and fix<br>
  His eyes in wild entreaty upon mine.<br>
  Next moment, stealing on me like a ray<br>
  Of faintest moonlight through a prison&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
  I spied my royal princess. I could hear<br>
  Her breath come, go, painting alternately<br>
  Glad rose and fearful lily on her cheek,<br>
  And scarcely knowing what it was I did,<br>
  I stooped and raised the blossom from the ground,<br>
  And kneeling, dropped it in her open palm.<br>
  She took it; for a moment earth and heaven<br>
  Swam in one whirl about me, then a calm<br>
  Fell on my spirit, and I slowly rose,<br>
  Knowing as if an angel had proclaimed it,<br>
  That soon or late, on that day or another,<br>
  My life would follow in the blossom&rsquo;s wake.</p>
<p>Then  was it that each morning at the dawn<br>
  I looked upon the sun in its first splendor<br>
  As one who questions, &ldquo;What hast thou for me?&rdquo;<br>
  And every evening as that splendor paled,<br>
  And ghastly as a spirit from the grave,<br>
  The wild moon rose upon me, &ldquo;What hast thou?&rdquo;<br>
  Preparing thus my soul against the day,<br>
  When he should fling the flower of my life<br>
  Beneath her feet, and she should lean to take it.</p>
<p>At  last it came. I had been at my post<br>
  Since heavy noon, and I was wondering why<br>
  The princess so delayed to venture forth,<br>
  When suddenly from where the fountains play<br>
  Down in the court, there broke upon my ears<br>
  A short, sharp cry, &ldquo;Stand by there for your lives,<br>
  And let no one pass by on pain of death!&rdquo;<br>
  It was the king&rsquo;s voice; but before mine eyes<br>
  Could turn within their sockets, the closed door<br>
  Which guarded the young princess from the world,<br>
  Swung on its noiseless hinges, and her face,<br>
  Awful in high devotion and despair,<br>
  Looked out and brightened on me like a star,<br>
  Then grew as fixed as death. &ldquo;I want,&rdquo; she said&mdash;<br>
  And low as were the words they filled mine ears<br>
  And fell upon my breast like dropping ice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  help of one who for my sake will brave<br>
  The shame and terror of a bitter death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  did not tremble. Earth&rsquo;s most awful joys<br>
  Make men quite calm. Giving her look for look,<br>
  But stopping not for any mock of words,<br>
  I followed and stepped in and shut the door,<br>
  And heard it clang behind me. Then, O then,<br>
  The usage of my thoughts passed quite away,<br>
  And what she was and what I was, I lost<br>
  In the great splendor which her beauty made<br>
  Through all the room. I had no need to turn<br>
  My head to know whose form it was that stood<br>
  Behind me. In her eyes his image burned,<br>
  And down through every fibre of her frame<br>
  The fervor and the purpose of a love<br>
  That dares all things, fears nought and devotes all,<br>
  Flashed like a flame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;your will!<br>
  Let me but know your will!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;First  hear my need.&rdquo;<br>
  And looking up, she cried below her breath,<br>
  &ldquo;I love the Count di Ferra; he is here:<br>
  We were to have been wedded ere the eve,<br>
  But some one has betrayed us. At the door<br>
  The king stands; in the court beneath us there,<br>
  Await three soldiers ready with drawn swords<br>
  To smite whoever leaps from out the casement;<br>
  Protect him! but first slay me where I stand,<br>
  That he, my father, seeing me lie low,<br>
  May stop to mourn and give him chance to fly.&rdquo;<br>
  And flinging all her beauty to the ground,<br>
  She knelt, my princess, knelt before my feet.</p>
<p>But  I, scarce waiting for the smile she strove<br>
  To give me for a guerdon, for the sound<br>
  Of his quick passionate voice in wild disclaim,<br>
  Asked if men knew her lover. And she said,<br>
  &ldquo;None on God&rsquo;s earth save we.&rdquo; Whereat at once<br>
  A great light spread itself within my soul,<br>
  And bidding her to thrust him out of sight,<br>
  I raised mine eyes and looked upon her face<br>
  For the last time on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam,&rdquo;  I said,<br>
  &ldquo;I love you. I have loved you all my life;<br>
  A musketeer has loved you all his life;<br>
  &lsquo;Tis meet for such offence that he should die.<br>
  But you, remember you this thing and live.<br>
  That on the morrow at the hour of noon,<br>
  From out the port below us in the bay,<br>
  There sails a bark unto the shores of Greece,<br>
  &nbsp;Guided by men I know. Now if so be<br>
  That all goes well, and you and he with faith<br>
  Fast wedded by some holy man of God,<br>
  Have gained a refuge in the little craft,<br>
  Uplift a scarlet pennon at the bow,<br>
  And let it float till out of sight of land.<br>
  Remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting  not to see the look<br>
  Of startled wonder ebb from out her eyes,<br>
  I knelt and took her robe within my hands<br>
  And kissed it, just as through the opening door,<br>
  The king leaped in upon us. How he sprang<br>
  Like flame upon my throat, and how she swooned<br>
  Protesting wildly in my innocence,<br>
  It boots not now to tell. Enough that I<br>
  Was deemed by him her lover and immured<br>
  Within these dungeon walls, before her eyes<br>
  Had oped again unto the light of day.<br>
  But he was saved! and now I ask no more<br>
  But that yon scarlet pennon on the sea,<br>
  Sink from the wide horizon and be lost,<br>
  The hour I give my parting breath to heaven.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>His  wish was granted. As the prison guns<br>
  Proclaimed to all the world the deed was done,<br>
  The little flag, that for so long a time<br>
  Had fluttered on the bosom of the bay,<br>
  Trembled from sight across the far horizon.</p>

  The glory of a day begun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in the sky, was on the hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in the wild bird&rsquo;s early trill.</p>
<p>His  form was high, his cheek was fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star of youth was on his brow,<br>
  The shadow of his falling hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was turning, in the early glow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the clear sunshine&rsquo;s rippling flow.</p>
<p>They  led him forth. They bade him look<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His very last upon the day,<br>
  And from his eyes the bandage took<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment, that the morning&rsquo;s ray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might bless him ere he passed away.</p>
<p>He  looked around. He looked above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On purple mount and tender sky.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stealing through fragrant groves to cheer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restless spirit of the ear. </p>
<p>A  girlish form, so mystic bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very guards were touched by fear<br>
  And trembled backward as the light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her pure glance fell on them, clear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As moonlight shimmering on the mere.</p>
<p><i>He shall not die</i>, she said, and laid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her woman&rsquo;s hand upon his breast,<br>
  Her bright smile glowing undismayed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out her locks, as from the west<br>

<p>And  such, the legend runs, her grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such the power of her mien,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sense of angel forms serene<br>

<p><i>He shall not die!</i> and from the crowd<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She led him forth, while heavenly awe<br>
  Fell on each wondering heart, and bowed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of every mortal there,<br>

  Sprang from the depths of darkest night.</p>
<p>Perchance  it was that he had been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her play-fellow from earliest youth,<br>
  And that there was no mystery in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His honest glance of love and truth,<br>
  But this I know, that one fair day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  early May,<br>
  He left us to return no more.<br>
  I saw him as he moved away,<br>
  Pause softly in the open door,<br>
  And bless the threshold o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Next  morn <i>he</i> came. Why is it now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering all as it befell,<br>
  I yet can bless the transient glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which led him to our humble well?<br>
  He was so noble, sir, to see;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such  majesty<br>
  Was in his mien and bearing bold:<br>
  My very cup took dignity<br>
  Beneath his glance which gently told<br>
  &lsquo;Twas welcome as a cup of gold.</p>
<p>He  quaffed, and in a moment more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had passed forever from my sight,<br>
  Had not the linnet at the door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upraised a song of such delight,<br>
  He turned&mdash;Ah, on what simple things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our  future swings;<br>
  What wondrous issues hang upon<br>
  The idle song a linnet sings!<br>
  He turned, and there, where roses run<br>
  Saw Clarice standing in the sun.</p>
<p>With  one meek hand upon her breast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clinging to the vine,<br>
  She stood in her young beauty dressed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a robe of golden shine.<br>
  I saw him start; I saw the blush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  manhood flush<br>
  Responsive to that vision bright,<br>
  And turning, let my whole soul rush<br>
  In love and fear, to hail the sight<br>
  Of her young innocent delight.</p>
<p>But  ah, in that uplifted face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answering color met my view,<br>
  A mortal in her winning grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed a tranc&egrave;d spirit too<br>
  I felt a stinging terror dart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keen  through my heart,<br>
  As I beheld that raptured eye,<br>
  And marked the reckless blood-drops start<br>
  Unheeded from her hand, and dye<br>
  The thorns she grasped unconsciously.</p>
<p>He  saw, and gently laid his hand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the bridle of his steed,<br>
  That, faithful to his least command,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paced slowly onward down the mead.<br>
  I marked him leaning backward still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As o&rsquo;er  the hill<br>
  He passed and vanished in the wood;<br>
  And turning with a nameless thrill<br>
  To clasp my darling where she stood,<br>
  Found silence there and solitude.</p>
<p>But  when at eventide I drew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face to mine with fond good night,<br>
  No lurking shadow met my view<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commingled with its wonted light;<br>
  Rather a shyly added gleam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  though some dream<br>
  Had brushed her by with ardent wing;<br>
  Some mellow sunset loosed its beam<br>
  Upon a wave yet fluttering<br>
  With ecstasy of early spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it that he will come again?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked and sighed; &ldquo;or do some souls,<br>
  Like the deep sea-shell, catch one strain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the world&rsquo;s music as it rolls,<br>
  And tranced in wonder and delight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fold up  their bright<br>
  Warm walls about it evermore;<br>
  Content to whisper day and night,<br>
  By land and sea, the echo o&rsquo;er<br>
  Of that one instant&rsquo;s joy and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  dared not think. Meantime the spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast by her veil of amber mist, <br>
  And in full splendor stopped to ring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilac boughs with amethyst,<br>
  Methinks the world was ne&rsquo;er so fair;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  very air<br>
  Hung poised as if on golden wings;<br>
  A light like love was everywhere,<br>
  And yet for me, the fear of things<br>
  Unknown, made dim earth&rsquo;s blossomings.</p>
<p>But  one clear day in early June<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sat busy at my wheel,<br>
  Crooning perhaps an old time tune<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lover&rsquo;s woe or &lsquo;over&rsquo;s weal,<br>
  I felt the shadow and the gloom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that  small room<br>
  Yield to a sudden burst of light,<br>
  And glancing with a sense of doom<br>
  Toward the door, beheld her bright,<br>
  Full figure lifted to its height.</p>
<p>O never,  never till I die<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I forget the look she wore,<br>
  As gazing on me silently<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She crossed the sunny, sanded floor.<br>
  It was as if a regal crown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had  settled down<br>
  Upon the artless brow I knew;<br>
  Her very step, her simple gown,<br>
  Transfigured in its lustre, grew<br>
  In dignity beneath my view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo;  and at the word her smile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed softly in a roseate bloom,<br>
  As sinks the sun away, the while<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All heaven flowers in its room&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one without awaits the cheer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  welcome here;<br>
  Speak to him for I go,&rdquo;&rsquo; she said;<br>
  And even while I faltered near,<br>
  Drooped lower, lower yet her head,<br>
  And vanished with reluctant tread.</p>
<p>That  instant through the swaying vines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He proudly stepped. O lover eyes!<br>
  O lover brows! how brightly shines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun of hope in youthful skies!<br>
  My old heart trembled as I gazed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My  eyeballs dazed;<br>
  I seemed as by some vision&rsquo;s stress<br>
  To see that other go dispraised,<br>
  That yet in going stopped to bless<br>
  The threshold he no more would press.</p>
<p>But  strong in might of motherhood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save my child from loss and woe,<br>
  I moved and faced him where he stood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With quivering lip but steady brow.<br>
  &ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in careless hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  wild-wood flower<br>
  May seem a treasure to the eye,<br>
  But place it in a lady&rsquo;s bower,<br>
  And what was radiant &lsquo;neath the sky<br>
  Seems only fit to fade and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Tis  true,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but lady&rsquo;s bower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a man&rsquo;s earnest heart are twain:<br>
  Sheltered by love, no stormy shower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall reach thy wilding sweet, again.&rdquo;<br>
  Then while I slowly shook my head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  softly said,<br>
  &ldquo;Thou hast a mother&rsquo;s constancy;<br>
  I have no mother; when I wed,<br>
  The mother of my wife must be<br>
  A mother also unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  turned away. I could not speak;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like shadows on a moonlit stream,<br>
  I felt my thoughts confusing break<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across an underlying gleam.<br>
  A moment more, and through the flush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vine  and bush<br>
  I saw him pass unto her side;<br>
  Then all grew dark, and a great gush<br>
  Of music swam up on the wide,<br>
  Swift breeze that filled the mountain side.</p>
<p>Why  need I linger? Ere the week<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had passed in all its cheer away,<br>
  The April of my darling&rsquo;s cheek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had bloomed and budded like the May.<br>
  She had no need of speech to tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  fairy bell<br>
  Had rung its summons in her soul;<br>
  The lips which smiled, the lids which fell,<br>
  The brow&rsquo;s transparent aureole,<br>
  Unwittingly revealed the whole.</p>
<p>You  see she was a maiden, sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That till that time had never known<br>
  What &lsquo;twas to have another stir<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current of life&rsquo;s undertone.<br>
  The falling shadows in the woods&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep  solitudes,<br>
  My mother glance, the sudden flow<br>
  Of waters in the mountain floods,<br>
  Had moved her, but such passion, no;<br>
  &lsquo;Twas sunlight falling upon snow.</p>
<p>My  darling loved, then; but for such,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief follows love as night the day;<br>
  And all this joy was but the touch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rapture ere it fled away;<br>
  The last, soft glimmer of the blue<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  heaven through<br>
  The gathering rush of hurrying cloud;<br>
  The final welling up of dew<br>
  Upon the blossom ere it bowed<br>
  Before the fierce destroyer proud.</p>
<p>But  ere the Sunday eve had come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ringing trump of war had blown<br>
  Across the threshold of our home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who held her dear had gone.<br>
  Gone, gone, and she, pure heart, was left<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind,  bereft<br>
  Ere love&rsquo;s first week had run its sands;<br>
  Her thread of hope by stem fate, cleft<br>
  While yet its silver shining strands<br>
  Gleamed bright and beauteous in her hands.</p>
<p>My  child, my child! But she like one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sees beyond the deep abyss,<br>
  A country flowering in the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All luminous with love and bliss,<br>
  Lost not that look which was my joy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in  the coy<br>
  Delight of memory found a spell<br>
  The present grief could not destroy;<br>
  The eyes o&rsquo;erhung with asphodel,<br>
  Saw not the shade that round her fell.</p>
<p>But  as the days fled by, and sounds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of warfare mingled with the blast,<br>
  And nearer, nearer to our bounds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frowning shade of Battle passed;<br>
  As death and danger filled the air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  many a fair<br>
  Fond woman&rsquo;s countenance showed trace<br>
  Of wasting grief or anxious care,<br>
  I marked upon my darling&rsquo;s face,<br>
  Another look find gradual place.</p>
<p>A  new, strange look, not terror, no,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor anguish, no, nor fear for him;<br>
  But something subtiler, such a glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a quick torch swung through the grim,<br>
  Dead darkness of the midnight air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might  cause to flare<br>
  Upon the placid, marble brow<br>
  Of some sweet Mary, gleaming fair<br>
  From wayside shrine upon the woe<br>
  Of a lost wanderer down below.</p>
<p>A  look that froze me, warmed me, dazed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would not leave my dreams at night;<br>
  A look that deepened as I gazed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled my soul with vague affright.<br>
  &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;she hears afar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  voice of war;<br>
  She will not linger long away;<br>
  The sound of battle in her ear<br>
  Is like a call she must obey:&rdquo;<br>
  But O the love, the heart&rsquo;s dismay!</p>
<p>And  I was right; another week<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we had left our home behind,<br>
  In Paris&rsquo; surging streets to seek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work for which her spirit pined.<br>
  &ldquo;I could not live so far,&rdquo; she said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From  where his head<br>
  May come some weary day to lie;<br>
  Nor breathe my breath and know some bed<br>
  Of pain was comfortless, that I<br>
  Might ease perhaps with smile or sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am at rest now,&rdquo; and she turned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face in glad content on mine,<br>
  Through whose pure light her glances burned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like holy lamps on holy shrine.<br>
  &ldquo;The smile I may not give to him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need  not grow dim<br>
  While pain and sorrow plead for aid;<br>
  The eyes he loved, forget to brim<br>
  With pity, or the heart he made<br>
  His own, grow faint with hopes delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  clad with this strong hope, she grew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once so beautiful and bright,<br>
  She seemed like one on whom some new<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair world had opened in delight.<br>
  For me it was enough to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  helpful, free,<br>
  Sweet way of her in all distress;<br>
  To hear her voice, and know that she<br>
  Was happy, and that pain was less,<br>
  And sorrow, for that happiness.</p>
<p>But  what say I? &lsquo;Tis not of this<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our conflict with the foreign foe,<br>
  That I would speak to-day&mdash;it is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her and of our final woe.<br>
  And she was in no peril then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not  even when<br>
  Gaunt Famine stalked the city through,<br>
  And women sickened, yes, and men<br>
  Lay down to die within our view,<br>
  And want was as the breath we drew.</p>
<p>It  is of that dread after-hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passion oped the door of hell,<br>
  And glutting fury rose to power,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And might was lord, that I would tell.<br>
  O awful flame of burning homes!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  falling domes!<br>
  Against your scarlet tapestry,<br>
  One figure only goes and comes<br>
  Whene&rsquo;er I look, one only, see<br>
  How angel-like it smiles on me! </p>
<p>But  to my story. France had bowed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her haughty head unto her fate,<br>
  And the last Prussian&rsquo;s footstep proud<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had echoed through our city&rsquo;s gate:<br>
  And peace was ours at last, if not<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  happier lot<br>
  Of conquerors in their victory;<br>
  The last fierce cannon had been shot,<br>
  And life and love were safe, and he<br>
  Our hero; priceless treasury.</p>
<p>To  me no other thought was worth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribute of a passing sigh;<br>
  I could have carolled in my mirth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day of shame and misery.<br>
  But ah, it was not so with her;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all  the stir<br>
  Of hope upspringing in her breast,<br>
  A shadow like the dreamy blur<br>
  That veils the moon, lay half confessed<br>
  Upon her beauty&rsquo;s glowing crest.</p>
<p>And  when I cried, &ldquo;A happy day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this which sees the Prussians gone,<br>
  So happy, this dear forehead may<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon wear, perhaps, its marriage crown,<br>
  She did not make me quick reply,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  dropped her eye<br>
  And shuddered faintly like a flower<br>
  That feels the wind go chilling by,<br>
  Though all things else around and o&rsquo;er<br>
  Hang still nor own its artful power. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A  happy day, but&mdash;&rdquo; and her gaze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed quickly to the open door&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;It is upon life&rsquo;s sunniest days<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm prepares that whelms us o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br>
  O what was it that smote my heart?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  stinging dart<br>
  Of terror, menace, doubt or woe<br>
  Was hidden in those words apart,<br>
  That all my life-blood ceased to flow<br>
  In peace, as she thus murmured low?</p>
<p>Moving  aside, I raised my eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where her glance had sped before,<br>
  When what was that which hid the skies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just shining through the open door?<br>
  A face, but ah, how dread, how rude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its  wild mood!<br>
  If it had been a tiger&rsquo;s own,<br>
  I had not sprung from where I stood<br>
  With fiercer cry, nor quicker thrown<br>
  My arms round Clarice standing lone.</p>
<p>And  yet it was a manly face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which some fond mother&rsquo;s lips had kissed,<br>
  A countenance where thought had place&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought though of a dogmatist.<br>
  I did not know him then by name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  through the flame<br>
  Of the fell glance which sought, alas!<br>
  My daughter&rsquo;s face with passionate claim,<br>
  I seemed to see as in a glass<br>
  The spirit of a demon pass.</p>
<p>And  though in just a moment more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vanished even while I looked,<br>
  And heaven&rsquo;s pure sky all sunnied o&rsquo;er<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came shining inward unrebuked,<br>
  I could not choose but feel the gloom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some  near doom<br>
  Had fallen about us unaware;<br>
  A breath, a whisper from the tomb<br>
  Had crossed our summer garden fair,<br>
  Leaving its poison in the air.</p>
<p>But  hiding in my mother breast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror I could not repress,<br>
  I strove with merry smiles and jest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win her back to happiness.<br>
  But she who ever until now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had  raised her brow,<br>
  Serene amid the darkest hour,<br>
  Drooped slowly from this time as though<br>
  She felt a blight upon the flower<br>
  Of her young life and maiden power.</p>
<p>But  not until that fearful day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came again and with some word<br>
  Of love and love&rsquo;s resistless sway,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strove hard to make his passion heard;<br>
  Not till commanded from her sight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  turned his bright<br>
  Fierce gaze on us and bade us know<br>
  By the low sounds of restless fight<br>
  Just waking in the streets below,<br>
  That will was law in Paris now: </p>
<p>Did  I foresee that we were lost,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Victor came not soon to aid.<br>
  That the shy leaf by zephyrs tossed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to the whirlwind&rsquo;s grasp betrayed,<br>
  But Victor could not come, the toils<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  tightening coils<br>
  Had caught us in their fatal snare;<br>
  The frantic freedom which despoils<br>
  And heedeth nought, was in the air,<br>
  And cannon&rsquo;s voice mocked every prayer.</p>
<p>And  as the conflict round us grew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intenser in its frenzy dire,<br>
  He fiercer turned as though he drew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh fury from each mounting fire.<br>
  &ldquo;Thou art my bride,&rdquo; he used to say;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And  sharest sway<br>
  With freedom in this breast of mine;<br>
  Your fates are one; the self-same day<br>
  That sees her fall, sees thee and thine<br>
  Laid bruised and bleeding on her shrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  when the hours in flying brought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly struggle to a head,<br>
  And wild despair and passion sought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do the work of hope, now dead,<br>
  It was no raging man that came<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red  from the flame<br>
  To gloat a moment o&rsquo;er his power,<br>
  But some mad demon dead to shame,<br>
  That in his frenzy found an hour<br>
  To tread and break a wilding flower:</p>
<p>My  innocent child! But she with calm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High aspect kept him still at bay,<br>
  And with one name as with a charm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stayed up her courage night and day.<br>
  Meantime about our very door<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  rush and roar<br>
  Of warfare &lsquo;gan to ebb and swell,<br>
  And barricades arose before<br>
  Our eyes, and nearer, deadlier, fell<br>
  The hissing shot and bursting shell.</p>
<p>And  listening to their sullen call,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking on their angry glare,<br>
  I could but pray their wrath might fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon us twain in our despair,<br>
  But she at that would whisper &ldquo;Nay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O rather  pray<br>
  That you may live though Clarice die;<br>
  If but upon some happier day<br>
  To tell my Victor, how that I<br>
  Was true unto life&rsquo;s latest sigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  leaning on my mother breast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her earnest face to mine<br>
  And murmured, &ldquo;Death for me is best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must not grieve at God&rsquo;s design.&rdquo;<br>
  Then as I shuddered, added slow:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The  noon-day glow<br>
  Of life had been too bright for me;<br>
  I was not made to stem the flow<br>
  Of daily care, nor live to see<br>
  My dreams fade in reality. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To  live, to love and then to die<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While life and love are pure and sweet<br>
  As April&rsquo;s mingled smile and sigh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which all hopeful fancies meet,<br>
  Is not so sad; more sad to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were  to see<br>
  The falling leaves, the clouding sky,<br>
  To look around and miss the free<br>
  Glad singing of the birds, and sigh<br>
  In vain for hopes and days gone by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  mist just blown from off the hills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the roses of the dawn,<br>
  That for a moment burns and thrills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With splendor from their glory drawn;<br>
  It were not meet for me to scale&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing  so frail&mdash;<br>
  The lofty facade of the sky,<br>
  Nor made to shimmer and to fail,<br>
  Bear up my heart as though my way<br>
  Lay through the golden ranks of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even  the love which God has given<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my summer morn complete,<br>
  Is more a thing of happy heaven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than happy earth, however sweet.<br>
  And he will say so, too, at last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  all is passed<br>
  And life resumes its wonted calm;<br>
  &lsquo;Tis not for one like me to cast<br>
  My lot with such as he; the balm<br>
  Is sweet, but mates not with the palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet  does he love me; meek, untaught,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender as all meek things be,<br>
  I know he holds me high as aught<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blooms or gleams on land or sea.<br>
  And I would ever shine thus bright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within  his sight;<br>
  And if I die it will be so,<br>
  For Death&rsquo;s deep portals shed a light<br>
  On the dear ones who pass below,<br>
  That shrines them in enduring glow</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  thus in fair, eternal youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cheek undimmed and smile unworn,<br>
  With eyes that never lose their truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lips whose speech is ne&rsquo;er forsworn,<br>
  &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll walk beside him day by day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life&rsquo;s  long hard way;<br>
  His hope in sorrow or despite,<br>
  But in his joy a memory;<br>
  As stars shine o&rsquo;er us, dim or bright,<br>
  As beams the morn or glooms the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing,  she stood with lifted head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned towards that fiery booming sky,<br>
  Serene, though death and anguish sped<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every shot that hurried by.<br>
  When, hark! from where the noise and glare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seethe  up the stair,<br>
  A sudden flash, a frenzied cry!<br>
  And awful in his wild despair,<br>
  That demon fronts us with the high,<br>
  Red flame of conflict in his eye.</p>
<p>Ah,  God of grace! But with a bound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught her form from off the floor,<br>
  And shrieking out, &ldquo;The end is found!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled with her through the open door.<br>
  I heard his footsteps as they rung,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  shriek she flung<br>
  To Heaven in her extremity,<br>
  And rousing, tottering upward, sprung<br>
  Along their wake, while under me<br>
  The earth rose heaving like the sea.</p>
<p>Down,  down the stair that shook beneath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the landing, out the gate,<br>
  And forth into the flaming death,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled like a mad thing to my fate.<br>
  A bullet struck me as I passed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fiery  blast<br>
  Swept by me, scathing cheek and brow,<br>
  But heedless, reckless, onward, fast<br>
  As doom itself, I rushed, nor knew<br>
  I crushed the dying as I flew.</p>
<p>They  told me later that it was<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very crisis of the fight;<br>
  That even as I strove to pass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barricade fell from its height.<br>
  But I saw not; my gaze, my all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on  that small<br>
  Frail figure flying from my eyes,<br>
  Borne on through flame, past rushing ball,<br>
  Up, up, unto the topmost rise<br>
  Of those wild ruins &lsquo;gainst the skies. </p>
<p>But  stunned and deafened as I was,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence which fell on the fray,<br>
  As forth upon that tottering mass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaped with her, and stood at bay,<br>
  Is with me yet; as if a flood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  rushing, should<br>
  In one wild moment fall backthrown&mdash;<br>
  The very life chilled in the blood,<br>
  And when he spake his words rang lone,<br>
  As through some wilderness of stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,  slaves! and will you falter now?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him shriek with frenzied cry.<br>
  &ldquo;Now when fair Freedom waits your blow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bow her radiant head and die?<br>
  <i>We </i>do not falter,&rdquo; and he drew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His  blade and threw<br>
  One frantic glance on Clarice&rsquo;s brow;<br>
  &ldquo;Never! Then come.&rdquo; And into view<br>
  Raising his threatening arm, stood so<br>
  With maddened eye bent on the foe.</p>
<p>When  hark, beneath, around, above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurried cry, &ldquo;On, comrades, on!<br>
  He holds them back, they dare not move,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leader seemeth turned to stone;<br>
  <i>Vive la Commune!</i>&rdquo; And with a bound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  shook the ground,<br>
  A dozen threatening forms rushed by.<br>
  I heard, threw off my gathering swound,<br>
  Looked, saw in that same leader&rsquo;s eye<br>
  Our Victor&rsquo;s tortured soul flash high. </p>
<p>She  sees him too, and o&rsquo;er her falls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden light. &ldquo;Ah, Heaven,&rdquo; she cries,<br>
  &ldquo;Do Frenchmen pause when duty calls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a single French girl dies?<br>
  Rouse,Victor, rouse!&rdquo; But stunned, dismayed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only  swayed<br>
  One restless moment towards the strife:<br>
  I saw her tremble, look for aid,<br>
  Grow firm, then smile, and crying, &ldquo;Life<br>
  For honor!&rdquo; spring to meet the knife.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  charm was broken. With a yell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That demon flung her to the ground,<br>
  And in the sudden tumult, hell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself seemed bursting from its bound.<br>
  But life and death were now to me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  equal; she<br>
  The beautiful, the fond, the dear,<br>
  Had perished, and not ev&rsquo;n the cry<br>
  Of Victor in his grief could e&rsquo;er<br>
  Rouse me again to wrath or fear. </p>
