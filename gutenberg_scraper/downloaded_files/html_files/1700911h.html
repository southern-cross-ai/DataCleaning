    The House In The Pine Wood</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We  had better lie down and die,&rdquo; said Robin peevishly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go a step further,&rdquo;  and to emphasise his words he deliberately sat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Infernal  little duffer,&rdquo; growled Herrick. &ldquo;Huh! Might have guessed you would Joyce.&rdquo; He  threw himself down beside his companion and continued grumbling. &ldquo;You have  tobacco, a fine night, and a heather couch of the finest, yet you talk as  though the world were coming to an end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure this moor never will,&rdquo; sighed Joyce, reminded of his cigarettes, &ldquo;we have  been trudging it since eight in the morning, yet it still stretches to the  back-of-beyond. Hai!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pedestrians were pronouncedly isolated. A moonless sky thickly jewelled with  stars, arched over a treeless moor, far-stretching as the plain of Shinar. In  the luminous summer twilight, the eye could see for a moderate distance, but to  no clearly defined horizon; and the verge of sight was limited by vague  shadows, hardly definite enough to be mists.</p>
  <p>The  moor exhaled the noonday heats in thin white vapour, which shut out from the  external world those who nestled to its bosom. A sense of solitude, the  brooding silence, the formless surroundings, and above all, the insistence of  the infinite, would have appealed on ordinary occasions to the poetical and  superstitious side of Robin&rsquo;s nature. But at the moment, his nerves were  uppermost. He was worn-out, fractious as a child, and in his helplessness could  have cried like one. Herrick knew his friend&rsquo;s frail physique and inherited  neurosis: therefore he forebore to make bad worse by ill advised sympathy.  Judiciously waiting until Joyce had in some degree soothed himself with  tobacco, he talked of the common-place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine  o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said he peering at his watch; &ldquo;thirteen hour&rsquo;s walking. Nothing to me  Robin, but a goodish stretch to you. However we are within hail of  civilization, and in England. A few miles further we&rsquo;ll pick up a village of  sorts no doubt. One would think you were exploiting Africa the way you howl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke thus callously, in order to brace his friend; but Joyce resented the tone  with that exaggerated sense of injury peculiar to the neurotic. &ldquo;I am no  Hercules like you Jim,&rdquo; he protested sullenly; &ldquo;all your finer feelings have  been blunted by beef and beer. You can&rsquo;t feel things as I do. Also,&rdquo; continued  Robin still more querulously, &ldquo;it seems to have escaped your memory, that I  returned only last night from a two day&rsquo;s visit to Town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you <i>will</i> break up your holiday into fragments, you must not expect to receive  the benefit its enjoyment as a whole would give you. It was jolly enough last  week sauntering through the Midlands, till you larked up to London, and fagged  yourself with its detestable civilization.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  threw aside his cigarette and nervously began to roll another. &ldquo;It was no lark  which took me up Jim. The letter that came to the Southberry Inn was about&mdash;her  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry  old man. I keep forgetting your troubles. Heat and the want of food make me  savage. We&rsquo;ll rest here for a time, and then push on. Not that a night in the  open would matter to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  made no reply but lying full length on the dry herbage, stared at the  scintillating sky. At his elbow, Herrick, cross-legged like a fakir, gave  himself up to the enjoyment of a disreputable pipe. The more highly-strung man  considered the circumstances which had placed him where he was.</p>
  <p>Two  months previously, Robin Joyce had lost his mother, to whom he had been  devotedly attached: and the consequent grief had made a wreck of him. For weeks  he had shut himself up in the flat once brightened by her presence to luxuriate  in woe. He possessed in a large degree that instinct for martyrdom, latent in  many people, which searches for sorrow, as a more joyous nature hunts for  pleasure. The blow of Mrs. Joyce&rsquo;s death had fallen unexpectedly, but it  brought home to Robin, the knowledge&mdash;strange as it may sound&mdash;that a mental  pleasure can be plucked from misfortune. He locked himself in his room, wept  much, and ate little; neglected his business of contributor to several  newspapers, and his personal appearance. Thus the pain of his loss merged  itself in that delight of self-mortification, which must have been experienced  by the hermits of the Thebiad. Not entirely from religious motives was the  desert made populous with hermits in the days of Cyril and Hypatia.</p>
  <p>Herrick  did not realize this transcendental indulgence, nor would he have understood  it, had he done so. Emphatically a sane man, he would have deemed it a weakness  degrading to the will, if not a species of lunacy. As it was, he merely saw  that Robin yielded to an unrestrained grief detrimental to his health, and  insisted upon carrying him off for a spell in the open air. With less trouble  than he anticipated, Robin&rsquo;s consent was obtained. The mourner threw himself  with ardour into the scheme, selected the county of Berks as the most inviting  for a ramble; and when fairly started, showed a power of endurance amazing in  one so frail.</p>
  <p>Jim  however being a doctor, was less astonished than a layman would have been. He  knew that in Joyce a tremendous nerve power dominated the feebler muscular  force, and that the man would go on like a blood-horse until he dropped from  sheer exhaustion. The collapse on the moor did not surprise him. He only  wondered that Robin had held out for so many days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I wish you had not gone to London,&rdquo; said Herrick pursuing aloud this train of  thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to go,&rdquo; replied Joyce not troubling to query the remark. &ldquo;The lawyer wrote  about my poor mother&rsquo;s property. In my sorrow, I had neglected to look after  it, but at Southberry Junction feeling better, thanks to your open air cure, I  thought it wise to attend to the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Joyce went on to state with much detail, how he had caught the Paddington  express at Marleigh&mdash;their last stopping place&mdash;and had seen his lawyer. The  business took some time to settle; but it resulted in the knowledge that Joyce  found himself possessed of five hundred a year in Consols. &ldquo;Also the flat and  the furniture,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;so I am not so badly off. I can devote myself  wholly to novels now, and shall not have to rack my brains for newspaper  articles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded over a newly-filled pipe. &ldquo;Did you sleep at the flat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I went up on Tuesday as you know, and slept that night at the Hull Hotel, a  small house in one of the Strand side streets. Last night, I joined you at Southberry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it is now Thursday,&rdquo; said Herrick laughing. &ldquo;How particular you are as to  detail Robin. Well, Southberry is a goodish way behind us now and Saxham is our  next resting place. Feel better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  thanks. In another quarter of an hour, I shall make the attempt to reach  Saxham. But we are so late, I fear no bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s alright. We can wake the landlord, I calculate we have only three miles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  enough too. By the way Jim, what did you do, when I left you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the semi-darkness Herrick chuckled. &ldquo;Fell in love!&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  You lost no time about it. And she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  daughter of the gods, divinely tall; dark hair, creamy skin, sea-blue eyes the  figure and gait of Diana, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  of the Celt than the Greek,&rdquo; interrupted Joyce, &ldquo;blue eyes, black hair, that is  the Irish type. Where did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Southberry Church, talking to a puny curate, who did not deserve such a  companion. Oh, Robin, her voice! like an Eolian harp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must possess a variety of tones then Jim. Did she see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded and laughed again. &ldquo;She looked and blushed. Beauty drew me with a single  hair, therefore I thrilled responsive. Love at first sight Robin. Heigh-ho!  never again shall I see this Helen of Marleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Live  in hope,&rdquo; said Joyce, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Allons, mon ami.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  more leisurely Herrick rose, markedly surprised at this sudden recuperation. &ldquo;Wonderful  man. One minute you are dying, the next skipping like a two year old.  Hysterical all the same,&rdquo; he added as Joyce laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  three miles,&rdquo; explained the other feverishly, &ldquo;I feel that I have to walk them,  and my determination is braced to breaking point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  means you&rsquo;ll collapse half way,&rdquo; retorted the doctor unstrapping his knapsack. &ldquo;Light  a match. Valerian for you my man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  made no objection. He knew the value of Valerian for those unruly nerves of  his, at present vibrating like so many harp-strings, twangled by an unskilful  player. His small white face looked smaller and whiter than ever in the faint  light of the match; but his great black eyes flamed like wind-blown torches.  The contrast of Herrick&rsquo;s sun-tanned Saxon looks, struck him as almost  ludicrous. Joyce needed no mirror to assure him of his appearance at the  moment. He knew only too well how he aged on the eve of a nerve storm. For the  present it was averted by the valerian; but he knew and so did Herrick, that  sooner or later it would surely come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get on as fast as possible,&rdquo; said Herrick, the knapsack again on his broad  back. &ldquo;Food, drink, rest; you need all three. Forward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  some time they walked on in silence. Robin was so small, Dr. Jim so large, that  they looked like the giant and dwarf of the old fairy tale on their travels.  But in this case it was the giant who did all the work. Joyce was a pampered,  lazy, irresponsible child, in the direct line of descent from Harold Skimpole.  If Jim Herrick must be likened to another hero of romance, Amyas Leigh was his  prototype.</p>
  <p>The  shadows melted before them, and closed in behind, and still there was nothing  but plain and mist. At the end of two miles a dark bulk like a thunder-cloud,  loomed before them. It stretched directly across their path. &ldquo;Bogey,&rdquo; laughed  Robin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  wood,&rdquo; said the more prosaic Jim, &ldquo;this moor is fringed with pine-woods:  remember the forest we passed through this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the cheerful sunshine,&rdquo; shuddered Joyce. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like woodlands by night. The  fairies are about and goblins of the worst. Ha! Yonder the lantern of Puck.  Oberon holds revel in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Puck  must be putting a girdle round the earth then Robin,&rdquo; said Herrick and stared  at the white starry light, which beamed above the trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hecate&rsquo;s  torch,&rdquo; cried Joyce, &ldquo;a meeting of witches,&rdquo; and he began to chant the gruesome  rhymes of the sisterhood, as Macbeth heard them. &ldquo;The scene is a blasted heath  too,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>By  this time the moon was rising, and silver shafts struck inward to the heart of  the pines. The aerial light vanished behind the leafy screen, as the travellers  came to a halt on the verge of the undergrowth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must get through,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;or if you like Robin, we can skirt round.  Saxham village is just beyond I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us choose the bee-line,&rdquo; murmured Joyce. &ldquo;I want a bed and a meal as soon as  possible. This part of the world is unknown to me. You lead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know it myself. However here&rsquo;s a path. We&rsquo;ll follow it to the light. That  comes from a tower of sorts. Too high up for a house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  Herrick as pioneer, they plunged into the wood, following a winding path. In  the gloom, their heads came into contact with boughs and tree-trunks but  occasionally the moon made radiant the secret recesses, and revealed unexpected  openings. The path sometimes passed across a glade, on the sward of which Joyce  declared he saw the fairies dancing: and anon plunged into a cimmerian gloom  suggestive of the underworld. No wind swung the heavy pine-boughs; the wild  creatures of the wood gave no sign, made no stir: yet the explorers heard a low  persistent swish-swurr-swish, like the murmur of a dying breeze. It came from  no particular direction, but droned on all sides without pause, without change  of note. Herrick heard Robin&rsquo;s hysterical sob, as the insistent sound bored  into his brain. He would have made some remark; but at the moment they emerged  into a open space of considerable size. Here, ringed by pines, loomed a vast  grey house, with a slim tower. In that tower burned the steady light outshining  even the moon&rsquo;s lustre. But what was more remarkable still, was the  illumination of the mansion. Every window radiated white fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo;  said Robin halting on the verge of the wood, &ldquo;not even a fence or a wall: a  path or an outhouse. One would think that this was an inferior Aladdin&rsquo;s palace  dropped here by some negligent genii. All ablaze too,&rdquo; he added wonderingly; &ldquo;the  owner must be giving a ball.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  signs of guests anyhow,&rdquo; returned Herrick as puzzled as his companion. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  Queer thing to find Versailles in a pine wood. However it may afford us a bed  and a supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was certainly strange. The circle of trees stopped short of the building at  fifty yards. On all sides stretched an expanse of shorn and well-kept turf,  pathless as the sea. In its midst the mansion was dropped&mdash;as Joyce aptly put  it&mdash;unexpectedly. A two-storey Tudor building, with battlements, and mullioned  windows, terraces and flights of shallow steps: the whole weather-worn and grey  in the moonlight, over-grown with ivy, and distinctly ruinous. The dilapidated  state of the house, contrasted in a rather sinister manner with the  perfectly-kept lawn. Also another curious contrast, was the tower. This tacked  on to the western corner, stood like a lean white ghost, watching over its  earthly habitation. Its gleaming stone-work and sharp outlines showed that it  had been built within the last decade. A distinct anachronism, which marred the  quaint antiquity of the medi&aelig;val mansion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must be an astrologer,&rdquo; said Joyce referring to the owner, &ldquo;or it may be that  the tower is an inland pharos, to guide travellers across that pathless moor. A  horrible place,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  horrible?&rdquo; asked Dr. Jim as they crossed the lawn.</p>
  <p>Robin  shuddered, and cast a backward glance. &ldquo;I can hardly explain. But to my mind,  there is something sinister in this lonely mansion, ablaze with light, yet  devoid of inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have yet to find out if that is the case Robin. Hullo! the door is open,&rdquo; and  in the strong moonlight they looked wonderingly at each other.</p>
  <p>The  heavy door&mdash;oak, clamped with iron&mdash;was slightly ajar. Herrick bent upon  consummating the adventure, pushed it slightly open. They beheld a large hall  with a tesselated pavement, and stately columns. Between these last stood black  oak high-backed chairs upholstered in red velvet: also statues of Greek gods  and goddesses, holding aloft opaque globes, radiant with light. A vast marble  staircase with wide and shallow steps, sloped upwards, and on either side of  this, from the height of the landing fell scarlet velvet curtains, shutting in  the hall. The whiteness of the marble, the crimson of the draperies, the brilliance  of the light; these sumptuous furnishings amazed the dusty pedestrians. It was  as though, on a lonely prairie, one should step suddenly into the splendours of  the Vatican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  palace of the Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; whispered the awe-struck Robin. &ldquo;Who can say  romance is dead, when one can stumble upon such an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shared Robin&rsquo;s perplexity: but of a more practical nature, he addressed himself  less to the romance than to the reality. Seeing no one, hearing nothing, he  touched an ivory button, that glimmered a white spot beside the door.  Immediately a silvery succession of sounds, shrilled through  the&mdash;apparently&mdash;lonely house. &ldquo;Electric bells, electric light. The hermit of  this establishment is up-to-date.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is also deaf, and has no servants,&rdquo; said Joyce impatiently after a few minutes  had passed. &ldquo;Has a Borgian banquet taken place here? The guests seem to be  dead. Hai! the whole thing is damnable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let yourself go,&rdquo; said the doctor roughly squeezing the little man&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;wait  and see the upshot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  and again they rang the bell, and themselves heard its imperative summons: but  no one appeared. Then they took their courage in both hands, and stepped into  the house. Passing through the crimson curtains, they found themselves in a  wide corridor enamelled green, with velvet carpet and more light-bearing  statues. On either side were doors draped with emerald silk. Herrick led the  way through one of these, for Joyce, rendered timorous by the adventure would  not take the initiative.</p>
  <p>In  the first room, an oval table was set out for a solitary meal. The linen was  bleached as the Alpine snow, the silver antique, the crystal exquisite, the  porcelain worth its weight in gold. An iridescent glass vase in the centre was  filled with flowers, but these drooped, withered and brown. The bread also was  stale, the fruits were shrivelled from their early freshness. Magnificently  furnished and draped, the room glowed in splendour, under innumerable electric  lights. But the intruders had eyes only for that sumptuous table, with its air  of desolation, and its place set for one. Anything more sinister can scarcely  be conceived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one has sat down to this meal,&rdquo; said Herrick lifting the covers of the silver  dishes, &ldquo;it has stood here for hours, if not for days. Let us see if we can  find the creature for whom it was intended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  you expect to find the Beast that loved Beauty, since you call him a creature,&rdquo;  said Robin hysterically. &ldquo;Here is wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim went to the sideboard, whereon were ranged decanters of Venetian glass  containing many different vintages. Passing over these he selected a pint  bottle of champagne. &ldquo;We must make free of our position,&rdquo; he said, unwiring  this, &ldquo;afterwards we can apologise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  cried Robin as the cork popped with a staccato sound in the silence. &ldquo;How  gruesome; give me a glass at once Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if it is good for you in your present state,&rdquo; replied the doctor  brimming a goblet, &ldquo;however the whole adventure is so queer, that an attack of  nerves is excusable. Drink up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  did so, and was joined by Jim. They finished the bottle, and felt exhilarated,  and more ready to face the unknown. Again Herrick led the way to further  explorations. Adjacent to the dining-room, they discovered a small kitchen,  white-tiled and completely furnished. &ldquo;Our hermit cooks for himself,&rdquo; declared  Dr. Jim, eying the utensils of polished copper. &ldquo;This is not a servant&rsquo;s  kitchen: also it is off the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  made no reply, but followed his friend, his large eyes becoming larger at every  fresh discovery. They entered a drawing-room filled with splendid furniture,  silver knick-knacks, costly china, and Eastern hangings of great price. There  was a library stored with books in magnificent bindings, and with tables piled  with latter-day magazines, novels and newspapers. &ldquo;Our hermit keeps himself  abreast of the world,&rdquo; commented Jim.</p>
  <p>Then  came a picture gallery, but this was on a second storey and lighted from the  roof. Treasures of art ancient and modern glowed here under the radiance of the  light, which illuminated every room. A smoking-room fashioned like a ship&rsquo;s  cabin: a Japanese apartment, crammed with the lacquer work, and stiff  embroideries of Yeddo and Yokahama; a shooting gallery; a bowling alley; a  music room, containing a magnificent Erard. Finally a dozen bedrooms furnished  with taste and luxury. To crown all they discovered a gymnasium fitted up  completely even to foils and boxing gloves: and a huge bathroom. This last was  throughout of white marble, with a square pool of water in the centre. &ldquo;What a  pond to bathe in!&rdquo; cried Jim enviously, for he was hot and dusty. &ldquo;Our hermit  is an ancient Roman; he understands how to enjoy life. Come along Robin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  by this time they had explored almost the whole of the wonderful house. There  remained the back premises, but on entering, they found nothing but darkness  and dirt, squalor and coldness. The hermit&rsquo;s attention to his mansion stopped  short at the servant&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe he has any servants,&rdquo;  declared Joyce. &ldquo;How the deuce does he keep all this clean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor shook his head. He hardly knew what to say. The situation was beyond  him. A palace in the wilderness, with an open door inviting thieves! Crammed  with treasures, brilliant with light, uninhabited, deserted. Was there ever  anything so wonderful? He had to pinch himself to make sure that he was awake. &ldquo;We  have got into the world of the fourth dimension: the fairy-land of the Arabian  Nights. What do you think Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think we had better climb up to the tower,&rdquo; said Robin with unusual common  sense, &ldquo;It is the only place we have left unexplored. There is a light there  too; Aladdin may be aloft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shook his head. &ldquo;He would have heard the bell. However come along. We must find  someone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  some difficulty they discovered the staircase leading to the tower. It was  narrow but straight, and not so steep as might have been expected. At the top  Herrick&mdash;leading as usual&mdash;was confronted by a closed door of plain deal. It  was not locked however, and having knocked without receiving a reply he opened  it. Joyce at his heels peeped over his shoulder and beheld a small square room  with windows on all four sides, and a large central globe burning in the  ceiling. In contrast to the rest of the house, this room was absolutely bare.  Blank walls, Chinese matting on the floor, a camp bedstead in one corner, a  deal table without a covering in another, and two cane chairs. No anchorite  could have had a more ascetic cell.</p>
  <p>Herrick  took in the scene at a glance, took in also, its&mdash;to him&mdash;central feature, the  body of a man lying face downwards, near the bed. Joyce saw the corpse also,  and remained at the door, shaking and white.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder  or suicide?&rdquo; Jim asked himself as he turned over the dead.</p>
  <p>That,  which had once been a man, was in evening dress. In the finest of linen and  jewellery, the most immaculate of clothes, it lay under the scrutinising eye of  Dr. Herrick. A lean evil face, with a hook nose, scanty grey hair cut short and  a long moustache carefully trimmed. The left hand gripped a revolver; the shirt  front over the heart was covered with blood, and a stream, coagulated and  black, streaked the matting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  God&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; cried Joyce not daring to enter, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was once the owner of this house I suppose,&rdquo; said Herrick grimly. &ldquo;Now, it is a  piece of carrion. Suicide apparently. Dead over twenty-four hours. Shot through  the heart. A steady hand to do that. H&rsquo;m, left-handed too. Is it suicide, or  murder? Here&rsquo;s a damnable discovery to cap the adventure,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim gravely.</p>
  <p>From  the doorway came a gasp, a tittering laugh. Jim had just time to spring forward  when Joyce lunged into his arms. The long expected nerve-storm had come at  last.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    De mortuis nil nisi malum</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="quote">&ldquo;And sunsets fire, the Saxham spire,<br>
My guide post unto heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  sang midway in the last century a local poet, who died long since and passed,  poems and all, into oblivion. But the famous spire in its copper sheathing  still catches the sunlight, and glows in the centre of Saxham, a veritable  pillar of fire. Those natives who have emigrated, enlisted as soldiers, taken  situations in London and elsewhere, shipped before the mast, as some have done,  always remember church and spire. The children recall its ruddy blaze when they  read Exodus.</p>
  <p>Saxham  was not a large place. It might have contained a couple of hundred inhabitants,  probably less, and these principally agricultural labourers. They worked on the  farms and estates which dotted the vast alluvial plain stretching to  Beorminster. As the city, like that one mentioned in the Bible, is set upon a  hill, the twin towers of the cathedral and Bishop Gandolf&rsquo;s spire can easily be  seen from Saxham. But the villagers prefer their own spire and their own  parson, rarely venturing the three miles to Beorminster. Those who do go,  always return to their beloved hamlet, more convinced than ever as to the  superiority of their birthplace. A sturdy stubborn set of rustics, these men  and women of Saxham.</p>
  <p>The  topography of the country as set down in Herrick&rsquo;s map, showed that Saxham was  almost the centre of the district, taking Beorminster as the real navel. The  great plain was covered with many such hamlets, each clustering round its  parent church; but Saxham was the nearest to the city. Far away on the other  side was smoky Irongrip the manufacturing town; almost in sight of Marleigh and  Heathcroft. Then sixteen miles across Southberry Heath (which Herrick and Joyce  had so wearily trodden on the previous night) Southberry Junction roared with  perpetual traffic for here, the great main line tapped the local railways which  converged from all points. The pine-woods, sheltering Saxham from the chill  winds of the moor, also barred it from the outside world, as Southberry was  considered to be. Saxham, with its neighbouring hamlets, claimed to belong  solely to Beorminster. The folk would have called themselves autochthonous, had  they known of such a word and its meaning.</p>
  <p>The  plan of the village was simple. In its centre was a genuine village green, with  a quincunx of immemorial elms. From this ran four streets through the mass of  houses, until they passed beyond them altogether and out into the country. On  one side stands St. Edith&rsquo;s church in a nest of trees; on the other &lsquo;The Carr  Arms&rsquo; an inn of undoubted antiquity. The remaining two sides are occupied by  rows of medi&aelig;val-looking houses, inhabited by those whom Saxham calls &ldquo;the best  people,&rdquo; by which is meant the tradesmen. There was no doctor or lawyer and the  rector representing the gentry in the village itself, dwelt on its outskirts.  The country people lived outside the village on their estates and visited it  only on business; and as there were no Radicals in Saxham, these were looked  upon as more than mortal.</p>
  <p>Under  the red tiled roof of &lsquo;The Carr Arms,&rsquo; Robin Joyce was still sleeping the next  morning when the green was filled with excited people talking of the murder&mdash;so  they called it. The events of the previous night had so shaken the nerve of the  little man, that it was all Herrick could do to get him out of that ghastly mansion,  and down to the inn. Dr. Jim, rousing the landlord, had told his story and  after seeing Robin to bed, had turned in himself. What did it matter to him,  that the great house was still ablaze in the pine-wood, still filled with  precious things, and its doors and windows open to thieves? He was too tired  almost to think, and the moment his head was on the pillow, he fell into a  heavy dreamless slumber, which lasted until ten the next morning.</p>
  <p>From  this much-needed rest, he was awakened by Napper, the landlord, a burly man,  with a ruddy face suggestive of beef and beer in large quantities. In no very  pleasant humour, Jim sat up, to demand with a growl and an adjective what was  wanted. On being informed that Mr. Inspector Bridge of Beorminster waited to see  him, the events of the night came back on his still drowsy brain with a rush.  Thoroughly awakened, he promised to be down in half an hour, and forthwith  tumbled into the largest cold bath Napper could provide. After a douche, and  ten minutes&rsquo; gymnastics, the Doctor hurried into a clean shirt and his homespun  suit. While he dressed he meditated on the fact that Napper had lost no time in  telling the police what had happened. In a few minutes he looked into Robin&rsquo;s  bedroom, and finding his companion still in an exhausted slumber, he went  downstairs alone, to face the officer.</p>
  <p>Inspector  Bridge was a tall lean man with a serious face, and&mdash;what was surprising taken  in conjunction with his funereal looks&mdash;a jocular manner. The man&rsquo;s humour  lurked in his eyes&mdash;a grey pair of twinklers, which belied the turned-down  corners of his mouth. His movements were slow, his tone was brisk and  businesslike. Rather a contradictory personality Herrick thought, and concluded  that Bridge resembled nothing so much as an undertaker out for a holiday. His  profession would thus account for the solemnity and slowness, and the holiday  explain his brisk jocularity.</p>
  <p>This  incongruous officer considered the young man with a pursed-up mouth and a  humorsome eye. He saw that Herrick was a gentleman, and this opinion being  confirmed&mdash;in the Inspector&rsquo;s mind&mdash;by the sight of a signet ring, he treated  him with more deference than he had been prepared to show. Napper&rsquo;s report of  the pedestrians had led Bridge to infer that they were of the genus &ldquo;tramp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  morning sir,&rdquo; began the Inspector genially. &ldquo;I have come to see you about this  murder of Colonel Carr. My card&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Herrick,&rdquo; said Jim, glancing at what he profanely called the official ticket. &ldquo;Have  you breakfasted Mr. Inspector? If not, or if you have&mdash;it really doesn&rsquo;t really  matter&mdash;take the meal with me. I must eat before I can talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bridge  was only too willing, and Herrick went up several degrees in his good opinion. &ldquo;Napper  can cater excellently,&rdquo; said he rubbing his hands. &ldquo;I have often tested his  hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim privately thought that the Inspector was not averse to testing anyone&rsquo;s  hospitality: but the man seemed decent enough, and Herrick was sufficiently  worldly-wise to make himself agreeable to Jack-in-Office. In another half hour  the two were seated in a pleasant parlour before a well-spread table. Bridge  performed wonders in the way of eating. How he could remain lean with such an  appetite, was a wonder to Jim. But the doctor himself was not far behind, and  between the two of them, they swept the table clean. Then Herrick lighted his  pipe, ensconced himself in a chintz-covered arm-chair near the window, and  prepared to answer the Inspector&rsquo;s questions before asking several of his own.</p>
  <p>At  the out-set Bridge detailed, all that had been done up to that moment. Three  policemen were looking after &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; (so was the house called), and  guarding the dead; a doctor was expected from Beorminster to inspect the body;  the Coroner to attend to the inquest; and the relatives of the deceased had  been notified. Then Mr. Inspector put Herrick through a stiff examination, and  took down all he said. When the officer was quite satisfied and his note-book  was full, Jim proceeded to make enquiries on his own account. The strangeness  of the whole affair, roused his curiosity, and&mdash;as Bridge pleasantly  observed,&mdash;he showed marked symptoms of &ldquo;detective fever.&rdquo; This was the first  time Jim had stumbled across the disease.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dead man was called Colonel Carr?&rdquo; asked Dr. Herrick, crossing his legs.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector nodded. &ldquo;A well-known county name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Wilfred Lloyd Carr. You  can see it in Burke&rsquo;s Landed Gentry. But what you will not see,&rdquo; added Bridge  with a dry cough, &ldquo;is the name he was known by hereabouts,&mdash;wicked Colonel Carr  sir. That is what every man woman and child called him, not without reason  Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  It does sound as though he had a bad reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bad  sir,&rdquo; echoed the Inspector not without pride, &ldquo;a regular out and out rip. But  that he belonged to the gentry, he would have been through my hands I can tell  you. And to think of him being murdered. I ain&rsquo;t astonished, no I ain&rsquo;t  astonished. He was too wicked to die in his bed as the Christian he wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say he was murdered?&rdquo; asked Jim alertly. &ldquo;The revolver was in his hand.  Looks like suicide to me,&mdash;at the first glance of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bridge  laughed grimly and shook his head. &ldquo;Colonel Carr was the last man in the world  to take his own life sir,&mdash;too much afraid of the burning pit for that. I  examined the body this morning, and I say&mdash;murder. Certainly my examination was  cursory. But if he had shot himself through the heart, the linen over it would  have been scorched. There is no mark of powder not even a singe. No sir, that  shot was fired at a long range. If you did not alter the position of the body  Dr. Herrick, I should say that the shot had been fired from the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not alter the position of the body Mr. Inspector. I merely turned it over,  and replaced it. H&rsquo;m! murder you say. And the assassin placed the revolver in  the dead hand to hint at suicide. Clever man or woman Mr. Inspector. Which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  knows,&rdquo; replied Bridge rubbing his grey hair. &ldquo;The Colonel had heaps and heaps  of enemies I can tell you. Whether man or woman, I do not know. But I&rsquo;ll tell  you one thing Dr. Herrick, whosoever fired the shot knew the Colonel  excellently well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean. The assassin knew that his victim was left-handed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  sir. You&rsquo;ve hit it. Now,&rdquo; added Bridge meditatively, &ldquo;could it have been  Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco.  Who is he or her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  was the servant of Colonel Carr,&rdquo; explained the Inspector, &ldquo;and as great a  mystery as his master; San Francisco, he called himself, and that I take it is  the name of a town. The wicked Colonel shortened it to Frisco for short. Yes!  Frisco might have killed him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you would only give me a concise biography of Carr, I should be less in the  dark Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you&rsquo;ll hear plenty of stories about him,&mdash;none of them creditable. But to put  all you need know at present into a nut-shell, I can only say that the wicked  Colonel returned here from foreign parts ten years ago. He built that tower,  and shut himself up to live the life of a recluse. He brought Frisco with him,  and the two inhabited that house all alone. No one thought of going near it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  That is why the crime was not discovered earlier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  Doctor. The milkman, the baker, and the butcher, were always instructed to  leave their goods in a porch at the side of the house. In that porch,&rdquo; added  Bridge, &ldquo;we have found two days provisions. To-day is Friday, last night when  you discovered the body was Thursday, and the provisions for that day and  Wednesday were untouched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  So Carr was alive on Tuesday!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe doctor, that he was murdered on Tuesday night. According to Napper,  Frisco, was drinking here on that evening, and spoke ill of his master. Carr  must have been alive then. If Frisco killed him, he would leave Saxham on  Tuesday night, therefore the provisions for Wednesday and Thursday would not be  taken in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  not the baker and the rest suspect anything, when they found two day&rsquo;s  provisions untouched?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord  bless you, no sir,&rdquo; said Bridge jovially. &ldquo;The wicked Colonel was that queer,  that nothing he did seemed strange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  said Jim after a pause. &ldquo;From what you tell me, it seems likely that this man  Frisco knows something of the murder, if he did not commit it himself. Can&rsquo;t  you find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no sign of the man sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about his appearance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stout sailor, that&rsquo;s what he looked like,&rdquo; said Bridge reflecting, &ldquo;red hair  and blue eyes, an American way of speaking, and a cross on his forehead right  above the nose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  cross! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  scar sir; a criss-cross slash with a knife. Frisco said he got it in South  America. But I don&rsquo;t rightly know how. Frisco could be secret if he liked, even  in his cups, and he could drink rum by the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you set the detectives after him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. I am waiting until the inquest is held. It takes place to-day at &lsquo;The  Pines.&rsquo; You will be there Dr. Herrick, and your friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  But my friend can tell you no more than I can. If I were you though Mr.  Inspector, I should certainly seek out this Frisco man at once. What is his  real name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know nor anyone else sir. He was a mystery I tell you. As to looking him  up, I like to do things in an orderly manner. First the inquest and all the  available evidence sir. Then we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his broad shoulders. It was not his business to instruct Bridge, but  it seemed to him foolish to delay hunting for this mysterious Frisco. The man  might be innocent, but on the face of it there appeared to be a strong  suspicion against him. Men do not disappear without some reason; and as Frisco  was gone, leaving a dead body behind him, it looked as though terror had winged  his heels. His reasons could resolve themselves into only one of two things.  Either he had murdered his master himself, and had fled to avoid the  consequences, or he knew who had committed the crime and, intimidated by the  assassin, had made himself scarce.</p>
  <p>While  Herrick was turning over the situation in his own mind, a knock came to the  door, immediately afterwards a girl entered. She was a slip of a thing, who  looked about nineteen, slim and well-set up. Her face was oval and thin, and  burnt red by wind and sun. Herrick had never before seen hair of such a  glorious red; it resembled ruddy gold, and was wreathed in burnished coils  round her well-shaped head. This young lady had eyes of a sapphire blue, and a  firm-set mouth. Dressed in a navy serge plainly made, with a linen collar, a  brown leathern belt, and gauntlet gloves, she looked trig and neat. A girl  likely to be passed over in a crowd until one looked into her wonderful eyes.  The soul that looked out of them proved she was a woman of no common  intelligence. Her manner was refined and well-bred. She was remarkably cool,  and after a shrewd glance at Herrick, addressed herself to the Inspector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon for interrupting you,&rdquo; she said in a brisk but not unmusical  voice, &ldquo;this inquest Mr. Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  takes place at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; this afternoon Miss Endicotte,&rdquo; replied Bridge who  seemed to know her well. &ldquo;But surely Miss you will not attend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  Mr. Bridge. I do the copy for the Chronicle. Besides, poor Colonel Carr was my  friend, and I want to hear the truth about his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked sharply at the only person he had heard speak sympathetically of the  dead man. &ldquo;There lives some soul of good in all things evil,&rdquo; he quoted, and a  flash of the girl&rsquo;s teeth showed that she perfectly understood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know that everyone speaks ill of the Colonel,&rdquo; said she a trifle sadly, &ldquo;he  was bad enough, no doubt. Yet, your quotation applies to him more than the  gossip about him would lead you to suppose.&rdquo; Here she glanced at Bridge. Not so  much to emphasise the fact that he talked ill of the dead, as to invite an  introduction. Bridge was quick to see her real meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is Dr. Herrick, who found the body,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and this lady, doctor is Miss  Bess Endicotte, who reports for the Beorminster Weekly Chronicle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  was a trifle surprised and disappointed to find that this charming young lady  occupied such a position, though why he should have been either he could not  explain even to himself. However he bowed with a smile, and received the same  courtesies in return. Miss Endicotte&rsquo;s eyes rested approvingly on his splendid  figure. &ldquo;This is what I call a man,&rdquo; they seemed to say, but with her tongue  she uttered quite different sentiments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to meet you Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; she said gracefully, &ldquo;you must tell me all  about your discovery,&mdash;that is, you do not mind my making copy out of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; responded Herrick eagerly, &ldquo;I am accustomed to be made copy of. My  friend Mr. Joyce, who is at present upstairs asleep, is a literary man. I am  quite hand and glove with the guild I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case we must be friends,&rdquo; said Miss Endicotte frankly. &ldquo;Mr. Joyce was with  you last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunate  yes Miss Endicotte. He is a nervous man, and not strong. I am sorry to say that  the terrible sight upset him. All the good I hoped he would obtain from this  walking tour has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you on a walking tour?&rdquo; asked Bridge who was putting on his cap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  For the last fortnight we have been tramping over the country. The last place  we stopped at was Southberry. Then we crossed the Heath to stumble on this  disagreeable adventure. Why do you smile Miss Endicotte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl flushed a trifle. &ldquo;I have heard of you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  me,&rdquo; Jim stared, &ldquo;but I am not known in this part of the country my dear lady.  Have we met before? Somehow, your face seems familiar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would be more familiar were I two inches taller and had dark hair,&rdquo; said Miss  Endicotte with an amused look, &ldquo;if you will stare at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  interrupted Jim eagerly, &ldquo;I remember now. The lady I saw talking to the little  curate in Southberry church!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  my sister,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;When you mentioned Southberry, I remembered that  she mentioned how you stared at her, and described your appearance. Then I  recognised you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope your sister did not think me rude,&rdquo; said Jim rather confused, &ldquo;but the  fact is, she is so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Bess composedly. &ldquo;Ida is accustomed to admiration. But  this is not business,&rdquo; she added turning to Bridge, &ldquo;Well what&rsquo;s to be done now  Mr. Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  can be done until the inquest is held,&rdquo; he replied going towards the door. &ldquo;But  I recommend you Miss Bess, to interview this gentleman. He can tell you much  that will be of interest to your readers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Inspector slipped out with a laugh, and Miss Endicotte turned her sparkling  eyes on Dr. Herrick. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t think me a nuisance,&rdquo; she said,  hesitating, &ldquo;but if you could.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  too pleased,&rdquo; said Jim placing a chair. &ldquo;What is it you wish to know Miss  Endicotte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about yourself and your friend, and the walking tour, and the discovery.&rdquo; Thus  far she rattled on blithely, but then flushed, and stammered. &ldquo;Please do not  think me rude,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;in my present capacity I am simply a machine for  the Beormister Chronicle. If you do not wish to tell me anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not the slightest objection,&rdquo; replied Jim laughing. &ldquo;Do you object to my  smoking? I can answer your questions better if I smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  do,&rdquo; cried Miss Endicotte eagerly. &ldquo;I am used to it. My brother Frank is never  without a pipe in his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  brother and I should get on well together then,&rdquo; said Herrick artfully, not  that he wanted to meet the brother so much as the beauty-sister of Southberry  Church, &ldquo;however&mdash;this interview!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Bess&mdash;as the Inspector called her, pulled out a pocket-book, and became the  reporter at once. She was versed in her profession and put the shrewdest of  questions. All the same she appeared to be nervous at times, and Herrick  guessed that it was the innately refined woman struggling with the necessary  obstrusiveness of the bread-winner. However he did his best to put her at her  ease, and told his story as concisely as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name is James Calthorpe Herrick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am a doctor, supposed to be  practising in West Kensington, London. My friend Joyce was one of my  patients&mdash;is I should say. He lost his mother and fell ill&mdash;by the way you need  not put that down Miss Endicotte. All you need let your readers know is, that  Mr. Joyce and myself have been on a walking tour, and stumbled&mdash;as I said  before, on the Pines, and the body.&rdquo; After which statement Herrick detailed the  arrival at the lighted house, the exploration and the discovery.</p>
  <p>Miss  Endicotte put all this down, and promised to amplify it in such a manner that  it would not trench upon Herrick&rsquo;s private affairs. Then he asked the girl  about Colonel Carr. She was rather reticent on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not feel that I am justified in speaking of the matter,&rdquo; she said shaking  her head, &ldquo;all I can say is that Colonel Carr was better than his reputation.  From what I can gather he was murdered. Well, he expected to be&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo; she  broke off and flushed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  expected to be murdered!&rdquo; Herrick looked keenly at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo;  said Miss Endicotte with a glance at the door. &ldquo;I have no right to say that. It  is a long story, and not very clear. If you remain in Saxham, if we become  better acquainted, I might&mdash;how long do you stay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  all depends upon my friend,&rdquo; replied Herrick his curiosity at fever-heat with  these hints, &ldquo;he is ill I am afraid. I must go up and see him now. We shall  meet again I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. I shall be at the inquest. And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I must give evidence. Joyce also if he is well enough. By the way  Bridge mentioned some relatives of Carr&rsquo;s. Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Marsh and her son,&rdquo; said the girl with some reluctance, &ldquo;they live in the  Bishop&rsquo;s Close at Beorminster. It will be a great shock to them, although they  were not on good terms with the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  they be at the inquest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Marsh will be there but his mother is very ill. She caught cold a day or two  ago, and is now in bed with a sharp attack of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Troubles  never come singly,&rdquo; said Herrick sententiously, &ldquo;by the way, the suspicions of  Bridge about Frisco?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure he is innocent,&rdquo; cried Miss Endicotte flushing. &ldquo;Frisco was bad, but he  loved the Colonel. He would not have killed him. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; she suddenly shook her  head, checked herself, and walked out of the room. Herrick stared. Was it  possible that this charming girl knew the truth?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Verdict Of The Jury</b></h2>
  <p>Robin  woke calmer after his rest. The nervous excitement had passed away, but the  reaction had left him as weak as a child. He looked shrivelled up and pale when  Herrick saw him. At once the doctor sat down to feel the little man&rsquo;s pulse,  which was slow and faint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must stay in bed to-day,&rdquo; ordered the doctor replacing his watch. &ldquo;I shall send  you up some strong soup. Sleep as much as you can, that is the best thing to  pull you round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Should  I not get up to look after this business with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no need. The police have taken charge of the Case. Your evidence is exactly  the same as mine, so I shall represent you at the Inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there to be an inquest?&rdquo; asked Joyce with languid interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!  This afternoon at the house. From what Inspector Bridge told me it would seem  that Colonel Carr was shot on Tuesday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the dead man&rsquo;s name Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Wicked Colonel Carr. From all accounts he was one of the worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did he commit suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not, if Bridge is to be believed. He insists that the man was shot&mdash;perhaps  by his servant, who has vanished. However we shall hear all that is to be heard  this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  colour crept into the wan cheek of Joyce. &ldquo;I should like to get up and hear all  about it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there might be material for a story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can hear details later on. At present you must stay in bed, until we return to  Town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about our walking tour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have decided to cut that short,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;this adventure has given  me a distaste for the trip. In a day or so, when you are rested we will return  to London. My practice is small but I must attend to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what about me Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  reflected Herrick, &ldquo;you are now well enough off not to make work an imperative  necessity. I think you should go abroad for a time, and do nothing, until you  are quite yourself. Explore Italy or Spain, and don&rsquo;t do a stroke of work.  Change of scene and company will make you your old self again in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,  never!&rdquo; moaned Joyce. &ldquo;I shall never get over her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  Don&rsquo;t give way Robin. You must be a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was so sudden,&rdquo; pleaded Robin piteously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. Didn&rsquo;t I attend her! But apoplexy always ends suddenly. Your mother was a  stout woman and took no exercise. That fit might have been expected; I warned  her often. You know I am sorry for your loss Robin; but sorrow will not bring  back the dead. You have your part to play in the world, so you must put this  grief behind you. If I talk a little brutally, you must excuse me. To a man of  your temperament, sympathy is the worst thing possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  Herrick&rsquo;s hands Joyce was more or less of a child, so he submitted&mdash;rather  against his will&mdash;to remain in bed, while his friend went forth to hear the  news. As might have been guessed Robin employed his solitude in gloating over  his sorrow. This weakness he did not dare to reveal to Jim, fearing lest he  should be lectured again. Still, he could not but acknowledge to himself that  Herrick&rsquo;s advice was sensible.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the doctor made a tour of the village. The villagers, swarming like bees in the  excitement of the moment, recognised a stranger, and guessed that this was one  of the two gentlemen said to have discovered the body. Hence Herrick found  himself the subject of considerable curiosity, but was not molested or accosted  in any way, until he met with a clergyman. This was on the outskirts of the  village, where a gorse-covered common stretched up to the pine wood surrounding  the house of Colonel Carr. The parson seemed to have been wandering on the  waste land, for he appeared suddenly at Herrick&rsquo;s elbow like a ghost. Probably  he had seen the stranger coming and had just stepped out from behind a bush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are Dr. Herrick?&rdquo; he asked nervously.</p>
  <p>Jim  signified that he was. &ldquo;I am, addressing the vicar?&rdquo; he hazarded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  rector,&rdquo; corrected the other. &ldquo;I am Mr. Pentland Corn. You will excuse my  breaking in on your meditations,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but I guessed that you were  the finder of the body of our late lamented friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  From all I have heard, there is very little lamentation over the Colonel&rsquo;s  death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scandal  and evil tongues,&rdquo; replied Mr. Corn rather tautologically, &ldquo;Carr had his good  points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what Miss Endicotte says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!  I was not aware that you knew Miss Endicotte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  came to the inn this morning to see Inspector Bridge about this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  said the Revd. Pentland in a hurry, &ldquo;some mistake. Miss Bess is the journalist.  Her elder sister Miss Ida is the head of the family. The nominal head I should  say, since Miss Bess manages everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rector smiled as he spoke, and Herrick on account of that smile took rather a  fancy to him. The Revd. Pentland Corn&mdash;wonderful name&mdash;was something under  forty; and looked more like a soldier than a parson. He had a smart soldierly  figure, wore a moustache, and his hair cropped close. But for his clothes,  Herrick would have taken him for a military man. He looked pale, there were  dark circles under his eyes, and he seemed to be labouring under considerable  stress of emotion. Perhaps the death of Carr had been too much for him. Yet  after the first remark he shirked the subject and talked of the Endicottes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the proper name of the family,&rdquo; said Corn hurriedly, &ldquo;a very old family in  these parts. But Miss Bess calls her collective brothers and sisters &lsquo;The Biff&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim smiled. There seemed to be something fascinating about the name, something  characteristic of the girl he had met at the inn. &ldquo;The Biff&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he repeated  laughing outright, &ldquo;and how is that derived from the high sounding name of  Endicotte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not derived from that at all Dr. Herrick. It is simply the initials of the  family. There are five of them. Bess, Ida, Frank, Flo, and Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see; Biff&rsquo;s! Ha! Ha, how amusing. Do they live near here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  quarter of a mile away, at the back of my house. Sidney is my pupil and a  strange boy he is. But I have no business to tell all these things to a  stranger,&rdquo; added Corn in confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  you say to me is perfectly safe,&rdquo; replied Herrick pleasantly. &ldquo;I think Miss  Bess a clever young lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as good as she is clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  great friend of the late Colonel&rsquo;s I believe,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
  <p>Pentland  Corn moistened his dry lips. &ldquo;He was kind to her,&rdquo; was his reply delivered in a  faint voice. &ldquo;You will excuse my emotion Dr. Herrick but I am rather shaken by  this death. Usually we are free from crime, and for this to happen in my  parish! It is terrible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew Colonel Carr well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well. I tried to win him from his evil ways. But he was cut off in the midst of  his sin. Oh, it is awful. Yet I liked him. He was a good friend to me on one  occasion. The reason I stopped you, was to ask if you met anyone in the house  last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one. Myself and my friend hunted all over it. The servant bolted, I have been  told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  has certainly disappeared,&rdquo; responded Corn looking at the ground, &ldquo;but I do not  think he is the guilty person. He was devoted to the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did he run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  who can say! There was a mystery in Colonel Carr&rsquo;s life Mr. Herrick, which I  fear will never be cleared up. You will be at the Inquest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It takes place at three this afternoon. And you sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I shall not be there. I cannot bear to&mdash;but that is neither here nor there,&rdquo;  broke off Corn hurriedly, &ldquo;tell me, was the house alight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every  room was lighted. It blazed like a palace in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Carr&rsquo;s whim. He surrounded himself with the most beautiful things and installed  the electric light. Water power you know,&rdquo; added the rector rather  inconsequently. &ldquo;I expect the wheel was going constantly for the two days  before the body was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  recollected the murmur in the wood, and now guessed that it came from the  waterfall, which turned the wheel for the dynamos. There was no doubt that  Colonel Carr surrounded himself with every comfort. &ldquo;Did he ever have guests to  stay with him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  rector made a gesture of surprise. &ldquo;If you had known Colonel Carr you would not  ask such a question. He hated his fellow-mortals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why had he so many bedrooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you. But I am certain that he never had anyone to stay in the  house. I have been in it once or twice myself, and Miss Bess has paid a visit.  But no other person has ever entered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Quite a mystery. What about Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  I expect you heard of him from Miss Bess. He is a great friend of the Biffs.  Stephen Marsh will inherit the Colonel&rsquo;s property I expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  relation was he to Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  nephew. But the two never spoke. They hated each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Marsh then is the Colonel&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me no. The present Mrs. Marsh is only step-mother to Stephen. A violent  terrible woman with Italian blood in her veins. It was she I think who put  Stephen against his uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is very ill I hear. Pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me,&rdquo; said Corn startled, &ldquo;why she was at my house on Tuesday! But it was  raining when Stephen came for her. I expect she got a chill then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. At all events she is seriously ill now I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said the rector and looked down again. &ldquo;I wonder if any doctor will attend her.  She has quarrelled with them all. Well, there is no more to be said Dr.  Herrick. By the way, if I have talked freely, you must excuse me for doing so.  I have a reason. Some day I hope to tell it to you. Are you stopping here for  long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  day or so. I am on a walking tour with my friend Mr. Joyce. We return shortly  to London. Good-day Mr. Corn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo;  replied the rector raising his hat, and slipped away into the gorse bushes like  a ghost.</p>
  <p>Herrick  walked on somewhat puzzled. What was the meaning of this frank speech, to a  stranger. The parson looked smarter and more of a man of the world than many  serious minded people would have approved of. Yet he had talked, to say the  least of it, in a most indiscreet manner. Moreover he had promised (quite  unnecessarily) to explain his reason for doing so to the doctor. What did it  all mean? &ldquo;Does he know something, as well as Miss Bess?&rdquo; thought Herrick  returning to the inn. &ldquo;Both of them seem to have a better opinion of Colonel  Carr, than the rest of the people. Humph! I seem to be surrounded by mysteries  here. Well. We shall see what the inquest will do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  proved more fractious than Herrick expected. He was most anxious to be present  at the inquest: but in the end over-ruled by the stronger will of his friend,  he consented to remain where he was. The doctor walked by himself to the Pines,  and was received by Inspector Bridge who introduced him to the Coroner, and to  Dr. Tiler, who had examined the body. After some discussion, Bridge collected a  jury of mixed villagers and Beorminster citizens. After these had inspected the  body, the witnesses were called.</p>
  <p>Herrick  gave evidence of his discovery, of the position of the body, and of the condition  of the house. He was followed by Tiler, who declared that in his opinion Carr  had been shot on Tuesday night (going by the condition of the body). He flouted  the idea of suicide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  shirt-front was neither blackened nor singed,&rdquo; said Tiler, &ldquo;and it would have  been had the deceased fired the revolver at so close a range. He was shot  through the heart, and as I believe, by someone who stood at the door. It seems  to me, that he was standing by the bed, and heard a footstep on the stairs. At  once he turned, only to meet the levelled revolver. The shot passed through his  heart and imbedded itself in the opposite wall. Again, there are three other  shots in different parts of the body. One in the neck, another in the abdomen,  and a third in the right leg. But the shot that killed the deceased was the the  first that went through the heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that such a shot was the first?&rdquo; asked the Coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  an examination of the wounds,&rdquo; replied Tiler, &ldquo;the remaining three shots were  fired when the man was down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  dead!&rdquo; said the Coroner aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  The deceased must have died almost instantaneously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  thrill of horror passed through those present at the idea, that the assassin  had fired three more shots at the dead body. There was something horrible about  the wreaking of such vengeance. And vengeance it must have been, for Bridge  proved that no robbery had taken place.</p>
  <p>But  the most interesting part of Bridge&rsquo;s evidence was yet to come. He produced the  revolver found in the hand of the dead man. All six chambers proved to be  loaded. Therefore it would not have been this weapon which had been used. The  idea of suicide was out of the question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also  gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the Inspector, &ldquo;the first shot was fired with a different  weapon to that employed to fire the other three. The bullet which passed  through the heart and embedded itself in the wall, has been extracted. Here it  is. The other three shots were found in the body and in the floor. Here they  are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pieces of evidence thus produced were placed before the jury. The first bullet  was round&mdash;of the old-fashioned kind fired from a muzzle-loading pistol. The  remaining three were conical in shape, and of the most modern manufacture.  Plainly then two pistols had been used. One of an antique pattern to fire the  first shot&mdash;the shot which killed the Colonel: and the other a revolver of the  most modern type. And this latter had been merely employed to make a target of  the dead body. &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; said Bridge after explaining all this, &ldquo;the third  pistol&mdash;or rather revolver found in the hand of the deceased, was not fired at  all. The chambers are loaded&mdash;there is no smoke-stain on the barrels. It was  simply put into the left hand of the dead to hint at suicide. The person who  did so, knew that Colonel Carr was left-handed, but in his agitation forgot  that the six chambers were loaded. In fact he defeated his own scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  evidence was surprising enough. Why should the assassin use two pistols, when  one would have sufficed? &ldquo;And?&rdquo; asked the Coroner, &ldquo;why do you say &lsquo;he&rsquo; Mr.  Inspector? Do you then think that the guilty person is a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think a woman would have committed so brutal a murder,&rdquo; said Bridge  bluntly. &ldquo;She would have been satisfied with killing the man, and not have  proceeded to mutilate the body. Also the idea of putting a revolver into the  hand of the dead would not occur to a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  I differ from you Mr. Inspector,&rdquo; contradicted the Coroner, &ldquo;a woman might do  such a thing, and it is more likely a woman would forget in her agitation that  the revolver was loaded, than would a man in the like circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  and Coroner argued out this point. At length Bridge losing his temper stated  that he believed Frisco shot his master and called Napper as a witness.</p>
  <p>The  landlord stated that on Tuesday night at six o&rsquo;clock Frisco had been drinking  rum at the Carr Arms. He seemed to be angry with his master whom he alleged had  treated him badly. As he left the inn, about seven o&rsquo;clock, he said, &ldquo;let him  take care, or he won&rsquo;t live long.&rdquo; At the time Napper thought it was merely a  drunken threat; but in the face of the death and Frisco&rsquo;s flight he thought  that the man was guilty. Of course the Coroner, who had lost his temper with  Bridge, told Napper that he did not want his opinion, but simply his evidence.  There was further trouble about this remark, in which the Inspector got the  worst of it.</p>
  <p>A  final witness was Stephen Marsh. He was a tall slight young man with bowed  shoulders, and a pensive face. He stated that he had called on the evening of  the murder for his mother at the rectory. She had been up at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; in the  afternoon, and as she drove home told him, that Colonel Carr had expressed his  intention of living for many a long day.</p>
  <p>Coroner.  &ldquo;Why is Mrs. Marsh not here to give evidence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh.  &ldquo;My mother is seriously ill in bed and could not come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner.  &ldquo;Her evidence must be taken. Did she say how the conversation came about to  induce the deceased to make such a speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh.  &ldquo;Yes! My mother wanted the Colonel to lend her some money. He refused. She said  that he might as well, as when he died the estate would come to me. It was then  that my uncle expressed his determination to live for many a long day. I merely  give this evidence to show that my uncle had no thought of committing suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner.  &ldquo;Have you seen your uncle lately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh.  &ldquo;No! Not for six months. We were not on good terms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner.  &ldquo;How was it then that Mrs. Marsh called to see him on the afternoon of the  murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh.  &ldquo;She was determined to go. I asked her not to, but she insisted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this reply there came a smile upon the faces of those of the jury who lived at  Beorminster. Afterwards Herrick learned that Mrs. Marsh was well known as  possessed of a violent temper, and there was no doubt (as some one remarked)  that she had given the Colonel a good talking to.</p>
  <p>However  the evidence of Marsh did not point to who had killed Carr. At the time there  was no more available evidence. Bridge insisted that Frisco was guilty. He had  left the house in the clothes he stood up in, evidently driven forth in a  panic. He had made inquiries, and had heard from the police at Southberry, that  Frisco&mdash;or a person answering to the description of Frisco&mdash;had gone to London  by the morning train. At this moment Herrick asked to be allowed to give  further evidence. He had just recollected that he had seen such a man as was  described.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was stopping at Southberry,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;waiting for my friend Mr. Joyce who  had gone to London. He went up on Tuesday morning. I was stopping at an inn  near the railway station. I got up early&mdash;about seven&mdash;to send a wire to my  house in London. I had to go to the telegraph office at the station. On the  platform I saw a stout man with a soft hat pulled over his face. He was dressed  in a blue serge suit with a red tie, and looked like a sailor. I waited until  the London train went, and saw him get into a third class carriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner.  &ldquo;How is it Dr. Herrick that you recollect this only now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I never thought of the matter before. Since Inspector Bridge has given a  description of the dress and especially the red tie. I am sure the man was  Frisco. I did not see his face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Coroner was displeased with this evidence, and said so. In fact he was a  disagreeable man, with a strong animus against Bridge. As there was no more  evidence, he summed up, trying to prove that Frisco could have had nothing to  do with the murder. However the jury were of a different opinion and more  sensible, so they brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Frisco. This  made the Coroner ill-tempered again and he left &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; in a great rage.  However the verdict was given, the inquest was at an end, and the jury left the  house.</p>
  <p>Stephen  Marsh as the nearest relative of the dead man, asked Bridge to allow the three  policemen to remain in the house, as he had to return to his mother. Bridge  consented, and then Marsh went up to Herrick who was standing in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;will you come with me to Beorminster? I want you to attend my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. &ldquo;She has a doctor already has she not Mr. Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh  shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice &ldquo;no Beorminster doctor will  attend her. Please come sir. She is so ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Although  he was partly prepared for this explanation, Herrick could not help staring.  What had Mrs. Marsh done that the medical fraternity at Beorminster should  boycott her in this way? &ldquo;You are quite sure that no one will attend her?&rdquo; he  asked incredulously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly.  She has quarrelled with all the doctors. I am very lucky to find you Dr.  Herrick, or I should be obliged to send to London or to Southberry. And we are  so poor, that the expense would be too much for us. You will come I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  liked the young man&rsquo;s face. It was soft and mild, but remarkably handsome in a  dark way. He could quite understand from such a face that a woman of imperious  temper such as Mrs. Marsh appeared to be, could dominate and bully her  step-son. If fact Stephen gave Herrick the impression of being crushed. It  seemed to be Herrick&rsquo;s fate to meet with people who needed to be bolstered  up,&mdash;witness Robin Joyce. Also he had a shrewd suspicion that the Revd.  Pentland Corn was of the weak type. The proverb says that some men come into  the world booted and spurred others saddled and bridled. Herrick was of the  former type, and these three weaklings of the latter. However, in spite of his  strong will, and dominating character, Jim had a kind heart. He therefore  consented to do Marsh the favour he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I must go first to the inn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my friend is there, and I must see after  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  wait for you,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;but pray do not be long. I think my mother is  dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim cheerily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull her round. Never give way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh  put out his hand and shook Jim&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I have wanted a friend for many a long day,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I believe I have found one in you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right Marsh,&rdquo; and so Jim took a second burden on his shoulder.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    At Beorminster</b></h2>
  <p>On  their way to the inn, Herrick and his companion, met Bess Endicotte. She looked  angry and her eyes sparkled as she advanced towards the two men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  it a shame?&rdquo; she said rapidly, &ldquo;that verdict I mean. I don&rsquo;t believe that  Frisco killed the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he did not there was no reason why he should have run away,&rdquo; replied Marsh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  cried Miss Endicotte indignantly, &ldquo;I did not expect to hear you say that  Stephen. You know as well as I do that the Colonel always said that Frisco was  in the same danger as he was himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  danger was that?&rdquo; asked Herrick sharply.</p>
  <p>Bess  hesitated, and seemed to regret that she had let her tongue wag so freely, but  Marsh answered for her. &ldquo;We do not know what it was,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;but my  uncle always hinted that he had enemies. Frisco knew his secrets; we did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if that is the case why should Frisco kill him?&rdquo; retorted Bess. &ldquo;However what  is done can&rsquo;t be undone. I suppose Frisco will be arrested!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll  have to catch him first,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim a trifle grimly, &ldquo;and as the man has got  away so rapidly, and is now lost in the wilderness of London, I expect they  will have some difficulty in doing that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure it was Frisco you saw at Southberry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I did not see his face. But the clothes of the man at the station were the same  in all respects as those described by Napper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  put everything down,&rdquo; said Miss Endicotte, &ldquo;and now I am going home to  Biffstead to put the article into shape. But I do not believe that Frisco is  guilty. Who is, I do not pretend to know; but I intend to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the police fail to do, you cannot Bess,&rdquo; said Stephen wagging his head, &ldquo;but we  must not wait. Dr. Herrick is coming with me to Beorminster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so glad,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;It is a shame none of the doctors seeing your  mother! How lucky that Dr. Herrick is here. I shall see you again doctor shan&rsquo;t  I! I have much to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall call on you with pleasure,&rdquo; said Jim gravely shaking hands. &ldquo;At Biffstead  I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Both  Stephen and Bess laughed. &ldquo;Oh, that is only my joke,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I call our  family the Biffs and the house Biffstead. The Grange is where we live. Anyone  will point out the place. Come when you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the two men resumed their walk, Herrick could not forbear expressing himself  about Bess. &ldquo;What a clever girl she is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;those eyes of hers twinkle  like stars when she grows excited. You know the family do you not Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have known them all my life. We played together as children. Ida is my greatest  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  glanced a little jealously at the young man. &ldquo;I saw her by chance at  Southberry,&rdquo; he said carelessly, &ldquo;she is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  but not so clever as Bess. Bess is the head and tail and middle of the family.  Were it not for her, it would go to pieces. But here we are at the inn. I&rsquo;ll  wait for you here Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; said the doctor, and ran up the stairs.</p>
  <p>As  might be guessed Robin the selfish was by no means pleased to be left alone. He  did not want Jim to go to Beorminster, not even although the call was so  imperative. &ldquo;What shall I do without you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will go to sleep,&rdquo; replied Herrick calmly, &ldquo;now no nonsense Joyce. I have  promised to see Mrs. Marsh and I must keep my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long will you be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  all depends upon the state in which I find Mrs. Marsh. If she is very ill I may  stay all night. Good-bye Robin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo;  returned the little man a trifle sulkily, &ldquo;there is far too much of the good  Samaritan about you Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never think of that in relation to yourself,&rdquo; said Herrick with a laugh. &ldquo;I  hope to be back this evening. Make yourself comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he ran down to rejoin Marsh, he could not help contrasting the two natures of  Stephen and Robin. It is true that he had not had much experience of Marsh; but  from what he had seen of him, he judged that he was of a grateful, kindly  disposition. Joyce on the other hand, although he looked upon Jim as his best  friend, was selfish to the core. Herrick from long association, and because he  had plucked him back on one occasion from the grave, was attached to him. But  he oftentimes acknowledged that were not Robin an interesting &ldquo;case&rdquo; from a  medical point of view, as he undoubtedly was, he could not stand much of him.  Still he had been so long the little man&rsquo;s friend, that he could not tear  himself away from old associations. Nevertheless Robin&rsquo;s yoke was beginning to  gall, and Herrick was glad to get a day away from his society. Friendship is a  tender plant, and nothing kills it sooner than selfishness. But Robin in his  peevish self-satisfaction had not the sense to see that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind going by the bus?&rdquo; asked Marsh with a flush. &ldquo;I am not rich enough to  afford a cart of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite used to public conveyances,&rdquo; said Herrick gaily, &ldquo;and as to your being  poor, the dark days are over now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so,&rdquo; replied Marsh thankfully, &ldquo;at least my uncle always told me that I  was to be his heir, although we quarrelled so much. I have to take the name of  Carr, and fulfil certain duties. I do not know what they are, but I shall do  them if only to get the money. I do so want to be rich. Ah here is the bus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the will?&rdquo; asked Herrick as they climbed up to the roof of the clumsy  conveyance, &ldquo;pardon me, perhaps I should not ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not mind in the least,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;indeed I am glad to find that you  take an interest in me. I have had a lonely life. The Biffs are my only  friends. By the way who told you about the Biffs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  described his meeting with Pentland Corn, and the conversation that had ensued.  &ldquo;He was remarkably confidential,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is strange,&rdquo; said Marsh thoughtfully. &ldquo;He usually keeps his mouth very much  closed. However,&rdquo; he added in a lighter tone, &ldquo;we can talk of him again. At  present, we will speak of the will. I have written to my uncle&rsquo;s solicitors  informing them of his terrible death. I expect to hear from them to-morrow or  the next day&mdash;perhaps later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are your uncle&rsquo;s lawyers&mdash;or rather I should say yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frith  and Frith!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Steel Lane. Cheapside?&rdquo; asked Herrick in a tone of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know of them. They are the solicitors of my friend Joyce!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is strange,&rdquo; said Marsh gaily, &ldquo;the world is very small after all is it not.  But I am forgetting my mother,&rdquo; he added sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was told that Mrs. Marsh was your step-mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she is; but we get on very well together. She is devoted to me. I expect you  have heard of her violent temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I have,&rdquo; said Herrick hesitating, &ldquo;it seems to be well known, if you will  excuse my saying so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s Town talk,&rdquo; replied Stephen with a vexed flush, &ldquo;but she is really a good  dear woman, and her own worst enemy. Since my father&rsquo;s death five years ago she  has been my best friend. Once she nursed me through a most serious illness.  There are worse women in the world than my step-mother Herrick, as you will  find. She is a noble-looking woman, and I am glad to be rich if only for her  sake. She is fond of luxury, but for my sake has borne poverty. And we have  been very, very poor,&rdquo; finished Stephen with a sigh.</p>
  <p>Every  word the young man uttered revealed his good heart. Jim was pleased to find  such an unsophisticated youth for once in his life. The young men he knew were  usually old before their time, and took a pride in being so. But Marsh talked  with such candour, that Herrick saw he was as simple as the day. &ldquo;You are a  good fellow Marsh,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I am glad to have met you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  echo your compliment,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but here we are at Beorminster. I hope  my mother is no worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  vehicle stopped at the foot of the hill upon which the cathedral was built.  Herrick followed his companion up a winding street, as steep as those at Malta,  and after a breathless climb found himself in the great square. The vast fabric  of the cathedral rose black against a saffron sky, and the bells were ringing  for the evening service. Stephen led the way towards a far corner of the  square, and turned into a dingy side street sloping down the other side of the  hill. Stopping at a tall narrow house three doors down, he admitted himself by  means of his latch-key and conducted his companion into a dark passage. A woman  with a candle held high above her head appeared at the end. She was very old,  with white hair and fierce black eyes, a foreigner, as Herrick guessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  is my mother, Petronella?&rdquo; asked Stephen hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh  Gran&rsquo; Dio, bad, very bad Signor,&rdquo; replied the old Italian, &ldquo;she die if no  doctor come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought one, Petronella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  be to the saints!&rdquo; cried Petronella. &ldquo;This way Signor Dottore. My signora is up  the stair. Piano! Piano. She is bad so bad. Piano!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  suppressed a laugh. The &ldquo;Piano! Piano&rdquo; of Petronella reminded him of the  opening chorus in the Barber of Seville. However he recovered his grave air  when introduced into the bedroom of Mrs. Marsh. A few minutes examination  convinced him that she was extremely ill. Her pulse was rapid, she was in a  high fever, and her face looked scarlet. Still she was conscious, and when the  doctor had finished with her for the time being she beckoned to her step-son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  death&mdash;the examination?&rdquo; she asked hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  jury have brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  spite of the pain she was suffering Mrs. Marsh sank back on her pillow with a  smile. &ldquo;I always thought that man would kill Carr some day&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Who  is the doctor Stephen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh  detailed all he knew about Herrick while that gentleman was giving directions  to Petronella. His step-mother listened attentively, and nodded when he  finished. &ldquo;I am glad he had the decency to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These wretches  here should be punished by the law. I don&rsquo;t want to die now there is a chance  of being comfortable for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not talk Mrs. Marsh,&rdquo; said Herrick coming to her bedside, &ldquo;and I think  your son had better go downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I very ill?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are not so bad as you might be,&rdquo; replied Jim cheerfully, &ldquo;do not excite  yourself, obey my directions, and you will be all right shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suffer such pains,&rdquo; moaned Mrs. Marsh, &ldquo;I can get no sleep. Chloral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo; asked Herrick sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chloral  or morphia. Give me something to soothe the pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see to it,&rdquo; said the doctor cheerfully, and looked at the handsome face of his  patient. He saw that she was a highly-strung woman, and from the word she had  used he guessed that she was in the habit of taking chloral to induce sleep.  Mrs. Marsh was the kind of person who would end her days in a mad-house, if not  soothed by artificial means. From the passionate expression in her eyes, the  wrinkles on her face, her impatient gestures, Herrick saw that she had  absolutely no control over her temper. Perhaps the rumours he had heard of her  influenced such a judgment; but afterwards he found that he was absolutely  right. The outbursts of rage to which Mrs. Marsh was subject were little  removed from madness. The only person who could deal with her was Petronella,  who (as Herrick learned) had been her nurse, and knew how to manage and humour  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall stay here all night,&rdquo; he said to the Italian, after certain remedies had  been applied. &ldquo;Make up a bed for me somewhere and send out to the chemist for  this prescription to be made up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was late when Jim descended. He found Stephen waiting for him at the foot of  the stairs, and was conducted by him into a small bare room, sparsely furnished  with two arm chairs, a few books and a table covered with writing materials.  Herrick rather tired, threw himself into one of the chairs, and informed  Stephen that he would stay the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  my mother so ill?&rdquo; asked the young man anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pretty  bad, but I have seen worse cases. Don&rsquo;t you trouble yourself Marsh. I&rsquo;ll do the  best I can to save her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Save  her life,&rdquo; echoed Stephen sadly. &ldquo;Ah, what a terrible thing it will be if she  dies now, when wealth is coming. She always wanted to be rich and now&mdash;life is  very cruel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends upon the way you look at it,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Give me some supper Marsh, and  a whisky. I feel rather played out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  meal was waiting in a poverty-stricken looking dining-room. Jim saw that the  pauperism of the Marshes was no fiction. They were evidently terribly poor.  Certainly the Colonel had done nothing to alleviate their distress. &ldquo;He would  not give us a penny,&rdquo; said Stephen after supper, and when they were smoking in  the small room which proved to be the young man&rsquo;s special sanctum. &ldquo;All the  time he kept telling me that I was his heir, but refused to help my mother and  me. I do not want to speak evil of the dead&rdquo; added Stephen, &ldquo;but Colonel Carr&mdash;&rdquo;  he shook his head.</p>
  <p>By  this time Herrick had seen his patient sinking into a sleep, and leaving  Petronella to call him should anything go wrong, was prepared for a little  conversation. He utilised the time by asking Marsh about himself and his uncle.  The young man answered him with the utmost frankness, and indeed seemed glad to  have a friend in whom he could confide.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father was a gentleman farmer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he attended more to pleasure than  to business. While out hunting, he saved the life of Miss Carr the Colonel&rsquo;s  sister. Afterwards she married him. I was their only child, for my mother died  when I was born. My father lost all his money from reckless living, and went  abroad for economy. In Italy he met my step-mother, who is the daughter of an  English consul by an Italian mother. He met her in a little town on the  Adriatic coast. Her father was dead and she was alone save for Petronella. It  was her intention to become a singer; but she fell in love with my father. He  brought her home to Beorminster, along with Petronella, who would not leave  her. With what remained of his money, my father bought this house. Five years  ago he died, leaving my mother two hundred a year. With this freehold and that  income we have managed to scrape along. I was educated at Bedford, and  afterwards went to Oxford. My father said that though he could give me no  money, he could at least afford me a decent education. I believe he pinched  himself to do so. Mrs. Marsh helped me; for she has always been good to me. I  was twenty-one years old when my father died, and after the funeral I wanted to  go to London and become a journalist. Mrs. Marsh however would not hear of  this. She insisted that I was the Colonel&rsquo;s heir and that I should wait till he  died.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  interrupted Herrick shaking his head, &ldquo;bad thing waiting for dead men&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think it was my wish to do so?&rdquo; protested Stephen passionately. &ldquo;I should  much have preferred to earn my own living, and fight my way in London. I have  some talent as a poet and a writer, and I was prepared to battle with the world  like other people. But Mrs. Marsh made me stop with her. I am twenty-six years  of age now, and I have done nothing. I write poetry and send it to the American  magazines, also a few prose articles. These keep me supplied with pocket-money.  It was Bess who put me on to the New York papers. There, the editors are more open  to new talent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Colonel refused to help you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always.  But I never asked him. I hated that man,&rdquo; said Marsh between his teeth. &ldquo;I  never went near his house. At times my mother called to see him. She always  fought viciously with him, and I think he liked her for that. Most people were  afraid of him, and he admired her for standing up to him. Colonel Carr thought  me a fool and a weakling because I stayed with Mrs. Marsh instead of going out  into the world. But I ask you Herrick, what else could I have done? Mrs. Marsh  had always been good to me; she sacrificed much so that I might be well  educated, so the least I could do was to stop with her. Again and again I  wanted her to come with me to London; but she always refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; said Jim, filling his pipe, &ldquo;she wished to keep an eye on the  Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. Carr always said that I was to be his heir. He has no relative but  me, and he was reported to be wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so Marsh. That house is filled with treasure! Did he inherit his  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  looked up alertly. &ldquo;Ah, now you are touching on the secret of Carr&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; he  said with some excitement. &ldquo;His father died ruined, and left him nothing but &lsquo;The  Pines&rsquo; with a few acres of farm, and corn-land. Do you know how old Colonel  Carr was, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I saw him only after his death. Not very old I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  sixty,&rdquo; replied Stephen, &ldquo;and into his life he crammed enough wickedness to  fill a century. He was twenty when his father died, and in the army. By  gambling and speculating he supported himself, and left his sister, my mother,  in that old ruined house. Afterwards he left the army&mdash;cashiered for cheating  at cards, and led a hand to mouth existence. But he would never sell &lsquo;The  Pines,&rsquo; however hard up he was. He stopped there on occasions, and played the  devil all round. I can&rsquo;t tell you how bad he was. It is the common-talk of the  countryside. He was called Mad Carr, and Wicked Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Carr?&rdquo; put in Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  he was only a captain when he left the army at the age of thirty. I believe he  called himself Colonel when he returned ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  what quarter of the world?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh  shook his head. &ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; said he slowly, &ldquo;for twenty years Carr  vanished from England. My mother was left behind in the old house, and  afterwards married my father. She should have made a better match, but she had  little money, and the reputation of her brother did her no good. However she  married my father, and afterwards died when I was born. That was the end of her.  The Colonel left his lawyers to look after the property, and remained away. I  always heard that it was in South America he picked up his money. At all events  he returned here ten years ago with plenty of cash. The first thing he did was  to put the house in order, and fill it with splendid furniture. He engaged a  staff of servants, and wanted to entertain. At first the people were disposed  to be friendly, but he went on worse than ever, and everybody cut him. In a  rage he sent away all the servants and only kept Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  Frisco come back with him from South America?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  But whether it was South America or North I cannot say. Frisco could hold his  tongue when he chose. However Carr turned his back on the country people, and  went on worse than ever. He was said to be mad but I think it was mere  devilment myself. One queer thing he did&mdash;no! Two queer things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  building of the tower was one,&rdquo; said Herrick shrewdly.</p>
  <p>Marsh  nodded. &ldquo;And the other mad act was the throwing down of the walls and fences round  the Pines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim looked puzzled. &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I noticed that the house had no fences  round it. One came upon it suddenly, as if it had been dropped from the skies.  Carr threw down the walls, to show that he was not afraid. On the other hand he  must have built that tower to show that he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  It is not difficult if you remember what you said to me when we met that girl.  You hinted that Carr was afraid of something in which Frisco was concerned.  Well then; evidently his first attitude was one of defiance towards this fear.  Afterwards he thought better of it and built the tower. A man would not leave  that splendid house to sleep in a bare room at the top of a tower unless he was  afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you are right,&rdquo; said Stephen musingly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what he was  afraid of. It was the third year after he returned that he built the tower, and  he was in such a hurry to get it done, that he had the men working at it by  night. You know he has a magnificent system of electricity round about &lsquo;The  Pines.&rsquo; Well, the lights were on night after night until the tower was  finished, and relays of workmen replaced one another. The whole county wondered  at the way Carr went on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gave no explanation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  He saw no one, but shut himself up like a hermit. Frisco attended to the house,  and cooked the Colonel&rsquo;s meals. But I think Carr often cooked for himself. He  was fond of cooking. For eight years he never went outside that house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  That accounts for the gymnasium, the bowling alley, and the shooting gallery.  What about his business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did it all my means of letter. Frith and Frith sent down a clerk occasionally.  Carr was a clever man of business, and invested his money in good securities.  So my mother said. She used to beard him in his den.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the clergyman, Corn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He called also to try and reform the Colonel, but he did not succeed. A good  fellow Corn, but weak. Can hold his tongue though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary he talked a good deal to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you said,&rdquo; muttered Stephen. &ldquo;I wonder what he meant by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he know the secret of Carr&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of. Corn always kept his mouth shut as I said. Why he should have  talked openly to you I can&rsquo;t say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that there are mysteries on all sides,&rdquo; said Herrick with a shrug. &ldquo;Miss  Bess used to visit Carr you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did once or twice; but I shall leave her to tell you of her visits and her  opinion of her host.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marsh!&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim after a pause. &ldquo;Have you any idea who murdered Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Not the remotest. Unless it was Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the face of it, one would think so. Why did Frisco run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  rubbed his chin. &ldquo;I think we must ask Bess,&rdquo; said he thoughtfully, &ldquo;if anyone  knows what is at the back of all this it is Bess Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    The Theory Of Mrs. Marsh</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next week or so, Herrick had his hands full. Mrs. Marsh grew rapidly worse,  and several times nearly slipped through his fingers. But the doctor&rsquo;s skill,  Petronella&rsquo;s nursing, and above all the indomitable determination of Mrs. Marsh  not to die, enabled her to turn the corner. She became much better, but still  suffered from racking pains. At times Herrick gave her morphia, but did so  sparingly. From Petronella he learned that she had taken chloral for years past,  and feared that if she gained a taste for morphia she might take to it instead  of the weaker drug. For Stephen&rsquo;s sake, Jim could not let that happen.</p>
  <p>Never  had Herrick had so unruly a patient. He did not wonder that she had quarrelled  with all the Beorminster doctors. The wonder was that she had a friend left.  Her temper was ungovernable, and she fought Herrick on every point that did not  chime in with her inclinations. In spite of the fact that he was attending her  out of sheer kindness, and had intimated to Stephen that he expected no fee,  Mrs. Marsh abused him virulently whenever she felt so inclined. But then she  abused everyone, even Petronella, who was her slave. As to Stephen, devoted as  he was to her, she could not find words bad enough for him sometimes. He was a  fool, a ninny, a milksop, he lived upon her charity, etc., etc. Yet there were  times when the young man was all that was good in her eyes. Even Herrick came  in for his share of praise at odd moments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gran&rsquo;  Dio!&rdquo; Petronella would say to Herrick after some tussel, &ldquo;was there ever such a  diavola as the Padrona?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old Italian woman had taken a great fancy to Dr. Jim. He was good to her  mistress whom she idolized, he was kind to Petronella herself, and could speak  her language. He had once made a tour of Europe for three years with a young  dipsomaniac and had contrived to pick up three or four tongues, which he spoke  remarkably correctly. Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dr. Jim knew them all  and could both read and write them with wonderful accuracy. In the eyes of  Petronella he was a marvellous man, and she often talked to him on subjects  which she would not discuss with anyone else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not be angry with the padrona Signor Dottore,&rdquo; she said sometimes, &ldquo;it is the  blood of the Michelotto family. Eh, the Michelotti were wicked!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  Colonel Carr? Eh, Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Dottore, the Colonel was an angel of light to the wicked Michelotti. The  padrona is the last of them, and it is not wonder she is angry. Per Bacco,&rdquo;  added Petronella who could swear on occasions, &ldquo;see this casa&mdash;a fitting casa  for the last of the grand signori.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it is all right now Petronella. As soon as your signora can be removed we shall  take her to The Pines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a fine casa if you like!&rdquo; Petronella spat, and shook her white elf-locks. &ldquo;It  will bring no luck. Eh Signor, but that man had the evil eye. Once I went with  the padrona to see him. He overlooked me although I made horns, and I hurt my  foot. If my padrona goes to that casa she will die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his shoulders, and did not argue. There was no means of persuading  Petronella out of the spite she had taken to The Pines. It was now the property  of Stephen Marsh. The senior partner of Frith and Frith had come down  personally with the will. This left Stephen the house, on condition that he  pulled down the tower. Furthermore the personal property of the late Colonel,  amounting to eight thousand a year well invested, was given to the young man on  a still more curious condition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are to have a special vault constructed in Saxham churchyard,&rdquo; said Mr. Frith, &ldquo;it  is to be built of stone and lined with sheet iron. The body of our late client  is to be put in there, and you alone are to hold the key of the door. Once a  month you are to enter the vault and see that the body is safe. If you do this  for a year then the property becomes yours absolutely. If you miss going once,  the money goes to&mdash;Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Frisco&mdash;the Colonel&rsquo;s servant!&rdquo; said Stephen in surprise, &ldquo;and by that name Mr.  Frith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  It is legal enough. But the man evidently murdered his master, and has gone  away to avoid consequences, I do not think you will be troubled by him. Also  Mr. Marsh&mdash;or rather Mr. Carr since you have to take the name&mdash;you can avert  all chance of this man getting the money by visiting the vault monthly for a  year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  was another mystery. Why the money should have been left to Frisco no one could  guess. Stephen often talked it over with Herrick, but could come to no  conclusion. However he set to work to carry out the terms of the will. A body  of workmen were employed to take down the tower; and Mr. Corn was seen about  the construction of a new vault. Evidently the Colonel did not consider that  his remains would be safe in the ancestral burial-place. In spite of all secrecy,  the countryside came to know of this strange provision of Carr&rsquo;s will, and it  was said that he wanted to make sure that his body would not be carried off by  the devil to whom he had sold himself. In fact the general opinion was, that  some night the remains would be carried off like those of the old woman of  Berkley. The villagers grew confused over the matter, and did not distinguish  between the body and soul.</p>
  <p>While  Mrs. Marsh was slowly getting better, and Stephen was attending to the  carrying-out of the will, Dr. Jim remained at Saxham, or rather for the sake of  his patient he lived at Beorminster, paying occasional visits to the village.  Robin had long since returned to London, and had left in much anger at Jim&rsquo;s  refusal to accompany him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have found a new friend,&rdquo; he said angrily, &ldquo;and I must go to the wall. I do  call it unfair Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Robin, I cannot be your shadow. You are quite well able to look after  yourself now. I took you for this walking tour, to do you good. Now you are in  excellent health. I must remain here until Mrs. Marsh is quite well. Remember  if I go she has no doctor to attend her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t do without you,&rdquo; persisted Robin. &ldquo;You have such an influence over me  that I am lost if you are away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must take up your life on your own shoulders,&rdquo; replied Herrick impatiently; &ldquo;it  is no use relying on other people. But if you feel that I am so indispensable  to you, why not stay here? You have money, no ties, and can do your work here  better than in London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to go back to town. If I stay here I shall not see much of you. Marsh is  your friend now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like Marsh. He is a good fellow, and I can make something of him. I suppose  Robin you think I am after his money; but you know me better than that. The  three hundred a year I have is enough for me. I was never a man for luxury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never thought or hinted such a thing,&rdquo; said Joyce with a blush. &ldquo;Well, if you  like to stay here Jim, I&rsquo;ll return to London, and we can meet when you return.  I suppose you&rsquo;ll be back some time,&mdash;that is if Miss Endicotte will let you go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  replied Dr. Jim, &ldquo;she has no thought of me. I like her very much but in my  present state of poverty I could not ask her to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  said nothing more, but the next week took his leave. He was much missed in  Saxham where his bright talk and merry face had made him a general favourite.  The Biff&rsquo;s especially were sorry. Bess had foregathered with Joyce on the  common ground of literature, and she lamented when he departed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t you stay here?&rdquo; she said in her blunt way, &ldquo;you can work better in the  country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Miss Bess. I am like Charles Lamb; London is my home. I cannot get enough of  the divine fire in this tame locality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing tame about it,&rdquo; cried Bess fired with indignation.</p>
  <p>Joyce  laughed. &ldquo;Not to you perhaps; but I prefer London myself. However, I hope you  will let me come down and see you at times. And we can correspond. And if you  have any manuscripts you think well of, send them to me. I will see what I can  do with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  arrangement was made, and Robin, taking a friendly leave of Jim went back to  his West Kensington fiat. He wrote frequently at first, but after a time his  letters became rarer. Herrick was sorry, but on the whole somewhat relieved to  be rid of such a burden. For Robin was one of those people who are delightful  to meet and terrible to live with. Had he been ill or in trouble the  conscientious Jim would have stayed with him. But since he had been  particularly well after that attack of nerves when the body was discovered,  there was no necessity for Herrick to martyrise himself further.</p>
  <p>And  besides Jim had fallen seriously in love with Ida Endicotte. When Mrs. Marsh  was fairly on the road to recovery, Stephen had taken Jim over to Saxham and  introduced him to the Biffs. They lived in a tumbledown house of considerable  size, down a deep and leafy lane. At one time the Endicottes had been great  folks, but the late Mr. Endicotte who had married the daughter of an Earl, had  squandered the revenues of the family. His wife Lady Arabella had died of sheer  worry, and Mr. Endicotte had found himself alone with five children and an  impoverished estate.</p>
  <p>For  a time he did his best to keep things together, but ultimately died&mdash;as it was  said&mdash;of a broken heart. It seemed probable that the five children would go on  the parish. &ldquo;What a fall for the haughty Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was at this juncture that Lord Gartham stepped in. He was an Irish peer, and  poor himself, but he could not see his sister&rsquo;s children entirely penniless.  Ida the eldest was twenty-four when her father died; Bess, had reached the age  of twenty-three; and Sidney the youngest, was sixteen. The five Endicottes were  all handsome, and had high spirits; but poorer than the proverbial church  mouse. What was to be done?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  earn our own livings,&rdquo; said Bess who was the most energetic of the five. &ldquo;Ida  can look after the house, Frank can manage the farm; and Sidney can go to  school, and I shall ask Mr. Arch to take me on to the Weekly Chronicle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my dear child!&rdquo; expostulated the Earl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it matter?&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;We are the Endicottes whatever we may do.  Everybody knows who we are and what we are. There is nothing disgraceful in  earning one&rsquo;s own living Uncle Gar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Earl&mdash;rather a helpless person&mdash;who had never done a stroke of honest work in  his life, was rather surprised at the energy of Bess. However her scheme  recommended itself to his favour since there was absolutely no other way of  settling the matter. In one way and another, Lord Gartham paid off the debts by  selling some of the land, and arranged that the united five should have a small  income which they would have to increase as best they could. Thus it was that  the Endicottes found themselves with their ancestral home, a small farm, two  hundred a year, and the world before them.</p>
  <p>They  were all young and hearty so they thought very little of the matter. Bess  obtained a post on the Weekly Chronicle at Beorminster, Ida looked after the  house, and Frank managed the farm. Flo was put to a Beorminster school, whence  she returned once a week to Saxham, and Sidney studied under Mr. Corn who  expressed a desire to take him. The countryside all approved of this  independent spirit, and made much of the Biffs.</p>
  <p>When  the Colonel died, this had been going on for three years. Ida was still  unmarried, as she had refused several offers. &ldquo;I cannot leave the children,&rdquo;  she said, and people were divided as to the wisdom of this attitude. Some said  it was right; but the majority agreed that it was a pity such a beautiful girl  should develop into an old maid. But the fact is no one knew Ida&rsquo;s secret. She  was in love with Stephen, and although they had never spoken on the subject  they understood one another very well. Hitherto Stephen&rsquo;s poverty had prevented  his speaking openly. Now the inheritance of eight thousand a year had altered  all that, and he intended to ask Ida to be his wife on the very earliest  opportunity.</p>
  <p>It  was a pity Jim did not know of this. He had fallen in love with Ida, and as she  was always pleasant to him, it never crossed his mind that her heart was  engaged. Open on most points with his new friend, Stephen out of delicacy for  Ida was reticent about his love. So Jim continued to live in a Fool&rsquo;s Paradise,  and not even the sharp-eyed Joyce had been able to able to enlighten him.</p>
  <p>Certainly  Mrs. Marsh had spoken to Jim on the subject. She wanted Stephen to marry Miss  Endicotte, But Dr. Herrick thought that was merely her own desire, and did not  think there was anything serious between the young people. Nor could Mrs. Marsh  inform him of more than the fact that they liked one another, and that it was  the desire of her heart to see them married.</p>
  <p>One  day when Stephen was at Saxham, Mrs. Marsh had a long talk with the doctor in  which he saw more of her stormy character, than had ever been shown to him  before. She could sit up in bed now, and wearied of the society of Petronella,  frequently asked Herrick to stay beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are one of the few sensible men I have met,&rdquo; she said, drawing her black brows  together. &ldquo;Come and talk. I want you to tell me what you think of Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can I think but that he is the best of fellows,&rdquo; replied Jim taking a chair by  the beside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  That sounds like the &lsquo;weakest of men,&rsquo; Stephen I mean. You are strong enough in  every way. That is why I want you to look after Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean look after him Mrs. Marsh.&rdquo; The widow mused for a time before  replying. &ldquo;He is a good-hearted fool,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;and with his sweet  nature is likely to be imposed upon in this world. Now he is rich and  scoundrels will prey on him. I want you to see he comes to no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I have to return to London,&rdquo; remonstrated Jim, rather taken aback by the  responsibility thrust upon him. &ldquo;I am not a rich man Mrs. Marsh, and I must  look after my practice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can arrange all that,&rdquo; she replied sharply. &ldquo;You are a good man Dr. Herrick. I  can see that; and I&rsquo;m no fool. All your influence over Stephen will be for  good. I can get him to offer you some inducement to stay beside him&mdash;at all  events until he is married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  he is married?&rdquo; echoed Jim puzzled. &ldquo;Has he any intention of getting married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of. He is too much wrapped up in his poetry. But I wish him to  marry Ida Endicotte. She is a well-born girl and a good woman. I think she will  make Stephen an excellent wife. She likes him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  felt the blood flush in his face. &ldquo;Liking is not love,&rdquo; he said in a rather  irritated tone.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Marsh pulled the curtains aside so that the light fell on the face of the young  man. Then after a scrutiny she gave a short laugh. &ldquo;So that is it, is it?&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;You are in love with the girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said so Mrs. Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!  You can&rsquo;t blind me. I am a woman. Come. You are in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his broad shoulders. &ldquo;I do not see why I should deny it,&rdquo; he said  coldly, &ldquo;I am in love with Miss Endicotte; but so far as I can judge she is not  in love with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she is in love with anyone,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Marsh, &ldquo;but I have not  seen enough of her to judge. If I could only see them together, I could tell.  She likes Stephen though. But here I am chained to this bed and cannot get out  to attend to matters of importance. Humph!&rdquo; she eyed Herrick steadily, &ldquo;so you  are in love with her! Well! it has been the desire of my life to see Stephen  married to Ida, but for all that, I want you to stay. Stephen shall give you a  thousand a year to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Mrs. Marsh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  don&rsquo;t contradict me or you will put me out of temper. And you know what that  means. I ask you to stop, to show my regard for you. Many another woman would  get you out of the way rather than see her pet scheme interfered with. I am not  that sort of narrow-minded person. You shall have your chance along with  Stephen. If she loves you, marry her in God&rsquo;s name and let&rsquo;s have done with the  matter. If however she prefers my poor Stephen&mdash;sweet-hearted fool that he  is&mdash;you must promise me not to put any obstacle in the way of the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Miss Endicotte prefers your step-son I certainly should not think of objecting  Mrs. Marsh,&rdquo; said Herrick stiffly. &ldquo;Your remark is rather unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo; retorted the widow, &ldquo;you are a gentleman, I know. But you  are also a human being, and when love comes into the question there are few  things a man will not do, or a woman for the matter of that!&rdquo; She clenched her  thin hand that laid outside the coverlet, and her face darkened. &ldquo;I know! I  know,&rdquo; she muttered between her teeth, &ldquo;who should know but I who have  suffered? Give me something to drink doctor. My throat is dry with talking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I had better leave you,&rdquo; said Herrick after her thirst was assuaged, &ldquo;you  are wearying yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Marsh abruptly, &ldquo;I have much to say of importance. I may not be  here long to say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  Mrs. Marsh. You are getting better,&mdash;much better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same I may die; one never knows,&rdquo; said the widow gloomily.</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed at these forebodings. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he trying to joke her out of so  morbid a mood, &ldquo;have you enemies, like Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyone  who came into contact with Carr was bound to have enemies,&rdquo; said Mrs. Marsh  bitterly. &ldquo;He was a devil if ever there was one. However this is not to the  point,&rdquo; she went on impatiently, &ldquo;I want to know if you will stay with Stephen  for a thousand a year?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a tempting offer to a poor man like myself,&rdquo; said Herrick with some  hesitation, &ldquo;but until Stephen himself asks me to stay, I cannot promise. He  may not wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is all right Dr. Herrick. Stephen knows that you are his best friend. I  want you to take him in hand and make a man of him. He is too fond of poring  over books; too careless of his physical health. Make him ride, and golf, and  all the rest of it. I have been a fool keeping him so much beside me. But I  love the boy, and that was my woman&rsquo;s weakness. Now he is rich, teach him how  to use his riches and be happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have most influence over him&rdquo; said Herrick still hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have had too much and not for the best&rdquo; was her gloomy reply, &ldquo;no; you are the  teacher he wants. Besides who knows what may happen to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked at her uneasily. Again she had hinted at something of danger to herself.  &ldquo;I wish you would be plain with me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Marsh with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you can guess,&rdquo; retorted the doctor. &ldquo;You hint at your dying; so far as I  know there is not the least likelihood of your doing so unless you take an  overdose of that chloral which I am always advising you to leave off. Have you  some enemy who is likely to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied Mrs. Marsh with unnecessary violence, &ldquo;I have no enemy. But I feel&mdash;I  have a presentiment&mdash;that I am not long for this world. As an Italian you know  I am bound to be superstitious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think the English part of your blood would revolt against such morbid  nonsense. Again I say you are not plain with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am. How dare you talk to me so!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Marsh furiously. &ldquo;You are the one  man I have met in this world of fools, other than that dead devil Carr. If I  made a confidant of anyone it would be of you. But so far as I personally am  concerned there is nothing to say. But Stephen&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated and fell to  plucking restlessly at the coverlet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  You wish me to be his bear-leader? If he is willing, I am willing. A thousand a  year is not to be despised. Moreover my conscience is perfectly clear as  regards Miss Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand. If she loves you, marry her by all means! If Stephen is her choice,  you must promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  promise nothing,&rdquo; said Herrick impatiently walking to and fro, &ldquo;there is no  necessity to promise. I am a man of honour. If Stephen and Miss Endicotte love  one another I am the last man in the world to step between them. You know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I didn&rsquo;t I should not ask you to stop and look after him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Marsh  cynically. &ldquo;However, you complained of my want of confidence. I am going to  amend that. Do you know why I want you to stay with Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make a man of him&mdash;so you said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  certainly, but it is something of an excuse. I also want you&mdash;and this is the  main reason&mdash;to guard him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against  whom? What are you hinting at?&rdquo; asked Herrick sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  Frisco,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply. &ldquo;Oh, you may look astonished, but if you  remember the will?&mdash;well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  will,&rdquo; repeated Dr. Jim, &ldquo;I see what you mean. The money goes to Frisco if  Stephen should neglect to visit the vault monthly for a year. What of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  much. Frisco killed Colonel Carr. Oh, I am sure of it! If not, why did he fly?  Besides there is no one else I can think of who had an interest in Carr&rsquo;s  death. I do not know what secrets he had, but what there were Frisco knew. That  was why Carr left the money to him failing Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  If Frisco possessed Colonel Carr&rsquo;s secrets he could have blackmailed him  without the necessity of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Marsh mysteriously. &ldquo;I have heard Frisco and Carr  quarrel. It is my belief&mdash;if you remember Napper&rsquo;s evidence that they  quarrelled on the night of the murder. They must have fought a duel, which is  just what two devils like them would do. Frisco killed his master before he  could fire a shot. That is why all the chambers of the revolver were found  loaded. Well, Frisco has had to fly; but he will not give up his chance of  getting the money. No! He will,&rdquo; here Mrs. Marsh bent forward to whisper, &ldquo;he  will try and maim or kill Stephen so that he may not fulfil the conditions of  the will&mdash;and visit the vault. Then Frisco will claim the money. I have thought  this all out while lying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is ingenious,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;but you forget that if Frisco shows himself,  he will be arrested. That stops his attempting to harm Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Marsh shook her head. &ldquo;You do not know Frisco; I do,&rdquo; she said: and not another  word could Herrick extract from her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  &ldquo;The Changeling&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>While  the tower at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; was being pulled down, Stephen paid frequent visits to  Saxham. Sometimes Dr. Herrick went with him, and together they would go through  that wonderful house. Marsh had never before been inside it, and he was amazed  at the luxury. His life had been so simple, so deprived of all beauty, that his  artistic temperament had been starved from lack of nutriment. Highly gifted  with the imaginative faculty, possessed of a keen perception of loveliness,  Stephen revelled in the beautiful things which filled every corner of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have to get a wife to share it all,&rdquo; said Herrick one day after his  conversation with Mrs. Marsh. He looked keenly at the young man as he spoke.</p>
  <p>Stephen  however betrayed no emotion. &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to marry some day,&rdquo; he  said coolly. &ldquo;If I were to die without children my cousin would get the  property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know you had a cousin?&rdquo; said Herrick, rather astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so. A distant cousin, although I have never seen him. My mother can  tell you all about him. It seems that Colonel Carr&rsquo;s father had a younger  brother who was turned out by his father. He went to America and married there.  Then he died leaving a widow and a daughter. The widow died and the daughter  married some one in the States. I do not know the name but my mother may. I  believe there is a son, but whether he is in America or in England I cannot  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim, &ldquo;very interesting. I must ask your mother about this. If you secure  the property by complying with the conditions of the will, it will be yours entirely.  Even if you do not marry, you will be able to leave it to whomsoever you  please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should leave it to my cousin, whatever his name is,&rdquo; said Stephen in a careless  tone. &ldquo;It seems to me that he has the right to enjoy it after me, since he is  of the Carr blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always  provided you do not marry and have children!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. But there is time enough to think of marriage. I want my mother to be  sole mistress of this beautiful place for a time. She has had such a dose of  poverty that I should like her to taste luxury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not in love then?&rdquo; asked Herrick in a jocular tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; this time Stephen flushed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when I am. Meantime let  me enjoy the present. I&rsquo;ll soon have this tower down and the house put to  rights. Then my mother can come. I hope you will stay also Herrick,&rdquo; he added  rather anxiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose my friend you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  all depends,&rdquo; replied Jim with a flush. He was thinking of Ida. &ldquo;I will remain  until your mother is quite well. You may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing  more was said at the time. Herrick could not be certain that Stephen was in  love with Ida or that the girl had set her heart on Marsh. They were excellent  friends, but in spite of Herrick&rsquo;s lynx eye he could not learn if they  understood one another. As a matter of fact they did; but neither of them  wished to hurry matters. Both felt that Mrs. Marsh would have to be consulted  before anything was settled, and therefore waited until she recovered her  health and was established at &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Marsh slowly regained her strength, and almost dispensed with Herrick&rsquo;s  attendance. She never recurred to the subject of Ida or of Frisco after that  one interview, although Herrick several times tried to make her speak.  Evidently she knew something about the man&mdash;perhaps had heard the Colonel speak  of him. But whatever it was she kept her own counsel. There was no need that  she should do otherwise. Perhaps if Frisco had made his appearance she might  have been induced to speak out, but the ex-sailor (as Herrick learned he was)  had vanished completely. He was traced to Paddington station, and after that  all sign of the trail was lost. Like a rain drop he had disappeared into the  mighty sea of London life, and in spite of all offers of reward not a hint could  be gained of his whereabouts.</p>
  <p>It  was generally considered that he was the criminal, most people holding that he  had shot the Colonel unawares. Napper&rsquo;s evidence went to prove that the two men  were on bad terms with one another, and probably Frisco excited by rum and a  sense of his wrongs, whatever these might be, had returned to &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; with  the intention of righting himself. No one entertained the idea of a duel having  been fought. Only Mrs. Marsh gave Frisco that grace. Herrick considered her  theory a feasible one, and felt that it was confirmed by the fact of the  revolver found in the dead man&rsquo;s hand being loaded. If Frisco had fired first,  the Colonel would have fallen with his weapon undischarged, and this would  account for the six chambers being filled. But what it would not account for  was the fact of one bullet being different to the remaining three. That was a  puzzle, and Dr. Jim could in nowise arrive at the solution of the problem,  although he thought over it a great deal.</p>
  <p>Bess  Endicotte was the only person who insisted on Frisco&rsquo;s innocence. She declared  that the man was too devoted to his master to kill him, and that there could be  no reason for the crime. This she explained to Herrick a week after the  interview with Mrs. Marsh. Both Herrick and Marsh had come over to Biffstead to  spend the afternoon, intending to return to Beorminster by the last bus,  somewhere about ten o&rsquo;clock. It was characteristic of Stephen&rsquo;s simple habits  that he still went to and fro by the public vehicle, although he could now have  afforded a cart, a horse, a bicycle, or even (had he so chosen) a motor-car.  But before taking full advantage of his new position and of his wealth, he  wanted his mother to be well enough to direct matters. She had held him in  subjection for so many years, that he hesitated to do anything without her  approval. So Herrick and Stephen came to Saxham by the bus, or used their legs.  For the sake of his health Herrick made Marsh walk as much as possible. The man  was visionary and it was necessary to shake him into something like practical  life by exercise.</p>
  <p>On  arriving at the Grange, the two young men, found the whole family at home.  There was Ida tall and beautiful who welcomed the visitors in her usual placid  way. She was of the Junoesque type, stately and maternal, moving like a large  goddess amongst minor mortals. Bess, who was all alert and vivacious, was  accustomed to make fun of Ida&rsquo;s stately ways. &ldquo;The Sacred White Cow,&rdquo; said Bess  folding her hands, and when Ida remonstrated pointed out that the term meant no  disrespect. &ldquo;Juno was called ox-eyed, and I&rsquo;m sure the cow is a most beautiful  animal,&rdquo; said she inconsequently. &ldquo;Why should a comparison to a useful animal  be taken as an insult? If I said you were like a fawn, or a stag, or a swan,  you would be quite pleased. But because I call you a lovely snowy cow&mdash;you  <i>are</i> a beautiful cow,&rdquo; broke off Bess with a shrug, &ldquo;the sacred white cow.  There!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really  Bess, you are getting more dreadful every day,&rdquo; cried Ida helplessly, &ldquo;please  don&rsquo;t call me this horrid name when Stephen and Dr. Herrick come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Herrick would understand; he is a scholar. However I won&rsquo;t call you anything  but Juno&mdash;will that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should prefer to be called by my proper name!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  made a mouth but yielded the point. She was devotedly fond of Ida, and always  said that her beauty would raise the family into affluence once more. &ldquo;My  <i>brains</i> may do something,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but Ida&rsquo;s looks will attract all the men  of wealth and position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want any of them,&rdquo; protested Ida with a blush. &ldquo;Do let me see after my  own future, Bess darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Undeniably  Bess was the cleverest of the family. She was so bright and quick, and  possessed of such indomitable perseverance, that she easily exercised a  despotic sway over the weaker vessels. Ida looked after the house, but Bess was  the real head who paid the bills, and bullied the tradesmen, and saw that  everything was in order. Even Frank gave way before her. But Frank was rather  like Ida in the matter of bovine simplicity. He was a big handsome fellow,  never out of temper. When he was not looking after the farm he strolled in the  fields, and searched into the secret workings of Nature. Sometimes he wrote  articles for the papers and magazines. A Gilbert White of the Parish of Saxham,  that is what Frank Endicotte was. Some of his articles had even been accepted  in London, and when he could be induced to write, he usually made a few  guineas. But Frank was lazy, and it needed all the scolding of Bess to make him  do his duty in the way of literary work. So far as the farm went he was never  idle, as he loved an open air-life, and took a genuine interest in stock, top  drainage and crops.</p>
  <p>Florence,  who was now home on her weekly holiday, bounced out on Dr. Jim and Stephen as  they came up the avenue. She was a girl in her teens, more like Bess than any  of the rest, and bubbled over with animal spirits. This was her last quarter at  school, and now her hair was turned up and she had arrived at the dignity of  long frocks. But at heart she was still a schoolgirl, and on this especial day  had let down her long hair much to the dismay of Ida who was nothing if not  conventional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Stephen!&rdquo; she cried clasping him by the arm. &ldquo;I am so glad you have come. Frank  is writing, Bess is typing, and Ida is making a new dress. I have no one to  amuse me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the Changeling?&rdquo; asked Stephen laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sidney!  Oh, he has a holiday, and has gone over to see &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; You know how fond  he is of going there. He was the only one of us that was not afraid of the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Bess was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It would take an army to frighten Bess. How are you Dr. Herrick? I am rude not  to have spoken to you before. Come inside, and wake us all up. I am sure this  place is like the palace of the Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose  we go over to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; and have afternoon tea in one of the rooms,&rdquo;  suggested Stephen. &ldquo;There is no food there, but we can take what we want from  here, and have a picnic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jolly!&rdquo;  cried Flo the schoolgirl, &ldquo;there are kettles and tea-pots and all the rest of  the things we want at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  house is remarkably well furnished,&rdquo; said Herrick laughing. &ldquo;It is a good idea;  three o&rsquo;clock. We had better go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  others entered into the scheme with avidity, and thus it was that Herrick found  himself walking beside Bess to &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; Not without a pang had he  relinquished Ida to his friend; but bearing in mind the confidence reposed in  him by Mrs. Marsh, he desired to act as fairly as possible. Besides he was  growing fond of Bess. She was such a bright companion, and so clever. At first  she was disinclined to speak of the Colonel and Frisco, but gradually became  more outspoken. In his quiet way Herrick had a wonderful gift of making people  talk. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it to any one but you Dr. Jim,&rdquo; said Bess&mdash;for so she now  called him, &ldquo;but there is something about you that makes me believe in you. I  think you must have a kind of daemonic influence like Goethe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sympathetic if that is what you mean,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I took to you immediately  I saw you in the inn parlour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  blushed a little through her tanned skin, and cast a keen look at the big man.  Somehow Herrick was conscious of that look, and wondered what it was for.  Perhaps with a woman&rsquo;s quickness Bess divined that he admired Ida and did not  approve of it. However she was too clever to say anything if such was the case,  but went on to talk of Colonel Carr and Frisco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  liked Frisco,&rdquo; she said in her quick decisive way, &ldquo;he was a bad man and some  of the things he told me he had done were really dreadful; but somehow he was  attractive. Much better than the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you liked the Colonel,&rdquo; said Jim with a side glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you see it was this way,&rdquo; replied the girl laughing. &ldquo;I was rather bold in  introducing myself to him, and he was so kind that I forgave him his bad  reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was it you met him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted some copy for the Chronicle and did not know what to write about.  Something had to be done, so I kept my ears open for an idea. Ida happened to  mention something about &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; so I thought it would be nice to see all  the wonderful furniture that was in the house. Would you believe it,&rdquo; she added  lightly, &ldquo;I went straight to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; and asked to see Colonel Carr? At  first he refused, but I was so persistent that he let me come in. I told him  frankly what I wanted and how hard up I was for an article. He was so taken  back by my assurance that he said I could describe &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; provided I did  so under a fictitious name. Then he took me all over the house himself; gave me  tea in the big drawing-room and sent me off. I got a good article out of what  he showed me, but of course I said that it was a description of a millionaire&rsquo;s  palace in Park Lane. Nobody believed that. I think the Colonel guessed they  wouldn&rsquo;t. He just let me write the article to make the people&rsquo;s mouths water  with telling about things he would not let them see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  nice Christian spirit!&rdquo; remarked Jim grimly. &ldquo;Ah! but you must remember that he  was treated very badly by the country people when he came back from America.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Then America was the place of his exile?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Frisco said; Mexico and Peru. The two had many adventures and used to tell me  about them. I made up several stories out of the material I got from them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  called to see the Colonel again then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not! He was always polite, and I wasn&rsquo;t a bit afraid of him. Oh, I know he had  a dreadful reputation, but he was never rude to me. Poor man,&rdquo; said Bess  letting her eyes rest pensively on the house which they were now approaching, &ldquo;I  think he was very weary of living alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  the Colonel and Frisco good friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  very best. Frisco adored the Colonel, who had saved his life. Both of them seem  rather afraid of&mdash;&rdquo; here Bess was silent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hardly know. But they hinted at some enemy who would kill the pair of them if  he discovered their whereabouts. That was what Frisco meant at the  public-house, when he hinted about his master not living long. If Frisco had  given information, the enemy would have killed the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if Frisco did, and then went away to escape the consequences?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Bess thoughtfully. &ldquo;Frisco would have been killed also. I think myself  that the enemy found out the Colonel and murdered him; then Frisco ran away to  save his own life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  That is one way of looking at the matter. Did you hear if any stranger was seen  in the neighbourhood on the night of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  looked quickly at her companion. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with some hesitation. &ldquo;I never  heard of anyone. Besides it would have come out in the evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no idea who killed the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. If I knew I should tell. There was something&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you that later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  it to me now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t do that until I get my facts together,&rdquo; said Bess firmly, &ldquo;Look here Dr.  Jim, I intend to find out the truth about this mystery. From something the  Colonel let drop, I believe it is concerned with the money he came back with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  South America?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  from North America,&rdquo; replied Miss Endicotte musingly, &ldquo;I am not quite clear.  But I&rsquo;ll ask you to help me when I get my facts together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  rouse my curiosity. Tell me now what you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said no and I mean no,&rdquo; retorted Bess setting her mouth firmly. &ldquo;You will be  here for some time yet. If you go away I shall write to you. I am sure we shall  find out who killed the Colonel, and I am equally sure that Frisco is not the  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well.  Have it your own way. Tell me one thing. How is it the Colonel was so anxious  about the preservation of his body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Now you are asking more than I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know though,&rdquo; said Jim looking at her sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think&mdash;I am not sure. Wait, Dr. Jim. In good time you shall know all that I  know. This is a romance in real life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  tragedy rather,&rdquo; said Herrick grimly, &ldquo;mind you keep your promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can be sure I shall keep it,&rdquo; said Bess nodding and for the time being the  matter ended. But Jim was considerably puzzled. How she could have got hold of  information of which the police knew nothing was difficult to say. All the same  he had more confidence in the brains of Bess than in those of Inspector Bridge.</p>
  <p>As  it was Saturday afternoon, the workmen had knocked off for the day. By this  time the tower was half demolished, and curious it looked in its dilapidated  state, with the pile of d&eacute;bris round about its base. The visitors looked at it  for some time, then went into the house. In the kitchen off the dining-room  they found an old woman who agreed to boil the kettle for them. After some  deliberation they fixed on the library as the best place for the meal. On  entering they found a boy reading in the corner under the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  here Sidney?&rdquo; said Ida amazed. &ldquo;How can you come here without asking Stephen&rsquo;s  permission?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stephen  doesn&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Sidney with a smile, and Stephen assured him  that he was welcome. While the others were talking and admiring the place Dr.  Jim stood looking at the boy who was leaning back on the sofa taken up with his  own thoughts. There was something peculiar about Sidney Endicotte, which  procured him the name of the Changeling. This was given to him in fun by Bess;  but many people in the village really believed that he was half a fairy if not  a whole one. This reputation rose from the fact that the lad possessed that  gift which in Scotland is called the second sight. No one in Saxham who saw  Master Sidney&rsquo;s large blue eyes fixed upon him or her but turned pale. In Italy  he would have been credited with the Evil eye, and indeed old Petronella always  crossed herself when she chanced to meet him. Once or twice Sidney had foretold  the death of those who had afterwards died. Thus he had an uncanny reputation.</p>
  <p>He  was a small thin boy looking much older than his years. Although he was but  sixteen, yet on occasions he looked quite twenty. Pale, thin-faced, with large  blue eyes, and a curious insistent gaze, he sometimes made even his own family  feel uncomfortable. Then he had such peculiar habits. At night he was generally  wakeful, and he slept much in the day-time particularly in cold weather.  Sometimes he would slip out of his bedroom by the window and remain away for  hours. When questioned where he had been he used vaguely to answer &ldquo;In the  wood.&rdquo; The doctors who had seen him could make nothing of him. He was healthy  in his own way, his head was clear, and Corn reported that he learned rapidly.  But about him hung a glamour not of this world. He might have been a male  Kilmeny who had returned from fairy-land. Bess sometimes called him Thomas the  Rhymer. When she did so Sidney would nod and laugh in so strange a way, that  Bess herself grew frightened, and dropped the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you feel to-day Sidney?&rdquo; asked Jim sitting down beside the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very well,&rdquo; he replied vaguely. &ldquo;I feel that I am not myself. I came here to  read myself to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you want to do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I could go away then. I always do when I feel like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like  what?&rdquo; Jim was puzzled. The boy was by no means mad, yet he talked in a manner  quite beyond the comprehension of a sane person. Jim had never met anyone like  him before and was much taken up with the oddity of the case from a medical  point of view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t explain; you would not understand,&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;Please leave me alone,  Dr. Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this moment Bess called to Jim from the other side of the room and he hurried  across to her. Sidney remained vaguely staring into nothingness. After a time  his eyes closed and he looked as though he were fast asleep. The others  gathered round the tea table, and prepared to eat. Bess would not allow her  brother to be awakened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  makes him ill if he is roused suddenly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He will wake up himself and  be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t look to me like a natural sleep,&rdquo; said Jim anxiously. &ldquo;How pale he is!  Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Ida sharply, &ldquo;I agree with Bess. Sidney had better be left alone. He gets  into these states at times. Let us have tea. I am so hungry, and it&rsquo;s past  five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  quarter past,&rdquo; said Stephen glancing at his watch.</p>
  <p>They  began to eat and drink, laughing and enjoying themselves. No one took any  notice of Sidney, and even Jim&rsquo;s attention was distracted. The boy remained on  the sofa, leaning back, white as snow, and drawing long deep breaths. He looked  like a dead person.</p>
  <p>After  a time the conversation languished. The tea was done, the food was finished,  and they talked about packing up to go. &ldquo;Poor Sidney&rsquo;s tea is quite cold,&rdquo; said  Ida. &ldquo;I really think we might wake him now. Oh, he is coming to himself. Wake  up Sidney, and have some tea. It is nearly six and we must be getting home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy&rsquo;s face had now a delicate pink tinge on it, and he seemed more himself than  he had been when he fell asleep. For a moment he was silent. Then he looked  slowly round at those who were present, until his blue eyes fixed themselves  calmly on Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Marsh!&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you had better go home. Your mother is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ida  gave a cry and Stephen turned pale. Bess alone retained sufficient presence of  mind to cross over to the boy and shake him, &ldquo;Sidney, what do you mean by  saying such a horrible thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true,&rdquo; replied the boy quietly, &ldquo;Mrs. Marsh is dead. I have just seen her.  She died at half-past five. Go home Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a word Marsh rushed from the room. He knew of Sidney&rsquo;s prophecies, and dreaded  lest this one should be true. He made for Beorminster as fast as he could go,  and was met by Petronella.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  padrona is dead!&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    A Nine Days&rsquo; Wonder</b></h2>
  <p>Petronella  made the terrible announcement with ominous calmness. Then, when she saw  Stephen staring at her open-mouthed, her wild southern nature could no longer  be controlled. With a choking sob, she flung her apron over her head, and began  to lament loudly for her dear padrona. Her voice ascended shrilling in a long  wail, like that of the Corsican vocieri. Luckily there were few people in the  street, and the sound was scarcely noticed; it was simply thought that the  excitable Italian woman was in one of her tantrums. And Beorminster was used to  Petronella&rsquo;s fits of rage. Stephen caught her suddenly and dragging her inside  by main force closed the door.</p>
  <p>Before  Petronella could recover her breath for another howl, she found herself on one  of the dining-room chairs with Marsh standing over her. The young man was so  shaken that he could hardly speak. The prophecy of Sidney, the hurried journey  to Beorminster on a grocer&rsquo;s cart which he had met near Saxham, and now the  terrible confirmation of the death; these things shook him to the soul. He  hardly recognised his own voice. &ldquo;Tell me everything that happened,&rdquo; he said  slowly, &ldquo;do not make any mistake. I must know all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Petronella  crossed herself. &ldquo;Holy Virgin,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;his eyes are like coals.&rdquo; Then  after a muffled wail, she burst out into rapid Italian which Stephen understood  easily from his habit of talking to her and to Mrs. Marsh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  you left at mid-day Signor Stephano, the padrona tried to get a little sleep.  When the postman came at two o&rsquo;clock, he brought one letter for her. I took it  up, and woke her. Then I went out of the room. In a quarter of an hour the  Signora called me. She looked white, so white. The letter was before her. She  told me to give her the chloral as she wanted to sleep. I asked her if she had  bad news in the letter. She said no, but that she felt suddenly sick. I gave  her the medicine in the little bottle, and went away. She took some I think,  for when I went up again an hour later she was asleep. I went again and  again&mdash;she was still asleep. Then I took up her tea, and wanted to waken her.  Gran&rsquo; Dio&mdash;she was dead&mdash;dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  time was that Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  half past five Signor, the hour when I always take up the Signora&rsquo;s tea. Oh,  she is dead and I nursed her. Cursed be it that I live still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  the old woman wailed on, Stephen shuddered. The hour was that which Sidney had  named. &ldquo;Are you sure she died at that time?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  sure Signor Stephano. When I went in before she was only asleep; I saw her  breathing. I was up at a quarter past five and she still breathed, and had a  colour in her poor cheek. When I set down the tray I turned to see that she was  quite still, her face pale as snow. I put my hand to her heart. She was dead.  Ah Dio mio, she must have passed away when I entered the room. I heard a sigh  at the door,&rdquo; said Petronella beginning to embellish. &ldquo;It was her spirit that  passed. What could I do but open the window to let the soul go free? Ah Holy  Virgin!&rdquo; and the old woman crossed herself again.</p>
  <p>By  this time Stephen had somewhat recovered his composure. Without a word he went  up to the room. Petronella had drawn a sheet over the dead. He drew it down  gently, and saw the waxen face beneath. Every wrinkle had been smoothed away,  and there rested a peaceful expression on that once stormy countenance. As  Marsh stood tearlessly looking at the dead, he heard a light step enter the  room. Herrick appeared, almost as pale as the dead woman. After a glance at the  corpse, he recognised that all was over, and looked at Marsh with a shudder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  whispered the young man replying to the unspoken thought, &ldquo;at half past five o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shuddered again and drew the sheet over the dead face. Then he took Stephen by  the arm and led him downstairs into the study. There he left him in a chair and  went into the dining-room, whence he returned with a decanter and two glasses.  Pouring out two stiff glasses of brandy he forced Stephen to drink one, and  took the other himself. Both were in need of the stimulant, for the event had  shaken them considerably.</p>
  <p>By  and bye Marsh laid down his head on the table and wept quietly. He had been  devoted to the dead woman and was all unstrung. Moreover the uncanny way in  which the first announcement of the death had been made, shocked him deeply.  Herrick went out to see Petronella. He found her in the death chamber. A  genuine Romanist, she had placed candles round the bed, and a crucifix on the  breast of the dead, On her knees she was praying aloud. Seeing that all had  been done that could be done, Herrick returned to the study. Stephen was  calmer, and inclined to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was half past five as Sidney said,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;Oh, Herrick what  does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know,&rdquo; said the usually sceptically doctor, &ldquo;After you had gone, I asked  the boy how he knew. He said that while asleep he had dreamed&mdash;so he put  it&mdash;that he was standing in your mother&rsquo;s bedroom. She was dying in a stupor,  and he saw the breath gradually leave her body. He also said that he saw her  spirit after she was dead. But of course that must be nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  what he said I can believe anything&rdquo; said Marsh, &ldquo;what else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jim uncomfortably, &ldquo;he described the bedroom exactly. Was he ever in it  Stephen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  certainly not. And he described it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly;  and as being in the state in which it now is. He said that Petronella came in  at the door with a tray and placed it beside the bed. She then put her hand on  your mother&rsquo;s heart and found that she was dead. Afterwards she opened the  window. Why&mdash;what&mdash;Stephen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; cried the young man now ghastly white. &ldquo;That is exactly what Petronella  told me she did. Oh, oh!&rdquo; and he fainted. Herrick scarcely wondered at it; he  felt deadly sick himself and it needed another glass of brandy before he could  recover himself sufficiently to attend to the unconscious man.</p>
  <p>Next  day the news was known all over Beorminster; and Sidney&rsquo;s prophecy also. The  Endicotte family would fain have kept it to themselves; but Sidney himself had  spread the news. For on the way home and before the rumour could have reached  Saxham,&mdash;which it did not until late that night&mdash;he told several people of Mrs.  Marsh&rsquo;s death and the hour at which it had occurred. So the report spread, and  that night Saxham, accustomed to Sidney&rsquo;s second sight, was in a ferment. Many  believed, others doubted, and the upshot was that a few enquirers went over to  Beorminster whence they rushed back with a confirmation of the news. Mrs. Marsh  was dead, and moreover she had passed away at half past five. Up till a late  hour that night nothing was talked about but this wonderful boy, and next  morning a crowd collected about &ldquo;The Grange&rdquo; hoping to catch a glimpse of him.</p>
  <p>Ida  was very angry at Sidney&rsquo;s indiscretion and told him so. He took it all  placidly. &ldquo;Why should I not say that Mrs. Marsh was dead?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She <i>is</i>  dead; and she died at the time I said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  how did you know, Sidney dear?&rdquo; asked the perplexed sister. &ldquo;When I was on the  sofa in the library I dreamed that I was in her room, I saw her die, and the  white spirit get out of her body. The spirit pointed to a bottle on the table  beside the bed, and then I forgot all till I woke on the sofa and saw Stephen  looking at me. Then I told him to go home. There is nothing strange about it  Ida. You know I can see things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ida  shuddered and ran away to tell Bess that Sidney was a most uncomfortable person  to talk to. The boy stayed indoors at the request of Bess all the morning, and  then slipped off in the afternoon to go to his favourite haunt in the pine  wood. When he came into the village the next day, he refused to talk of his  dream or vision or whatever it might be called, and seemed quite cross when it  was referred to. From that day Sidney was shunned as though he had the plague.  Everyone was afraid of being told too much about themselves or their relations.  This troubled the boy very little. He went on living in his usual dreamy way,  and had no more visions for a time. Even at Biffstead he was regarded as  something dangerous. But there by tacit consent the subject was dropped.</p>
  <p>What  Dr. Jim thought of all this, it was difficult to say. Sidney&rsquo;s prophecy was  thrown into the background so far as he was concerned by the discovery that  Mrs. Marsh had died from an overdose of chloral. He had always warned her that  she might make a mistake, and apparently she had done so at last. But when  Petronella told him of the letter he changed his mind. What if she had committed  suicide? He recollected her vague allusions to enemies, and her persistent  declaration that she might not live long. At once he set about hunting for the  letter, Petronella helping him. But it was not to be discovered although they  searched high and low. At last, Herrick spied ashes in the fireless grate, and  found that some paper had been burnt, without doubt the letter Mrs. Marsh had  received.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there a fire in the grate on the day Mrs. Marsh died?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signor Dottore. The grate was empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. I need not have asked. This flimsy stuff would have been swept away  with the ashes. Humph! She must have got up and burnt the letter, and  then&mdash;Well, we must wait for the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Herrick who attended to all the details of the funeral, as Marsh was  completely bewildered by the sudden catastrophe. The inquest resulted in a  verdict that Mrs. Marsh had died from an overdose of chloral, but no one hinted  at suicide. As Dr. Jim gave evidence of her use of the drug to alleviate pain and  obtain sleep, it was concluded that she had miscalculated the dose. Even  Stephen believed that this was the case, for Herrick said nothing of his  suspicions. What Petronella thought Dr. Jim could not find out. She was as  secret as the grave.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Marsh was buried in the family vault of the Carr&rsquo;s at Saxham. A large number of  people came to the funeral, not because the dead woman had been popular, but  that they wished to attend the rites of a person whose death had been foretold  in so curious a manner. In the vault, the coffin was laid beside that of the  late Colonel, and Herrick shuddered as he thought of these enemies lying side  by side. Certainly, when the new vault was ready the body of the Colonel would  be removed to it, in accordance with the terms of the will. But it would be  some time before this was completed, and meantime Carr&rsquo;s body remained in the  old sepulchre. Pending its removal, Stephen had had a new iron door put on the  old vault, and kept the key to himself. It was quite safe in his pocket, and he  never parted from it.</p>
  <p>After  the funeral Herrick made several attempts to discover something about the  letter delivered to Mrs. Marsh on the day of her death, although he was careful  not to hint that it had any connection with her sudden end. But although he  questioned the postman and the postal authorities, he could gain very little  satisfaction. It was a plain envelope stamped&mdash;so far as could be  remembered&mdash;with the London post-mark. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Dr. Jim to himself when he  acquired this information. &ldquo;Frisco is in London. I wonder if he wrote that  letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>However  it was little use conjecturing. Mrs. Marsh was dead and had taken her secret  and the secret of Colonel Carr along with her into the next world. Herrick put  the idea out of his head, as he had much to do in considering his future  position. Three or four days after the funeral he was alone with Stephen in the  Beorminster house, and there spoke to the young man about his movements.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must return to London Marsh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can do no more good here; and I must  attend to my practice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Stephen quickly, &ldquo;you must not leave me like this Herrick. I have grown  used to you as a companion. I like you more than any man I ever met, and  without you I should be lost. You must stay with me. Is your practice a large  one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary it is very small. I have been established in West Kensington only  for two years. If I had not a small income of my own I should starve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you must come to me. I hope you will Herrick. I am rich, and I can allow you a  good income&mdash;say a thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is generous of you Marsh. Did your mother speak of this to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  she did not. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  she wanted me to stay with you, and proposed the same amount.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad,&rdquo; cried Stephen his face lighting up. &ldquo;I can do this much at least for  her memory. So she wished you to remain with me? You will of course. I cannot  do without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  smoked in silence for a few minutes. &ldquo;A man in my position has no right to turn  his back on such good fortune. All the same Marsh, if I did not like you  personally; if I did not think I could earn my income by helping you, I would  not take the position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you will do so?&rdquo; cried Stephen stretching out his hand.</p>
  <p>The  doctor grasped it heartily in token of acceptance. &ldquo;But I am not without  scruples as to taking such a large amount of money,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I make only a  couple of hundred a year by my practice. You rate me at a high value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  too high for the good you will do me,&rdquo; said Marsh heartily. &ldquo;I have been a  different man since you came into my life. You have shown me how to look at  things in a broader spirit. I am less morbid than I was. No, Herrick. I have  eight thousand a year, and you shall have the sum I name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. I am delighted. But for what period? You see Marsh, some day you will  marry, and then you will find in your wife the companion necessary to your  existence; you will not want me. I think we had better make an agreement for  three years. By that time I shall have done you all the good I can; you will be  used to your position. And,&rdquo; continued Jim looking into the young man&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;you  will be looking for a wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  nodded. &ldquo;Three years then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you want a document, the lawyers can  draw it up. As to marrying, I dare say I shall marry. Already I have&rdquo;&mdash;here he  broke off abruptly, &ldquo;there are some things a man cannot talk about even to his  best friend. Let the subject of love and marriage be tabooed between us  Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;  replied the doctor rather stiffly, &ldquo;I have no wish to force your confidence  Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not that; but&mdash;I have an idea in my head. It may come to nothing. On the other  hand&mdash;well,&rdquo; he dismissed it with a wave of his hand, &ldquo;time enough to talk  about it when it ripens. Let us change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the face of this unwillingness on the part of Marsh, Herrick was obliged to do  as he was asked. He wondered if Stephen really loved Ida Endicotte or whether  it was Bess who attracted him. Time alone would reveal the truth, so Herrick  for the moment thought no more about the matter. He had engaged himself to look  after Stephen, and at once set to work to earn his income. The subject was  introduced by Marsh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you and I ought to go abroad for a year or two,&rdquo; he said restlessly. &ldquo;I  feel that both Beorminster and Saxham are distasteful to me for a time. I have  arranged to let Petronella live here, on a small income. I thought she would  like to return to Italy, but she begged me to allow her to stay here for a  time. I asked her to go to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; but she refused. So here she must stay,  and you and I Herrick?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will go up to London for a couple of weeks,&rdquo; said Herrick promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want to go further afield and for a longer time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you forgotten the terms of the will?&rdquo; put in Dr. Jim. &ldquo;You must pay a monthly  visit to that vault, or the money goes to Frisco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  nodded somewhat grimly. &ldquo;I should have remembered,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yes! I cannot  travel until the year is at an end. But even if it so happened that I did not  go to the vault and lost the money, I do not think that Frisco would return to  claim it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Herrick musingly, &ldquo;after all we cannot be certain that  Frisco killed his master. He may re-appear and explain his flight and prove his  innocence. On the face of it, it would seem he is guilty but the evidence is  all circumstantial. Better stick to the terms of the will, and not give him the  chance of claiming the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good Herrick. Then we will go up to London, and you can take me to tailors and  all the other tradesmen whose goods I may need. I want you to educate me Dr.  Jim. You have had a varied experience of the world and I have not. I am a  country mouse, and you the Town one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  thirty-five I must have had some experience Marsh. Yes! I have travelled in my  time. I have been round Europe with a man I was trying to reclaim from strong  drink&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo;  replied the doctor with a shrug, &ldquo;he is a fairly decent member of society now.  Nothing to boast of. Well Marsh, I have also been doctor on a liner to the  East. Finally I went with an expedition into the interior of Africa. Now I am  settled in the dull quarter of West Kensington, and often wish I could be off  again on the long trail. Civilised life is too respectable for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the year is out we will go on the long trail together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Herrick, &ldquo;an exploration of our planet will do you no harm. Later on you  can settle down and be comfortable with a wife&mdash;I beg your pardon I am  trenching on forbidden ground. However Marsh I am glad things are so arranged.  It is a bit of good luck for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for me also Herrick. You can do me nothing but good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so,&rdquo; said Herrick cheerfully &ldquo;the first thing I intend to do is to take  you out into the open air. You must hunt and shoot and golf and swim, and get  yourself into a state of physical perfection. Your mind is all right. I like  your poems, and you have it in you to do great things Marsh. But first of all  you must attend to the body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have neglected these things,&rdquo; said Stephen straightening himself, &ldquo;but my life  was so narrow, that I did not look after myself as a man should. Besides to  tell you the truth Herrick I am so much of the student, that out-of-door life  never attracted me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is because you have never had a companion to interest you in the life,&rdquo; said  Herrick smiling. &ldquo;Now, I am devoted to athletic sports of all kinds. If I can  infect you with my enthusiasm you will soon be able to take the deepest  interest in them yourself. Not that I was fortunate enough to succeed with  Joyce,&rdquo; finished Dr. Jim with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  your friend who was staying at the Carr Arms? I never met him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will when we go to town. He is not a bad little chap but his brain is too large  for his body, Besides which he is neurotic, and intensely trying at times. I  don&rsquo;t suppose I should have cured him altogether, but I could have made him  twice the man he was, had he only taken my advice. But Robin was always as  obstinate as a mule. He lives into himself and for himself. There is no hope  for a man like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will succeed with me Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am certain to succeed with you. In the first place your nerves are not  diseased: in the second you are less selfish, and thirdly you are sensible  enough to see sense&mdash;and that last is not given to many men. Well, we have had  a long talk Marsh, so we had better go to bed, and begin our new life  to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was three days after this that the two went up to London. Herrick called at  Biffstead, and told Bess about his new relations with Stephen. She expressed  herself greatly pleased. &ldquo;You will do him no end of good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;physical  exercise is what he needs. He in making good use of his money,&rdquo; she added  emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have too good an opinion of me, Miss Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl laughed, and blushed. In her heart she liked Herrick greatly. He was so  big, so strong, so sensible&mdash;exactly the sort of man she admired. Frank, her  brother resembled him in many ways, but he was not so worldly-wise, nor perhaps  so clever. However she was too much the woman to make a direct reply to Herrick&rsquo;s  speech, and changed the subject. &ldquo;When you come back we must have our talk,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Meantime I shall give you something to go on with in London. Do you  know anything about cryptographs Dr. Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I have looked into the subject once or twice, but I never did much good at it.  Why?&rdquo; Bess went to her desk and fished out a bit of paper. &ldquo;I want you to see  if you can solve this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have done my best and failed. It is a  piece of paper I picked up in the Colonel&rsquo;s house when he was alive. I am sure  it has to do with his secret, whatever that might be. Else why should it be in  secret writing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  took the paper she held out. It was a yellow kind of Chinese paper, tough, and  wrinkled. On it was written in red ink the following,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;S.g.d.  K.Z.R.S. V.z.q.m.h.f. S.h.k.k. 1.5.I.t.k.x. S.i.d.n. C.d.z.s.g.  T.m.k.d.r.r.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  jumble of letters made Herrick stare. He could make nothing of them. Yet here,  no doubt, was the secret of Colonel Carr! Perhaps if the writing could be read,  the reason of his death might be explained, even the name of the assassin might  be given. Bess watched him eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay it may help us,&rdquo; Herrick said doubtfully, &ldquo;if the Colonel had a secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>If</i>  he had,&rdquo; cried Bess emphatically. &ldquo;I <i>know</i> he had!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it may be contained in this mixture of letters. You have failed, you say? Well  Miss Bess, I don&rsquo;t know that I shall succeed. However I will try. You will let  me have this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will take the very greatest care of it. I have a copy to be sure; but that  is the original.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  bring it back to you safe and sound in two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be back then?&rdquo; she asked with a quick flush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I shall arrange about my practice and return for good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  looked down. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she said in a low tone; then thinking she might have  said too much she smiled in his face. &ldquo;Of course I am glad,&rdquo; she cried gaily, &ldquo;are  we not pledged to find out who killed the Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    A Curious Discovery</b></h2>
  <p>It  was now quite two months since the death of Colonel Carr, and all this time  Robin had been in London. He had written to Herrick telling him he felt so much  better that he would not go abroad. &ldquo;I have a new idea for a novel,&rdquo; wrote  Joyce, &ldquo;and now that I have the leisure, I intend to throw myself heart and  soul into it. I still keep on my flat.&rdquo; Herrick therefore determined that his  first visit should be to the little man.</p>
  <p>Stephen  and the doctor took up their abode in the Guelph Hotel in Jermyn Street. It was  the first time the young man had been in London, and the novelty and excitement  of town life, did much to dispel the grief he felt for the death of his  step-mother. It was not that he regretted her the less, but he was sensible  enough to see that it was foolish to weep over an irremediable misfortune. He  therefore took Herrick&rsquo;s advice and threw himself with ardour into fitting  himself out with a complete ward-robe for the first time in his life. The  doctor took him to the best West-End shops, instructed him in the topography of  the fashionable locality, and when Stephen was fairly set going, found time to  attend to his own business.</p>
  <p>He  first went to his house in West Kensington, and saw that it was all right. Then  he called upon the young practitioner who had nursed his practice while he was  away, and made him an offer to sell it. The young doctor who had only lately  started in the district was overjoyed at the chance as Jim had got together a  fair number of patients. Herrick made the terms of purchase as light as  possible, and spread the payment over a considerable time. Dr. Grant asked two  days for consideration, as being poor it was necessary he should see his way  how to pay the money. At once Jim consented to this, and after finishing this  necessary business, he went off to Robin&rsquo;s flat. The arrangement and discussion  with Grant had taken up the best part of the afternoon, and it was close upon  seven when Herrick found time to see his friend. At first he hesitated, and  half made up his mind to put it off until the next day. But as he was in the  neighbourhood, he finally decided to go, and sent a wire to Marsh that he would  not be home until ten o&rsquo;clock. He intended to ask Joyce for a meal, making sure  that he would be welcome. Yet strange to say, Robin was not so hearty as  Herrick expected. Perhaps he had not got over his anger at the desertion of the  doctor; but after his last letter Jim could not think that such was the case.  In spite of their severance, Herrick still wished to keep an eye on Robin  knowing that he was foolish in many ways. Therefore when Joyce showed a  disposition not to invite him to stay, Herrick at once determined that he would  remain. There was a reason at the back of this confusion, and Herrick in the  interests of a weak man, resolved to find out what it might be. Seeing that he  was bent on remaining, Robin made the best of what he evidently considered a  bad job, and became more of his old self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not looking so well, as your letter led me to hope Robin,&rdquo; said Herrick,  when the two were smoking in the study.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am in the best of health,&rdquo; said Robin quickly. &ldquo;But of course I have been  working hard at my book, and that takes it out of a chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  me some of the chapters,&rdquo; said Herrick, who once had been a kind of literary  adviser to the author.</p>
  <p>Robin  shook his head uneasily. &ldquo;Not until the book is done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you to  get an impression as a whole. This will be my master-piece. Besides,&rdquo; he added  glancing at the clock, &ldquo;we might be interrupted. At half past seven a friend of  mine is coming to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope my unexpected coming will not upset your arrangements Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not&mdash;how can you think so?&rdquo; said Robin with an air of constraint that  did not escape Herrick. &ldquo;You are always welcome. Will you stop the night? I can  put you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I must get back to Marsh. I am his companion and doctor for the time being. A  very good billet I assure you Robin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about your practice?&rdquo; asked Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am now selling it to Grant. It is such a small practice that it is not worth my  while to stick to it as against an assured income of a thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that what Marsh gives you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I do not mind telling you Robin as you are such an old friend. But do not  mention this to anyone else. I stay with Marsh for three years. In this way I  shall be able to save money and buy a practice in a better part of the town. It  is a wonderful bit of luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is indeed, and I congratulate you,&rdquo; replied Robin cheerfully and shaking his  friend by the hand. &ldquo;Marsh must be well off to be able to afford your  companionship at that price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He has been left about eight thousand a year more or less by Colonel Carr, his  late uncle. But that is his business Robin. We will not talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  they yet found out who killed Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. Of course it is supposed that Frisco killed him; but the man has  disappeared. When he is caught we shall know the truth. You read the case  Robin. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems as though that man were guilty,&rdquo; replied Joyce slowly, &ldquo;but I am not  prepared to offer an opinion. The fact is I am so busy with my book that I have  put all these horrors out of my head. By the way, what about your Southberry  Helen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Endicotte? Oh, I have seen a good deal of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you are still in love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very passionately perhaps. But I think a respectable affection is better to  marry upon than a wild romantic adoration that will not resist the wear and  tear of life. I hope some day if Miss Endicotte will allow me, to marry  her&mdash;that is when I have a good practice. But if another man more worthy of her  comes along, why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ardent  lover!&rdquo; laughed Joyce. &ldquo;If you really felt any passion you would not  contemplate with equanimity the idea of an intruder. I believe you like that  little journalistic girl better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  kind of dull anger stirred in the doctor&rsquo;s breast at hearing Bess so flippantly  alluded to. But he saw that Joyce did not mean any harm, so turned off the  remark with a laugh. &ldquo;She is a charming young lady Robin. But she is better as  a comrade than she would be as a wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  comrade is what you want,&rdquo; said Joyce shrewdly. &ldquo;Your luke-warm affection will  not win you the love of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not. However we shall see,&rdquo; Herrick was annoyed, for he felt there was some  truth in this remark. He was glad when a ring came to the door and interrupted  a conversation which was rapidly getting unpleasant to him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your  friend. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  Mexican called Don Manuel Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  It it not often one foregathers with that nationality in London. Where did you  meet him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the Apollo Club, Johnstone introduced me to him. Here he is. I think you will  like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was not so sure. He had met with Mexicans on their native heath and did not  like the breed. However as the man was the guest of Joyce, he felt compelled to  behave at least politely. All the same knowing Robin&rsquo;s weakness in picking up  doubtful acquaintances, he determined to be observant of the Mexican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Herrick, Don Manuel Santiago. And this Se&ntilde;or, is my very best friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  little dark man clicked his heels together, foreign fashion, and bowed  politely. Herrick looked at him from head to foot in one swift glance, and made  up his mind that the man was a rogue, an adventurer, if nothing worse. He was  not tall, and he was very lean. His face was swarthy; he had a hook nose, a  black moustache, and a pair of restless shifty dark eyes. Accurately dressed in  an evening suit, he wore too much jewellery. Yet for all this he did not look  vulgar. There was a somewhat dangerous air about him. Herrick watching his face  intently made up his mind that Don Manuel was a half caste Indian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am pleased to meet you Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Don Manuel in good English but with a  foreign accent. &ldquo;Dr. Herrick? Ah! I know the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim, looking surprised. Robin also shared his astonishment, and  expressed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  Santiago you did not tell me you knew Herrick!&rdquo; said he, as they took their  seats at table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I not?&rdquo; replied the Don carelessly. &ldquo;Ah! that was no doubt because his name was  never mentioned between us. But if I am not mistaken,&rdquo; said he addressing  himself directly to Jim, &ldquo;you were concerned in that strange case of my friend  Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  almost bounded from his seat. That here of all places and in so unexpected a way,  he should meet with a stranger who knew Carr, was like fiction. Had the  incident occurred in a novel, he would have put it down as a freak of  imagination on the author&rsquo;s part. Yet the thing had happened in real life and  to himself. &ldquo;Was Carr a friend of yours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve  years and more ago,&rdquo; replied Santiago quietly, &ldquo;we knew one another intimately  in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mexico!&rdquo;  muttered Herrick, recalling what Bess had said about Frisco&rsquo;s tales of North  and South America, &ldquo;not in Peru?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  went to Peru together&mdash;on an expedition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  sort of an expedition?&rdquo; asked Joyce eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make our fortunes. That is the sort of expedition we all are bound to  undertake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  thought of Colonel Carr&rsquo;s money. Was he on the point of learning sufficient of  the man&rsquo;s wild life in the Americas, to reveal what his secret was? &ldquo;Did you  succeed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not&mdash;the Colonel did. Afterwards he returned to England, and I lost sight  of him. When I came over six months ago, I heard of him, and intended to pay him  a visit. But I put it off and off and off&mdash;until&mdash;&rdquo; he made a rapid gesture, &ldquo;poor  Carr! His was a sad end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  unexpected one,&rdquo; said Herrick fixing his eyes on the man. &ldquo;Did you know his  servant, Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied Manuel calmly. &ldquo;Frisco was after my time, or before it; I forget which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow  Herrick felt instinctively that this was a lie. According to Bess the ex-sailor  had been with Carr throughout his wandering life. It was incredible that if  such was the case (and Jim preferred to believe Frisco rather than  Santiago)&mdash;that Frisco should not have gone on to Peru. He would be needed on  an expedition such as Manuel spoke of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you treasure-hunting&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
  <p>Don  Manuel nodded &ldquo;Yes! The Peruvians buried a lot of gold and jewels, at the time  of the Conquest. Carr got wind of a hiding place from some one&mdash;an Indian I  believe, and induced me to go with him to Peru. I was doing nothing at the  time, so I went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carr  found the treasure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so. Colonel Carr was rich was he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  rich,&rdquo; chimed in Joyce. &ldquo;Do you remember Herrick, how astonished we were at the  magnificence of that house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember,&rdquo; said Herrick curtly. The interruption did not please him, as he  wanted particularly to hear what Santiago had to say. &ldquo;But Se&ntilde;or Manuel, if you  started on this search together, how was it that you do not know for certain if  Colonel Carr was successful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don  Manuel&rsquo;s face grew black and his eyes flashed. &ldquo;If you would know the reason  Se&ntilde;or, Colonel Carr was a devil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said Herrick with a short laugh. &ldquo;That is no news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shared the expenses of the expedition, we were to share the profits; but Carr  treated me shamefully. The treasure was said to be concealed beyond  Cuzco&mdash;where it does not matter. I know, but I do not intend to tell. I fell  ill at the first stage of the journey after we left Cuzco and were amongst the  mountains. What did Carr do? He left me to the care of the Indians, and pushed  on himself. That was the last I saw of the devil. For two years I was held  captive amongst the Indians and barely escaped with my life. I hunted for Carr  when I got to Callao; but he had disappeared. I traced him to Mexico. He  vanished from Vera Cruz. I was worn out and ill. I went back to my own family,  and all these years I thought nothing about the Colonel. But chance brought me  to England, and chance led me to hear where Colonel Carr was settled. As I said  I would have seen him to reproach him for his treachery, but&mdash;&rdquo; Don Manuel  shrugged&mdash;&ldquo;he is dead. That is the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange story, and not creditable to Carr,&rdquo; said Herrick wondering if all this  was a lie. &ldquo;Who was it told you where Colonel Carr lived?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not,&rdquo; said Joyce on whose face Jim&rsquo;s eyes rested for a moment. &ldquo;I knew  nothing of this until this moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  I heard the name Se&ntilde;or, can be of little interest to you,&rdquo; said the Don with a  sneer. &ldquo;It was in London. I tell you no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want you to tell me anything,&rdquo; retorted Herrick the blood rushing to his  face. &ldquo;So far, I am interested in your story, but if you choose to be silent,  you are at liberty to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo;  said Manuel humbly, &ldquo;I did not intend to provoke your anger,&rdquo; but as he spoke  there was a nasty glitter in his eyes, &ldquo;I cannot tell you who gave me the  information without breaking confidence with a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  grunted, but he said nothing. Santiago was evidently a dangerous little devil.  For all he knew the Mexican might have had something to do with the murder. Of  all strange circumstances that Herrick had stumbled upon this surely was the  strangest! To find the man who knew of the past of Colonel Carr, in the company  of Robin Joyce.</p>
  <p>As  the meal was now at an end, the three adjourned to the study where they began  to smoke. Herrick had his pipe, Joyce a cigarette, and Manuel produced one of  those long lean Mexican cigars, that only a hardened smoker can enjoy. As he  bent forward over the spirit lamp, Jim saw by the touch of grey on his temples  and the wrinkles down the side of his neck that the man was much older than he  had thought. At the first glance Santiago looked&mdash;if you wanted to be  disagreeable&mdash;say thirty-five. Herrick was now sure he was over fifty. But the  man was in wonderfully good condition. Having noticed him at the table Jim saw  that he was both abstemious and temperate.</p>
  <p>For  some reason not apparent, Manuel desired to ingratiate himself with Herrick,  and tried by picturesque talk to banish the disagreeable impression he had made  by his last remark. He told the most wonderful stories of his adventures by  land and sea. According to his own account he had lived a life of hair-breadth  escapes. South America he knew from Quito to the Horn, and had explored the  unknown portions at the risk of his life. He had been captive to Indians, he  had been tortured&mdash;Herrick noted that his left ear was missing&mdash;and he had been  almost frozen while ascending Chimborazo. Then he had hunted for treasure,  fought for it with knives when it was found, and by his own confession had more  than one death to his account. All this he told in vivid picturesque language and  with a wonderful command of the English tongue. Herrick complimented him on his  capabilities as a linguist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know seven or eight languages,&rdquo; said Manuel boastfully &ldquo;not to speak of  Indian dialects. I have been all over Europe. Yes, Se&ntilde;or, when I made  money&mdash;and I have made a great deal&mdash;I came always to Europe to spend it. That  I did royally. Oh, they know me in every capital. Of all, give me Vienna. Oh,  Se&ntilde;or, I am known on the Prater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to the police no doubt,&rdquo; thought Herrick; but for his own private reasons did  not give vent to this opinion. He said aloud, &ldquo;I suppose Don Manuel, you were  not surprised to hear of Colonel Carr&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  flashed a quick glance at the imperturbable countenance of the doctor. &ldquo;Oh, but  I was,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;to escape all the dangers of the tropics, and then to die in a  quiet little English village. Strange! To be sure though,&rdquo; added Manuel with  another glance, &ldquo;he brought his murderer with him. And Frisco was capable of  anything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  put in Herrick sharply, &ldquo;I thought you did not know Frisco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  did I Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Santiago covering his mistake with wonderful swiftness &ldquo;but  I heard of him. He was a devil worse than Carr, if that can be possible. They  were attached to one another but quarrelled&mdash;Oh, yes, Se&ntilde;or I assure you they  quarrelled. Once over a game of cards, Carr slashed Frisco across the face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that was it, was it?&rdquo; murmured Herrick as he recalled the criss-cross slash on  Frisco&rsquo;s face which had been described to him. &ldquo;A queer couple. What was Frisco&rsquo;s  real name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know,&rdquo; snapped Manuel with a surprising curtness considering his late  voluble talk. Shortly he took his leave, with a politely expressed hope that he  would meet Herrick again. When the Mexican was gone, Joyce turned eagerly to his  friend and asked what he thought of him. &ldquo;If you want to know my real opinion,  he is a thorough little blackguard. Cut him Robin, or you will get into  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see why I should. He is a decent fellow. His only vice is gambling. He  would sell his shirt to gamble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Looks a card-sharper. Where does he gamble principally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a club down in Pimlico,&mdash;the Parrot Club. Very few people know about it. But  the play is very high?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.  So you met Santiago there,&rdquo; said Herrick lazily.</p>
  <p>But  Joyce saw the trap and avoided it. &ldquo;No! I told you I met him at the Apollo  Club&mdash;that is respectable enough I hope? And Archy Johnstone introduced him to  me. He is decent, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I have nothing to say,&rdquo; replied Herrick with a yawn, putting on his coat, &ldquo;only,  if that man gets you into trouble don&rsquo;t blame me. He will probably induce you  to gamble and all your new income of five hundred a year will go once and for  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  peculiar expression swept across Joyce&rsquo;s face and he opened and shut his hands  nervously. However he held his tongue, and having said good-night Herrick went  away, sorry to see that his friend was in such bad company. He regarded Don  Manuel as a rook and Joyce as a pigeon. But he knew the little man well enough  to know that his interference was vain. Joyce could be as obstinate as a mule  at times.</p>
  <p>When  he got back to the Guelph Hotel it was close on eleven. All the same Stephen  was sitting up for him over a meditative pipe. The sight of his honest handsome  face was quite a relief to Herrick after the crafty looks of Manuel. And truth  to tell, Joyce had fallen also in Herrick&rsquo;s estimation; for as a man he could  not compare with Marsh. Not for the first time Dr. Jim began to think there was  something sly and evil about Robin. Hitherto, he had been too much taken up  with the man&rsquo;s nerves to think much of his moral character. But after this long  absence he saw plainly that Joyce was deteriorating rapidly. The company he had  been in this very night proved it, if there were any truth in the saying that  birds of a feather flock together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo  Stephen!&rdquo; said Herrick taking off his coat, &ldquo;why did you not go to bed man?  Sitting up all alone, like a maid on the Eve of St. Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not want to go to bed until you came home,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;you know I  always like a chat. Have some whisky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.  Shove over the tobacco-jar. Well Marsh, I have arranged about the sale of my  practice. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am delighted. You are sure you do not mind giving it up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for a thousand a year,&rdquo; replied Herrick with a laugh. &ldquo;I never made so much in  all my medical life. Not to mention the delights of your society. What have you  been doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shopping  mostly. Then I called in on Frith and Frith to talk about business. I heard of  your friend Joyce there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  deuce you did!&rdquo; said Jim wheeling round. &ldquo;I have just been dining with him, and  I do not think he is improved. Frith and Frith are his lawyers I know. How did  his name crop up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the course of my talk about the Colonel&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you will be rather astonished,&rdquo; continued Marsh lighting his pipe, &ldquo;but the  fact is Colonel Carr allowed Mrs. Joyce, the mother of your friend an income of  five hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Herrick, and thought that this was just the sum Robin said he had been  left by his mother&rsquo;s will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Why, I do not know. Nor could Frith tell me. The Colonel never called to see  Mrs. Joyce; he never wrote her a letter. But he directed Frith to pay her an  annuity of five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  annuity? Then it ceased at her death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. The son gets nothing. The reason Frith mentioned it, was that he wished  to know if I had found anything amongst my uncle&rsquo;s papers likely to show why  the annuity had been paid, and whether it ought to be continued to the son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queer!&rdquo;  said Herrick. He remembered that Robin had told him that he had interviewed the  lawyers and had been informed of his income. Why had Robin told a lie? &ldquo;I  suppose,&rdquo; said the doctor after a pause, &ldquo;that Frith did not take it upon  himself to promise Joyce the continuance of this annuity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; replied Stephen, &ldquo;he had no right. Of course I told him that I knew  nothing about the matter and would not pay anything to Joyce. Still&mdash;as he is  your friend?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that. I don&rsquo;t want you to pay him anything. Did Joyce call to see Frith do  you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week after his mother&rsquo;s death. He has not been since. They told him then that  he need not expect any more money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week after his mother&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; related the doctor &ldquo;and it was two months later  we were on that walking tour! Did not Joyce call to see Frith somewhere about  the twenty-fourth of July?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  It was towards the end of April he called. He has not been near them since. You  look rather pale, Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  nothing,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;I have had rather a turn, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    Herrick Is Suspicious</b></h2>
  <p>Dr.  Jim slept very little that night. He was turning over in his mind Joyce&rsquo;s  strange conduct. Now that he remembered, Robin had been very particular as to  the details of his whereabouts. He had gone to Town on a Tuesday leaving  Herrick at the Southberry Railway Inn. According to his story he had seen Frith  and Frith the same afternoon, and again the next morning. The intervening night  he had slept at the Hull Hotel in a side Street off the Strand. Then on  Wednesday afternoon, he had rejoined Dr. Jim at Southberry and on Thursday  morning had started to cross the Heath. It was on that same night, that the two  had discovered the body of Colonel Carr. So far Herrick had believed this  story.</p>
  <p>But  now, the fact that he had not called on the lawyers had put a different  complexion on the affair. Also his statement concerning the money left to him  was proved&mdash;by the evidence of the solicitors who paid the annuity&mdash;to be a  lie. Robin therefore had not been so deeply plunged in grief as he appeared to  be, when he could call a few days after his mother&rsquo;s death to see if he was to  inherit the money. Herrick considered that probably when alone in the flat he  had found some paper stating that the five hundred a year terminated at his  mother&rsquo;s death, and had gone to Frith and Frith in order to ascertain if this  were true. Besides his mother might have told him this on her deathbed. But  what else had she told him? Colonel Carr was not the man to pay out money for  nothing. Mrs. Joyce must have had some hold over him.</p>
  <p>However  the main point, and that which vexed Dr. Jim most, was the fact that Robin had  not called on the solicitors, as he said he had done. At Southberry he had  received a letter calling him up to town. Jim had not read the letter, but  since Robin had told him the contents he never doubted that it was from the  firm of Frith. If he had not called on them, why was the letter sent, and where  was he during the two days he was in Town? Herrick reckoned back the dates. It  was Thursday the twenty-sixth of July when they arrived at Saxham. Robin had  gone to Town on the twenty-fourth, and on that same night Colonel Carr  (according to the medical evidence) had been shot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Heavens!&rdquo; said Jim when this came into his mind, &ldquo;can it be possible that Joyce  killed the man? There is no reason why he should. I am a suspicious fool. He  was in London even though he did not call on the solicitors. There is no proof  that he was at Saxham. He said himself when he went through the Pine wood that  he did not know the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  Jim recollected that it was Robin who had selected the route for the walking  tour. Could it be possible that he knew of the existence of the House in the  Pine Wood, and had designedly led Herrick that way in order that the murder  should be discovered, and suspicion averted from himself? &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Cried Jim  tossing and turning, &ldquo;he could not have contrived so damnable a scheme. Besides  he slept at the Hull Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way he kept arguing out the situation, but by the morning he had come to  no conclusion. The evidence against Robin was not strong enough. But while  shaving Dr. Jim made up his mind to call on Frith and Frith, and also to look  in at the Hull Hotel. Nevertheless whatever he found, he resolved to hold his  tongue so far as Robin was concerned. Joyce was far too intimate with Don  Manuel to please Herrick. And Don Manuel, as the doctor remembered professed a  hatred of Carr. He also might have something to do with the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stephen&rdquo;  said Herrick at breakfast, &ldquo;I want you to look after yourself again to-day. I  have business to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Marsh, &ldquo;I can amuse myself. There is The National Gallery to  see; and the Tower, and Westminster Abbey. I should only bore you taking you to  these places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am never bored in your company,&rdquo; said Jim absently, his thoughts intent on what  he had to do, &ldquo;but I shall be at your service to-morrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have to see about your practice I suppose Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Also some other business. How long do you want to stay in Town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  week is enough for the present,&rdquo; replied Marsh, &ldquo;we came for two, did we not? I  have got all the clothes, I need. They will be ready by the end of this week;  then we can go back. You want to return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I have an idea in my head. Later on I will tell it to you.&rdquo; Marsh turned to ask  what Herrick meant but seeing that his friend was taken up with his own  thoughts, he said nothing. After breakfast Jim left Marsh to look over the morning  paper, and went out.</p>
  <p>The  first place he sought out was the lawyer&rsquo;s office. Mr. Frith the junior partner  received him, all the more readily, when he heard the name. On the previous  day, Stephen had been enthusiastic on the subject of his new friend. Frith  junior took to Jim at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad to see you,&rdquo; he said pushing forward a chair, &ldquo;Mr. Marsh-Carr told us  all about you. I am glad he has had the good sense to select you as a  companion. He needs shaking up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marsh  is a good fellow,&rdquo; replied Jim, &ldquo;and anything I can do to make a man of him  shall be done. But the material is there, Mr. Frith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  But that step-mother of his did a great deal to ruin him. He could not call his  soul his own. I do not think her death is much to be regretted,&rdquo; finished Frith  with a dry smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was rather stormy, but I think she really loved her step-son. What are you  smiling at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was recalling one or two interviews I had with the lady in question,&rdquo; said the  young lawyer. &ldquo;She was, as you say, stormy. Even the Colonel was afraid of her,  so he sent her up to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she come about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  annuity for herself and an income for her son, the present owner of the estate.  Colonel Carr refused to allow her one penny. He said that he had made his will  in favour of Stephen Marsh, and that both he and Mrs. Marsh could wait until  his death. I tried hard to persuade him to allow her something but he refused.  Mrs. Marsh used to come up and make scenes in this office. Stormy!&rdquo; chuckled  Frith. &ldquo;I should think she was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was your opinion of Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled the lawyer with a quick glance, &ldquo;that is rather a leading question. The  man is dead, and he was a good client to us. But speaking as man to man and in  confidence doctor, I think he was the greatest scoundrel in the Three Kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rather strong Mr. Frith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it falls short of the truth Dr. Herrick. However the man is dead, so we may  leave him at rest. He met with a terrible death, and his own familiar friend  put an end to him. The Colonel had not much human feeling but when dying he  must have felt a pang at the thought that the only creature he had been kind to  was putting him out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim using his favourite ejaculation, &ldquo;do you believe that Frisco did kill  him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know anyone else who could have done so. And if he did not, why did he  run away? Why does he keep hidden? Yes, Dr. Herrick, I think the crime can be  safely put down to his account. Queer man too,&rdquo; added Frith reflectively, &ldquo;he  was slangy and a good bit of a brute, yet there was something of the gentleman  about him. He could speak good English when he chose, which was not often.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Colonel brought him from South America?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he now?&rdquo; said Frith sharply, &ldquo;I never knew that before. Frisco at times came up  about Carr&rsquo;s business but he was careful to say nothing about himself. He  seemed fond of his master. That is why it is so strange he should have killed  him. But then we know that the collie, which is the most faithful of dogs, goes  mad at times and attacks his master. I expect it was something of the same kind  with Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know how the Colonel made his money?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  nor does anyone else that I know of. I am certain of one thing, that it was  made in some shady way. Carr was an out and out bad lot. A kind of Captain  Kidd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange  that you should mention his name in conjunction with Kidd. He had a treasure  likewise, had he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean by &lsquo;had a treasure likewise?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  considered a minute before replying. As a rule he was not a man given to loose  speaking, and preferred to do his own work without the assistance of any one.  But he saw that Frith was a shrewd and capable man, and that in case of need,  his advice was not to be despised. So far as Joyce was concerned, Jim did not  intend to say anything at present, as he was not yet sure of his ground and  even had he been sure, he would have hesitated to betray his friend, however  guilty he might be. Concerning Don Manuel, he had no such scruples, so he then  and there told the lawyer all that had passed at the flat. Frith listened  attentively, but seemed in no way astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the sort of thing one would expect from Carr,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The man was a bad  lot, and I daresay if we knew all the details of that expedition we should find  it less innocent than this Mexican has depicted. Still, leaving the man amongst  the Indians was bad enough. So that was how he made his money. I always knew it  was not made in any respectable way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Few  fortunes are,&rdquo; said Herrick dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true; but some methods may be more damnable than others, as in this case.  Carr I know went away many years ago, as poor as a rat. I have heard my father  speak of him. He came back ten years ago with no end of money. We helped him to  invest it. As the income is eight thousand a year Dr. Herrick, you may guess  what the principal amounted to. Treasure-hunting sounds innocent enough, even  romantic, but in Carr&rsquo;s hands I can guess what a piece of rascality it was. The  man could not run straight. If there was a possibility of going the wrong way,  he took that in preference to following the right path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo;  said Herrick approaching the main object of his visit, &ldquo;the man had some good  points. For instance, he was charitable to Mrs. Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  West Kensington?&rdquo; said Frith with a stare. &ldquo;How did you know about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce  is a friend of mine. I was with him on a walking-tour when he received your  letter asking him to call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  We never wrote the man a letter in our lives!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  on or about the twenty-third of July?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I am positive. I should have known. It is true that he called to see us a few  days after his mother&rsquo;s death, about the annuity which Carr ordered to be paid  to Mrs. Joyce. He wanted to know if he would have it also. We communicated with  Colonel Carr, who replied in his characteristic way that Joyce could go to the  devil. Afterwards Joyce called a second time and we told him the message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  second time was on the twenty-fourth of July?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  It was towards the end of April. We have not seen him since, nor, as I say,  have we written him any letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  concise explanation showed Herrick that Robin for reasons of his own had told a  deliberate lie. Whatever he had come to London about, it was not to see the  Solicitors as he had alleged to Herrick. Dr. Jim pulled his moustache  reflectively. &ldquo;Why was an annuity paid to Mrs. Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Frith, &ldquo;and even if I did, it would be a breach of  professional etiquette to tell you. A year after the Colonel came back to  England&mdash;about nine years ago&mdash;he ordered my father to send a monthly cheque to  Mrs. Joyce at an address at Hampstead. She sent a receipt every time, but she  never came to see us, and we had absolutely nothing to do with her. When she  changed her address, which she did several times, she notified the fact and we  sent her allowance to the new place. That is all I know of the annuity. And as  I say the Colonel stopped it when she died. What it was for, I don&rsquo;t know. The  Colonel was dark in many ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was evidently a most dangerous person,&rdquo; said, Herrick rising to take his leave.  &ldquo;However he has received the reward of his crimes. By the way I suppose all the  business of Marsh is in your hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  It is all in order. The Colonel was a most methodical man, and left his estate  in the best of conditions. We are now arranging for letters patent for this  change of name. Our client has arranged to call himself Marsh-Carr. I suppose  he did not like the idea of Carr alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you wonder at it considering the reputation of the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  not a very nice name to give one&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; laughed Frith rising. &ldquo;Well good-bye  Dr. Herrick. I am glad to have seen you, and still more glad to think that our  client has so excellent a friend at his elbow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed at this praise and departed, very pleased that he had been received in  so friendly a way. He fancied at one time that Frith might have looked upon him  as an interloper, and it was a great compliment to him, that these shrewd  lawyers should be so satisfied with Stephen&rsquo;s choice of a friend.</p>
  <p>From  the city Herrick went to the Strand in search of the Hull Hotel. He was now  very doubtful of Robin&rsquo;s honesty. If the man had lied in one thing he would in  another. Jim was quite prepared to find that Joyce was not known at the Strand  public-house, but in this instance he proved to be wrong. Directed by a  friendly policeman, he soon found the place. It was a small pot-house of  anything but a reputable appearance. Herrick stepped inside, and was confronted  by a stout woman with a squint. In answer to his inquiry for the landlord, she  announced that the house belonged to her, and demanded his business. Herrick  seeing the necessity for caution went about his task in an artful way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a friend of mine who stayed here on the night of the twenty-fourth of July  last,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He wrote to me from this place on that date, and as I have  received no letter since, I have come to inquire if he is still to be found  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is his name sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Robin Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know it,&rdquo; grunted the landlady. &ldquo;Robin Joyce,&rdquo; she rubbed her nose, and then  shouted. &ldquo;Tilda! Do you know a party as stayed here called Robin Joyce? Look up  the books&mdash;twenty-fourth July.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smart-looking girl dressed in a tawdry manner made her appearance and requested  her mother (the stout lady was her mother it appeared) not to make such a  noise. Then she addressed herself to Herrick. &ldquo;I need not look at the books  sir. I remember Mr. Robin Joyce quite well. A little man is he  not&mdash;clean-shaven&mdash;with rather long hair and big, big black eyes. Nervous  manner sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is him,&rdquo; replied Herrick thankful to hear that his friend was known at the  address he had given. &ldquo;He slept here on the night of the twenty-fourth of July.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg  your pardon sir, but he did nothing of the sort. He came here after mid-day  with a black bag and engaged a room. Then he went out almost at once, promising  to be back to dinner. It was ordered, but he never came. No sir, I did not see  him until mid-day next morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are certain he did not sleep here on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  certain sir. You remember mother, he told both of us when he came back that he  had been staying with a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I remember now. Then he paid his bill and went away, to catch a train, he said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Paddington train,&rdquo; put in the daughter. &ldquo;I heard him tell the cabby to drive to  Paddington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  thanked the two women for their information, and asked if Mr. Joyce had been  there since. Both were positive he had not. &ldquo;I saw him only once sir and he did  not sleep here,&rdquo; were the last words of the daughter. So Herrick departed fully  convinced that Robin had told him a second lie. Naturally the little man never  thought that anything would happen likely to induce Herrick to make enquires.  Nor would such have been the case, but for Stephen&rsquo;s remark about the annuity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  question now,&rdquo; said Herrick to himself, &ldquo;is whether he was at Saxham on that  night. If I can prove that&mdash;&rdquo; he shook his head, and acknowledged that things  were beginning to look black against Joyce.</p>
  <p>For  the moment he almost made up his mind to go at once to West Kensington and tell  Joyce the whole story, demanding at the same time an explanation of  these&mdash;apparently unnecessary lies. But on second thoughts he resolved to wait  until he could make certain that Joyce had gone down to Saxham. Robin would  probably take the afternoon train to Beorminster. In that case however he would  have had to change at Southberry Junction and as Herrick was at the Junction he  might not risk doing so. There was Heathcroft of course. That was six miles  from Saxham, and could be reached by another line. He might have gone that way  and walked the six miles. &ldquo;But I cannot say anything for certain until I make  enquiries,&rdquo; thought Herrick and so resolved to wait until he returned to &ldquo;The  Pines&rdquo; with Marsh.</p>
  <p>The  next two or three days Herrick spent with Stephen. Not a word did he say about  the business he had been employed upon. He did not even speak of Joyce, tried  not to think of him, but gave himself up to the enjoyment of the moment. Owing  to his recent bereavement Stephen would not go to any theatre, but the two  managed to find amusement in exploring London. With the greatest good humour,  Herrick permitted himself to be dragged to the Tower, the Abbey, and to several  other places which Stephen had already visited. Also there was much shopping to  do, clothes to be tried on, and all kinds of fascinating things to be bought.  Stephen purchased a selection of presents for the Biffs, and made Herrick help  him to choose them. They arranged to go back at the week&rsquo;s end, when &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo;  would be ready to receive them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect it is all in order by this time,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;and Ida promised to see  after the servants for me. Bess is superintending the whole business. I have  told her to do exactly as she pleases, and there is nothing she likes better.  We shall find the place in apple-pie order when we go back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you not marry Miss Bess?&rdquo; said Herrick laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  like Bess very much, but she is not the wife for me,&rdquo; said Stephen seriously. &ldquo;Ida  is better suited to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  felt a pang of jealousy. What chance had he against this wealthy favourite of  fortune. Then he rebuked himself for the ungrateful feeling and swore if he saw  the least love existing between Marsh and Ida that he would at once crush down  his own passion. As yet (as he had told Joyce) it was not very strong; but in  the sunshine of Ida&rsquo;s beauty and charm, it might easily assume gigantic  proportions. If it did, and Stephen loved her, why then good-bye to his income.  For Herrick felt that under the circumstances the situation would be so  unbearable that he would be forced to leave Saxham. If Stephen would only say  definitely if he loved the girl Herrick would know how to act. At present he  was quite in the dark. Still until he could be quite sure he judged it wiser to  hold himself well in hand.</p>
  <p>Later  on it occurred to him that he would see Joyce and ask him to come down to  Saxham. If he had really committed the murder (and of this there was as yet no  proof) he would naturally refuse to come. On the other hand he might dare as  much. However, on the whole as straws show which way the wind blows and he knew  what a nervous man Joyce was, Herrick thought he would be able to decide by his  manner if he really had any dislike to Saxham.</p>
  <p>He  therefore one afternoon went to West Kensington. By this time he had settled  with Grant about his practice, and arranged the manner of payment. His sole  business was with Robin, and he went at once to the Mansions. The servant said  that Mr. Joyce was absent, but was expected in soon, and that another gentleman  was waiting in the drawing-room to see him. Herrick had his suspicions at once,  and was not at all surprised to meet the smiling face of Don Manuel Santiago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you have come to see our friend,&rdquo; said the Mexican, shaking Herrick&rsquo;s hand in  the most hearty manner. &ldquo;I also. He will be back shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  are you Don Manuel?&rdquo; said Herrick politely. &ldquo;Well, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  speech was obvious, but the fact is Herrick was observing the Mexican from  under his eyelids. When Santiago thought himself unobserved he stole glances at  his visitor. Apparently he neither liked nor trusted Herrick. The doctor  wondered what bond bound Robin and this scamp together. Joyce was a scamp also  and worse if his visit to Saxham could be proved. Manuel answered the inquiry  with a careless speech and a puzzled look, evidently wondering why it was made.  After a time he began to walk restlessly about the room exclaiming that he  wanted a cigarette, and he had exhausted his own. Herrick politely offered his  case, as he wanted to put the Mexican at his ease and get him to speak, in the  hope of learning something from him, but Don Manuel refused the offer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  smoke only my own particular kind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ah! now I remember. I left some  in Joyce&rsquo;s study. I will go and look for them. Will you come also, Se&ntilde;or? We  had better smoke in the study. Joyce does not like the smoke in this room&mdash;&rdquo; he  cast a look round and shrugged, &ldquo;this ugly room,&rdquo; said Don Manuel spitefully.</p>
  <p>Herrick  followed rather because he wished to keep this shifty creature in sight than  because he wanted to smoke. Manuel went to the writing table and shifted the  papers about. He searched the mantelpiece, and then casting his eyes on a  tobacco cabinette walked towards that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had found them and put them in there,&rdquo; said Manuel and pulled open several  drawers.</p>
  <p>The  Cabinet was at Herrick&rsquo;s elbow, and he could see into all the drawers as the  Mexican opened them. In the lowest drawer was a pistol. Don Manuel took it out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  strange place to keep a revolver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, it is not a revolver what can  it be&mdash;so large&mdash;so clumsy, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  took the weapon handed to him while Manuel continued his search for the  cigarettes. A frightful suspicion flashed into his mind as he saw the old-fashioned  weapon in the Mexican&rsquo;s hand. He remembered that the death wound had been  inflicted by a roughly cast bullet, and that at the inquest it was said such  had been fired from an antique pistol. Here was the very thing in his hand&mdash;an  old pistol, silver-mounted, and clumsy in the extreme. The muzzle was large,  and could well fire the big bullet that had passed through the heart of Carr to  bury itself in the opposite wall. And this was in Joyce&rsquo;s house. Herrick felt  sick.</p>
  <p>Manuel  turned to him with a shrug. &ldquo;There are no cigarettes here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Joyce has  smoked them. Se&ntilde;or you look ill&mdash;pale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is nothing,&rdquo; replied Herrick, replacing the weapon in the cabinet &ldquo;I am subject  to attacks of faintness. I think Don Manuel, that you had better say nothing,  to Joyce about our finding that pistol. He might not like us to be prying into  his cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you please,&rdquo; said Santiago with a shrug, &ldquo;but Joyce would never be angry with  me. What is the pistol Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  some old-fashioned weapon that Joyce brought in a curiosity shop very probably,&rdquo;  replied the doctor carelessly, &ldquo;it certainly is not the kind of thing one would  use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Don Manuel equally carelessly, &ldquo;an ugly thing. I will say nothing. A  cigarette? Se&ntilde;or, I will take one of yours. Ah, there is my dear friend Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  the Mexican was lighting the cigarette Robin entered, and greeted Herrick  rather stiffly. It was all Jim could do to bring himself to shake hands with  the man he now believed to be a criminal. Yet in spite of all he had learned,  in spite of the discovery of the old-fashioned pistol, he could not yet bring  himself quite to believe in Robin&rsquo;s guilt. He still hoped for the best, and  talked easily enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  pale you are Jim,&rdquo; said Joyce abruptly, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so much a countryman now, that London does not agree with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  laughed at the joke. &ldquo;I prefer London myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a pity,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;for I am returning to Saxham to-morrow, and I want  you to come down for a few days next week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be delighted,&rdquo; replied Robin at once. &ldquo;I can put up at The Carr Arms. I  do not know Marsh you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay when he meets you he will ask you to stay at &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo;&ldquo; said  Herrick, &ldquo;but you will come down Robin? I have seen so little of you, and I do  not want our friendship to end so abruptly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I will come with pleasure,&rdquo; replied Joyce so warmly that Herrick&rsquo;s heart smote  him for his treachery. But when he remembered how Joyce had deceived him, how  he had led him to the very house in which to all appearance&mdash;he had committed a  crime, the doctor&rsquo;s heart grew hard and he was quite prepared to play his part  and trap this man. He was now beginning to regard Robin as a little reptile  extremely dangerous who needed to be crushed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall come next week,&rdquo; said Joyce gaily, &ldquo;and if Marsh likes me, he may as you  say, ask me to &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; You might come also Manuel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  if I have a day to spare,&rdquo; said the Mexican. &ldquo;I should like to see the place  where my dear friend Carr died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glanced at Herrick as he spoke, but the doctor was not attending to him and did  not see the look. Tea was being brought in, and Herrick wanted to get away at  once. He felt that knowing what he did, he could never break bread with Robin  again. He fervently hoped that the man was innocent, but things looked black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must go now Robin,&rdquo; said Herrick hurriedly, &ldquo;remember you <i>must</i> come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  promise. Won&rsquo;t you have tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  thanks; Marsh expects me. Good-bye until we meet at Saxham. Don Manuel, Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till  we meet at Saxham,&rdquo; said the ready foreigner, and Herrick hurried out of the  room and down the stairs. Not till he was in the train did he remember that he  should have been wise enough to have secured the pistol as evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he may not be guilty after all,&rdquo; said Jim hopefully. His heart told him that he  was wrong. The circumstantial evidence was too strong.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    The Secret Writings</b></h2>
  <p>Dr.  Jim could not conceal from himself, that he was rather jumping at conclusions  with regard to the guilt of Joyce. The man had deliberately lied about his  visit to Frith, and had not slept at the Hull Hotel, as he had stated. Herrick  could not account for Robin&rsquo;s movements on the night of the twenty-fourth of  July, and on that same night Colonel Carr had met with his death. Then again,  Robin was connected indirectly with Carr through his mother, although there was  nothing to show the relations which had existed between the Colonel and Mrs.  Joyce. Finally Joyce was in possession of an old-fashioned weapon, firing a  round bullet of the antiquated sort. And Carr had been killed with just such a  bullet. This was all the evidence Jim could find which was likely to inculpate  Robin.</p>
  <p>On  the other hand there was no reason why Joyce should not be able to defend  himself. He certainly could not explain away the lies he had told Herrick about  the visit to the solicitors, and the pretended income, but he might be able to  account for his doings on the night of the twenty-fourth, and for the  possession of the pistol. After all he had shown no hesitation in accepting  Herrick&rsquo;s invitation to Saxham. If he were guilty he would be afraid to venture  there lest he should be met by some one who had seen him on the night of the  murder in the vicinity of &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; His determination to come to Saxham  looked like innocence, and Jim granted as much.</p>
  <p>The  most important link to be discovered in the chain of evidence, was the way in  which Robin (if guilty) had come to Saxham. Owing to the presence of Herrick at  Southberry, he would not have risked going by that line, seeing that he had to  change at the junction. The other line branched off from the main trunk, before  it reached Southberry and touched at Heathcroft, six miles from Saxham. Herrick  made up his mind that when he got to Saxham, he would go to Heathcroft to make  inquiries. If he could prove that Robin had alighted at that station, there  would no longer be any doubt of his guilt. No doubt Joyce, if he had come to  Heathcroft, had disguised himself, but he might not think of increasing his  stature by artificial means, and he was so exceptionally small that even the  most casual observer would remark upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall give him every opportunity of defending himself,&rdquo; thought Herrick. &ldquo;If I  find that he came to Heathcroft, he will have to account to me for his doings.  I must know the truth, or else part with him as a friend for ever.&rdquo; Then the  doctor thought with a qualm, that if he did learn the truth, the parting might  be more complete than he imagined. If Joyce were indeed guilty he would find  himself in a dilemma, as to whether he should hold his tongue or denounce the  man he had been so friendly with. It would not be a pleasant position.</p>
  <p>It  was when he was in the train that Herrick thought of this. With Stephen he was  returning to Saxham, and the two had provided themselves with newspapers and  magazines to beguile the tedium of the journey. For some time Herrick had been  concealed behind the Daily Telegraph, pretending to read. But in reality he had  been thinking over the case of Robin Joyce. Marsh was in good spirits, and  inclined to talk. So Dr. Jim yielded, for after all his thoughts were anything  but pleasant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are glad to go back to Saxham Stephen?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Marsh-Carr  (as he must now be called) nodded and smiled. &ldquo;Very glad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I find a  little of London goes a long way. I want to be in my own country amongst my own  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have a large circle soon Stephen. When you are settled at &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; all  the county will call. They will be delighted that in that beautiful house,  there will be some one they can know. You must make the Carr family once more  important in the county.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid I am not ambitious,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;my nature is a somewhat retiring  one, I fancy. I shall attend to my estates and write poetry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no desire to go into parliament?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the least. Books and friends; those are what I want. Of course I shall try and  do good in my own way, but I do not wish to take part in public life. There  will be plenty for me to do in a small way Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you are right,&rdquo; responded Herrick soberly, &ldquo;and you have had such a  wretched life hitherto, that it is but fair you should have a few years of  enjoyment. But you must travel for a time before you settle down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be pleased to. But of course as you know I shall not be able to leave  Saxham until the end of a year. I want to be certain of holding the property. I  wonder why my uncle left instructions that a new vault should be built, and  should be visited; and why for a year?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot understand myself,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;your uncle was a man of mystery.  But I have learned something of his past Stephen,&rdquo; and Herrick related his  meeting with Don Manuel and what he had been told about the doings of Carr in  South America.</p>
  <p>Stephen  looked uneasy and grave. &ldquo;I hope this money was obtained in quite a proper way,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;otherwise I should be afraid to use it. If it is what the gipsies  call red money&mdash;that is obtained by bloodshed, I would rather give it up. For  it can bring only a curse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think you need trouble on that score,&rdquo; replied Jim with a shrug. &ldquo;Heaven  knows that Carr was not scrupulous, but with regard to the fortune he brought  home, if it was taken from some treasure chamber of those Inca monarchs, the  spoil was legitimate enough. If I came across such a treasure I should have no  hesitation in taking it. The worst feature of the expedition was the leaving of  Santiago with the Indians, but as he is still alive, no harm has been done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I ought to give him some money?&rdquo; asked Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; was Herrick&rsquo;s emphatic reply. &ldquo;In the first place we do not know that the  story is true; in the second place I am convinced that the Mexican is a  scoundrel, and in the third, it is not your place to impoverish yourself for  the sake of other people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could find out the story of my uncle&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  Don Manuel is probably coming down to Saxham on a sentimental pilgrimage to see  the grave of a man he detested. He may tell you all he knows if you question  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  he will tell me a very pretty story,&rdquo; said Stephen dryly, &ldquo;but will it be true.  I do not want the Arabian Nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I should not care to take Santiago&rsquo;s word myself,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;still amongst his lies there may be some grain of truth. But where the  real truth will be found is in that secret writing which Bess gave to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess!&rdquo;  cried Marsh-Carr with a smile.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim coloured and apologised. &ldquo;A slip of the tongue,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hear you talk  of Bess so frequently that I am apt to fall into the same habit. But this  writing,&rdquo; he added hurriedly to avoid further explanation, &ldquo;as you know, we can  make nothing of it. Yet if we could read it, something tangible might be  discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really do not see why I should trouble at all about my uncle&rsquo;s villainies,&rdquo;  said Marsh-Carr rather impatiently, &ldquo;the estate is mine now, and I want to  enjoy it without worrying my conscience. Of course I do worry. As to the  writing, there is a cryptogram in the &lsquo;Telegraph&rsquo; which resembles the paper you  showed me. Here it is, in the Agony Column.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  took the newspaper, and looked at the paragraph indicated by Stephen. The  jumble of letters did indeed resemble that on the piece of Chinese paper. In  print the cryptogram was as follows:&mdash;Eqhrbn: Gxcd: Ozqj: Bnqmdq; 15, Nbsnadq:  Rodzj: Sn: Aktd: Bknsgdr: Vghsd: Gzs: Fknur: Rgndr: Dzqqr: Lnmdx.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim read this over twice, then took out the Chinese paper and compared the two  cryptograms. &ldquo;I believe the secret writing is the same,&rdquo; he said with some  excitement. &ldquo;See Stephen, in each there are figures, and in each the figures  are the same. Fifteen. I believe that this was inserted by some one who knew  Carr. It may be from Frisco communicating with a third person about the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough;&rdquo; replied Stephen, &ldquo;yet it might merely be a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the figures were not the same I might think so. But that in both there should  be fifteen is strange, to say the least of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  thirty is the key to the cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be so,&rdquo; said Herrick studying the &lsquo;Telegraph,&rsquo; &ldquo;but I am hanged if I can  see how to apply it. Oh, that Edgar Allen Poe were at hand! He could unravel  any cipher in ten minutes. The man had a marvellous gift in that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  once read a book on cipher-writing,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr after a pause, &ldquo;it said  that to unravel a line of secret writing, it was best to search for the  character that represented &lsquo;E,&rsquo; since that letter is used more frequently than  any other in the English language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you lay a finger on the weak spot,&rdquo; said Jim quickly, &ldquo;This cipher may be  written in Spanish for all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  in Spanish particularly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  if it applied to Colonel Carr and his doings, that is the most likely language  he would use, other than English. He was mostly in Mexico and Peru, if Manuel  is to be believed, and there Spanish is spoken as you know, Stephen. This may  be a writing in that tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  Herrick, you know Spanish, so you might,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I might,&rdquo; interrupted Dr. Jim sarcastically, &ldquo;if I were acquainted with secret  writing. But this is Dutch to me and worse, for I have some knowledge of Dutch  and absolutely none of this. Let us try your &ldquo;E&rdquo; idea Stephen, and see what we  make of it. The Chinese paper cipher is the shortest. We will count the letter  that is most frequent, and call it &lsquo;E.&rsquo; Something may come of the attempt.&rdquo;  Herrick counted and Stephen checked his reckoning. &ldquo;Four &lsquo;D&rsquo;s,&rsquo;&ldquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Five  &lsquo;K&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Three &lsquo;Z&rsquo;s:&rsquo; and Three &lsquo;R&rsquo;s.&rsquo;. Humph! Seems to me that &lsquo;K&rsquo; is the  predominating letter, and once it comes &lsquo;K.K&rsquo; which might stand for double &lsquo;E.&rsquo;  Well we&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;E.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  here are two &lsquo;R&rsquo;s&rsquo; together,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;That might stand also for double &lsquo;E.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  But you forget that there are five &lsquo;K&rsquo;s&rsquo; to three &lsquo;R&rsquo;s.&rsquo; We agreed to call the  letter which predominated &lsquo;E.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right. Fire away, and see what you make of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the next hour the two men with pencil and paper, did their best to extort sense  from the jumble of letters on this basis. At the end of the time they were both  out of temper, and had not succeeded in obtaining even one reasonable word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it!&rdquo; said Stephen throwing his paper to the other end of the carriage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  believe it makes sense at all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  replied Herrick wiping his face, &ldquo;it is sure to make sense. All ciphers do. And  I daresay this is an easy one. The easiest are usually the most difficult to  unravel. That is an epigram Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  had taken up the paper again and was studying the cipher. &ldquo;Fifteen I.T.K.X.&rdquo; he  said musingly, &ldquo;the figures and the letters run together here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they do in the Telegraph cipher,&rdquo; said Herrick, and read out, &ldquo;Fifteen  N.b.s.n.a.d.q. What of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it might be a date,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr apologetically.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim laughed. &ldquo;It might&mdash;on the other hand it might not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget the figures are concealed the same as the letters,&rdquo; said Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do we know that,&rdquo; retorted the doctor. &ldquo;Fifteen may be the key to the cipher.  You may count one, or count five: or add the two together and count six: or  subtract the two and count four. Then again you may have to count from left to  right or right to left. And after all the cipher may be in Spanish, or English  or in the Indian tongue for the matter of that; Carr was mixed up with the  South American Indians you know. We&rsquo;ll never discover it Stephen. But I tell you  what,&rdquo; added Jim struck with a sudden thought, &ldquo;this Mexican devil may know  what it means!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case he must have put it in the paper,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;he knew Carr and  the cipher was used by Carr. What is more likely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  frowned. &ldquo;There is some conspiracy on,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I do not see what it all  means. We must learn what these ciphers mean Stephen. It is a serious matter.  Do you think the key might be found amongst your uncle&rsquo;s papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  left no papers,&rdquo; replied Stephen, &ldquo;I have looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim shook his head. The thing was beyond him. He replaced the Chinese paper in  his pocket-book, and cut out the notice in the Telegraph. &ldquo;I say Stephen,&rdquo; he  said while thus employed, &ldquo;did your uncle take in the &lsquo;Daily Telegraph?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He used to pass it on to Bess when he had done with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you see!&rdquo; cried Jim triumphantly, &ldquo;another link. This cipher has been put in  the newspaper your uncle usually read. Oh, be sure it has to do with his  business&mdash;perhaps with his death. Well, we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing  more was said about the matter, as the two were a trifle exhausted by their  efforts to read the ciphers. When the train arrived at the Beorminster Station,  they were met by Frank Endicotte, who came towards them in a state of  excitement usually foreign to his nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad  to see you fellows back,&rdquo; said Frank shaking hands. &ldquo;Bess got the wire you sent  Steve, and insisted that I should meet you here. I have brought a cart,  borrowed it from Pentland Corn. He wanted his groom to come too, but there was  not enough room for four. Got much luggage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Only a couple of portmanteaux. The heavy baggage is coming on by a goods train,&rdquo;  laughed Stephen. &ldquo;I have been buying up the whole of London! I say Frank how  are the Biffs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Frank as they put up the portmanteaux on the dog-cart. &ldquo;Up you  get Steve. Will you drive, or you Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied the doctor grimly, &ldquo;you have undertaken the responsibility of that  horse. If I kill it, Corn will blame me. Drive yourself. I&rsquo;ll stick on behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No,&rdquo; protested Stephen, &ldquo;get up in front Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. The Lord of the Manor of Saxham must have the first place.&rdquo; He swung  himself up to the back seat, &ldquo;send her along Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes they were rattling home along the Southberry road, and Frank was  telling Marsh-Carr all that had been done at &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; It seemed that Bess  and Ida had engaged a moderate staff of servants, the most indispensable that  is; as they left the choice of the others to Stephen. The house had been cleaned  from top to bottom, food had been got in, and a good dinner awaited the  travellers. &ldquo;Bess, Ida and I are coming over later on,&rdquo; explained Frank, &ldquo;we  want to hear of your adventures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am afraid we have none,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr with a laugh.</p>
  <p>Herrick  said nothing. He was thinking, if he told all he had discovered and talked  about his suspicions, he might create a sensation. However the time was not yet  ripe to take the Biffs into his confidence. Bess was the one he would consult  if necessary.</p>
  <p>Frank  deposited them at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; and then drove away to the Rectory to restore the  cart. Stephen found the house in admirable order, and a good dinner waiting for  him and his friend in the dining-room. Herrick felt rather a qualm as he sat  down, remembering that ghastly meal which had waited for the dead Colonel.  However he was too healthy a man to give way to such morbid fancies, and made  an excellent meal. Afterwards he and Stephen had coffee in the library, and as  the evening was chilly, Marsh-Carr ordered a fire to be lighted. In a state of  comfort they sat in comfortable arm-chairs smoking luxuriously. Hitherto  Stephen had smoked only cigarettes, but lately, by the advice of his doctor,  had begun pipe-smoking. After a time, he found it much more satisfying than the  cigarettes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose they will be here soon,&rdquo; said Stephen glancing at his watch.</p>
  <p>Herrick  grunted. Truth to tell he felt so comfortable that he did not want to be  disturbed. There was a good deal of the bachelor about Herrick. However, just  as Stephen replaced his watch, one of the new footmen announced the Biffs; not  by that name certainly. &ldquo;Mr. Endicotte, the Misses Endicotte,&rdquo; said Phillips.  He had been in the service of the Bishop of Beorminster and prided himself on  knowing the manners of good society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Bess when the first greeting was over and they were all seated comfortably  round the fire, &ldquo;what do you think of the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is splendid,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;I have to thank you and Ida heartily. But I won&rsquo;t  stop short at thanks.&rdquo; And then the presents were produced. They took the form  of jewellery and both the girls were delighted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  lovely! lovely,&rdquo; cried Ida looking at the emerald ring which Stephen had placed  on her finger. &ldquo;I do so love jewels!&rdquo; As she spoke she caught the eye of  Marsh-Carr fixed significantly on her, and blushed. She knew very well why the  ring had been bought although Stephen had not placed it on the engagement  finger.</p>
  <p>Herrick  did not notice this by-play which might have enlightened him. He was busy  talking to Frank about the new gun which he was examining. Frank had always  wanted a gun and was in the seventh heaven of delight. Bess also was pleased  with a bangle. But she would rather have had books. However she did not say so,  as she did not wish Stephen to think she was disappointed. &ldquo;I have something  for Flo and Sidney, but those can wait,&rdquo; said Stephen.</p>
  <p>Frank  was so taken up with his new gun, that Stephen devoted himself to Ida. Herrick  was thus thrown into the society of Bess, who asked him if he had solved the  cryptogram. &ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and here is another of the same sort  which appeared in the Telegraph of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  glanced at it with interest. &ldquo;I have seen something like that before,&rdquo; she said  thoughtfully, &ldquo;several times a cipher like that has been in the Telegraph. I  never thought it had anything to do with the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure it had,&rdquo; said Herrick eagerly. &ldquo;Have you the cuttings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I did not think it was necessary to keep them. They all appeared within the  last year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo;  said Herrick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for a file of the newspaper. But this cipher? I wish  we could read it. I believe it has some connection with Carr&rsquo;s death, or at all  events with the secret of his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; said Bess looking at the cutting and the scrap of Chinese  paper, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  unless what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was talking to Frisco one day,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;he had been drinking rum as usual  and was rather drunk. The Colonel had sent him to the post-office for the  letters and he held one in his hand the only one which had come that day. It  was about three months ago, shortly after I picked up the piece of Chinese  paper. This one,&rdquo; she shook it at Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand. Go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  noticed that the envelope of the letter Frisco carried was of the same paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  cried the doctor, &ldquo;this is interesting. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  was shaking the letter&mdash;waving it over his head, and singing. I stopped to tell  him he ought to be ashamed of himself being in such a state, when he knew  perfectly well how to behave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  minute,&rdquo; interrupted Herrick remembering what Frith had said &ldquo;was this Frisco a  gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  and No,&rdquo; replied Bess. &ldquo;He had a refined way of speaking in spite of the  frightful American slang he used. At times when he was quite sober he would  speak to me in the most refined way. At other times he was just awful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  large fat man was he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Immensely stout: but his face was rather handsome. He was about the same age as  the Colonel. There was something attractive about Frisco,&rdquo; finished Bess with a  sigh, &ldquo;he was his own worst enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  about this letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was waving it and singing. I met him in the pine wood, where I had been to look  for Sidney. I told him that he might lose it since he was so drunk. He laughed  and said no one could read it. He knew the letter by the envelope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said Herrick, &ldquo;by the Chinese paper! It is noticeable. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  asked him what he meant? He laughed again, and went away singing, &lsquo;Move on One!  Move on One!&rsquo; I took no notice of the words at the time, but as he had a cipher  letter in his hand I have often wondered if he applied the words to the cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Move  one on!&rdquo; repeated Herrick excitedly, and glanced at the Chinese paper cipher. &ldquo;Humph!  Stephen thought that fifteen I.T.K.X. might be a date. If this cipher has to do  with the murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  date!&rdquo; interrupted Bess eagerly, &ldquo;well! Colonel Carr was murdered in July. Dr.  Jim, in the word July there are four letters, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean. And here are four letters I.T.K.X.: also the number fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Move  on one,&rdquo; said Bess repeating the cry of Frisco, &ldquo;that is take the next figures  to one and five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two,  six,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;by heaven that must mean the twenty-sixth! Move on one of  these four letters. I stands or J, T, for U, K for L, and X in place of Y.  July,&rdquo; cried Herrick dashing down the pen. &ldquo;Here is the solution of the  cryptogram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  twenty-sixth of July,&rdquo; repeated Bess, &ldquo;and the Colonel was murdered on the  twenty-fourth. I do not see the connection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have not worked out the whole cipher yet,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;here, take a pen and  write down the alphabet.&rdquo; Bess did this as rapidly as possible as she saw what  the doctor meant. &ldquo;Now place A under B, B under C, and so on to the end of the  alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess  did this also, &lsquo;I can put Z under no letter,&rsquo; she said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  you can. Z goes under A, I have heard of this cipher. It is written with  misleading letters. You simply take the next letter for the one that is down.  Come, we will apply the result to these ciphers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  is what they got. In the Chinese paper cipher:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  last warning. Till 26 July. Then death. Unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  in the printed cipher of the &lsquo;Daily Telegraph&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco.  Hyde Park Corner. 26 October. Speak to blue clothes, white hat, gloves, shoes.  Carr&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    Settling Down</b></h2>
  <p>The  cipher was so simple that Herrick wondered that he had not solved it before. It  merely consisted of the alphabet arranged in two lines as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">A.B.C.D.E.F.G.H.I.J.K.L.M.N.O.P.Q.R.S.T.U.V.W.X.Y.Z.  Z,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,</p>
  <p>The  cipher was written by using the second line as though it were the first. All  that had to be done was to write out the alphabet as above, and use the first  line in place of the second. Nothing could be more ingenious, or&mdash;when it was  known&mdash;more simple. But for all that, Herrick would not have found the key, had  he not recollected Stephen&rsquo;s remark that the number fifteen might be a date,  and had not Bess related Frisco&rsquo;s apparently meaningless words.</p>
  <p>However  here was the reading of the riddle. Colonel Carr had been warned to do a  certain thing, and was threatened with death if he did not do it. He was given  up to the twenty-sixth of July, but the punishment, vengeance, or whatever it  was had been executed on the twenty-fourth. Jim could see no reason for this  anticipation of the cipher letter.</p>
  <p>As  to the cryptogram in the agony Column of the &ldquo;Daily Telegraph,&rdquo; it would seem  that someone knew that Frisco was in London and wished to see him about Carr&rsquo;s  money. This rather bore out Herrick&rsquo;s belief that there was a conspiracy in  progress to rob Stephen of his inherited wealth. Was Captain Manuel striking in  the dark? Or had Robin Joyce anything to do with the matter? Herrick asked  himself these questions, but he did not seek an answer from Bess. Until he was  absolutely sure of Robin&rsquo;s guilt he did not wish to say a word. And if he told  Bess about Santiago, he would have to reveal what Joyce had&mdash;presumably&mdash;done.  At all events the mere mention of Santiago&rsquo;s name and where he met him would invite  questions regarding Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were you Dr. Jim,&rdquo; said Bess the next day, when they met to talk over their  discovery, &ldquo;I should go up to London and wait at Hyde Park Corner. It will be  easy for you to see a person dressed as noticeably as the man who put in the  cipher intends to be. I should think a navy blue serge with white hat, gloves,  and boots would attract attention. You can then see if the person meets Frisco,  and, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  give Frisco in charge,&rdquo; finished Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Miss Endicotte decisively, &ldquo;I should not do that. At present public  opinion and circumstantial evidence is so much against Frisco, that he would  not have a fair trial. If he did murder Colonel Carr, which I don&rsquo;t  believe&mdash;you can prove it by watching him. See where he and the man who meets  him are going, follow on, and be guided by circumstances how to act. Have you  any idea who put this in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim suspected Don Manuel, but he did not think it wise to say so. &ldquo;I really  cannot be sure,&rdquo; said he shirking the question, &ldquo;of course we are all in the  dark about this business. Again I notice that no time is mentioned in the  cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I can understand that,&rdquo; replied Bess producing a slip of paper from her pocket,  &ldquo;when I got home last night I looked through the file of the &lsquo;Daily Telegraph&rsquo;  given to me by Colonel Carr. I thought there might be a third cipher. See, here  it is. It appeared about the beginning of August.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked at the third cipher. It was worded exactly the same as the one that had  appeared in the newspaper at the later date, save that in it the hour of three  o&rsquo;clock was mentioned as the time of meeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;I wonder if Frisco obeyed this first request?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure he did,&rdquo; answered Bess readily, &ldquo;if he had not, the time of meeting  would be put into the second. No, Dr. Jim. It is because the person who wants  to meet Frisco met him the first time, that he has omitted the hour. He knows  that Frisco will be there at three o&rsquo;clock if he comes at all. You go up and  see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is now the twenty-second,&rdquo; said Herrick after a moment. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go up.  But I should say nothing of all this to Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  to anyone,&rdquo; replied Bess warmly, &ldquo;let us work out the thing ourselves and put  an end to the conspiracy. I am sure it is one,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;for you see Carr&rsquo;s  money is mentioned. I hope poor Stephen will not be murdered next!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope not,&rdquo; said Herrick rather gloomily. He was recalling what Mrs. Marsh had  said to him about Frisco and of a possible danger to her step-son. &ldquo;At all  events I shall look after him carefully. But all this seems to show that Frisco  is not the good man you thought him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does look bad for Frisco,&rdquo; admitted Bess dejectedly, &ldquo;still he may be able to  explain if he can only summon up courage to take his trial. I should not like  to be mistaken in Frisco. There was something I liked about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll go up to town and watch,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;By the way, my friend Joyce is  coming down here next week to stay for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so glad,&rdquo; said Bess eagerly. &ldquo;I saw only a glimpse of him last time. He is  an author, and we shall have so much to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was rather annoyed by her enthusiasm. He did not like the idea of Joyce whom he  suspected, being too great a friend of this girl&rsquo;s. Yet when he came to think  over the matter, his annoyance was ridiculous. He was jealous of Stephen with  Ida, and now irritated at the prospect of Bess getting on well with Robin. &ldquo;I  do not love the two of them,&rdquo; said Herrick to himself with a vexed laugh, &ldquo;yet  I like both. At all events if Joyce does come down, I&rsquo;ll keep them apart as  much as possible. I must know the truth about Joyce before I let him again into  my circle of friends. In any case he is a liar if no worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was an unsatisfactory frame of mind in which to renew a friendship. But Jim had  no such intention. Finding that Robin had told him two deliberate falsehoods,  he made up his mind that all was at an end between them. Herrick had a very  high opinion of the sacredness of friendship, and was in addition as Dr.  Johnson said &ldquo;a good hater.&rdquo; He either liked a man greatly or disliked him  immensely. With the utmost calmness he went to work to get his quondam friend  by his side in order to learn the truth. If Joyce had murdered Carr, if he was  mixed up with Frisco and Don Manuel in a conspiracy against Stephen, there was  no punishment he did not deserve. But although Herrick was hard, he was also  just. Every chance would be given to Joyce to prove his innocence. And if in  the end he proved to be guilty, Jim knew in his heart of hearts that he would  let him go free. Much as he might deserve the punishment of the law, Jim felt  that for the sake of their old friendship he could not be the one to hand him  over to Justice.</p>
  <p>It  must not be thought that Herrick took his discovery calmly. He suffered greatly  on learning the worthlessness of the man he had so trusted. He had saved Robin&rsquo;s  life by nursing him through a dangerous illness, and had been attracted by his  ambition to become a great novelist. He had also tried to make a man of him by  strengthening his will and mending his nerves, being sorry for the tortured  creature. But since the man was so inherently bad Herrick sternly cut himself  off from him. He waited only to be certain of the worst to cast Robin out of  his life. But until he was certain, he gave him the benefit of the doubt. It  was a painful position, but Jim set his teeth and stuck to it.</p>
  <p>The  journey to town was a complete failure. Herrick watched at Hyde Park Corner all  day, and thereby incurred the unjust suspicions of the police. But he saw  neither the eccentrically-dressed individual, who had described himself in the  cipher, nor the ex-sailor, whom he hoped to recognise by his monstrous  stoutness, and if chance offered, by the scar on his forehead. Neither one of  them came to the rendezvous, so Dr. Jim returned to Saxham a sadder but not a  wiser man. Bess consoled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  must have got some suspicion that they were being watched,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sooner  or later another of these ciphers will appear in the paper and you will have a  chance of catching them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim disbelieving, &ldquo;if they are suspicious, they will make some other  arrangements for you see, they must have guessed that in some way I had solved  the cipher. It is all darkness and mystery,&rdquo; said Herrick vexedly. &ldquo;For the  time being at all events I intend to put it out of my head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  he did and with considerable success. There was much to do at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; and  with its new master. The estate had to be put in order, more servants had to be  engaged with the assistance of Ida, and the walls and fences had to be put up  again. Also the new vault was rapidly approaching completion and Stephen hoped  to have his uncle&rsquo;s body removed into it before Christmas. In the meantime he  did not neglect to go monthly and even weekly to the family sepulchre to see  that all was safe. As yet nothing had been disturbed. Stephen began to think  that the necessity of protecting the body of the wicked Colonel was all  moonshine. But Herrick knew better. He still believed in the existence of a  conspiracy, and kept his eyes and ears open. It was well in these days, that  Marsh-Carr had so watchful a guardian.</p>
  <p>Joyce  arrived at the Carr Arms with Don Manuel, and the two made themselves very  agreeable, Herrick did not approve of their calling at Biffstead, but he either  had to quarrel openly with them, or tolerate the acquaintance, as a row would  have spoilt his plans and perhaps (if his suspicions were correct) exposed  Stephen to danger. Herrick held his peace and made himself agreeable. Indeed  neither Robin nor Santiago had any idea that he was their enemy, so well did he  play his part. Dr. Jim hated to wear a mask, but much could be done by guile,  and nothing at all could be gained by force, so he consented to do violence to  his usually open nature.</p>
  <p>Meantime  he devoted himself to educating Stephen out-of-doors. Horses were bought and  the two rode daily. Herrick taught Stephen how to swim, to fence, to box, and  to golf. Indeed the Biffs also took to golfing, for Herrick obtained permission  to lay out part of the heath as a links. Then the young men and maidens of the  county came to play and Saxham became quite busy. Even the Beorminster people  contrived to learn the game, and the clerical society there curates, dean, and even  the canons played with zest and judgment. Herrick as the original starter of  the game was voted an acquisition to the county and made much of. He and  Stephen were asked everywhere and as the weeks went by Marsh-Carr became a  different man. He lost his air of shyness, became straighter in the back, spent  less time poring over books and more in the open air. Needless to say he was  warmly attached to the doctor, and it was now &ldquo;Jim and Steve&rdquo; between them. And  the Biffs approved of the friendship.</p>
  <p>Since  he had lost the friendship of Robin, Herrick paid more attention to Ida. He  never paused to analyse his feelings towards her, and foolishly believed that  he loved her. She knew better and smiled at the attentions paid to her by Dr.  Jim. Herrick was no wiser than his neighbours when it came to a question of  sex, and because he admired Ida thought that she was the only woman in the  world for him. He had never been in love before and mistook the affection he  felt for a beautiful and kind-hearted girl for the genuine passion spoken of by  poets. If it was, Jim did not think it was so bad as they made out. He had not  himself felt the wound, so he jested at the scars of others. Ida was amused at  the dear, large, stupid creature and played the r&ocirc;le of Omphale to his Hercules,  but she knew quite well when to pull him up. When his attentions became too  pressing she did so in her own quiet way. Strange to say Stephen did not notice  his friend&rsquo;s folly, or if he did, he made no remark.</p>
  <p>One  day the Biffs took afternoon tea in the pine-wood round the mansion. Stephen  and Herrick were there, the Biffs themselves, and Don Manuel with Robin. The  latter was much excited and chattered on in a merry way which amused everyone  save Herrick, who looked at him rather sourly. Bess was too attentive to Joyce  to please the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  and sit by me Mr. Joyce,&rdquo; she said making a place beside her when they sat on  the grass for tea. &ldquo;You shall feed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  what a privilege!&rdquo; put in Santiago and Bess frowned. She did not like the  Spaniard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am so hungry,&rdquo; announced Robin. &ldquo;Jim, you sit over there by Miss Endicotte, and  Mr. Marsh can sit beside Miss Flo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  placed himself beside Sidney who at once got up and walked away to the other  side of the circle. Sidney hated the Mexican, and openly said as much. There  was a bad feeling about him, said Sidney, and he sometimes shivered and turned  pale when in Don Manuel&rsquo;s company. The Mexican did not seem annoyed. He  understood Sidney better than did the others. Or he said he did and explained his  reasons to Herrick. The doctor laughed at him when these were explained and  declined to argue such nonsense. At this Don Manuel smiled but did not take  offence. He had his own reasons for remaining on friendly terms with Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  pleasant it is here,&rdquo; said Bess looking at the green boughs overhead, &ldquo;so  solitary! One would think we were miles away in the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  we are,&rdquo; said Robin amidst a general laugh. &ldquo;How many more miles do you want us  to be Miss Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl laughed herself. &ldquo;You know what I mean perfectly well. Of course nothing  could be more absolutely rural than this, but Saxham is the same. What I meant  to say is that no human habitation can be seen hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  The tower has disappeared;&rdquo; said Stephen gravely, &ldquo;it used to be visible from  here. Just over those two pines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  chimed in. &ldquo;Ah, that is where my poor friend met with his death! I wonder you  are not afraid to live in the house, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should he be afraid?&rdquo; put in Ida rather indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ghosts are not pleasant  things,&rdquo; said the Mexican with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say that the wicked Colonel walks?&rdquo; asked Robin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are talking nonsense,&rdquo; said Herrick who was beginning to find the conversation  disagreeable, and in the presence of Stephen, not in good taste. &ldquo;There are no  such things as ghosts, and the room in which Colonel Carr died has been  demolished. If you talk like this the ignorant country people will be inventing  some legend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sidney  who had been listening to all this very quietly looking first at one speaker  and then at the other, let his grave blue eyes fall upon the doctor. &ldquo;How do  you know that there are no such things as ghosts?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;There are. I  have seen them myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everybody  shuddered, and Santiago looked at the boy with a curious smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  have you seen a ghost?&rdquo; asked Herrick quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this wood, in the village churchyard; all kinds of shapes and forms. They do  not frighten me. Only bad people are frightened. You would be,&rdquo; he added  looking at Santiago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  responded that gentleman, &ldquo;you are quite right. I am glad I have not your gift  of seeing things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  laugh at it I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, I know too much about it to laugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  tower,&rdquo; said Sidney suddenly turning to Stephen. &ldquo;I know you can see it from  here. Often and often I have sat in the darkness under yonder tree and watched  the shapes in the light that streamed from the windows. All had shapes&mdash;all  wicked spirits,&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;The Colonel was so wicked that nothing good  would come near him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ida  thought that this conversation had gone quite far enough, and when Herrick  glanced at her interposed, &ldquo;Sidney you are talking nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy got up in a kind of cold rage. &ldquo;Always nonsense,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because you are  all blind and stupid.&rdquo; And he walked away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he mad?&rdquo; said Robin, his mouth open.</p>
  <p>Bess  was about to contradict him rather indignantly when Santiago interposed. &ldquo;He is  far from mad,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but he has a wonderful gift, denied to us who are of  common clay. Of course the doctor does not believe in this. He is a  materialist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am not,&rdquo; replied Herrick rather nettled, &ldquo;but I do not believe in things that  cannot be proved by the senses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said you were a materialist,&rdquo; replied Santiago, and refused to speak further.  It was on another occasion and when no one was present that Jim renewed the  conversation.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the doctor was angry at the attention paid by Joyce to Bess. The little man had  now known her some weeks and had taken a violent fancy to her. He haunted her  like a shadow, and she did not seem to dislike it. Herrick did, but as he had  no right to interfere he was obliged to look on in silence. More than ever he  regretted his folly in inducing Robin to come down to Saxham. Not for all the  schemes in the world would he have Bess Endicotte lose her heart to Joyce.  Until this day such an idea had never entered his head: but now he saw more  clearly. Bess was distinctly pleased with Robin&rsquo;s attentions. Should she really  get to care for him (and Robin was attractive when he liked) Herrick knew that  he would be forced to interfere. Even if he had to denounce Joyce to the law,  he would put an end to such a possibility. He could not even see the two  together without annoyance, and rose abruptly to walk away.</p>
  <p>As  he went in the direction of the heath, and by almost the same path as he and  Joyce had come on that terrible night, he heard a light step behind and turned  to see Ida. She looked more lovely than ever, for having followed him rapidly  her face was somewhat flushed. Just as he was on the edge of the heath she laid  her hand on his arm. A thrill ran through the strong frame of the doctor. He  thought this was love. But indeed any man would have felt as much had Ida  Endicotte touched him.</p>
  <p>She  was beautiful, and moreover had a magnetic attraction, which drew the most  sullen under her charm. How much more then Herrick, who frankly acknowledged  that she was&mdash;what he rather obviously called&mdash;an angel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  follow him Dr. Jim,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;Believe me, he is better alone. I  know his moods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you talking of Sidney?&rdquo; asked Herrick in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I thought you followed him,&rdquo; she cast a look across the moor where the slender  figure of the boy could just be seen disappearing on the horizon. &ldquo;How fast he  walks. Here, there, and everywhere, like a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not follow Sidney,&rdquo; said Herrick gravely, &ldquo;but I see that I must take the  boy in hand. His brain is too excitable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think he is mad,&rdquo; said Ida turning pale. &ldquo;I assure you that he is very  shrewd in many ways, and looks after himself thoroughly. But he was always a  delicate boy with strange habits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a poet,&rdquo; said Herrick decisively, &ldquo;that is why he &lsquo;sees things&rsquo; as he puts  it. His imagination and brain power are too strong for his weak body. If he  went in for exercise and took pleasure in sport he would soon lose these  unhealthy phantasies. They would pass away in verse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he ought to go to a public school?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. The boy is too peculiar; too rare a spirit. The other boys would not  understand him, and he would be as unhappy as Coleridge and Lamb. No! He needs  looking after privately. I like Corn, but he does not understand the boy. Let  me see to it, Miss Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  faltered Ida, &ldquo;I should be very glad. We are all very fond of Sidney; but he is  peculiar as you say. And you have done wonders with Stephen. I can see that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have only induced him to take an interest in healthy things,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;the  rest follows as a matter of course. But I am glad you are pleased. You know  that I am anxious to please you&mdash;Ida.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Endicotte blushed and drew back with a look of surprise. Then she seemed to  make up her mind, and instead of leaving him as seemed to be her original  intention, she walked on beside him towards the moor. &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she said  simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not angry at my calling you Ida?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I call you Dr. Jim. You seem to be a kind of brother to us all. I am  glad that Stephen has so good a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I do not want to be a brother,&rdquo; said Jim in a deep voice, trying to take her  hand. &ldquo;You must understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew her hand away quietly. &ldquo;I do understand,&rdquo;  she said in low tones. &ldquo;But I beg of you not to go on talking like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Ida&mdash;you must have seen. I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  You do not love me, Dr. Jim,&rdquo; she laid her hand on his shoulder, and looked  gravely into his flushed face. &ldquo;If you had really been in love with me, I  should not have waited. You saw how I turned to go and changed my mind. That  was because I wish to put matters right between us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand Ida.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you don&rsquo;t and that is why you speak. If you were in love with me Dr. Jim,  you would know that I am in love with someone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  love with someone else? Not&mdash;not Stephen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Stephen, and he loves me. Oh, you look astonished. I said you did not know what  love meant. Had you really felt the passion you believe you feel, you would  have guessed. You like me because we get on well together; because you think I  am pretty.&rdquo; Here she blushed and laughed. &ldquo;I am talking foolishly I fear. But  what I mean to say is that it is only Ida Endicotte you love, not the real  woman. If you did; if your heart was filled with a true passion, you would have  seen that Stephen and I understand one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he asked you to&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no need that he should ask,&rdquo; replied Ida. &ldquo;I am quite content to wait until  he speaks, because I know. And he knows that I know. That is true love Dr. Jim.  We do not need mere words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  looked down rather shamefaced. Ida took him by the arm and forced him to face  her. &ldquo;Confess,&rdquo; she said with a laughing face, &ldquo;you are not quite brokenhearted  that I will not marry you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied Jim rather astonished at the calmness of his feelings. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I  feel suicidal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ida  shrugged her queenly shoulders. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; was her remark, &ldquo;what I said was  true. You do not love the true woman. No, Dr. Jim,&rdquo; she put her hand into his, &ldquo;I  am glad we have had this talk. The moon can never be yours, so do not cry for  it. When you are really and truly in love, you will feel very different to what  you do now I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  more himself, laughed. &ldquo;Where did you learn all this lore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother  Nature taught it to me,&rdquo; laughed Ida. &ldquo;I needed no teaching. I knew years ago  that Stephen and I were born for one another. Yet we have always been merely  friends; nothing more. He has not even said to me as much as you have done. We  understand, both of us. That is why I have refused so many good offers. Other  people could not understand, not even Bess, clever as she is, but I knew, so  did Stephen. It is for this reason I refuse you Dr. Jim. Not that you have  asked me,&rdquo; she finished laughing.</p>
  <p>Jim  laughed too, for he was now once more at his ease with her. &ldquo;I have been making  a fool of myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you are a dear good woman to take me in such a  spirit. I suppose it was not really love after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Dr. Jim, you do not even know the meaning of the word. But if I had chosen  you would have learned it. Do you know,&rdquo; she added with another laugh, &ldquo;you  remind me of the cook, who was of that &lsquo;appy disposition that she could marry  anyone? You had better be careful Dr. Jim, for any clever woman who let you  believe she loved you could become Mrs. Herrick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think so,&rdquo; said Jim grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do, and I am sure of it. Well, I have been a traitress to my sex and have  warned you. I could say something more but I shall leave you to find it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find  what out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  that is part of the finding. You are a great big stupid wise man Dr. Jim, and I  love you for your folly. But some day you will be happy. You do not understand  what I mean at present. Don&rsquo;t try to understand. It will come upon you  unexpectedly. And now,&rdquo; she held out her hand like a queen, &ldquo;we are friends; we  are brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brother,  and sister Ida,&rdquo; said Jim kissing that white hand. This time he did not feel  the slightest thrill. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he cried rather vexed. &ldquo;I do not know  what love is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you will some day, and soon. I see it coming.&rdquo; Thus spoke Ida, and refused to  explain herself further. But Jim understood her&mdash;dimly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Second-Sight</b></h2>
  <p>Herrick  was much happier now that his relations with Ida were properly adjusted. He  recognised how true was her woman&rsquo;s instinct which had gone at once to the root  of the matter. He had never truly loved her, as a woman demands to be loved.  The very fact that he had been blind to her feeling for Stephen showed that  what he had mistaken for true passion&mdash;if it could be so called&mdash;was wholly  false. He had been attracted by her beauty, by her kindly spirit, by that sympathy  which every genuine woman can give to a man whom she finds pleasant company;  but of the sacred feeling, which is named love, yet which has no name, he had  not felt one thrill. With feminine cleverness she had taken his gimcrack  passion in the right way, and had shown him in the kindest of words, how poor a  thing it really was. There was no ill feeling in his heart now that he had lost  her. He could regard her as a dear friend, and even be glad that she should  marry Stephen.</p>
  <p>So  far Herrick was quite content. Yet there was a vague yearning in his breast for  companionship, and sympathy. Certainly he had both from Stephen; but Stephen  was a man, and could not be to him what a woman could be. Herrick had lived a  life, so active and full of interest that he had never found time to think of  love or of womankind. Now that there was&mdash;so to speak a pause in his life&mdash;the  vacuum thus created required to be filled up in some way. For man, was woman  created, and Jim was simply yearning (although in his materialistic blindness  he did not know it) for the other part of himself. Ida had hinted that what he  wanted would come to him; yet so blind was Jim, that he could not see the  advancing vision. He looked to all four points of the horizon, and  saw&mdash;nothing. It was a wonder to him in after years that it had been so with  him. But it was but that dense gloom which heralds the dawn. And the glory of  day was at hand.</p>
  <p>In  this unsatisfactory mood, wanting something yet not knowing what it was that he  wanted, Jim was anything but a pleasant companion. Formerly he had been  serenely strong, never out of temper, and always sufficient in himself to  himself. Now he was easily irritated, he smoked more than was good for him, he  looked upon his fellow mortals with jaundiced eyes. In vain he rode, he boxed,  he fenced, he swam, he took long tramps into the country. External Nature could  do nothing for him. The secret of his redemption was within him, yet he did not  know how to learn it. Poor Jim! Those dark days took much of his pride from him.  He learned then how poor a thing is man; how dependent upon forces which  although within himself he is unable through weakness or through ignorance to  control.</p>
  <p>One  form of Herrick&rsquo;s unrest took the shape of being almost openly rude to Robin.  The little man was in the habit of haunting Biffstead. He was by this time  desperately in love with Bess, and took no pains to conceal his feelings.  Manuel encouraged it, for the Mexican was his confidant. Robin would have told  Herrick had the doctor shown any sympathetic disposition to listen. But Jim  avoided him on all occasions. Perhaps Robin guessed the cause, for he let  sleeping dogs lie, and never asked what it was that had come between them. He  knew that it would be wiser for him to leave Saxham, yet so deeply was he in  love that he could not tear himself away from so dangerous a neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>Jim  felt that if he spoke to Robin he might say too much, so he sounded Manuel on  the subject of their leaving. He wished both men to go, conspiracy or no  conspiracy. The mystery of the affair was beginning to exasperate Jim, and as  has been said before he was not in his usual good-tempered frame of mind.</p>
  <p>One  day he encountered Santiago on the common. The Mexican was in good spirits and  expressed his pleasure at the meeting. The doctor nodded grimly, but did not  return the compliment. &ldquo;When are you two going away?&rdquo; he asked. Manuel looked  up at the hard tone and saw at once that Jim had made up his mind to be  disagreeable. But the Mexican was not lacking in courage and had no thought of  retreating. &ldquo;I do not quite understand what you mean Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said with  coldness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am talking of you and Joyce. When are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  it suits me to leave, Se&ntilde;or. I have every right to stop here if I so choose,  and I do choose. As to Joyce, you had better ask him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  saw that he had taken the wrong tone with the man and by a great effort of will  became more friendly. &ldquo;You need not be angry Santiago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only ask  because I see that Joyce is attracted by Miss Bess Endicotte. That is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo;  Santiago shrugged his shoulders, &ldquo;Why should it be wrong? She is a most  charming lady and your friend Joyce loves her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!  He can never marry her,&rdquo; said Herrick angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no reason why he should not. Of course it is none of my business, Se&ntilde;or, and  I fail to see why you should speak to me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here, Don Manuel. I speak to you because I know that Robin has come under the  power of your will. You do what you like with him, and I want you to take him away.  He must not ask Miss Bess to marry him, for the very simple reason that he has  no income and no position. Such a marriage would be a bad one for the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop  that!&rdquo; cried Herrick so fiercely that the Mexican was cowed. &ldquo;I am responsible  for Joyce and for you also, seeing that I asked you both to come here. You must  go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as Joyce is concerned I shall use the influence you are pleased to talk  about to get him to leave. As for myself, the Rev. Pentland Corn has asked me to  stop with him for a week or so; I have accepted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pentland  Corn!&rdquo; said Herrick surprised. &ldquo;What can there be in common between the rector  and you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know that I am a bad man,&rdquo; replied the Mexican smoothly, &ldquo;but perhaps this  priest may improve me. I believe he did his best with Colonel Carr; but with me  he may not fail. We are friends&mdash;great friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand,&rdquo; muttered Herrick eyeing the man curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there any need you should?&rdquo; retorted Don Manuel working himself into a rage. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,  I do not understand that you talk to me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; replied Jim coolly. He did not want to quarrel with the man as yet.  &ldquo;We need not lose our tempers like schoolboys. You can stay a century with Corn  for all I care! But Joyce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I have any influence with him he shall go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. I would have spoken to him myself, but your influence over him is  stronger than mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You ascribe to me more power than I possess,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;I do not wish to obtain influence over any one. To me Joyce is a pleasant  friend, nothing more. When I go back to London probably I shall see little of  him. And I return to Mexico in two months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was pleased to hear this. If there was any conspiracy, and Don Manuel was mixed  up in it, the thing would at all events come to a head within eight weeks. It  was time it did, for Herrick was weary of fighting with shadows. Once he had  something definite before him he could fight; and a vague threat in the Mexican&rsquo;s  tone assured him that he would not have long to wait.</p>
  <p>As  he had no excuse for leaving Don Manuel the doctor was forced to return to the  village with him. On the way they passed Sidney, who was walking towards the  moor. Herrick called to the boy, who merely waved his hand and passed on. Jim  noticed that his face was singularly colourless, of a hue resembling that which  it had assumed when he had slept on the library sofa prior to his announcement  of Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  ill that boy looks!&rdquo; muttered Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; interposed Manuel, &ldquo;he is not ill. But he is in that frame of mind which  will bring him into contact with spiritual intelligences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  his rapt look and his fixed eye. That boy Dr. Herrick, is clairvoyant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was angry at once. &ldquo;You are talking the jargon of the spiritualists,&rdquo; he said  roughly, &ldquo;all trickery and fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Believe  me nothing of the sort Se&ntilde;or. I myself have seen the most extraordinary things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked at him with a disdainful smile. &ldquo;I know you are not a good man Santiago,  nor do you wish to be thought one. But I credited you with more intelligence  than to believe in hallucinations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don  Manuel not at all offended laughed. &ldquo;True I am not a good man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and  more is the pity. I am afraid to go where that lad can go&mdash;into the astral  plane. You do not understand? No! you are as I said before, a materialistic  being. But I am not a fool Dr. Herrick, and I can tell you that I know  something of the psychic faculty. In Mexico I have seen the most wonderful things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all about it,&rdquo; said Jim humouring the man, &ldquo;I am a sceptic you know. All the  spiritualism I have ever seen is humbug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  of which I talk is not spiritualism,&rdquo; rejoined Manuel coldly, &ldquo;it is the occult  science. What is the good of my explaining anything to you? You would only  laugh, you cannot see, you never will see. The prison of the flesh is too  strong for you to break through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a healthy man if that is what you mean,&rdquo; retorted Jim, &ldquo;but about this boy?  He is queer, I admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  you can see that!&rdquo; said Manuel sarcastically. &ldquo;I congratulate you. Eh! he  foretold the death of Mrs. Marsh. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  But that was a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. These things are always coincidences&mdash;to you. But to me it is a proof  that the boy can enter the astral plane. He does not know what it is; he is not  instructed but he can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what it is myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is another world that is all around us,&rdquo; said Manuel waving his hand, &ldquo;it  interweaves itself into our world but having only limited senses we cannot see  it. That boy has senses finer than ours and he can see. If you gave him a  crystal, a blob of ink, any shining surface with depth, he would see the most  wonderful things. Have you read Zanoni, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bulwer  Lytton&rsquo;s romance? Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course you call it a romance; but there is much truth in it. Well, it is  useless for me to explain, besides I am not a good man, and to tell you all I  <i>should</i> be good. That boy however? You want to make him like yourself. Well  then make him eat plenty of meat, and take exercise, make him fat, place him  amongst boys who will laugh at him, and he will be like the rest of the world.  He will not lose his power altogether. It will come to him at odd moments. But  he will not be the dreamer you see him, no! and he will not be able to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have thought of that myself,&rdquo; said Herrick lazily, &ldquo;the boy is half-starved and  queer&mdash;a poet in temperament. I will take him in hand, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  make him like yourself. Did I not say so?&rdquo; Manuel paused, then laughed. &ldquo;To-night  if I am not mistaken he will astonish you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know the look he had on  his face. Something is in the air. He sees it he will tell you about it, and  you will laugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me about what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know; I am not clairvoyant. Wait and see,&rdquo; and Manuel turning on his  heel went into the Carr Arms which they had approached during their  conversation. Herrick looked after him with a smile of contempt. &ldquo;A charlatan!&rdquo;  he muttered, &ldquo;and I thought he was only a villain. Humph! I do not think one need  be afraid of him&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the same in spite of his openly expressed scepticism, the conversation haunted  him. He determined to keep Sidney in his company and see if anything happened.  Herrick scoffed at the things Manuel had been talking about, yet he could not  deny that the incident of the prophecy of Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s death was very  remarkable. Indeed Jim shuddered as he wondered if this uncanny boy was about  to prophesy something similar. However he put the gruesome thought out of his  mind, and went to Biffstead. Here he met Joyce coming out of the gate. The  little man looked quite joyous, and greeted Herrick gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you just going in? I was coming to you. Miss Endicotte asked me to take a  message to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; said Herrick forcing himself to be civil. It was most important that he  should not quarrel with Robin at present. He hated himself because he was  obliged to wear this mask; but the circumstances of the case and the interests  of Stephen required it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Endicotte wants you and Marsh-Carr to come to dinner. She has asked me also. I  am going back to dress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to invite Don Manuel I suppose,&rdquo; sneered Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Joyce simply. He either did not notice the sneer, or wished it to  appear that he had not perceived it. &ldquo;Manuel dines with Pentland Corn to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hear he is going to stay with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Corn and he have taken to one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curious  they should, and not creditable to Corn,&rdquo; said Herrick and went inside, leaving  Joyce staring after him.</p>
  <p>The  little man frowned, and his face assumed a most unpleasant expression. &ldquo;I  wonder if he knows anything?&rdquo; he thought biting his fingers. &ldquo;He is quite  different to what he used to be. I don&rsquo;t care. I can hold my own,&rdquo; and with  this defiant declaration he marched away holding his head in the air. Certainly  Dr. Jim was not wrong in suspecting Robin to be other than he seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you won&rsquo;t come to dinner?&rdquo; said Ida when Herrick presented himself. &ldquo;What a  pity! Bess <i>will</i> be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; replied Herrick dryly. &ldquo;I understand Joyce is coming. But that is  neither here nor there, I shall tell Stephen that you want him and so shall be  left alone in the house. Will you send over Sidney to dine with me. I want him  particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he is only a boy. He will bore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary, I find him a very interesting study. You know I promised to take  him in hand. Well, I want to have a talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure it is very good of you to take so much trouble Dr. Jim,&rdquo; said Ida  gratefully. &ldquo;Certainly; I will send him when he returns from the moor. He went  out for a walk. And you will tell Stephen to come over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  as soon as I get back. He has been writing poetry all the day, and needs to be  taken out of himself. I am very glad you have asked him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  bowed himself out and returned to &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; Of course Stephen was delighted  at the idea of a dinner with Ida, but did not want to leave his friend alone. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Sidney is coming to keep me company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  shuddered. &ldquo;Then I am glad I am going away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that boy is most  uncomfortable&mdash;so uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will certainly find more pleasure in Miss Endicotte&rsquo;s society!&rdquo; laughed  Herrick. Stephen laughed too and looked sharply at his friend. But true to his  reticent nature he said nothing.</p>
  <p>In  due time Marsh-Carr departed and Sidney arrived. The boy had more colour in his  cheeks, and his eyes had lost the fixed expression noticed by Don Manuel. He  and Dr. Jim were on friendly terms and Sidney was pleased that he had been  asked to dine. All the same he made a bad meal. The dinner was excellent but  the boy restricted himself to the plainest of the dishes and very little of  them. He did not touch meat but seemed to prefer vegetables. Herrick noticed  this abstinence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will never grow strong if you don&rsquo;t eat beef, Sidney,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;all  English boys should eat beef.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never liked it,&rdquo; replied the boy abruptly. &ldquo;I do not like any meat; it is  disagreeable to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you never touch wine I notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I once drank a glass of beer. Ugh!&rdquo; Sidney made a wry face and shuddered at the  recollection. &ldquo;How can people like such things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you live on then?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fruit  vegetables and plain water. I do not often touch tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think that is unhealthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I feel alright Dr. Jim. I am never ill. Ida is always fussing over me, but I am  much stronger than I look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Appearances  are deceptive then,&rdquo; said Herrick dryly, and rose to go to the library. &ldquo;I  suppose you do not smoke Sidney, you are too young to indulge in that. Perhaps  you do though?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never smoke, I never will. I suppose I am different from other boys, but all  the things they like to do I dislike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  thought that this was the queerest lad he had ever met, but for the moment he  dropped the subject. After a time he began to talk sport to see if Sidney would  take any interest in it. The boy answered politely but was obviously bored. Not  even the account of a tiger hunt with which Herrick strove to rouse him, had  any effect. The doctor more puzzled than ever, and recollecting what Santiago  had said, changed the tone of the conversation. He spoke of the fakirs in  India, of their self-mortifications, and the visions they asserted they had.  This was strange conversation for a boy of sixteen, but then Sidney was a  freak. He woke up upon this topic, and began to talk brightly. His face became  animated, a look of interest came into his eyes, and he talked in a way so far  above his years that Herrick was astounded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  seem to know India,&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;often times I see pictures of in it my mind.  The bright blue skies, the brilliant vegetation, the queerly-dressed people.  And the long range of mountains,&rdquo; he continued as in a dream, &ldquo;peaks of snow  against a cold sky. Those must be the Himalaya Mountains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have read about India,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;and so it has impressed itself on your  mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I know more about the country than I have read. It is just as if I had once  lived there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim had a smattering of the theory of reincarnation. He did not believe in it,  but on questioning Sidney he really began to believe that the boy must have  been in India in some former life. Else how did this country-bred youth know  about the gorgeous east. He said things which he could not possibly have read  in books. For two hours Herrick drew him out on the subject and was fairly  astounded at the mind which laid itself out before his gaze. Later on Sidney  began to grow restless and again his eyes took on that fixed look. Rising he  walked up and down the library. Dr. Jim asked what was the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to see something,&rdquo; said Sidney in a most matter of fact tone, &ldquo;the  feeling is always the same. I feel as if I were not myself; as if I did not  belong to my body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to sleep?&rdquo; asked Herrick anxiously and with a thrill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I feel particularly wide awake. I wish Stephen were back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim sat up alertly. &ldquo;Why do you wish that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something bad going to happen to him. I feel that he&mdash;he is in danger. I don&rsquo;t  know,&rdquo; Sidney passed his thin hand across his eyes, &ldquo;there is a dark cloud, but  bad,&mdash;bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  felt half inclined to go with Sidney to Biffstead and walk home with  Marsh-Carr. But he was ashamed to give way to what seemed a foolish impulse. He  laughed at the boy, and began to question him on other subjects. &ldquo;You are fond  of wandering about at night?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  go to the Pine wood very often,&rdquo; replied Sidney still uneasy, &ldquo;it is so amusing  to watch them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Them?  Who?&mdash;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose you would call them fairies,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;they are real people to  me. Little men and women, so busy about their work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. This sounded like the ravings of a lunatic. &ldquo;There are no such things  as fairies,&rdquo; he said roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen them,&rdquo; replied Sidney obstinately, &ldquo;but we will not talk of them Dr.  Jim. You would not believe me if I told you what I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here Sydney,&rdquo; said Herrick after a pause, &ldquo;I believe you do see things in a  way. You have a most vivid imagination and a strong poetic temperament. The way  in which you described India shows me that. I believe you think of these queer  things so much that you make yourself see them&mdash;a kind of hallucination. If you  ate meat and took to sport, these unhealthy visions would pass away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; replied Sidney indifferently. He apparently did not wish to argue the  matter. But he held to his own opinion nevertheless. There were a few moments  of silence, then the boy exclaimed. &ldquo;It is coming nearer&mdash;the danger to  Stephen. Dr. Jim! Let us go to Biffstead. I am sure there is danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  the materialist however, would not give way on this point. He thought it would  be weak for him to yield to the boy&rsquo;s folly. &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;You  are giving way to your imagination. Nothing can happen to Stephen. If there is  danger,&rdquo; he added in a joking manner, to make Sidney ashamed of himself, &ldquo;why  don&rsquo;t you go to sleep and see what it is? There is the sofa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I feel wide awake, and yet I feel&mdash;I feel,&rdquo; Sidney clenched his hand.</p>
  <p>Herrick  reflected for a moment. Santiago had said that the boy was clairvoyant, and  could see visions in any shining surface or in a blob of ink. There was a large  silver ink pot on the table. More as a joke than in earnest, Herrick pushed  this across to Sidney. &ldquo;Look there and see what is the matter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Sidney  looked offended. &ldquo;If you do not believe me, you need not laugh,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I  shall go to Biffstead myself. It is eleven o&rsquo;clock. Quite time I was home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! Look in the ink first,&rdquo; said Herrick, now much more in earnest. He really  wished to see if the vivid imagination of the boy would see a picture in the  black pool. &ldquo;Have you ever looked into a crystal Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can see things without looking into anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you are asleep? Vivid dreams?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said the boy quietly, &ldquo;but in the dark I can&mdash;no matter. Do not at us talk Dr.  Jim. You only laugh at me and I want to go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  warn Stephen?&rdquo; said Herrick angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  retorted Sidney doggedly, &ldquo;to warn Stephen. He is in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  I&rsquo;ll go with you Sidney. It seems that you must be humoured. But to oblige me,  see if you can discern the Arabian Nights in the ink-pot. I am sure you will  see Stephen seated quietly in your drawing-room talking to your sisters, with  Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Very  unwillingly Sidney did what he was asked. He knew that Herrick was laughing at  him, and was particularly sensitive to ridicule. With a look of reproach which  made Dr. Jim feel rather ashamed the boy drew the big silver ink-pot towards  him and stared into the black oval. The chimes of the clock striking eleven had  just died away and there was an absolute silence, broken only by the faint  crackle of the fire. All the lights in the room had been turned off early in  the evening at the request of Sidney himself. The boy disliked the full blaze. Only  on the writing-table was a green-shaded lamp, and close to this:&mdash;but in such a  position that the light did not fall into the ink-well, stood the silver pot.  Herrick half vexed with himself for encouraging this folly, watched the boy  quietly from an arm-chair. Sidney bent over the ink and stared into it hard.  After a minute or two Herrick saw a quiver pass through the boy&rsquo;s frame. &ldquo;What  is it Sidney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see the drawing-room at Biffstead,&rdquo; said Sidney quietly, &ldquo;but Stephen is not  there! Mr. Joyce is talking to Ida and Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed. &ldquo;What nonsense! Stephen is certainly there. If he is not, had you not  better look for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see him now,&rdquo; continued Sidney taking no notice of the ridicule. &ldquo;He is walking  in the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  declared the sceptic in the arm-chair, &ldquo;what should take Stephen to the  churchyard at this time of the night? It is not on his way home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  <i>is</i> in the churchyard,&rdquo; insisted Sidney, &ldquo;there he walks amongst the  tombstones. He is going to the new vault. For a time he looks at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you see that when the night is dark?&rdquo; cried Herrick rising, &ldquo;there is no  moon. Come away Sidney, this is bad for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  Wait!&rdquo; said the boy hastily, &ldquo;the danger, the danger. Stephen has left the new  vault; he has gone to the old one. He is being followed, by a man in a dark  cloak. The man has a big stick. He comes behind Stephen he&mdash;he&mdash;stop! stop!&rdquo;  the boy almost screamed. &ldquo;No!&mdash;don&rsquo;t hit him! Do not hit him. Stephen! Help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo;  cried Herrick, catching the boy by the arm and now thoroughly frightened &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  go on in this silly fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you the man has struck Stephen,&rdquo; said Sidney passionately, &ldquo;he is lying by  the old vault unconscious from a blow on the head. The man has gone. I don&rsquo;t  know where. Let me go, Mr. Herrick. Stephen is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sidney  wrenched himself away from Herrick and went staggering towards the door with  his hands held out. Dr. Jim followed him to stop him from leaving the house in  this state. But the boy gained the hall before he did. Once there and he seemed  to gather strength. He caught up his cap and pulling open the massive door  passed outside. Herrick taken by surprise did not wait to put on his own cap.  He went after the lad bare-headed thinking he had been seized with a fit of  madness. In spite of the darkness of the night he followed on Sidney&rsquo;s heels so  closely that he was enabled to keep him in sight. Jim wondered where he was  going, being still sceptical of harm to Stephen.</p>
  <p>Sidney  passed swiftly beyond the belt of pines and down the lane which led to  Biffstead. &ldquo;He is going home,&rdquo; thought Herrick with relief.</p>
  <p>But  the lad did not go home. He turned off sharp to the left, and entered the  churchyard through a side lane. Herrick, now awestruck at his strange  experience which he did not understand, ran after him stumbling over the  graves. Sidney never fell. He passed swiftly to the old vault of the Carrs.  Beside it was a dark body on the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stephen!  Stephen!&rdquo; cried the lad, and then sank exhausted beside the body.</p>
  <p>Herrick  came up thunderstruck at that cry, struck a match and held it close to the  ground beside the face of the unconscious man. He started back with an  irrepressible cry and let the match fall. It was Stephen Marsh-Carr who was  lying there, and he was bleeding from a wound on the back of the head. And  beside him, also unconscious, lay the lad who had foreseen the accident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  crime,&rdquo; said Herrick aloud in a shaky voice, &ldquo;this is the work of Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    The Wooing Of Robin Joyce</b></h2>
  <p>Bewildered  as Herrick was by the strangeness of this discovery, he had nerve enough to  pull himself together and go for assistance. In spite of the lateness of the  hour, the Carr Arms was full of labourers drinking and smoking. A number of  these came at once to the churchyard when they heard of the accident&mdash;for so  Herrick put it&mdash;and Stephen was carried to his house. Herrick had ascertained  before seeking assistance that his friend still lived. Meanwhile Sidney had  revived, but was in a drowsy state. &ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; he said. Herrick after  whispering him to say nothing of the vision seen in the ink-pot, sent him to  Biffstead in charge of the landlord Napper. Then he accompanied the body of his  friend to &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; Herrick could not help thinking of it as the body though  he knew Stephen still lived. But it was quite probable that he would be an  actual corpse before the dawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Marsh-Carr has met with an accident,&rdquo; was the explanation of the doctor to his  helpers, and they went away. But they knew very well that it was no accident,  and moreover the presence of Sidney besides the body hinted that another  wonderful event had taken place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Master  Sidney said that his mother was dead,&rdquo; remarked the wiseacres, &ldquo;and he has  found the dead body of Mr. Marsh himself now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not dead,&rdquo; said others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  But he will die. Master Sidney, never makes a mistake.&rdquo; And by the next morning  a legend had been circulated that the uncanny boy, had foretold the death of  the new Squire. When those who called at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; heard that Marsh-Carr had  lived through the night, they were quite disappointed. It seemed a reflection  on Master Sidney. Yet the boy had held his tongue and no one knew really what  had happened. In default of the truth then, they took refuge in a fable. There  was absolutely no authority for what was said, but Sidney had been found  unconscious beside the unconscious Squire. That was enough material out of  which to form a wonderful story, and it lost nothing in the telling.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Herrick fulfilled his duties of medical attendant to his friend, smiling grimly  the while, that the need should come so comparatively early in their  acquaintance. He had known Marsh-Carr but a little over five months. The  meeting had taken place in July and it was now near Christmas. The doctor  examined the wound on the back of the head. It was a nasty jagged cut,  evidently made by some blunt instrument. &ldquo;A big stick as the boy said, no  doubt,&rdquo; mused Herrick as he plastered and bathed and bound it up. &ldquo;Stephen is  stunned for the time being, but I do not think that the brain is injured. His  head is pretty hard. Frisco had good intentions, but not sufficient judgment to  strike hard.&rdquo; For of course it was Frisco who had done this. Dr. Jim remembered  what Mrs. Marsh had said and regretted that she had passed away without informing  him more fully of what she knew about Frisco. That the ex-sailor should dare to  come down to the scene of his first crime in order to commit a second (for at  the moment Herrick credited Frisco rather than Joyce with the Carr murder) was  wonderful enough, but his reason must be more wonderful still. It was  impossible that he should be able to get the fortune even if he put Stephen out  of the way, for he was a proven murderer, and if he showed himself would be at  once arrested. Certainly he might explain all suspicions away, but that was  doubtful in the face of such strong evidence. Yet, apparently he had made up  his mind to remove Stephen, and get the money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he won&rsquo;t if I can help it,&rdquo; muttered Herrick, &ldquo;the beast. I&rsquo;ll carry Stephen to  the vault myself so that the terms of the monthly visit may be fulfilled. Not  that I don&rsquo;t think he will be on his feet sooner than Frisco expects. The job  had been badly done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  sent in a message to Beorminster by a groom, telling Bridge of the new outrage  and advising a search to be made for Frisco. Then the patient having been  attended to and the would-be assassin recommended to the attention of the  police, Dr. Jim could do nothing more. He sat before the library fire and  smoked, thinking deeply the while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if Joyce attempted this murder,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There is something queer  about this stopping here. But that boy said Joyce was at Biffstead talking to  his sisters, if I believe one part of that vision&mdash;and I am bound to do that&mdash;I  must believe the other. Not Joyce then, but there is Don Manuel, he is  connected with Robin in some underhand way. Besides, he professed to hate Carr,  to regret the loss of the treasure. It might be he, if he has been with Corn  all the night well and good&mdash;if not, he will have to account to me for his  time. I do not believe in the little reptile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  meditations were ended by a sleepy servant who announced Ida, Bess and Frank.  With them came Joyce wide-eyed with wonder; but so far as Dr. Jim could see  there was no sign of terror or of guilt on his face, and Robin was not the man  to conceal his feelings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Napper  brought home Sidney and told us of this dreadful thing,&rdquo; said Bess who seemed  the most collected of the party. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he is not dead nor do I think he will die. The blow was badly aimed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  could have done it?&rdquo; asked Frank frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have my own opinion, but I prefer not to express it at present,&rdquo; said the  doctor somewhat curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to take me to him doctor,&rdquo; said Ida looking at him with imploring  eyes. &ldquo;Let me watch beside him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can do no good Miss Endicotte,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;better let me look after him.  To-morrow you can come over and watch if you like. I think he will recover  consciousness before the dawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God for that!&rdquo; cried Ida devoutly and then she wept. The strain on her had been  very great and she was glad of the relief of tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you looked for the man who did this?&rdquo; asked Joyce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have sent a message to the police at Beorminster,&rdquo; said Herrick without looking  at him. &ldquo;You can do no good Joyce; better go back to the inn. By the way your  friend Santiago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has been with Corn all the night,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;we met them coming here. They  had just heard the news, but Bess persuaded them to stay away thinking they  would only bother you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it is best to keep the house as quiet as possible. Has Sidney said  anything?&rdquo; he asked looking at the sisters.</p>
  <p>Ida  clasped her hands in terror. &ldquo;Did Sidney say this would happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He looked into yonder ink-pot and foretold the assault. I cannot understand the  thing myself, but we can talk of it to-morrow. In the meantime, all of you hold  your tongues about Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  they all promised to do and now being more at rest in their minds about  Stephen, they went away. Herrick drew Bess aside at the door. &ldquo;Come over with  Ida to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded and ran after the rest who were disappearing into the darkness. Herrick  with a frown returned to the library. &ldquo;It was not Joyce,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it was  not Manuel. After all it <i>must</i> be Frisco. Well, if the police are clever they  will catch him before he can leave the district. Ha! I&rsquo;ll send a message to  Southberry, it was that way he escaped last time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  hastily wrote out an explanation. He did not need to add a description of  Frisco as the hand-bills had sufficiently described him. This he sent off with  another groom, then went to pass the night beside the bed of his patient. All  that night Stephen lay as still as a corpse.</p>
  <p>It  was towards morning when he moved and showed signs of returning consciousness.  Herrick was assiduous in his attendance, and success crowned his efforts.  Gradually Stephen came to himself, with a dull pain in his head, weak, but  quite himself. &ldquo;Where&mdash;where am I?&rdquo; were his first stammering words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  your own house,&rdquo; said Herrick quickly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk my dear chap; you have had  an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember,&rdquo; muttered Stephen, &ldquo;at the vault, a blow,&mdash;yes, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet,&rdquo; said Herrick sternly, &ldquo;you must not talk I tell you!&rdquo; And after another  attempt Stephen obeyed. Shortly he fell asleep. Herrick drew a long breath. The  worst was over. For once the villany of Frisco had failed in its object.</p>
  <p>Several  people called that morning, amongst others Mr. Corn. The clergyman did not look  well, and hurriedly asked after the sufferer. &ldquo;I hope he is better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a  terrible affair Dr. Herrick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  cowardly crime!&rdquo; said Herrick sharply. &ldquo;However we can talk of that when Marsh  gets better. Meantime Mr. Corn, will you tell me if Don Manuel was at your  house last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me, yes,&rdquo; replied Corn surprised. &ldquo;He came to dinner, and stayed with me up  till midnight. I was walking with him to the Carr Arms, when we met the Miss  Endicottes who told us of this terrible business. Why do you ask me the  question Dr. Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no special reason,&rdquo; replied Herrick mendaciously, &ldquo;save that being in a  sense responsible for the visit of Santiago to this place, I wish to warn you  that I know nothing about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you anything to say against his character?&rdquo; asked the rector sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I know nothing about him. All I can say is that I do not like the man, and I  think he is a bad lot. If you like to tell him this Mr. Corn you are at liberty  to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not the man to make mischief,&rdquo; said Corn hotly, &ldquo;so far as I can see Don  Manuel appears to me to be perfectly respectable. If he is not, I can look  after myself Dr. Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Herrick ceremoniously, &ldquo;I did not wish to infer that you  could not. All I have to say is that Mr. Marsh is better, and that in a week he  will be about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pentland  Corn murmured something about being pleased, and took his departure. Herrick  did not quite know what to make of the rector. He was a good preacher, a  kind-hearted man, and in his own way, clever. But he seemed to be weak, and  usually had a haggard look on his face for which there was no apparent reason.  Sometimes he went away to the sea-side for his health and invariably returned  looking worse than ever. Altogether the man was a mystery, and Herrick could  not make out what was at the back of his timidity, and his restless behaviour. &ldquo;I  seem to be surrounded with mysteries,&rdquo; said Herrick to himself. &ldquo;I wonder if I  shall ever get to the bottom of any one of them. If I do, the rest will easily  be unravelled. I suspect the whole lot are of a piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ida  came that morning, and Bess. This latter young lady waited in the library while  Herrick took up Ida to the room of Stephen. She had insisted upon going up to  watch beside him. &ldquo;It is my right you know,&rdquo; she said to Dr. Jim, and he  silently admitted that it was.</p>
  <p>Stephen  had just opened his eyes when they entered. He tried to speak, but Ida placed  her hand on his mouth and Herrick frowned. Marsh obediently held his tongue,  and Ida sat by his bedside. However the patient managed to kiss Ida&rsquo;s hand.  Then Herrick went down to see Bess, warning Ida that Stephen was not to speak.  Marsh did make another attempt but Miss Endicotte would not allow it. &ldquo;The  doctor says you are to be quiet. If you say a word I shall go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  ring?&rdquo; murmured Stephen, looking at her.</p>
  <p>She  knew what he meant. Drawing the emerald ring he had brought her from town off  the finger it was on, she put it on the engagement finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  that please your lordship?&rdquo; said Ida gaily, but the tears were in her eyes.  Stephen looked again. Thus was the situation adjusted between them without  words. They were engaged to be married. Stephen fell asleep again holding the  hand of his promised wife. Both were happy.</p>
  <p>Meantime  Bess and Herrick were in consultation. Herrick told the girl what Mrs. Marsh  had said about Frisco, and how Stephen had been struck down from behind. &ldquo;So it  looks to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as though this man were trying to get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does,&rdquo; admitted Bess reflectively, &ldquo;but why should Frisco do all these dreadful  things to get the fortune? If he had Colonel Carr in his power he need not have  killed him; nor need he now try and get Stephen out of the way. I don&rsquo;t  understand it. However, as you have told the police both at Beorminster and  Southberry, I am sure the man will be caught. I hope so I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Then you champion Frisco no longer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  if it were really he who attempted to murder Stephen I hope he will be caught  and punished. All the same I do not think he killed Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can be your reason for saying so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  hesitated. &ldquo;Some time ago I promised to tell you something about the Colonel,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;I will do so in a week from to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head. &ldquo;Please do not ask me, but as far as this assault on Stephen  goes, I am quite with you about Frisco. I hope he will be caught and punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a strange girl,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;and a mystery like the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are the rest?&rdquo; asked Bess smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  replied Jim after a pause, &ldquo;Mrs. Marsh was one, you are another and Pentland  Corn is a third&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pentland  Corn!&rdquo; she echoed turning pale, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suspect him of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t suspect him of anything, but I do not understand why he is so intimate  with that Mexican.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  opened her mouth to make a remark, then she changed her mind. &ldquo;I can say  nothing now,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;later on. Ida is with Stephen. Oh, well, I  need not wait. I must go into Beorminster. They will be asking for news of this  for the paper. I might hear something about Frisco there. If I do I shall let  you know. Good-bye!&rdquo; and before Herrick could stop her she was off like a  swallow.</p>
  <p>Evidently  Bess knew something about Corn which she did want to admit at present. Herrick  wondered what it could be. Surely she did not think the clergyman had liked  Carr so much that he was working for the discovery of his murderer. &ldquo;But she is  doing some detective business on her own account,&rdquo; thought Jim rather vexed. &ldquo;She  will get into trouble if she does not take care. I wish she would let me know  what she is up to. I&rsquo;ll wait a week, no longer. After that, she must speak out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  before the week was ended, accident brought about a confession from Bess which  Dr. Jim was far from expecting. It arose out of the wooing of Robin Joyce.  Whether Manuel had used his influence or not to induce Joyce to leave Saxham,  it is impossible to say. If he had, one would have thought that Robin would  have resented the interference of his former friend Herrick. But several times  during the week he met Dr. Jim, yet made no sign that Santiago had told him of  the doctor&rsquo;s wish. He continued to haunt Biffstead and Dr. Jim hardly ever went  there without meeting Robin coming or going. This did not make Jim any the more  amiable.</p>
  <p>The  accident to Stephen caused great excitement in the country. Bridge came over to  see the squire and to interview Dr. Jim. But nothing came of his talk  or&mdash;so-called vigilance. The police both at Southberry and Beorminster failed  to find any trace of Frisco, although the railway stations were watched  carefully. Thanks to Herrick&rsquo;s prompt action, it was impossible that the man  could have left the district without the knowledge of the police, yet he was  not even seen. Bridge went to Heathcroft, but failed to learn that anyone resembling  the ex-sailor had boarded a train at that station. To all appearances Frisco  had not been in the neighbourhood. Yet if Frisco was not the culprit, who was?</p>
  <p>Herrick  knew that Joyce had been at Biffstead on the evening of the assault. According  to the evidence of Corn, Don Manuel had been at the rectory till midnight. As  the assault on Stephen took place shortly after eleven both these men must be  held guiltless. Stephen himself could give no help. He had left the Biffs at a  quarter to eleven, with the intention of coming straight back to &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo;  Then as the night was fine, he thought he would go and have a look at the  vault. He went into the churchyard and after seeing the new vault went on to  the old one. While looking at it, he received a blow at the back of his head  and remembered no more until he found himself in bed with Herrick bending over  him. He had heard no footsteps behind him. The blow had been struck in the most  unexpected manner, and he had been taken completely by surprise.</p>
  <p>All  this puzzled Herrick greatly. However, he determined to wait for another week  to hear what Bess had to say. She might tell him something tangible, likely to  lead to an explanation of these mysteries. But even if she did not Dr. Jim made  up his mind to move in the matter. He would first have a talk with Robin and  learn if he had anything to do with the death. He would have to explain away  the evidence of the old-fashioned pistol being in his possession. It might not  have been the weapon used; on the other hand, Herrick felt convinced in his own  mind that it was. To unravel the puzzle therefore, Robin was the man he  intended to begin with. He was assisted to make a start by the folly of Joyce  himself, and this incidentally brought about the confession of Bess.</p>
  <p>One  afternoon towards the end of the week Herrick went to Biffstead. Ida was at &ldquo;The  Pines&rdquo; with Stephen, and Bess was alone. Hearing this, Herrick volunteered to  fetch her, and started off. As he approached the house he heard the voice of  the girl raised in anger. She appeared at the French window of the drawing-room  which looked out on the front of the house, and seemed in a state of alarm. The  moment she saw him she passed rapidly through the window and caught him by the  arm. At the same moment Robin, greatly excited, appeared at the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  back! Come back, Miss Bess. I did not mean it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; asked Dr. Jim astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  inside,&rdquo; panted Bess, &ldquo;that man! I want you to thrash him. Oh, the coward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim took Bess by the arm and drew her into the room. Robin winced and shrank  aside as the doctor entered. Bess had evidently been typing at her worktable,  for it was drawn near the window, and some manuscript lay open on the table.  Before this stood a chair, and near it was another chair in which to all  appearances Robin Joyce had been seated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  then!&rdquo; said Herrick, when he had placed the girl in her chair, &ldquo;what does this  mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  said Robin very pale but trying to speak calmly. &ldquo;Only that I asked Miss  Endicotte to be my wife, and she refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; flashed out Herrick angrily. &ldquo;What right have you to ask her to be your  wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  Robin could answer (not that he showed any inclination to do so) Bess started  to her feet. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;He did ask me to be his wife and  because I refused to marry him, he threatened me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Threatened  you,&rdquo; Herrick turned on Joyce with a dangerous look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; implored Robin very white, &ldquo;forget what I said. I did not mean any harm. I  shall go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  seized him by the wrist. &ldquo;You will do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You  must wait until I have heard all about this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  winced again and looked cowed. His lips were dry, his face was pale, and he  cast an imploring look upon Bess. The girl returned that look with one of  defiance and addressed herself to Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what that little coward has accused me of?&rdquo; she cried fiercely. &ldquo;He  said that I murdered Colonel Carr!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim laughed. The accusation was so absurd that he could not help laughing. &ldquo;Of  course the man is mad,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did <i>not</i> say that you had murdered Colonel Carr,&rdquo; cried Robin. &ldquo;I only said  that you were near the house at the time of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  cried Herrick turning on the little wretch, &ldquo;and how do you know that Mr.  Joyce? Come. Out with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said he saw me,&rdquo; put in Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did see you,&rdquo; said Robin making a clean breast of it. &ldquo;You were near the house  and for all I know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you <i>did</i> come to Saxham on that night,&rdquo; interrupted Herrick. &ldquo;Oh, you liar!  You went to see Frith and Frith; you slept at the Hull Hotel, did you? And all  the time you were down here! I believe you killed Colonel Carr yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear I did not,&rdquo; shrieked Robin, &ldquo;she did if anyone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you dare to say that again,&rdquo; cried Bess, &ldquo;you are telling a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you not on the lawn in front of the house?&rdquo; asked Robin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was, and I can account for my presence to Dr. Herrick&mdash;not to you&mdash;little  toad that you are,&rdquo; cried the angry girl. &ldquo;Send him away,&rdquo; she added turning to  Jim, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  back to the Carr Arms,&rdquo; said Herrick to Joyce sternly, &ldquo;and wait for me there.  If you try to run away, I shall have you arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cannot arrest me,&rdquo; blustered Robin looking desperately afraid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can. I have evidence you know nothing about. Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  seemed inclined to dispute the order, but when Herrick made a step in his  direction he caught up his hat and fled through the window. &ldquo;He will run away,&rdquo;  said Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  him try,&rdquo; remarked Herrick grimly, &ldquo;I can have him arrested at once and I will.  Insult you, did he&mdash;the hound!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was my own fault for being so kind to him,&rdquo; cried Bess excitedly, &ldquo;as if I  cared for him. It was only because he was a writer that I let him come and see  me so often. But I shall not have anything more to do with him. He sent me a  manuscript. I shall send it back. Where is it? and she began to pull out the  drawers in the writing-table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  get excited Bess,&rdquo; said Jim using her Christian name in his hurry. &ldquo;I will put  it alright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Bess in a rage kept turning over the papers and scattering them on the floor in  her search for the manuscript. Suddenly she tossed aside a pile of  writing-paper in the left-hand drawer. Underneath was an old fashioned pistol.  She looked at it in astonishment. &ldquo;Where did that come from?&rdquo; she asked in  dismay, taking it up.</p>
  <p>Herrick  took it from her. He recognised it at once. It was the very pistol that Manuel  had shown him in Joyce&rsquo;s flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does it mean?&rdquo; asked Bess quite amazed at the discovery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  means that Joyce is even more of a hound than I thought he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The Confession Of Bess</b></h2>
  <p>Bess  Endicotte stared at Herrick where he stood with a black look on his face, and  the clumsy weapon in his hand. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll see Bridge about it,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the  bullet&rsquo;s still at the police office. If it fits this&mdash;&rdquo; he clicked his tongue  against the roof of his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  cried Bess finding her tongue, and asking the question with a shiver. &ldquo;Is that  the pistol with which&mdash;&rdquo; here her voice died away in her throat. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t  be,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked at her in his turn, and slipped the pistol into his pocket. &ldquo;I know what  you are thinking about,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but the pistol will do you no harm.  I have seen it before. You are all right Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right!&rdquo; she echoed and drawing her brows together. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what should I mean, but that Joyce slipped this devilish piece of evidence into  the table drawer, just to accuse you of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  bounded to her feet, grasping the idea for the first time. &ldquo;He did that, did  he?&rdquo; she cried her head flung back, her eyes angry. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she stamped, &ldquo;what  should be done to such a man! And you can sit quietly there Dr. Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I want to hear your story. After this, you must tell me all you know; all you  have heard. As for Joyce,&rdquo; his mouth twisted, &ldquo;leave him to me. He will not get  off easily I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  put the pistol there, that I&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off again, and looked at him in a  scared manner. &ldquo;Did <i>he</i> kill Carr?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;yet. To kill the man he must have had some strong motive. I have  yet to learn the motive strong or weak that would make Joyce risk his neck. He  is careful of his neck too,&rdquo; explained Dr. Jim. &ldquo;I have a mind to break it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why?&rdquo; asked Bess round-eyed. She had never seen the good-tempered doctor in  such a rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder you can&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; remarked Herrick cooling down. With a gasp Bess drew  back. Their eyes met. A sudden crimson flushed her face, and she turned it  away. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herrick taking her hand, &ldquo;and I only knew it myself a moment  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about?&rdquo; cried the girl snatching her hand away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am talking of you and myself. Ida said that it would come all of a sudden, and  she was right, here it is, and I have been looking in the wrong place for it  these many months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  knew perfectly well what he meant, but she made a show of not understanding. &ldquo;I  think we are talking nonsense,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is much to be done, if what  you say about the pistol is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Herrick again, &ldquo;as you say there is much to be done. The other thing can  stand over for a time. You know well enough; but it suits you to hold me at arm&rsquo;s  length. Woman&rsquo;s way I suppose. Well,&rdquo; he brisked up and his voice took a  sharper tone, &ldquo;let us get to business. This rascal tried to inculpate you in  the crime. He shall have the finest thrashing he ever had. The pistol I can  explain away. I have seen it in his house, and I can guess that he slipped it  into that drawer so as to make his case against you the stronger. He thought if  he accused you and could back his accusation with evidence that you would never  dare to refuse him&mdash;the mean hound!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  it would never have come to that,&rdquo; said the girl proudly. &ldquo;I am not the woman  to be won by threats. He did accuse me of the murder, and I defied him to do  his worst. I suppose if you had not come, he would have shown me the pistol  next. The mean scoundrel!&rdquo; she clenched her fist, &ldquo;beat him well Dr. Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a blood-thirsty person it is,&rdquo; laughed Jim, &ldquo;but upon my word you know, this is  the strangest of wooings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that,&rdquo; said Bess drawing back, &ldquo;we can talk later of such things. But my  position is anything but a pleasant one. That little man will make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he does not, his Mexican friend will. They are a proper pair of scamps. However  I am equal to both of them. Leave Joyce to me. I know all about him; but about  yourself, nothing. Joyce&mdash;I take it&mdash;accuses you of being near &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; on  the night of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  at the hour,&rdquo; said Bess quickly. &ldquo;This is what I have been trying to make up my  mind to tell you all the week. The necessity of doing so has come earlier than  I expected, but I shall explain myself now.&rdquo; She came to a stop and looked at  him questioningly. &ldquo;Of course you know I had nothing to do with the crime  itself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure of that,&rdquo; said Herrick heartily. &ldquo;But I think you know who did it. Come  now, confess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken,&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;All I know is that Frisco is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you proof of this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  proof of my own eyes; I saw him at the door of the house when the shots were  being fired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard the shots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  of them. The fourth I did not hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  About what hour was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between  nine and ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what were you doing out at that hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  paused. &ldquo;I had better tell you all from the beginning,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;then  you can judge for yourself. I have told no one as yet. It was too terrible,  and&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I had other reasons for silence. Yet if Frisco had been  tried for his life, I should have come forward in spite of all. He is perfectly  innocent. I can prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo;  muttered Herrick taking a seat. &ldquo;Well, let us hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about that horrid Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  attend to him later. He will stay at the inn until I come. That is, if he is  really innocent. Of course if he tries to bolt, I shall know he is guilty, and  have him arrested. Oh, Joyce knows me, and will act accordingly. Never mind  him. Go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not much of a story,&rdquo; said Bess. &ldquo;You know the habit that Sidney has of  going to the Pine Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  see the fairies? Yes, he told me all about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  on the night of the murder, he went away as usual. It came on to rain and Ida  was in a great state. She thought he would catch his death of cold&mdash;he is so  delicate you know. I said I would go and look for him, and about nine o&rsquo;clock I  set out. I knew he would be in the Pine woods. It was raining and I wrapped a  long cloak about me. He was not in the wood, although I searched everywhere  with a lantern. Then I came out of the wood by mistake right on to the Colonel&rsquo;s  lawn. The light was burning in the tower, and the whole of the house was  illuminated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as I saw it,&rdquo; muttered Herrick. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  crossed the lawn to come home, when I heard three shots fired one after the  other in the tower. I heard them plainly. I turned with a start; but the  Colonel had done so many queer things that I thought he was only shooting to  amuse himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  never struck you that it was murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  If the Colonel had not been so eccentric I might have suspected, but nothing  ever surprised me in that house. I waited for a moment. There were no more  shots. I looked towards the house and there I saw Frisco standing in the  doorway. I saw him quite plainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was some time after hearing the shots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  no. It was immediately after the first shot. When the other two were fired I  saw him there. I thought that he might see me, and as I did not want Colonel  Carr to think I had been spying round his house at so late an hour, I ran home  as fast as I could. Sidney had arrived before me. I said nothing about the  shots, and went to bed. When I heard how you had discovered the body, I knew  that I had heard the shots fired by the murderer. But I knew also that when  Frisco was missing he was not guilty. So that was why I defended him. I could  not speak plainer could I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I see no reason why you should not have told the story you tell me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Frisco had been arrested I should have. But you know,&rdquo; here Bess looked down, &ldquo;can  you not understand Dr. Jim? The people round about here are sad scandalmongers.  Because I called on Colonel Carr to get an article as I told you, people said  that I was fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  brutes!&rdquo; cried Herrick firing up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, you can understand that if it had  become known that I was near Colonel Carr&rsquo;s house so late at night, there would  have been more talk. I really don&rsquo;t know what they would have said. So I said  nothing not even to Ida. Of course I could have told them that I went out to  get Sidney&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; Bess shrugged her shoulders, &ldquo;you know how spiteful people  are. No! After consideration I thought it best to hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you might have told me,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was afraid to,&rdquo; faltered Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  foolish child, as though I should not have understood!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;I am glad I have told you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I, as it has brought Joyce to the rope&rsquo;s end. How did he say he saw you on  that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was in the Pine Wood; on the verge of the lawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for what reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not tell me; nor did I ask him. You see,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;I was so angry that  he should accuse me of shooting the Colonel, that I gave him no time to  explain. Then you came, and&mdash;you know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Well, Joyce shall explain to me his reasons for coming to Saxham. Of course I  knew that he was here on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew?&rdquo; said Miss Endicotte much astonished. &ldquo;<i>How</i> could you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  information came to me by accident more or less,&rdquo; replied Herrick and forthwith  he explained, how Stephen&rsquo;s remark as to Robin&rsquo;s income had led him to examine  into the doings of the little man on that night. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;I  went to Heathcroft station. There I learned that a little man muffled up in a  great coat (he had the excuse of the rain, but it really was a disguise) had  arrived at Heathcroft by the seven o&rsquo;clock train from London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Heathcroft is six miles from this place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Joyce knew. Therefore he was thoughtful enough to bring his bicycle with him.  Oh, he came here right enough&mdash;to see the Colonel I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  murder him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really can&rsquo;t be sure of that Bess. You see Carr, for some reason we do not  know, allowed Mrs. Joyce an income of five hundred a year. Robin wanted this to  be continued to him. The solicitors told him that Carr refused it. Therefore I  can only think that he came down to try and persuade Carr to be more generous.  But,&rdquo; added Herrick with emphasis, &ldquo;I hardly think that for such a reason Joyce  would commit a murder. He hasn&rsquo;t the pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  may be,&rdquo; replied Bess thoughtfully, &ldquo;but it seems to me that if he did not, he  took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to conceal his movements from you.  Besides which, he led you directly to the house, where he knew&mdash;at all events I  think so&mdash;that the body would be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is certainly strange, and looks as though his movements had been premeditated.  It was Joyce who selected the country for the walking tour. Yet so far as I  know he was never in these parts before. And I am bound to say that it was I  who led the way to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. He was too clever to take the initiative. But he no doubt made  suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he did that. Well, I must get the truth out of the man himself. He must account  to me for the possession of that pistol, and for his being in the Pine wood on  the night of the murder. I wonder he gave himself away like he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  curled her lip. &ldquo;He did not intend it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he thought that if he  frightened me I would consent to marry him to save my own skin and then hold my  tongue about his presence at Saxham. Oh! all his calculations were carefully  made, you may be sure Dr. Jim. It was only because he mistook my character that  they were upset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded. &ldquo;There is Don Manuel of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Mexican! What about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I wonder if he has anything to do with this. It is strange that he should be so  friendly with Joyce, or with Corn too for the matter of that. Joyce said that a  mutual friend of his and mine introduced him to Santiago. I took the trouble to  write to that friend&mdash;a man called Johnstone, and I learned that Johnstone had  never seen or heard of Don Manuel, nor had the Mexican ever been to the Apollo  Club where, according to Robin the introduction took place. Where they met, and  why they met, I have yet to find out. Luckily I have now enough evidence to  force my dear friend Joyce to be candid. And I shall not spare him,&rdquo; said  Herrick with a grim smile. &ldquo;He is a liar and a scoundrel. I never was so  mistaken in a man before. I prided myself upon reading character. It seems that  I am not so clever as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt there is something between them, since they are so intimate,&rdquo; was the  reply of Miss Endicotte, &ldquo;but whether it has to do with the murder I do not  know. Did Se&ntilde;or Santiago know Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  South America, and hated him like poison. It seems they both went on a  treasure-hunting expedition in Peru.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treasure-hunting!  Peru. Ah I remember, that was the expedition Frisco used to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  Frisco with the Colonel there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He let drop hints that he and the Colonel had found treasure in Peru, and that  they had lost themselves. Of course I do not know the whole story. But from  what Frisco said I know it was in that way Colonel Carr obtained his wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a liar that Manuel is!&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;He denied that he had ever seen Frisco,  According to Manuel only he and Carr were on the expedition. Santiago fell ill,  and Carr left him amongst the Indians. He was held in captivity for two years,  and when he got back to civilisation Carr had vanished with the treasure. He&mdash;I  am speaking of the Mexican&mdash;arrived in England six months ago&mdash;in search of  Colonel Carr no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder if he killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might have, and yet I do not know. Revenge is a poor thing when no substantial  benefit is to be derived. Santiago wants wealth. He would have managed the  affair in a different way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  remember the warnings!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  of them. Yes! That is the kind of way Santiago would go to work. Try and  frighten Carr into parting with a substantial amount. But I do not think that  he would kill the goose with the golden eggs&mdash;at all events until he was in  possession of some of the eggs. No, I can&rsquo;t think the Mexican is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Joyce must have done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps.  But he is such a coward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  not either of those two, who is it?&rdquo; asked Bess. &ldquo;Not Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked at her, &ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; he said coolly, &ldquo;you see the alibi you  provide for Frisco does not touch the subject. You saw the man at the door when  three shots were fired. Well, if you remember at the inquest it was proved&mdash;as  much as it could be proved&mdash;that those three shots were fired at a dead body.  Therefore when you heard them the man was already dead. Why should Frisco not  have done it and then come down leaving his accomplice to do what he liked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;it was the bullet that killed the Colonel&mdash;the  old fashioned bullet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fired  from this if I am not mistaken,&rdquo; went on Herrick producing the pistol.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t be sure of that. And admitting that it is so, how did the pistol come  into possession of Joyce, if Frisco used it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am in the dark there,&rdquo; said Herrick vexedly. &ldquo;I must get the truth out of  Joyce. Time to see him now,&rdquo; and he glanced at his watch. &ldquo;As to the pistol I&rsquo;ll  see Bridge and find out if the bullet fits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  held out her hand. &ldquo;Let me do that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;while you are watching Joyce  and the Mexican I can attend to that matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think you will be able?&rdquo; hesitated Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am certain I can. Besides I want to have some part in the discovery of the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor handed her the pistol. He knew that she was a clever girl, and would not  undertake a thing unless she could execute it thoroughly. &ldquo;You and I can do the  detective business together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will look after Joyce and Santiago  and Frisco if I can find him; your part will be to trace the pistol and to see  if the bullet fits. You can manage Bridge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo;  replied Bess, putting the pistol away, &ldquo;he is so conceited that a little  flattery goes a long way with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let him meddle in this matter. He will only spoil it. I know what to do. Leave  it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim took up his hat to go. Suddenly he recollected a point he had not yet  discussed and sat down again. &ldquo;About Pentland Corn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do you think  of him Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a good man,&rdquo; she replied promptly, &ldquo;but he is weak. I am sure there is  nothing wrong about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  why should he make such a friend of Santiago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know. Shall I ask him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  would not tell you the truth if you did. He has his own secrets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  nodded. &ldquo;But I do not believe they are bad secrets,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the rector is a  man with a past&mdash;a sad past. Did you know he was a soldier before he became a  parson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Dr. Jim, &ldquo;and yet I always thought he had a martial air about him. Why  did he leave the army?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said he had a call. No!&rdquo; added Bess hastily seeing the doctor&rsquo;s lip curl, &ldquo;I do  not think he is a hypocrite. He is most devout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I do not believe much in that emotional religion,&rdquo; said Jim with a shake of his  head, &ldquo;a call had he, and left the army for that? I should like to hear a more  feasible story. He was a friend of Colonel Carr&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he was the only person the Colonel saw, and he used to go very often to &lsquo;The  Pines.&rsquo; But I do not think he did Colonel Carr much good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary it is probable that the Colonel did a weak man like that a good  deal of harm,&rdquo; Herrick stopped; then said suddenly. &ldquo;He knows something about  this murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  makes you think so?&rdquo; said Bess startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!  He did not come to the inquest, and seeing that he was the parson of the parish  and a great friend of the dead man I think that strange myself. Also when I met  him in the morning after the murder he talked nonsense, sheer nonsense, and was  in a sort of hysterical condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  might have been because of the shock,&rdquo; replied Bess thoughtfully, &ldquo;I know one  thing at least about Mr. Corn. He will not look upon a corpse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, nor does anyone else. The parishioners are sometimes annoyed because  he will not come and see their dead. Mr. Corn will pray with a dying person but  he will not look on a dead one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  And he was a soldier!&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I must look into this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have quite enough to do at present I think. I will see to the pistol, and you  can go now to Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we can meet and compare notes. And Bess, we understand one another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Endicotte flushed. &ldquo;I wish you would not talk nonsense,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there are  other and more important things to think of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim would have protested, but she re-entered the house, and left him to his own  thoughts. These were pleasant in spite of the discovery of Robin&rsquo;s iniquities.  Jim now saw that he had been in love with Bess without knowing it. The shock of  Joyce&rsquo;s wooing had brought about the discovery. &ldquo;And what a fool I have been  not to see it before!&rdquo; said Dr. Jim. &ldquo;No wonder they say Love is blind,&rdquo; and he  whistled light-heartedly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    Robin Joyce Explains Himself</b></h2>
  <p>Whether  it was the charm of the girl&rsquo;s society based upon his new discovery, or the  interest of the conversation from a detective&rsquo;s point of view, that detained  Herrick with her for over two hours, it is impossible to say. Probably Dr. Jim  could not have given a satisfactory answer himself. But as he hurried along the  road to the Carr Arms he acknowledged that he had been dilatory, for in two  hours Robin could have got away from Saxham. But Dr. Jim did not think he would  go. Robin was a child in many ways, and was not quick in making plans. Besides,  he would be bewildered by the sudden revelation of his rascality and for the  moment he would not be able to think of his own safety. Or at least if he did  think, he would be unable to make any plans. Also&mdash;and of this Herrick was  certain&mdash;he had very little money to come and go on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  thought the doctor, as he swung into the village green, &ldquo;Robin knows better  than to give me the slip. He would be afraid that I would show him no mercy  when I caught him up. Probably he will make out some story and implore me for  the sake of our past friendship to be silent. If he tells me the whole truth  and if he did not actually kill Carr, I might&mdash;but then he insulted Bess, and  tried to get her into danger.&rdquo; The doctor clenched his fist and frowned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  give him a thrashing at all events. There is a bad time coming for you Robin my  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  prognostications of Dr. Jim proved to be correct. Joyce had not attempted  flight. He was waiting in his sitting-room for the coming of the doctor, and he  looked horribly frightened. Herrick could have found it in his heart to be  sorry for the wretched little creature with his white haggard face and staring  eyes; but he remembered what was at stake, and made up his mind to be stern  even to the verge of brutality. For all he knew this treacherous little  scoundrel might have hinted to the outside world that Bess was involved in the  murder of Carr. If he had done this, Herrick considered that nothing would be  too bad for him. It was in a very stern frame of mind that Dr. Jim sat down  opposite his former friend. Robin winced at the regard of those once kind eyes.  He felt like a rabbit in the presence of a boa-constrictor. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Jim  grimly eying the miserable wretch, &ldquo;and what have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;  returned Robin sullenly. &ldquo;I am afraid I shall not be satisfied with that Joyce.  You will have to tell me the whole of your doings, from first to last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have done nothing so very wrong Jim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; interposed Herrick, &ldquo;I think you had better call me by my last name.  We are not friends now you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will,  I call you Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; said Robin with a small sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it might be better&mdash;sir,&rdquo; drawled Herrick, and the contempt in his tone  made the self-satisfied Joyce wince.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had done anything wrong I should not have waited to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; replied the plain-spoken Jim. &ldquo;You know me better than that. Had you  bolted I should have had the police on your track before night-fall. You know  me, as I said before. Your only chance is to make a clean breast of this damnable  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  bandy words with me Joyce. It won&rsquo;t do. You are in a cleft stick and no amount  of wriggling will serve you. If you want a lead here is one. You told me at  Southberry that you went up up see Frith and Frith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I did.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lord!&rdquo; cried Herrick in a tone of disgust &ldquo;will you never be done with your  petty falsehoods. I know that you have not seen the solicitors for some  months&mdash;certainly not on the twenty-fourth of July. Frith told me how you tried  to get your mother&rsquo;s annuity transferred to yourself. Come now! Don&rsquo;t play the  fool with me. You did not sleep at the Hull hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I went there. And I know also that you alighted from the seven train at  Heathcroft station, and rode on your bicycle to Saxham&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know for what  purpose, unless it was to kill the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; this time Joyce was really afraid. &ldquo;I did not kill him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  remains to be proved. What about that pistol you slipped into the drawer of  Bess Endicotte&rsquo;s writing-table&mdash;now, you are about to lie again! It won&rsquo;t  do;&mdash;it won&rsquo;t do. The truth, you rat of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  call names,&rdquo; muttered Joyce weakly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon. I will not call you any more names. Let us conduct this  conversation calmly. But you have to tell me the whole truth, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Joyce defiantly, &ldquo;and if I refuse? What then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will hand you over to the Beorminster police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have no evidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have more than you think of. You ass,&rdquo; said Herrick in a cold rage, &ldquo;for the  sake of our past friendship I have been sparing you all these weeks. I got you  down here in the hope that you would be man enough to come forward and confess  your follies. I do not say crimes, for you have not pluck enough to commit the  smallest. But you kept your own counsel, and thought you were pulling wool over  my eyes. I have seen through all these weeks. And now you insult the woman I  love, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  jumped up in a childish rage. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love her&mdash;you won&rsquo;t marry her,&rdquo; he  panted. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down,&rdquo; commanded Herrick sternly, &ldquo;you have nothing to say in the matter. Leave  Miss Endicotte&rsquo;s name out of it. We have had enough of this nonsense. Confess  what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Joyce set his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Then I shall send for the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  dare not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  You think so.&rdquo; Herrick rose and walked towards the bell. Joyce anticipated him  and stood in his path with flashing eyes. Herrick laughed. &ldquo;Are you about to  measure your strength against mine?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Before  he could speak further the little man had flung himself at his throat like a  wild beast. Strong as Herrick was, the abnormal nerve force of Joyce made him  no mean antagonist. But the contest was unequal, and at last Herrick lifted  Joyce above his head, shook him as a terrier does a rat, and pitched him  headlong into a chair, where the creature, helpless, and overborne, sat  gnashing his teeth and glaring. For the moment Herrick thought he was mad. &ldquo;Have  you had enough?&rdquo; asked the doctor recovering his breath, &ldquo;if not I am quite  willing to administer the thrashing you so richly deserve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  still glared and stamped in impotent rage. Then he suddenly burst into tears  and hid his face in his hands. &ldquo;You great brute,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;you might spare  me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spare  you!&rdquo; echoed Herrick contemptuously, &ldquo;and did you think of sparing that poor  girl, whom you were trying to blackmail into marriage! You may thank your stars  Joyce that you have to deal with a man who knows you as I do. If it had been  another man, they would have left you half dead on the floor. You shall have  justice from me, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  still continued to sob, and huddled up in the big chair looked scarcely as  large as a child. &ldquo;I feel ill&mdash;ill&mdash;horribly ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  feel much worse before I&rsquo;ve done with you,&rdquo; said the relentless Herrick, &ldquo;sit  up and talk rationally. All this won&rsquo;t do with me. You have tried all your  tricks, they are of no avail. Here are pen ink and paper. I intend to take down  all you say, and you will sign the statement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see you to the devil first,&rdquo; cried Joyce sitting up tear-stained and  dishevelled but with an evil look in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will do exactly as you are bid,&rdquo; replied Herrick selecting a pen, &ldquo;now begin,  and tell no lies. I have information of which you know nothing, and if I catch  you tripping&mdash;well you know what to expect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  saw that he was helpless. He had tried defiance, force, tears, and was now at  the end of his resources. Herrick pitilessly held to his point. Seeing that  there was no help for it, the little scamp dried his eyes, arranged his coat  and hardened himself into a reasonable frame of mind. &ldquo;You have the whip hand,&rdquo;  he said sullenly, &ldquo;so I must give in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that is very wise of you. After all you might have known that such  play-acting would not impose upon me. Now you are to tell me all you did at  Saxham on that night and why you came down. I shall probably ask you a few  questions to which I shall require truthful answers. And remember what I said.  I know more about your doings than you give me credit for. I can tell if you  speak the truth or not. Now go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim squared his elbows and settled himself to write. Joyce cast one look at the  door as though he meditated flight. But he knew that such a dash for liberty  would result in his incarceration in prison so he abandoned it and sullenly  began to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did come down to Saxham on the twenty-fourth,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so. And your story of seeing Frith and Frith was a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I did not want you to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  only that, but you wished to make use of me. I was to prove your alibi, Eh? You  chose this country for our walking tour on purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  planned the whole thing,&rdquo; said Joyce shamelessly and with something of pleasure  in his own cleverness. &ldquo;You think yourself clever Herrick, but I, whom you have  always despised, have made a tool of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  to a point you have no doubt. But there is a proverb about playing with edged  tools, you seem to have forgotten. As to your saying that I despise you I never  did so, until I found out&mdash;never mind how&mdash;that you had told me a lie about  going to London from Southberry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was my own business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I was to be your tool, as you have just said. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  thought for a moment. &ldquo;As I have done nothing so very wrong,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there  is no reason why I should not tell you everything from the beginning. I suppose  you will admit that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  reason at all. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Well then until my mother died I had no idea of her position&mdash;nor,&rdquo; added  Joyce, &ldquo;have I any very clear idea now. She left a paper behind her which  explained much, but not all. I will show it to you when you come up to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you; I will remind you of that promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  scowled and continued. &ldquo;My mother said that between a certain Colonel Carr and  herself there existed a business arrangement that she should receive five  hundred a year for her life. The arrangement was made by my dead father for  services rendered to Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  were those services?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is one of the things I do not know. The paper said nothing about them. The five  hundred a year was to be paid to my mother and when she died it was to stop. So  you see that in place of having an income as I thought I was left a pauper. My  mother had saved some money&mdash;about three hundred pounds. I am living on that  now. I was in despair, and I went to the solicitors who pay the annuity to ask  if Colonel Carr would continue it. They wrote to the Colonel and he refused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; said Herrick smoothly, &ldquo;Frith told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have meddled a good deal in my business,&rdquo; sneered Joyce. &ldquo;Well, I was  again in despair, as I saw nothing before me but a life of hard work. I read  over the paper again. My mother said in it that Carr was a dangerous man, but  that he had enemies, who threatened to kill him. She advised me to see him, but  to take all precautions against my visit being known to anyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Dr. Jim, &ldquo;I see no reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  did I,&rdquo; responded Robin with a shrug; he was now quite himself again and seemed  to enjoy the telling of the story. &ldquo;She hinted however that if Colonel Carr  ever died by violence&mdash;and she was sure he would&mdash;I might be accused of the  crime if I went to see him. She said that it was dangerous to be in his company  for that reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me a very ridiculous reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it was. All the same as she knew more about the matter than I did, I  thought it best to adopt her suggestion. I wished to see Carr and ask him to  continue the annuity. But I wished to see him secretly so that if he was  murdered&mdash;as my mother hinted&mdash;I should not be dragged into the matter. For  that reason I made the plans you blame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  were a fool to do so,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim vigorously, &ldquo;why in the name of heaven did  you not tell me all this? I should have come and seen Carr with you openly. I  should not have been afraid of being implicated in a crime, though the man were  murdered half a dozen times over. The secret means you took to avert suspicion  falling on you, have only resulted in your being suspected&mdash;at least by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you did not suspect me?&rdquo; said Joyce snappishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  of the crime, for I know what a coward you are. But you know something about  it. Still, if the police knew all I do, you would find yourself in Queer  Street. Again I say that in your desire to avert suspicion from yourself, you  have brought it upon your head. However I think the reason given in the paper  you speak of ridiculous. Go on. What of your plans? How were they carried out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  first looked up a map of the country to see where Carr lived. Then as you had  proposed a walking tour, I induced you to take the route which ran right across  Carr&rsquo;s place. I thought if anything occurred you could prove that I was with  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  did you expect the man to be murdered while we were on our tour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know what might happen. As it was I knew the man was dead when I  rejoined you at Southberry. But my idea was to see him, and then to pass  afterwards with you through the village. When I set out on the walking tour I  never thought he would be murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was, to say the least, strange that Carr should meet with his death at so  critical a moment to you,&rdquo; said Herrick doubtfully, &ldquo;he had lived safely for  ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was chance I suppose. At all events I did not kill him as you seem to suppose.  I simply wished to see him about the annuity. When I left you at Southberry and  went to London on the plea of seeing Frith and Frith, I left my bag at the Hull  Hotel to provide a second alibi. I intended to get down and see Carr, then be  back and sleep at the Hull Hotel on that night. It was the murder that threw me  out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed. &ldquo;And it was the murder against which you were taking all these  precautions. How ironical! Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to my flat and got my bicycle, and I wrapped myself up in my great-coat.  Then I went down to Saxham by the Heathcroft line. I alighted there at seven o&rsquo;clock;  had something to eat at the railway bar, and then rode on my bicycle to Saxham.  I found the house from the map and waited in the pine woods before I could make  up my mind to go in and seek for an interview.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time did you hide in the Pine Woods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between  eight and nine o&rsquo;clock. While there I heard a single shot. It frightened me.  But I did not think that it was murder. No,&rdquo; said Robin to himself with a  shiver, &ldquo;I did not think it was murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be the death shot,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;seeing that Miss Bess heard the other  three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard them also. But that was after nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  all this time you remained near the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I went on to the other side of the Pine wood keeping the tower in sight. I saw  a girl with a lantern searching the wood. She passed near where I lay and I saw  her plainly. That is how I recognised her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why did you accuse her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought she might have had something to do with the crime,&rdquo; said Joyce  sullenly, &ldquo;you must confess it was queer to see a girl in the woods at that  hour. If she was innocent why should she have been about the house so late?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you dare to hint that she is not innocent,&rdquo; cried Herrick violently. &ldquo;She went  to look for her brother Sidney. She heard the shots too. Did you see Frisco at  the door of the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  It was some time after I lost sight of Miss Bess that I heard the shots, I  thought she might have fired them. I waited till ten o&rsquo;clock, and then thought  I would go and see what was the matter. I walked through the wood, and entered  the house. It was all alight and quite deserted, just as we found it. As I had  heard the shots in the tower I climbed up. At the top I saw what you and I  saw&mdash;the dead body of the Colonel. He was quite dead. I was afraid, for the  very thing I dreaded had come to pass. I saw how wise was my mother&rsquo;s advice,  and being afraid lest someone should come and I should be arrested for the  crime I went away. I got my bicycle which I had left in the Pine wood and rode  back to Heathcroft. I found the last train gone, so I could not get back to the  Hull Hotel. I feared to sleep in any inn lest the police, when the crime was  discovered, should make search for strangers. I passed the night in a wood,  then rode on at dawn to a station beyond Heathcroft, where I got a cup of  coffee at the bar of the station. Then I took the train back to London, went to  the Hull Hotel, and said that I had passed the night with a friend. Afterwards  I caught the Southberry train and rejoined you. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  very pretty story!&rdquo; remarked Herrick grimly, &ldquo;then you were anxious to push on  across the moor that we might find the body together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly; I thought it would be already found when we arrived. However when I  saw the house blazing I knew that nothing had been disturbed. We went in  and&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that you took a fit of hysteria,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I thought it was fatigue,  but now I understand it was because you were playing a part. This is all very  well, how do I know you did not kill the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not; I swear I did not,&rdquo; cried Joyce with a shiver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about that pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  has nothing to do with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it not the weapon that was used?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  hesitated and wriggled. &ldquo;I do not see why you should ask me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you indeed,&rdquo; said Herrick grimly, &ldquo;I see a very good reason. Carr was shot  through the heart with a bullet that might very well fit that ancient weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that I put it into the drawer at &lsquo;The Grange?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to lie about that? It won&rsquo;t do Joyce. I saw that pistol at your  flat,&mdash;in your tobacco cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  turned white. He had been quite prepared to lie, but this information showed  him how futile that would be. &ldquo;How did you find it in there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I wasn&rsquo;t poking and prying. Manuel hunting for cigarettes showed it to me. He  dropped across it by accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  sprang to his feet. &ldquo;The liar, oh, the liar!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Manuel! why he knew it  was in the cabinet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he placed it there, Eh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said so!&rdquo; muttered Robin passing his tongue over his dry lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but I can see it it your face. Evidently Manuel played upon you the same trick  you intended to play upon Bess. A nice pair, upon my soul!&rdquo; Herrick paused for  a moment. &ldquo;What has Manuel to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  that I know of,&rdquo; retorted Joyce sullenly. &ldquo;He brought me the pistol, but  refused to say where he got it. He knows something of this matter I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am very certain he does. However, I&rsquo;ll speak to him. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  went over to Beorminster this afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good I&rsquo;ll see him when he comes back. By the way, you told me a lie about him,  Johnstone did not introduce you at the Apollo Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Since you know so much you might as well know more,&rdquo;  he said coolly. &ldquo;I met Manuel at the Pimlico gambling club. We played together  and became friends. Oddly enough, he knew all about Carr. That drew us  together. We talked a good deal about the business, and I told him what I told  you. But he is a scoundrel,&rdquo; said Joyce gritting his teeth, &ldquo;he wants to make  out that I shot Carr with that pistol, and showed it to you in my flat to  inculpate me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  was what you proposed to do with that girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did,&rdquo; said Robin sullenly. &ldquo;I wanted to marry her; and I made my plans so that  she should not dare to refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  rose to his feet. &ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;I had intended to give you a  thrashing; but you are such a miserable wretch that if I man-handled you I  should probably kill you. You can go free for me. But you shall leave this  place by the five o&rsquo;clock train from Beorminster. I&rsquo;ll see to it myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you would,&rdquo; sneered Joyce, &ldquo;so I have packed my clothes. And what are  you going to do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep  an eye on you. Go back to your flat. If you try to run I&rsquo;ll have you arrested.  Do not think because I send you to London that you will be beyond the reach of  my arm. You and Manuel are plotting to get this money of Stephen Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not, whatever Santiago may be doing. He got everything out of me and told me  nothing in return. Save that he knew Carr and hated him I do not know anything.  I don&rsquo;t believe that the pistol is the one used in the murder. Santiago  probably read about an old-fashioned weapon being used, and knowing that I was  down here on the night put that pistol&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes, I see all that. You see what a scoundrel you have taken up with! Upon my  word Joyce, you had better have stuck to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too late now,&rdquo; said Robin with something of a sob, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never trust me  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  replied Herrick calmly, &ldquo;I have not yet got to the bottom of this business. But  I believe you are the tool rather than the accomplice of this Mexican. However  I will deal with him. You go to London, and hold yourself in readiness for my  orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be even with Santiago yet for his treachery,&rdquo; said Robin rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you can settle between yourselves. Hullo, don&rsquo;t go yet. Sign this paper. I have  written down all you told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t sign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will, and at once. I will be the witness. If you don&rsquo;t I will not protect you  in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t let me get into trouble?&rdquo; said Joyce taking the pen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if what you have told me is true. Sign.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Joyce signed and Herrick witnessed the document. The doctor placed it in his pocket  and then ordered a trap from Napper. After Joyce had paid his bill, the doctor  drove him to Beorminster. The five o&rsquo;clock train was on the point of departure,  but he just managed to catch it. As he flung himself into a carriage he held  out his hand to Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Jim coldly, &ldquo;we have done with all that. And no tricks, or you&rsquo;ll get  the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go straight to my flat,&rdquo; said Joyce sulkily, and as the train steamed out of  the station he cursed his former friend.</p>
  <p>He  would have cursed him still more if he had seen what he did next. The doctor  went to the telegraph office, and wrote out a wire describing Joyce&rsquo;s face,  clothes, figure, and all: also set down the train by which he would arrive at  Paddington. This he sent to a firm of private detectives with whom he had  already done business. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Herrick with a grim smile when the wire  was despatched, &ldquo;Joyce will be watched from the moment he gets to town. Any  tricks, and&mdash;&rdquo; the doctor laughed.</p>
  <p>Apparently  he did not yet trust the little man in spite of his confession.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    Bess The Detective</b></h2>
  <p>In  this way Saxham was purged of one undesirable person. Herrick was pleased that  he had acted with such promptitude. Bess would no longer be vexed by the odious  attentions of the little scamp who had tormented her. Dr. Jim smiled to think  how much of the jealous rival there was about his dealings with his quondam  friend. He now recognised that Bess was the woman he desired for his wife. Nor  did he think she would refuse to become Mrs. Herrick when he could give her a  home worthy of her. Had she disliked his attentions, she would not have  permitted even the strange hour&rsquo;s wooing, which was all they had of love, since  Jim had found his heart. He laughed at the recollection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  talk of love between intervals of detective analysis,&rdquo; he thought as he walked  back to Saxham, having sent on Napper&rsquo;s cart by the groom, &ldquo;is a strange way of  wooing one&rsquo;s wife, and the last kind I expected to indulge in. But Bess enjoyed  it I fancy. I must recompense myself in a more leisurely way, when this  business is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  arriving at Saxham, the doctor called in at the Carr Arms to see Don Manuel. He  wanted to hear from the man himself if he had really given the pistol to Joyce,  and if so how it had come into his possession. It might be that he had bought  it in order to incriminate Robin&mdash;although at present Herrick could see no very  good reason for such incrimination&mdash;on the other hand the pistol might be the  veritable weapon used to shoot Carr. But that could be proved only by the test  of the bullet, and he would have to wait until Bess saw Bridge about that. In  some way Herrick felt convinced that Santiago was connected with the crime. He  had known and hated Carr; he was far too intimate with Joyce for mere  friendship, and he showed too great a desire to remain in the parish. That he  should have in some way gained possession of the real pistol was not unlikely. &ldquo;And  it might be that he used it himself,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim as he entered the inn, &ldquo;although  I should think he would have used a more modern weapon for choice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  speaking to Napper about the Mexican a shock awaited him. The landlord  expressed the broadest surprise that Mr. Joyce had not told Dr. Herrick of  Santiago&rsquo;s departure. The Mexican had gone to London by an early train. Herrick  swore beneath his breath, feeling that he had been outwitted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  Mr. Joyce came back here this afternoon did he see Don Manuel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye  sir, that he did. The foreigner was waiting for him, and they talked for an  hour. After that Don Manuel came down with his trunk&mdash;he had but one, doctor,  and drove in to catch an earlier train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  Beorminster?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir. To Heathcroft. He paid his bill alright though. But I was astonished Mr.  Joyce left us so suddenly. There is nothing wrong I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  no means,&rdquo; replied Herrick with a carelessness he was far from feeling. &ldquo;I  believe Don Manuel had to go up on business, and asked Mr. Joyce to join him  later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  they be coming here again sir?&rdquo; asked Napper, and on receiving a reply in the  negative expressed his regret. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t pay much, but they was sure,&rdquo; said  the worthy landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear Se&ntilde;or Santiago say <i>where</i> he was going?&rdquo; asked Herrick. But this the  landlord could not tell him.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim walked away annoyed that he had been taken in. He felt that Robin had been  tutored to play his part by the cleverer scoundrel. No doubt Robin had told the  Mexican of his intrusion into the case, and Santiago had taken alarm. He knew  well enough that Dr. Jim would recognise the pistol, and that he would force  Robin to say where he had obtained it. Evidently Don Manuel thought it would be  better for him to disappear than to face an examination. Yet he could have told  Joyce to make up some story about the pistol so that he might not be brought  into it. The whole business was part of the conspiracy. Don Manuel was in it,  Robin also, and Herrick felt that the firm of Joyce and Santiago had been one  too many for him.</p>
  <p>All  the same he remembered that he had set a watch on Joyce. If the scamp tried to  hide, or went to any place to meet Manuel, he would be followed. &ldquo;I shall go up  to Town to-morrow,&rdquo; said Herrick on his way to &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; &ldquo;Wherever Joyce has  gone, there Manuel will be. I shall run both to earth and learn what all this  means by questioning them in each other&rsquo;s company. They won&rsquo;t trick me a second  time! Well, I have done enough detective work for the day. I&rsquo;ll think of  something else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  was now so far on the road to recovery, that he was able to leave his room. He  had seen little of Jim lately, but he did not miss him, thanks to the constant  attendance of Ida. Marsh-Carr was as devoted a friend as ever to Herrick, he  still believed him the cleverest and best of men, but now his whole heart was  filled with the image of Ida. The two were constantly together, and the girl  had had no small share in nursing back her promised husband to health. The  wound in the head had mended and the blow had left no effect behind it beyond  an occasional head-ache.</p>
  <p>Stephen  never gave his assailant a thought. He quite forgot Carr&rsquo;s tragic death, and  all the strange circumstances which had brought about his change of fortune. At  times he even ceased to remember his step-mother, much as he had loved her. All  his thoughts were for Ida, and with her he passed hours planning their future.  They never talked of the past, and noticing this, Herrick forebore to tell his  friend that he was still working to discover the murderer of Colonel Carr, and  striving to baffle a possible conspiracy that had for its aim, the loss to  Stephen not only of the Carr fortune, but possibly also of his life. Jim felt  quite competent to deal with the matter himself, and did not think it necessary  to spoil Marsh-Carr&rsquo;s love-making with such common-place things. Therefore he  remained in ignorance of Herrick&rsquo;s doings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  late you are,&rdquo; said Stephen who was already dressed for dinner. &ldquo;I have been  anxiously expecting you this last hour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to go into Beorminster,&rdquo; said Herrick carelessly. &ldquo;Joyce has been called up  to town and I went to see the last of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad he has gone,&rdquo; Stephen said gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him. I think he is  false. As for the Mexican&mdash;&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>Herrick,  who was pouring himself a glass of sherry as an appetizer turned with a laugh. &ldquo;The  Mexican is a bad lot sure enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As to Joyce he is more of a fool  than a knave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  forgot that he was your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do quite right to use the past tense Steve. He <i>was</i> my friend, but he is so no  longer.&rdquo; Herrick laughed again and sipped his sherry. &ldquo;I have taken you for a  change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well that I will never fail you,&rdquo; said Stephen warmly. &ldquo;No. I suppose we  shall remain good friends till you marry. Then you will forget me, and think  only of your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know better than that Jim. Besides Ida is fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. I was fond of Ida too at one time&mdash;that was before she was engaged to  you. But I have not played you false Steve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are telling me old news,&rdquo; replied Marsh-Carr smiling. &ldquo;I saw that you were in  love with Ida.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I was never in love. I thought I was, but my love was a snare and a delusion.  But you thought so did you? Were you not jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I knew that Ida was mine, and I trusted her&mdash;you too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonderful  man!&rdquo; said Herrick looking into the fire. &ldquo;Well you did right to trust us both.  We are merely friends now. Indeed I know we never were anything else. I was  blind; but she was not. However I am glad that you two are engaged. You will be  happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when am I to congratulate you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  this very minute if you like. Is it Bess you are talking of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  sat up on the sofa looking astonished. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Ida saw that she was in  love with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ida  is a clever woman. She prophesied my love would come suddenly. Bess has not yet  formally consented to be my wife; but I think it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am more than delighted. We shall be brothers-in-law. And you will always stay  here Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Living  on you my dear fellow? No, I shall start practice again in Town, when I have  got together sufficient money. Then when I am doing fairly well Bess shall come  to me and supplement my income by writing novels in the intervals of looking  after the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Herrick  you must not go away. You promised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until  you were married. But be of good cheer Steve, I won&rsquo;t leave you until  everything is right.&rdquo; Dr. Jim said these last words with a significance which  was lost on his listener.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought that your friend Joyce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  he never had a chance. I was a fool to let him hang after Bess. However I found  out to-day what she was to me, so it is all right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess  and Ida are coming over this evening with Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the better. I can make my proposal in due form. By the way Steve I am going up  Town to-morrow if you can spare me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  But it is not to make arrangements to leave me is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think not! I shall never go till you tell me Steve. No, I am going to  see about some business of my own. Well I must dress. I hope you have a good  dinner for me. I am very hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  think of nothing but eating,&rdquo; said Stephen with a laugh.</p>
  <p>The  dinner gave every satisfaction even to Herrick who was somewhat fastidious. But  Ida had seen that a good cook was engaged, and the two men had nothing to  complain of. Dinner over, Herrick supported Stephen into the library, and  placed him on the sofa. Then he sat beside him and they smoked over their  coffee and cognac. &ldquo;But you must go to bed at half past ten,&rdquo; said Herrick  sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a tyrant you are Jim. Hark, there are the girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  came in looking charming, and in the best of spirits. It needed but a glance  for Dr. Jim to see that Bess had said nothing about Joyce to her brother or  sister. What a wise little woman she was! When Ida and Frank had seated  themselves beside Stephen, Jim drew her into a remote corner of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said nothing about our adventure of to-day,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she replied in the same tone, &ldquo;I thought it best not to. And Mr. Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not be troubled with him again. He has gone to town. I do not think he  will come back. Santiago has gone also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about his threat against me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is alright. I have his confession in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he kill Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I have not yet solved that problem. But do not let us talk of these unpleasant  things any more Bess. To-morrow you shall know all. In the meantime make  yourself agreeable to me and tell me how much you love me. Come now. After this  afternoon you cannot deny&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  neither deny nor affirm,&rdquo; said Bess her face one glow of scarlet&mdash;but that  might have been the fire&mdash;&ldquo;you were not in earnest to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  I was. Can&rsquo;t you see that I love you with my whole heart and soul! I never knew  until to-day how much I did love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it was Ida?&rdquo; faltered Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so too for a period of madness. But I know now that I was mistaken. We  are the best of friends as you can see. But you have not replied to my  question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want me to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I am the dearest man in the world, and that you have loved me for ever so long.  Come now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true,&rdquo; said Bess sinking her voice. &ldquo;I have loved you. I do love you and I  am thankful to be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a poor doctor remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love you for yourself, not for any money you may have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo;  said Herrick, &ldquo;that is lucky for me! Come here. Behind this screen&mdash;there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Dr. Jim&mdash;No&mdash;Very well. Jim, without the doctor. Do not go on like this. We are  not alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you come into another room?&rdquo; teased Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. Jim what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leading  you into the world,&rdquo; said Herrick laughing. Bess laughed also and blushed when  Jim led her before the three astonished people who looked at them in amazement.  &ldquo;Lady and gentlemen,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;do you know who this is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess  I suppose,&rdquo; said the stupid brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  more than that,&rdquo; cried Ida rising to take her sister in her arms, &ldquo;oh! Bess  darling, I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  cried Stephen and pinched Frank&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>That  youth was still dense, although the truth was staring him in the face. He  looked at the two girls almost weeping with pleasure in one another&rsquo;s arms; at  the laughing faces of Herrick and Stephen. Still he did not understand, not  having yet experienced the love of woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are stupid Frank,&rdquo; cried Ida, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you see,&rdquo; said Herrick gripping Frank&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;What a blind brother-in-law I  shall have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Frank&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Are you to marry Bess?&rdquo; Herrick nodded. &ldquo;And Stephen  takes Ida?&rdquo; the engaged couple laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;that is two of  them gone, and who is to look after Biffstead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Flo  of course,&rdquo; said Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  if she could! Bess is the top, tail, and bottom of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  she is,&rdquo; cried Ida hugging her sister, &ldquo;and I am jealous of Jim taking her away  from us!&rdquo; Then she gave Herrick a roguish glance. &ldquo;Was I not right?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  right,&rdquo; he replied, and drew Bess down on the seat beside him. Ida went as by  instinct to Stephen. Only the miserable Frank was left out in the cold, and  said so. The quartette laughed heartlessly.</p>
  <p>There  was not a happier party in the whole three kingdoms than that seated before the  fire in the house of wicked Colonel Carr. If the shade of the old man had been  present in the room, he must&mdash;or rather <i>It</i> must have sighed enviously at the  sight of such happiness. Not during his reign had such truth and honour and  clean delight prevailed in the old house. It was a merry evening. &ldquo;Memory of  the Golden Age,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
  <p>The  next morning Dr. Herrick re-entered the work-a-day world. He walked over to  Biffstead and found Bess just setting out for Beorminster on her bicycle. &ldquo;You  can leave that,&rdquo; he said after a kiss had been exchanged, &ldquo;I will drive you  over to Beorminster in the cart. I told the groom to put in the horse and bring  it round here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are going to Town?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  On the track of those two scamps. You are going to see Bridge about that  bullet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  I have the pistol in my pocket,&rdquo; she replied showing it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Can you drive the cart back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I can. Drive? Who ever heard of asking a country girl such a question.  You do not know my accomplishments Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that you are the dearest and sweetest and most sensible girl in the whole  wide world. But I say we won&rsquo;t take the groom. In the first place I want you  all to myself. In the second, I must tell you all that took place when I  interviewed Joyce yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess,  needless to say thought this a capital plan, so when the groom brought round  the cart he was sent away. He saw the pair drive towards the village and there  was a broad grin on his face. He knew very well what they were to one another.  In some mysterious way the news had got to the servants&rsquo; hall and had been well  discussed that very morning. The lovers drove into Beorminster and talked in  the most matter of fact way about the conspiracy. Their heads were so close  together that one would have thought they were exchanging the tenderest  confidences. In place of that the detective fever was raging in both their  breasts, and they were like a couple of Scotland Yard officials.</p>
  <p>Then  Herrick took a last farewell, promised to return in the course of a few days,  and caught the express. When the train disappeared round the curve Bess went  back to the cart and drove it to some stables where she put it up. Afterwards  she went into the lower part of Beorminster where Mr. Inspector Bridge had his  office. He happened to be in and brightened up when he saw her. Bridge had a  great opinion of the younger Miss Endicotte.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  good wind brings you here Miss?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said Bess solemnly, &ldquo;that requires some telling Mr. Inspector. It is about this  pistol?&rdquo; and she produced it from her pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pistol!&rdquo;  echoed Bridge puzzled, &ldquo;ah! it is the pistol of the Carr case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I want to find out,&rdquo; said Miss Endicotte who had her story all ready to  tell, and had discussed its details with Dr. Jim during the drive. &ldquo;I found  this the other day in the Pine wood near Colonel Carr&rsquo;s house. It is a clumsy  old-fashioned thing; but I remembered what was said about the bullet being  old-fashioned also. Now I want you to see if the bullet fits the muzzle of  this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  said Bridge with his most important air and looking down the muzzle, &ldquo;so you  found this pistol in the grass&mdash;and near the house? Perhaps&mdash;I say perhaps mind  you Miss Bess&mdash;this might be the weapon we have been looking for so long. Is  there a name on the butt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Bess promptly, &ldquo;you only find that in novels. There is not so much as a  scratch on the handle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  old weapon,&rdquo; observed Bridge wagging his head ponderously and irritating Bess  to a frenzy with his platitudes. &ldquo;Well, we must see if the bullet&mdash;Ha! yes, the  bullet. Now where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bridge  went hunting over some shelves, and then he took to excavating in  drawers&mdash;opened a safe, dug under dusty piles of papers, and suddenly produced  (Bess never saw from where) a small box in which something rattled. When he  opened this there were three conical bullets and one fat round one. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried  Bess, &ldquo;there it is. Try! please try Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  in good time Miss,&rdquo; said the aggravating Bridge, and dropped the bullet into  the muzzle. It disappeared, and he nodded solemnly. &ldquo;It is the pistol,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;you have made a valuable discovery Miss. If there was only a name or  initials on the handle,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
  <p>Bess  was not attending to him. She took the pistol and dropped out the bullet; then  rammed it home again, and nodded in her turn. &ldquo;There is no doubt of it,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;this the pistol that shot Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you leave it with me Miss?&rdquo; asked Bridge, &ldquo;I might find out something likely to  lead to the detection of the assassin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  laughed delightedly. From that last phrase she knew that Inspector Bridge had  been reading detective fiction of the worst. She knew also that the pistol  would afford no clue to the truth until it was in capable hands. Therefore as she  thought it would be safer in the Beorminster police office than in the untidy  house of Biffstead where everybody was always turning over everybody else&rsquo;s  drawers she consented that Bridge should take charge of it. The Inspector with  an important air put away the pistol in his safe. He was about to replace the  box, when he noticed that Bess had the round bullet in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  Miss give it back?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Belongs to the Crown that does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  queer bullet,&rdquo; murmured Bess, &ldquo;made in a mould. Here is the seam. I do not  believe it is lead. It is too hard for lead. Have you a pen-knife Mr.  Inspector? Ah,&rdquo; she seized one lying on the desk, &ldquo;this will do. I don&rsquo;t  believe this is lead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said Bridge crossly, &ldquo;all bullets are made of lead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is not,&rdquo; cried Bess who was scratching away vigorously. &ldquo;See how hard it is.  And the scratches shine. Inspector Bridge,&rdquo; she said in a solemn tone, &ldquo;I  believe this is silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; The Inspector took it up and examined it in his turn. What Bess said  was true. The bullet was hard, not soft as lead should be, and moreover it was  hard to scratch, and the little scraping she had given it glittered in parts  just like silver. &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; murmured Bridge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is a silversmith just round the corner,&rdquo; said Bess in great excitement. &ldquo;Do  come and let him see it. I want to know for certain that it is silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know what good that will do Miss Bess. If it is silver that will not  help us to catch Frisco any the sooner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  but you can&rsquo;t think what discoveries you might make if you knew it was silver  for certain. I know how you can put things together, and a piece of evidence  like this&mdash;oh I am sure you could do a lot with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bridge  in his own heart did not very well see what he could do. But he was not proof  against flattery as the artful Bess well knew, so he went round the corner with  her to a convenient jeweller&rsquo;s and offered him the bullet. &ldquo;Will you please to  tell me what this is?&rdquo; he said in his most official tone. &ldquo;Do not destroy it  Mr. Blinks, or deform it in any way. It is the property of the Crown. All the  Crown wants to know is the metal of which this is formed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Blinks was much impressed with this speech. Promising to be careful he took the  bullet into the next room&mdash;into his workshop and there performed some trick of  the trade. When he returned he handed the bullet to Bridge very little altered.  &ldquo;It is of silver, Mr. Bridge,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of silver?&rdquo; asked Bridge while Bess tried to suppress her excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  of silver Mr. Bridge. It has been cast in a mould. Probably a cup or a silver  plate has been melted down. What is it Mr. Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  property of the Crown,&rdquo; replied Bridge solemnly and departed. When in the  office he locked up the bullet and looked at Bess. &ldquo;I really do not see how  this discovery can help me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  over it Mr. Inspector. You will be certain to hit upon some link.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Bess herself was as far away from the truth as the Inspector. As she drove back  to Saxham, she wondered how it came about that the bullet which had killed Carr  was cast in silver, and to this she could find no answer.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    Unexpected Evidence</b></h2>
  <p>The  surprising discovery that the bullet was of silver, elevated the crime from the  common-place to the romantic. That an old-fashioned weapon should have been  used in these days when firearms have reached such a pitch of perfection, was  remarkable enough, but that the assassin should have reverted to the  superstitions of the Middle Ages for his missile, was almost beyond belief. In  spite of her quick brain, Bess could not come to any decision. Failing a  discussion with Dr. Jim she resolved to leave the vexed question at rest.</p>
  <p>All  the same she did not pause in her detective work. Having followed up one clue,  until it ended&mdash;for the time being&mdash;in nothing, she hunted about for another.  So far she had made two discoveries. The pistol which Joyce declared he had  received from Don Manuel was certainly the weapon with which the murder had  been committed; and the bullet was of silver. But this knowledge resulted in  nothing. Certainly it cast a strong suspicion on the Mexican; but that part of  the puzzle Bess felt she could safely leave to Herrick. So far as her  particular business was concerned she could do no more, until she heard her  colleague&rsquo;s report. Pending this, she began to work in a different direction.  It occurred to her that she had never questioned Sidney about his doings in the  Pine wood on the night of the murder. Possibly he might be able to supply some  clue to the mystery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was in the habit of watching the tower,&rdquo; said Bess to herself, &ldquo;he said as much  on that day when we had the picnic. I wonder if he saw anything suspicious on  that night; then he might have seen that horrid little Joyce, or perhaps  Frisco. I&rsquo;ll see what he knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sidney  was not an easy person to question. His fantasies of thought, had been laughed  at so frequently, the truth of his statements so often denied, that he had  grown reticent. What he saw, what he heard, he kept to himself, and not even  his own family could get him to explain himself on occasions when they really  desired information. The boy mooned about in a dreamy state of mind, saying  little beyond the merest common places and for the most part lived in that  world of fantasy which was anathema-maranatha to the people around him. He was  like a wild animal, shy, timid, and intensely suspicious.</p>
  <p>Bess  thought that he might be more open with her, when he was&mdash;so to speak&mdash;in his  native wilds. She therefore watched her opportunity, and followed him to one of  his favourite haunts in the pine wood, where it fringed the moor. Here one  afternoon, she found him seated in a secluded glade beside one of those  remarkable circles, which the country people call fairy rings. So steadily was  he gazing at this in the half-light which filtered through the overhead boughs,  that he did not notice her approach. To be sure she trod softly and used the  same precaution as she would have done when approaching the haunt of some timid  animal.</p>
  <p>Sidney  had always been a puzzle to everyone, but Bess understood him better than most  people. Besides she had discussed him frequently with Santiago, and was  inclined to take the Mexican&rsquo;s view of the boy&rsquo;s peculiarities. Remembering the  oft-quoted saying of Hamlet. Bess was less sceptical than those around her. She  could not see why Sidney should not possess the power of seeing,&mdash;what in the  generally accepted sense is called the unseen. Considering what the lad had  foretold with regard to the death of Mrs. Marsh and the accident to her step-son,  it was impossible to say that Sidney was either a fool or a madman. There was  some reason for his fantasies&mdash;so-called: and Bess regarded him with a certain  amount of awe. She could not understand him; but she granted that he was a rare  spirit, far removed from the common-place mortal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  Thomas the Rhymer,&rdquo; said Bess gaily, when her shadow fell on the fairy-ring, &ldquo;are  you looking for the Queen of Elf-land?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was characteristic of Sidney that he was never taken by surprise. At the sound  of her voice he neither started nor expressed any anger. All he did was to  raise his serious eyes to her face, and observe quietly, &ldquo;I knew you were  coming, Bess dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  threw herself down beside him and nodded towards the fairy-ring. &ldquo;Did they tell  you?&rdquo; she asked in low tone, and in all good faith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Bess. This is not the time for the little people to be abroad. I was only  looking at their dancing-ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen them here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Often,&rdquo;  replied Sidney with conviction, &ldquo;small naked folk who dance and sing and play  on queer instruments. They know that I see them; but they are not angry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you are a fairy yourself Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I have a soul&mdash;what you call a soul&mdash;and the fairies have none. They are only  the creatures who attend to the works of Nature; her servants. I can see them  because&mdash;&rdquo; here Sidney broke off, &ldquo;it is no use my telling you Bess, you would  not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  quite admitted this. She could not understand. All the same she did not tell  her brother that he was a fool as many people would have done. She simply  nodded, and passed the subject by. Her errand was to find out what Sidney had  seen in the actual world. After the manner of her sex she approached the matter  by a side-issue. &ldquo;Sidney dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do you know that Mr. Joyce has gone  away to London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I did not,&rdquo; replied Sidney gravely, &ldquo;but I am very glad he has gone. A bad man  Bess, and he would have done you harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?  What do you mean.&rdquo; Sidney passed his hand across his face. &ldquo;I cannot explain,&rdquo;  he said in a troubled voice, &ldquo;you see Bess, bad people carry about with them a  bad atmosphere. That Mexican was very wicked; Joyce not so bad. Both of them  made me feel quite ill. Did you never see how I refused to sit beside them?  Well, that was because they gave me such pain. Not physical pain but a kind of  uncomfortable feeling, which I can&rsquo;t put into words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what an old-fashioned way you talk Sidney,&rdquo; said Bess puzzled, &ldquo;one would think  you were a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know more than I say. Corn did not teach me everything I know!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me Sidney. Do you like Mr. Corn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do&mdash;in a way. He is not bad, but he is weak. With good people he is good, with  bad people he is bad. I am glad that Don Manuel has gone to Town. He was doing  Mr. Corn a lot of harm. But if I told you what I know of these things you would  only laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I would not Sidney,&rdquo; said his sister earnestly, &ldquo;I am sure that you are so  sensitive that you feel these influences you talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sensitive,&rdquo;  echoed Sidney, &ldquo;yes! I suppose that is what you would call it. You have come  here to ask me a question?&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo; she demanded, then seeing him shrug his thin shoulders, she  admitted the truth of what he said. &ldquo;I want to ask you who you saw in the Pine  wood on the night when Colonel Carr was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sidney  thought for a moment, then raised his eyes towards the gap in the trees  formerly blocked by the tower. &ldquo;I saw a lot of red mist about the tower,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;that was anger. I saw too&mdash;&rdquo; he shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;It is not these  things you wish to know Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to know who killed Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you Bess. If I knew I should tell. But I don&rsquo;t. On that night I came  here, looking for things&mdash;&rdquo; said Sidney with a side-glance to see if she were  laughing, &ldquo;and although I felt that there was a bad influence about the house,  I never went near it. I kept away and wandered on to the moor. That is why you  missed me, when you came to look for me. I did not mind the rain. But I saw  your lantern, and thought you would be anxious, so I returned home. Then you  came back yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That is all true. But tell me Sidney, did you see Mr. Joyce in the wood or on  the moor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I did not see him. Stephen was the only person I saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  started violently. &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;surely you must be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the boy indifferently, &ldquo;why should I be mistaken? You know I can see in  the dark like a cat. Before I saw your lantern, I had seen Stephen on the lawn  looking at the tower. I do not know what time it was, so don&rsquo;t ask me. You are  always so particular about time,&rdquo; said Sidney peevishly, &ldquo;as though it  mattered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  reflected. It was strange that Stephen should have been in the vicinity of the  house on that night and yet have escaped her notice. But she remembered that  being intent upon looking for her brother that she had not even seen Joyce,  although he was lurking in the bushes at her elbow. True she had caught a  glimpse of Frisco. But that was when she consciously looked at the door. It was  possible that Sidney might have come across Stephen. &ldquo;Did you speak to him?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should I have spoken to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he go into the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I saw Bess. He was looking up at the tower, standing on the lawn by the  trees. I went away to the other side of the wood, and out on to the moor. That  is all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Sidney, did you see Frisco crossing the moor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. When I saw your lantern I went home. I wish you would stop asking me  questions,&rdquo; he cried irritably, &ldquo;you make my head ache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  this speech, he relapsed into one of his silent fits, and Bess could not get  him to speak. Knowing from experience that Sidney was hopeless when in this  mood, she left him still by the fairy ring, and took her way back to Biffstead.  The house was empty, as Ida had gone to Beorminster to see Flo, and Frank was  attending to the farm.</p>
  <p>Bess  sat down and wondered what could be the meaning of Stephen&rsquo;s presence at &ldquo;The  Pines&rdquo; on that night. She knew that he had come over from Beorminster to escort  his mother home. But then Mrs. Marsh had been with Mr. Corn the whole evening,  and there was no reason why Stephen should have gone out of his way to visit &ldquo;The  Pines.&rdquo; It was in the afternoon that Mrs. Marsh had seen the Colonel, and  Stephen must have known that she would not be at the great house after nine o&rsquo;clock.  This, Bess, calculating by her own movements, was the hour at which Sidney had  seen him. He was looking up at the tower too, so Sidney said. &ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t  have had anything to do with it,&rdquo; she thought restlessly, &ldquo;he disliked the  Colonel, but he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t even think of it! Such a thing if true,  would kill Ida. Yet I must find out from Stephen himself why he was in the wood  on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  reflected. At this hour Stephen would be alone. Why should she not go over and  see him. In one way or another she could tell him about the pistol and the  silver bullet and see from the expression of his face if he knew anything about  either. It was incredible that Stephen should have fired the shot. He was the Colonel&rsquo;s  heir; but even to gain the money he certainly was too good a man to commit a  crime. Yet if what Sidney said was true, Stephen had been on the lawn about the  time Colonel Carr was shot. He must know something about the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see him,&rdquo; said Bess putting on her hat again. &ldquo;I shall not be able to sleep a  wink until I know what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another half hour she was in the library where Stephen was established on the  sofa. He looked thin, and rather worried, but his face brightened when he saw  her. &ldquo;This is good of you Bess,&rdquo; he said stretching out his hand, &ldquo;I am all  alone; Herrick is in Town; Ida at Beorminster. Not a soul to speak to. Draw  that chair close to the fire. Shall I ring for tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too early yet,&rdquo; she said reassured by this bright talk. It was incredible  that a man who spoke so lightly should have a black crime on his soul. &ldquo;I just  want to chatter for a bit; I am so tired of my own company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I. Well you talk about Jim, and I&rsquo;ll discourse about Ida. We shall be quite  happy. By the way, when will Ida be back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  dinner time. She will come over and see you afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish she would come to dinner here,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;you also and Frank and  Sidney. I miss Jim horribly, and it is no fun eating a long solemn meal alone.  Upon my word Bess, I sometimes long for the days when Petronella&rsquo;s macaroni  could be eaten hurriedly, and without this formality. I would rather have a  book than a footman about the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a mixed way of talking,&rdquo; said Bess pensively, &ldquo;you <i>have</i> a book on the table  as a rule, I suppose you are glad all the same that you have the Colonel&rsquo;s  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I am,&rdquo; said Stephen frankly, &ldquo;it enables me to marry Ida. I was so  afraid lest she should marry someone else before I came into my kingdom. But I  could not ask her to be my wife when I was a pauper could I Bess? She&rsquo;s a rare  jewel that requires a rich setting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Ida values money so much as all that,&rdquo; said Bess gravely. &ldquo;She  would have married you without a sixpence. But I am glad all the same that the  money came to you so soon. It is nice to be rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  it is,&rdquo; admitted Stephen gladly. &ldquo;I can buy whatever books I like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  laughed at this speech. &ldquo;I am afraid you will grow into a bookworm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Jim has got me out of bad habits in that respect. At one time I did nothing but  read. Now I ride and swim and box and fence and shoot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  started at the last word. It gave her the opening she desired. &ldquo;Are you a good  shot?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was always a good shot,&rdquo; said Stephen coolly, &ldquo;that is, with a pistol. I never  handled a gun until I came here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know you had ever handled a pistol either?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, I did. Young Capron gave me permission to shoot rabbits on his estate ages  ago. I could not afford to buy a gun, but I did manage to get enough money to  screw out a revolver&mdash;and a very good one. I believe it was brought here from  Beorminster, unless Petronella overlooked it. But I have not used it for over a  year. Rabbit shooting with a pistol is not much fun especially when one is  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to see the pistol,&rdquo; said Bess, after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  over then to the box behind that screen,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;if it is anywhere it  will be in there. There are all sorts of odds and ends, rag tag and bobtail of  my former existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  did as she was told and walked slowly over and behind the large gilded screen  which stood in a far corner of the library. Here, pushed to one side, was a  moderately sized box, the lid of which was open. She found in it a few books,  many manuscripts, pens, an inkstand, and all the paraphernalia of a writing  table. These she enumerated aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said Stephen from the sofa, &ldquo;those are the the contents of my study. I  expect Petronella threw all the things into that trunk. The pistol is bound to  be there&mdash;in a small mahogany-box. I always kept it on the mantelpiece of my  study. Be careful if you find it Bess. All six chambers are loaded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  some search Bess came across just such a box, and opened it to find a neat  little revolver of the most modern pattern. She carried this, box and all, to a  table near the sofa. Again Stephen warned her that the weapon was loaded. &ldquo;I  kept it loaded because my mother was always afraid of thieves poor soul,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;though heaven knows there was little enough to steal in that dismal  house of ours! What is it Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are only three chambers loaded,&rdquo; said Bess thickly. In a flash she remembered  the three shots fired into the dead body&mdash;and the conical shape of the bullets.  Those in the weapon she held were conical in shape.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said Stephen nervously. &ldquo;I always kept the whole six loaded. You must be making  a mistake,&rdquo; he took the revolver from her and examined it closely. &ldquo;You are  right,&rdquo; he said with a long breath. &ldquo;Three of them <i>are</i> empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke he looked up apparently with indifference. When his eye caught hers he  saw something in her expression which made him start and flush crimson. For a  moment they looked at one another. Then Stephen swung himself up to a sitting  position and laid the pistol on the side table. &ldquo;Why do you look at me like  that Bess?&rdquo; he asked in a hurried tone.</p>
  <p>For  a minute she did not reply. But she felt that she must know the truth, and  burst out hurriedly &ldquo;Stephen! You were on the lawn on the night your uncle was  killed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young man started to his feet, and then fell back again on the sofa white, and  amazed. &ldquo;How do know?&rdquo; he stuttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sidney  saw you. He told me. Oh, Stephen,&mdash;three chambers of your revolver empty&mdash;three  shots at&mdash;&rdquo; she felt suffocated and could not continue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  Wait&rdquo; Stephen put his hand to his head. It felt confused. His face was of a  deep purple. Bess thought that he would have a fit and blamed herself for  having blurted out her suspicions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  Wait&rdquo; muttered Marsh-Carr again as she moved towards the bell to summon  assistance. He sat down on the sofa, his face in his hands, rocking himself to  and fro. Then he heaved a deep sigh, and looked up at her white haggard face. &ldquo;You  will not tell Ida,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>With  her hands twisted in her hair Bess stepped back. She suppressed a shriek. &ldquo;Stephen!&rdquo;  she cried hoarsely &ldquo;You did not&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not murder him. No,&rdquo; replied the young man harshly. &ldquo;He was already dead  when I fired those three shots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was you who?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was I,&rdquo; cried Stephen, rising to his feet with a fierce look, &ldquo;and you are  going to denounce me, I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! how can you think I would do such a thing? But Ida, poor Ida!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not tell her,&rdquo; cried Stephen grasping her wrist until she winced with the  pain. &ldquo;Do what you like, but say nothing to Ida. I would rather break off our  engagement on another plea than that she should know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pain of the twist he gave her arm brought Bess back to a more normal state of  mind. She pulled herself together, and sat down. &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;no  one but you and I will share this secret. Can you swear to me that Colonel Carr  was already dead when you fired those shots? I want the truth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was already dead,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr sitting down quietly, &ldquo;did you not hear the  medical evidence at the inquest? It was the bullet which killed him. My shots  were fired at a carcase.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you do such a horrible thing?&rdquo; wailed Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I was mad for the time  being,&rdquo; said Stephen gloomily, &ldquo;I will tell you all if you are strong enough to  hear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  what I know, I am strong enough to hear anything. Oh! To think that you should  have behaved in so barbarous a manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  winced. &ldquo;It was barbarous I confess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I was mad for the time  being. After all you must not be too hard on me. I did not kill my respected  uncle,&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
  <p>Bess  shivered. She had never before seen this side of Stephen&rsquo;s character, and the  new experience was unpleasant. It even stirred her into unconsidered  indignation. &ldquo;Since you went up that tower with a revolver, you must have  intended to kill the man,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I did, perhaps I did not,&rdquo; he answered in a most brazen manner, &ldquo;but the plain  truth is that I wanted to frighten him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did you think a revolver would frighten a man who had faced death fifty and a  hundred times?&rdquo; said Bess with scorn. She recalled to her memory several  episodes Carr had told her of his American doings; she well knew the  dare-devilry latent in the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carr  was old, and had lost his nerve. I counted upon that. I never intended to kill  him. When I went up the tower the work had been done for me already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know,&rdquo; said Stephen earnestly, &ldquo;upon my soul Bess I do not know&mdash;the man  was dead when I saw him. It was sheer rage that made me fire those three shots.  The brute that is in me, as it is in every man, came to the surface. But of the  real murderer I saw no trace. I did not see Frisco whom I take to be the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not Frisco,&rdquo; flashed out Bess, &ldquo;However,&rdquo; she continued sick at heart, &ldquo;you  had better tell me how it came about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly  through my love for Ida, partly through my mother,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr gloomily. &ldquo;It  came to my mother&rsquo;s ears that the Colonel intended to disinherit me. I suppose  Frisco got the upper hand and induced him to alter his will&mdash;that is if he did  alter it which I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course he did not Stephen. If he had left the money to anyone else you would  not be here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure about that,&rdquo; replied the young man savagely. &ldquo;Frisco might have  taken the second will from the corpse. At all events I know that Frith and  Frith drafted no new will. If it was drawn the Colonel must have drawn it  himself. However Frisco let out in one of his drunken fits at Beorminster that  Carr intended to cut me off. My mother heard the news and came home in a frenzy  of rage. It was for that reason she called on Carr on the afternoon you know  of. The twenty-fourth was it not? She intended to argue him into a better frame  of mind. He only laughed at her and said he would leave his money as pleased  him. She told me the next day. But Carr was dead then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you decide to frighten him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I not telling you!&rdquo; said Stephen impatiently. &ldquo;When my mother went to Saxham I  knew she would fail. A woman could not deal with a devil like my beloved uncle.  I determined to see what I could do with a revolver. I would have fought a duel  with him to keep my rights,&rdquo; said the young man fiercely, &ldquo;but I would not have  killed him in cold blood. No, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  go on,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;I want to know all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is little to tell,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr. &ldquo;I was going to Saxham to fetch home my  mother who was at the rectory. I thought I would visit &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; and see the  Colonel. I did so, some time before nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  it was about that hour Sidney saw you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay. I stood on the lawn looking at the tower, and could not make up my  mind to enter the house. It was all ablaze with lights, and quite deserted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Bess recalling her own experience. &ldquo;I heard you fire the shots and saw  Frisco at the door. He was drunk and hanging on to the post.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard me fire the shots. I did not know you were about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was then. I had gone to look for Sidney. But you see Frisco&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Frisco,&rdquo; said Stephen vehemently. &ldquo;I tell you Carr was dead when I went up,  lying face downward. If Frisco was at the door, he was just clearing out after  killing the man. He knew that he would be arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he must have heard the shots?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  he knew that someone had discovered the body which would make him run for it  all the more quickly. However to make a long story short I fired the three  shots you know of, and then returned to my mother at the rectory. I said  nothing about the matter, as I had not killed Carr. If Frisco is not the  murderer I do not know who is. That is all I can tell you Bess, you see I am  not such a guilty wretch as you thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; said Bess impetuously, &ldquo;If you were I should insist upon your  leaving Ida. To fire at the dead was savage, but, as I know the man must have  been dead at the time&mdash;the medical evidence proves that, I will say nothing.  Why did you not tell me of this before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  use would it have been?&rdquo; said Stephen raising his eyebrows, &ldquo;I cannot tell you  anything likely to lead to the capture of the assassin, and beside it is not a  pleasant thing to tell about myself. I should not have told you now, but that  you have been one too many for me. I should have re-loaded the three chambers  of that revolver. But I forgot and put it away thinking all six were loaded. I  should be ashamed to let Jim or Ida know that I had been such a beast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall say nothing to them,&rdquo; said Bess coldly, &ldquo;but I am disappointed in you  Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said the young man humbly, &ldquo;I should have had more self-control. But you  will not turn your back on me for this Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  All the same I can&rsquo;t feel as I did towards you. Let me go away and think  Stephen. And&mdash;put away that revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marsh-Carr  nodded, and slipped the weapon into his pocket. But he made no attempt to  detain Bess. She went away with a sore heart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    Part Of The Truth</b></h2>
  <p>While  Bess was thus employed, her colleague had his hands full in London. On arriving  at Paddington, Herrick drove directly to the West Kensington Flat. It was  closed, and the porter explained that Mr. Joyce had been away for some weeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  that is a pity,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim with a grim smile. &ldquo;I wished to see him most  particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  expect him back shortly sir,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Has he written to fix the date of his return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet sir. But Mr. Joyce never remains away more than a month or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may change his habits this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so sir. Shall I tell him you called sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You need not go so far as that. When he comes home just send a wire to that  address. And this for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  porter, a venal creature in uniform, looked at the half sovereign and the  address of the Guelph Hotel in Jermyn Street. He promised faithfully to send a  wire the moment Mr. Joyce returned, and Dr. Jim went away, very well satisfied  that he had done right in having Robin watched. &ldquo;Damned little scoundrel!&rdquo;  growled Herrick. &ldquo;What is the use of sparing him? But that he is in the hands  of a stronger villain, I would lay him by the heels straight off. But I shall  deal with Santiago this time. I expect he and Joyce are plotting together in  some hole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  another hour Herrick was climbing a flight of dingy stairs in the neighbourhood  of the Strand. He stopped at the second landing and before a door, which bore  the name of Kidd, Belcher &amp; Co, Private Inquiry Office. On entering he was  confronted by a dirty undersized boy. Kidd was absent on business, but Belcher  was in, and on giving his card, Dr. Jim was shown into the next room. Here at a  table near the window sat a man. That is he stood on two legs, he was neatly  dressed, and he talked in a prim precise voice. But going by his face he was a  ferret. The long face and nose, the broad forehead and small receding chin, and  above all the red-rimmed eyes without eyebrows or eyelashes. All this made him  look very much like a ferret. And his nature was also of the beast. He was a  sly, silent, cunning tracker, relentless when once he had hunted down his prey.  A dangerous man, a deadly man, who had elected to place himself on the side of  the law, as offering the better price. Had he chosen to be one of the great  criminal profession, Mr. Belcher would have been a dangerous opponent to the  police. Luckily he found that honesty paid better than roguery, therefore he  was at the disposal of Dr. Jim, for the watching of Santiago and Joyce. He  talked freely on this point. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right sir,&rdquo; he said in his whispering  voice and arranging his neat white tie. &ldquo;Kidd caught him at the Paddington  station, and followed him to Pimlico.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he is in Pimlico is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watched  by three boys, and Kidd himself. Four kids I call them,&rdquo; said Mr. Belcher with  a silent laugh. &ldquo;You see sir that Mexican gent prefers to live at Pimlico  because it is near the Gambling Club. We need not mention names sir, as I have  an interest in that club and don&rsquo;t want the police to know of it. I hunt with  the hounds and run with the fox you see,&rdquo; and Belcher gave another of his  silent laughs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim taking no notice of the joke, &ldquo;so Joyce is at Santiago&rsquo;s lodgings is  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drove  straight therefrom Paddington, and has not been out of doors since. The Don has  been sir. He never thinks you are after <i>him.&rdquo;</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fancy he has rather a contempt for my brains,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;However we shall see  about that. I&rsquo;ll go to those lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you mind telling me what the Mexican has done sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would mind very much Mr. Belcher. When I want to tell you my business you won&rsquo;t  have to help me. It is a private matter. But later on there may be something in  it likely to pay you. At present all I want you to do is to keep an eye on  Joyce and Santiago. I will pay you well for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir, thank you, sir. Excuse my curiosity. Quite professional.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt; but you will make more money by asking no questions. If things are as I  suspect with these two it will put a lot of cash into your pockets. Meanwhile,  hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; said the ferret meekly, &ldquo;so long as you know your business,  I don&rsquo;t need to teach it to you. But you know our firm. We are straight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  long as you are paid. Otherwise you prefer to keep gambling saloons unknown to  the police. Oh, never fear man, I shall say nothing. By the way, lend me a  revolver:&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said the ferret with sudden interest, &ldquo;is it as bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. One at least of the two will show fight, and it won&rsquo;t be the man you  followed from Paddington. You had better come with me Belcher. I want to know  if the coast is clear. If the two catch sight of me from the window, they may  clear out. While I am talking to them, you and Kidd can remain outside. If you  hear a shot, rush up with the nearest policeman. But I won&rsquo;t fire unless I am  driven to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going  to shoot one of them Dr. Herrick?&rdquo; said Belcher producing a very serviceable  weapon which Jim slipped into his breast pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless either one draws on me. It is the Mexican I fear. But it is the more  likely I shall only fire the revolver by way of a signal. You know what you  have to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir,&rdquo; said the ferret with something of admiration in his whisper, &ldquo;you ought  to have been in our profession doctor. You provide against every chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except  sudden death,&rdquo; laughed Jim as they went down the dingy stairs, &ldquo;I have a tough  article to deal with in that Santiago. Do you know anything about him Belcher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  ferret shook his head and waved a neat umbrella to a passing hansom. &ldquo;Not much  sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been in England over six months, and always in the same  lodgings. He has money but not too much of it. I got to know him at the club,  and he gambled so high and won so much that I made it my business to look after  him. But I could find out nothing to get the whip hand of him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Joyce goes to your club also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  sir. I told you so when you called to see me first. I knew the name at once.  Kidd knows him too, but he doesn&rsquo;t know Kidd. That was why I sent Kidd to  Paddington. He&rsquo;s a fool, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough,&rdquo; replied Herrick dryly, &ldquo;but even a fool can become dangerous in the  hands of an unscrupulous scoundrel like Santiago. Oh, I do not know anything  against him,&rdquo; added Herrick seeing the ferret&rsquo;s eyes twinkle. &ldquo;I am only going  by the little I do know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  enough to jail him I suppose, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet, but there might be soon,&rdquo; replied Jim, glancing sideways at his neat  companion. He well knew that Belcher and Kidd liked to know secrets in order to  extort blackmail. A dangerous pair; but Jim knew how to deal with them. They  were rather afraid of Jim. He knew too much.</p>
  <p>Herrick  had become acquainted with the ferret through having saved the life of his  small daughter, and as this child was the apple of the man&rsquo;s eye, he adored Jim  and was in the habit of speaking to him more freely than he otherwise would  have done. Therefore Jim got to know more about the Private Inquiry Firm than  was altogether wise. However, he could keep his mouth shut, and, as at present,  he sometimes found the pair useful. But the connection was not a pleasant one,  even so, and Herrick was wont to comfort himself with the reflection that when  dirty work has to be done, no man can be nice in the choice of his instruments.</p>
  <p>Directed  by the ferret, the cab stopped at the corner of a Pimlico street in a quiet  neighbourhood. There he left the doctor in the cab, and went along to  reconnoitre. In ten minutes he came back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Mexican has gone out,&rdquo; said Belcher, &ldquo;he has been away an hour. But Joyce is in  the sitting-room. Kidd saw his face two or three times at the window. If you  creep along the street under the house he won&rsquo;t be able to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  you are,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim climbing down, and paying off the cab&mdash;lavishly because  he did not want a disturbance, &ldquo;you wait outside both of you and keep an eye on  the policeman. When you hear a shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t tell me twice Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; said Belcher, his professional pride  wounded. &ldquo;Off you go sir, I&rsquo;ll stop hereabouts and whistle if the Mexican comes  along. He doesn&rsquo;t know my real business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim  nodded, and walked along to number forty-three, where&mdash;as Belcher told him  Santiago had rooms on the first floor. On the opposite side of the street he  saw Kidd with a green shade and picturesquely attired in rags, playing the part  of a pavement artist. At the end of the street three or four boys were playing  marbles. No one would suspect that either man or boys were spies. Jim fingered  his revolver, and rang the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to see Mr. Joyce,&rdquo; he said to the slattern who opened the door, &ldquo;my name  is Nuttall, and I come from Don Manuel Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  slattern suspecting nothing from this calm address conducted Jim up the stairs.  She opened a door and gave the message to Robin. Herrick heard his voice  telling her to show in Mr. Nuttall, and he guessed from the sound of it that  Joyce was uneasy. The slattern pushed Jim to the door and then dropped down  stairs rapidly. She wanted to get back to her novel, for her mistress was away  for the afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  Joyce and how are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  gave a kind of squeal like that of a trapped animal, and fell back into the  chair from which he had risen to welcome Mr. Nuttall. His face grew white, his  jaw dropped, and he collapsed into a limp heap. Fright so paralysed his tongue  that he could not speak. Jim smiled politely and closed the door. Then he took  a chair opposite to the wretched creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a proper little scoundrel,&rdquo; he said in withering tones, &ldquo;I am sorry to see  you brought so low as this, Joyce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; cried Robin flaming into sudden fury. &ldquo;Have you not humiliated me  enough, but that you must come after me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  find you in hiding with Don Manuel. Go easy Joyce, and keep a civil tongue in  your head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to kill you,&rdquo; he muttered, his face distorted with fury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no doubt you would, and I have also small doubt but that your friend  Santiago will try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you want to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you. Yes. You told me such lies at Saxham, coached by Don Manuel I suppose,  that I wish to talk to the two of you together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t leave this place I will call the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  so by all means. I shall give you in charge when they appear. Come Joyce, don&rsquo;t  be a fool! You have to sit down and do what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  resumed his seat and bit his fingers. &ldquo;Santiago will kill you,&rdquo; he muttered  viciously. &ldquo;I hope he will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you; I see pity is wasted on a reptile like you. But see here,&rdquo; said Jim with  sudden fierceness. &ldquo;I am prepared for you and for the Mexican also. I have only  to fire this,&rdquo; he showed the revolver &ldquo;and the detectives who are waiting will  come up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Detectives!&rdquo;  cried Joyce white as snow and trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you fool. I gave you every chance to clear yourself. You abused my leniency,  and plotted with Santiago to cheat me. This time you will not get off so easy.  I wonder how you will like being in the dock on a charge of conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the truth, and you know it. You and Santiago wish to get the money left by  Colonel Carr. You tried to murder Stephen in the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not I,&rdquo; gasped Robin shaking with fright, &ldquo;I was with the Miss Endicottes  all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know that your accomplice is the bolder villain. It was he&mdash;&rdquo; here Herrick  made a shot in the dark, &ldquo;&mdash;it was Santiago who struck Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know he did,&rdquo; sobbed Joyce falling into the trap, &ldquo;but I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind about yourself,&rdquo; said Jim exulting in having extorted this piece of  information, &ldquo;tell me what there is between Santiago and Corn that made him  force the parson to tell a lie in order to prove his alibi. Corn said that  Manuel was with him all the evening. You know that is false. Manuel went out  and struck Stephen Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what power Santiago has over Corn,&rdquo; said Robin wiping his eyes, &ldquo;he  never told me; but he has some. He treats me like a dog, and I can&rsquo;t call my  soul my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  poor little rat!&rdquo; said Herrick with a certain pity. &ldquo;Then the best thing you  can do is to come back to me, and tell me all you know about this scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; whimpered Joyce, &ldquo;he would kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  he! I shall know how to save you, and if you do not tell,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim in a  sharp tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you arrested as being concerned in this murder of  Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am innocent; you know I am innocent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of the sort,&rdquo; replied Herrick unexpectedly. &ldquo;I have your word for  it, and your confession of your doings on that night. But there is quite enough  in that confession&mdash;signed by yourself, mind&mdash;to justify your being arrested on  suspicion of having committed the crime. Do you think a jury would believe in  your story, especially as I can prove that the pistol with which&mdash;as I verily  believe&mdash;the crime was committed was in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got it from Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you said, and yet at the time you told me, it was out of my power to question  the man. You knew that he had gone up to Town by the Heathcroft line, and you  did not tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was afraid. He forced me to hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better be a little more afraid of me. I can do you more mischief than Don  Manuel is likely to do. He will have sufficient to do to look after himself.  But I knew what a slippery little devil you were Joyce, and so I had you  watched from the moment you disembarked at the Paddington station. You can&rsquo;t  move a step now without my knowledge. So you need not try to give me the slip  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By  this time Joyce was in a state of collapse. He saw that Herrick had been too  clever for him. Between his fear of Santiago and his fear of Herrick he was in  a pitiable state of mind. Dr. Jim felt sorry for the miserable creature in  spite of the contempt which his conduct righteously provoked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you  what I can,&rdquo; said Joyce after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you are wise. You expect Santiago back soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a quarter past four now,&rdquo; said Herrick glancing at his watch. &ldquo;I will wait  for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is dangerous,&rdquo; said Joyce alarmed, and rising from his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  am I. It is not a man like me who is afraid of a Mexican Greaser, Mr. Joyce.  Don&rsquo;t go near that window. You&rsquo;ll be making signals to your friend. I don&rsquo;t  trust you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my honour&mdash;&rdquo; began Joyce returning to his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t got any. Now then, why did Santiago try to get Marsh killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not want to kill him. He only desired that he should be disabled and  prevented from going to the vault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  whistled. &ldquo;Ah, he has been looking up the will at Doctor&rsquo;s Commons. Well, and  what does he expect to gain by the money going to Frisco? The man is in  communication with him I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Joyce sulkily, &ldquo;he is in communication with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil!&rdquo; Herrick sprang to his feet. &ldquo;So <i>you</i> put that cipher in the paper,  asking Frisco to meet you at Hyde Park Corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes  I did. I put in the first and the second.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  taught you the cipher? It was one that Colonel Carr knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santiago  taught it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Now we are getting at the truth,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;and where did you meet  Santiago may I ask? No lie this time, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  met him at the gambling club in this district.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you did. I never knew that gambling was a vice of yours. It seems one never  does know a man. I thought better of you. Well, and for what reason did  Santiago tell you about this cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew him before I went on the walking tour with you. When I came back to London  I went to the club and saw him there. He talked about the murder of Carr and  had seen my name as one of the men who found the body. In one way and another  he got everything out of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  story you told me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He made me tell everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever  man,&rdquo; said Herrick with a nod, &ldquo;but of course you are so weak poor soul, that  you would tell everything. I now see how this man got you into his power. Well,  and why did he teach you the cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems he knew Frisco&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  He denied that. I knew that was a lie; but no matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said that Frisco was in London, and that I should like to find him. I wanted to  know if Frisco had really killed Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Herrick shrugged his shoulders, &ldquo;and were you simple enough to think that Frisco  would tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he was innocent of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That he was innocent. But if he had told me that he was guilty I could not have  betrayed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim with a sharp glance, &ldquo;you are getting more mysterious every  moment. Well, so you put in that cipher&mdash;the first&mdash;by the direction of the  Mexican?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And met Frisco at Hyde Park Corner. I also put in the second when I wanted to  see Frisco again. He wouldn&rsquo;t give me his address, but said if I wanted to see  him I was to communicate by the cipher. I did not meet him the second time,  because I saw you waiting to catch us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  That was clever of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  you too,&rdquo; said Joyce, &ldquo;how did you learn the cipher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my business. Be civil,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim sharply, &ldquo;go on. You saw this man you  say, and he told you he was innocent, which is a lie. I suppose Santiago saw  him also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  We were all three in my flat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice  party,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim sarcastically, &ldquo;and you made up this conspiracy between  the lot of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  We wanted Marsh to lose the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not see where the advantage would come in,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim reflectively, &ldquo;the  money would go to Frisco certainly, but he could not benefit, without running  the risk of arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was not to appear at all in the matter,&rdquo; explained Joyce. &ldquo;When the money came  to him, he was to feign death and make a will leaving the fortune to me; I was  to share it with him and Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. The conspiracy was more complete than he had thought, and very cunning  too. &ldquo;Upon my word that is clever,&rdquo; he said in a tone half of jest and half  admiration, &ldquo;although I do not exactly see how the law would look at the  matter. Frisco wanted for murder&mdash;to feign death&mdash;fortune left to you&mdash;money to  be shared between the presumed corpse and the two plotters left alive. Why! it&rsquo;s  like a melodrama. You would have had some difficulty in proving the death of  Frisco though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Santiago was going to manage that,&rdquo; said Joyce with confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure he would, even to going the length of making a real corpse of the man  after the will was signed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  jumped up and began to walk up and down much agitated. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;bad as  you think me Herrick, I should never have consented to Frisco being put out of  the way. The death would have been proved without that. Frisco would have  received his share of the money. He would have gone free. I would rather die  myself than that anything should happen to Frisco. Yes, you may look; I would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Your conscience has grown very tender all of a  sudden, that you should desire to shield a scoundrel. Is Frisco a relative of  yours that you should be so careful of his skin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  dropped into his seat and looked straight at the doctor. &ldquo;Frisco is my father,&rdquo;  he said deliberately.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim jumped up in his turn and stared down at the pinched white face. He could  scarcely believe his ears. &ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;is this another part of  your conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth,&rdquo; said Joyce simply, so simply that Herrick was convinced that for  once he was telling no lie. &ldquo;When he met me and came to my flat, he told me he  was my father. I did not believe him, but he soon convinced me by showing me my  mother&rsquo;s letters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Addressed  to him where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Colonel  Carr&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Herrick dropped back into his chair, &ldquo;so this accounts for the annuity! What is  your father&rsquo;s real name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce!  The same as mine. He was Colonel Carr&rsquo;s Cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was amazed, and remembered what he had heard about the uncle of the wicked  Colonel. &ldquo;Carr&rsquo;s father turned a son out of doors,&rdquo; he muttered &ldquo;the son went  to America and married. He had one daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mother. She was the Carr&rsquo;s cousin, not my father&rsquo;s. I am getting confused,&rdquo;  murmured Joyce feeling his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case you are cousin to Stephen Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And I should have the money, since my grandfather was the brother of Colonel  Carr. That was why I conspired, as you call it. That was why my father and  Santiago tried to help me to get my rights. What do you think of it now  Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that you went the wrong way to work,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;that is if you are  telling me the truth,&mdash;which I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth,&rdquo; cried Joyce clenching his fist, &ldquo;if you do not believe me,&rdquo; he  added listening for a moment, &ldquo;here is one who will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santiago!&rdquo;  said Herrick rising to be ready for emergencies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He is coming up the stair now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment there was a shrill whistle outside, Belcher&rsquo;s signal.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Don Manuel&rsquo;s Recollections</b></h2>
  <p>Santiago  entered the room quite unsuspiciously. His step was light, his eyes were  bright, and he had evidently been successfully plotting some new and lucrative  villainy. In a moment his astonished eyes lighted upon Herrick, standing tall  and smiling on the hearth-rug. A Spanish oath of the coarsest slipped from his  mouth, and he looked about as evil as a man can look who knows that the game is  up. However he was plucky enough to show fight. He even attempted bluff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you doing in my rooms Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; he demanded in Spanish. &ldquo;If you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think we had better keep to English?&rdquo; said Herrick blandly. &ldquo;I know you  speak it so well, and of course we have our mutual friend Joyce to consider.  You are surprised to see me. Natural, very natural.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  sat in his chair silent and white. He was too frightened to open his mouth for  he knew something of Don Manuel&rsquo;s rages, and dreaded the tornado which would  ensue when the Mexican learned how Herrick had been told everything by his  weak-kneed coadjutor. For a moment Santiago (still in ignorance as to the true  state of affairs), ground his teeth. Then by an effort of will he recovered his  smile, and to all appearances his usual temper. &ldquo;You will excuse me if I spoke  rudely Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said with a polite bow, &ldquo;it is not my custom. But I am rather  taken aback at meeting you here. I do not remember having asked you to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; replied Jim cheerfully. He did not sit down, for Santiago was still  on his feet. And one can use a revolver better when standing. &ldquo;I heard that you  had been suddenly called to Town yesterday. I therefore made it my business to  follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  kind of you,&rdquo; said Santiago slipping his hand into his breast pocket, an action  which was imitated by Herrick, &ldquo;but how did you find out my address? I never  gave it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  oversight on your part my dear Don Manuel,&rdquo; replied Jim politely but watchful  of the man&rsquo;s slightest action, &ldquo;but the fact is my friend Joyce left  Beorminster yesterday as you know&mdash;that was after his talk with you I believe.  I thought that it was possible you might ask him to stop with you for a day or  so in place of returning to his own home. Therefore I telegraphed to town  asking certain friends of mine to keep a watch on him and&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  am I to understood from all this Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  much. That your game is up. Joyce has told me much; I have waited to see if you  will tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don  Manuel cast a black look at Robin who began to whimper. &ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over. I had to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told him what?&rdquo; demanded the Mexican livid with rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  about the conspiracy&mdash;Frisco, and a few other&mdash;ah, would you&rdquo;&mdash;for Don Manuel  had whipped out his revolver. Herrick was just as quick and the two men faced  one another. Robin gave a shriek like a frightened woman. The sight was an  unpleasant one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried Joyce wringing his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment before you fire Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Herrick coolly, &ldquo;I would have you know that  the firing of a single shot will bring up the police.&rdquo; Santiago dropped his  revolver with a start. &ldquo;The police,&rdquo; he muttered; then after a pause he  returned his weapon to his pocket. &ldquo;You can do the same Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think we shall have much use for them,&rdquo; said Herrick putting away his  weapon and sitting down. &ldquo;I think we may talk now that these preliminaries are  ended. Will you not be seated Se&ntilde;or Manuel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  my own house!&rdquo; exclaimed the Spaniard between his teeth but sat nevertheless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so; I have to ask you pardon for that. But you see my friend, I must stand if  you do, and I am tired. You might use that pretty little weapon in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may do so yet,&rdquo; said Santiago with an ugly look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.  All the same I would point out that your intention has its disadvantages. In  the first place I am a good and a quick shot. In the second as my shot or yours  would summon the police, you might get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police can do nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you attempt to kill me I think they can do a lot. We are not in Mexico now,  Se&ntilde;or Santiago. Come, let us talk sensibly. I am sure you must see that I am in  a position to dictate my own terms. You will not find them hard I assure you  always provided&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Provided  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you did not murder Colonel Carr. If you did, I fear&mdash;I fear I shall be obliged  to hand you over to the police. We have a prejudice against people being killed  in this country, Don Manuel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  curse your fine speeches!&rdquo; growled the Don. &ldquo;I did not kill Carr if that is  what you are driving at.&rdquo; He paused and cast a look at Joyce. &ldquo;I see that you  have got the better of me. If that white-livered cur had held his  tongue&mdash;however I must make the best of a bad job. Come, if I answer your  questions freely and frankly will you promise not to inform the police of what  I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t promise that. If you know where Frisco is you must tell me. I want to  have that man hanged.&rdquo; Joyce started up with a cry. &ldquo;I am sorry Robin, if he is  your father, but as he is a murderer also he must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; interposed Santiago coolly, &ldquo;Frisco is no murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?  Then, as you were in possession of the pistol with which Colonel Carr was shot,  perhaps you can tell me who used it. That is,&rdquo; said Herrick significantly, &ldquo;if  you did not use it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t use weapons of that sort,&rdquo; said Santiago scornfully, &ldquo;besides it was my  game to frighten Carr, not to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. It was you who sent those warnings in cipher.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know that do you. Yes, it was I, and to make Carr afraid. He had few good  nights after he got those warnings I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were all bluff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as I was concerned,&rdquo; replied Santiago easily, &ldquo;but had I chosen they could  have been sent in deadly earnest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think you will until I explain. But first I must be assured of my own  safety before I speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim pulling out his pipe, &ldquo;its this way you see. I want to get to the  bottom of this conspiracy. Also to learn who killed Carr. I could have you  arrested on a charge of trying to kill Marsh,&rdquo; here the Mexican muttered a  curse on Robin&rsquo;s head and the little man winced. &ldquo;But if you will prove to me  that you did not kill Carr and tell me the whole truth, why I will let you go  back to Mexico unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I refuse?&rdquo; demanded Don Manuel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll call up the police and  give you and Joyce in charge for conspiracy and assault with intent to kill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not wish to kill him,&rdquo; protested Manuel, &ldquo;I only wanted to prevent him  going to the vault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so allow the money to pass to Frisco,&rdquo; put in Herrick, &ldquo;very clever. I know all  about that. Tell me something new.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I had only been here before you intimidated this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would have done as he has done,&rdquo; said Herrick; then changing his tone, he spoke  sharply. &ldquo;We are wasting time. Tell me all I want to know; answer my questions,  and you shall go free, save that I shall have you watched until the true  murderer of Colonel Carr has been found. If you refuse you shall be arrested  forthwith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  if I were to shoot you?&rdquo; cried Santiago savagely half rising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would be  hanged, or else you would have to end your own life. Don&rsquo;t I tell you the sound  of the shot will bring up the men I have had posted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  reflected for a moment, then he took out his revolver and tossed it carelessly  on to the table. &ldquo;You are the stronger Se&ntilde;or. I give in. Allow me to roll a  cigarette, and I will answer all your questions. I am not afraid, for I can  swear by the Holy Mother that I did not kill Carr and&mdash;&rdquo; added Santiago with a  gay laugh, &ldquo;I rather regret I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  said Herrick lighting his pipe, &ldquo;the story. In the first place where did you  meet Colonel Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  Mexico about twenty years ago. You would not think it to look at me. But I am  not young, Se&ntilde;or Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you meet Frisco at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joyce&rsquo;s  father? I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;I wanted to tell Herrick the precise relationship  between myself and Colonel Carr, but I grew confused. Was not my mother his  niece? I forget. I am so muddled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It is this way. The uncle of Colonel Carr, a younger brother of his father was  turned out of doors by the grandfather. He went to the States and married. He  died leaving a widow and daughter. The widow died and the daughter married an  American. Your father was the son, and he married your mother. You are their  son. Therefore you were a kind of third or fourth cousin to Carr. Your father  Frisco was a second cousin. I think it is this way, but,&rdquo; Santiago shrugged his  shoulders &ldquo;your English relationships are so very confusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cousins  will do,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Did Carr know that Frisco&mdash;we will continue to call  him so as it is rather confusing&mdash;did Carr I say, know that Frisco was his  second cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  For that reason he allowed Mrs. Joyce an annuity of five hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  was it not continued to our friend here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don  Manuel laughed. &ldquo;I think the Colonel and Frisco had quarrelled by then, and  Carr had told him to look after his own brat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you?&rdquo; cried Robin jumping up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  friend, I repeat what the Colonel said. That is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  interposed. &ldquo;Did Mrs. Joyce know that Frisco was with Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me no. She thought she was a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true,&rdquo; said Robin gloomily, &ldquo;my mother always said that my father had died  in America. I could not believe that Frisco was my father until he convinced  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think we both convinced you,&rdquo; said the Mexican with a laugh, &ldquo;but it strikes me  Dr. Herrick that we are beginning the story at the wrong end. Let me tell it in  my own way. It will be much clearer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it will be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that I have no reason to conceal anything now,&rdquo; said Don Manuel with a  shrug, &ldquo;you may as well know all. The money is lost and I shall return to  Mexico as poor as I set out. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  the story in your own way,&rdquo; growled Herrick disliking the coolness of the man  yet half admiring his nerve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Santiago placing a cigarette in  his mouth and crossing his legs, &ldquo;it is this way. Twenty years ago I met  Colonel Carr. He was in the war between Chili and Peru, and a brave soldier he  was. A brute also. There was nothing he would not do to get money. He had left  his home a pauper, and he swore he would go back a millionaire. But when the  war was at an end, he had not got the fortune he wanted. It was about that time  that Frisco fell in with Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Frisco introduced himself as a cousin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  that,&rdquo; said Santiago briskly. &ldquo;They soon found out the relationship. Joyce&mdash;I  am speaking of your father my friend,&rdquo; this in an aside to Robin, &ldquo;Joyce came  from San Francisco, so the Colonel one day being drunk, called him Frisco&mdash;the  name stuck to him. After that they were what you English call pals, and hung  round Lima trying to make money. I was in the army then and saw much of them.  Frisco was as anxious as Carr to be rich. He said he had left a wife and son in  California.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was you Robin,&rdquo; put in Herrick much interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That was Robin,&rdquo; said Don Manuel with a sour glance at the little man whom he  had not yet forgiven for his cowardly confession. &ldquo;Well Se&ntilde;or, the two tried to  make money and could not. Then they heard of the treasures buried by the  Indians when Pizarro conquered Peru. They went off to Cuzco; afterwards up into  the mountains. For some months they were gone. One day they came back to Lima  to see me, ragged and poor. They had caught an Indian who knew of a large  treasure in gold and jewels. He told them where it was hidden, and gave them a  plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I thought the Indians would not tell,&rdquo; said Herrick, who knew something of the  country of which Santiago was speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  one did,&rdquo; said the Mexican with a smile, &ldquo;they tortured him with a red-hot gun  barrel. Don&rsquo;t look so astonished Se&ntilde;or. Indians are not much above the beasts,  and I told you Carr was a devil. They tortured him till he gave them the plan.  Carr was afraid of losing it, so he made Frisco tattoo it on his breast, and  then burnt the original plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  Herrick started to his feet, &ldquo;I see now why Carr wanted his body watched for a  year! At the end of that time the plan&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  not be recognisable,&rdquo; finished Santiago quietly. &ldquo;Exactly so, Se&ntilde;or. Carr knew  from the ciphers I sent him that I was in the country and would in some way try  to get a sight of that plan. For that, he shut himself up in the tower, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a bit,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;he built that tower when he came home ten years ago.  Your coming did not make him build it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  knew that someone would come and try to kill him,&rdquo; said Don Manuel coolly, &ldquo;but  I am telling the end before the beginning. Let me go on. Well, Dr. Herrick, as  I said, Colonel Carr had that plan tattooed on his breast. He would not show it  to me, but wanted me to join in an expedition to get the treasure. I got the  money and fitted out the expedition. We started off to Cuzco, then up the  Apurimac and on the mountains. I told you something of this before Se&ntilde;or. On  the way they betrayed me into the hands of some Indians, and went on  themselves. I cursed my fate when I learned their treachery. I was held captive  for two, three years. To revenge myself on Carr I told the Indians how he had  found the treasure. They were furious, and sent out men to protect it. But Carr  fought them and got away to the coast with a quantity of jewels, and gold. He  went to the States, and afterwards came on to England where he settled down at &lsquo;The  Pines.&rsquo; But at Lima he was twice nearly assassinated, and knew that the Indians  had appointed some of their more civilised countrymen to follow and kill him  and to cut the plan of the hiding-place out of his flesh. He knew also that  these appointed would follow him across the water to the ends of the earth. But  he managed to give them the slip, and never thought that in an obscure country  village he would be in danger. All the same he built the tower that he might  keep himself safe while asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are you one of these emissaries?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>Santiago shook his head. &ldquo;I  might have been had I so chosen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I wanted a share of the money  myself, or at all events a plan of the hiding-place, that I might search for  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you hear all this, when you were a captive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not&mdash;then. It was when I got back to Lima that I heard. I could not learn  where Carr had gone. I did not know even if Carr was his real name. I hunted  for him both in North and South America, but he had so cleverly concealed his  trail that I could not trace him. Then I was ill for a long time after the  privations I had suffered amongst the Indians. It was only within the last year  that I discovered the whereabouts of Carr. I then came to England to frighten  him. So I sent those cipher warnings. I wanted a share of the money&rsquo; or the  plan. Carr refused to give me either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you saw him then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  he wrote me a letter defying me to do my worst. Of course he thought that I was  one of those appointed to kill him. That was why he lived in the Tower, and  arranged that his body should be watched after his death. Dead or alive you see  he was determined that I should get nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  came down to Saxham to break into the vault?&rdquo; suggested Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I should  have done so, had I not hit upon this other plan&mdash;what you call the conspiracy.  But I thought that through this little fool I might get the money. I deserve it  more than Stephen Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was silence for a few minutes. Santiago was regretting the downfall of his  hopes. Robin was wondering about his own future, and Dr. Jim reflected on the  strange story which had been told to him. &ldquo;Did you never go down to Saxham?&rdquo; he  asked. &ldquo;Oh, yes, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the Mexican airily &ldquo;on the night when Colonel  Carr was murdered, I was at the rectory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Pentland Corn,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;then you knew him before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know him better than anyone in his parish knows him,&rdquo; said Santiago, &ldquo;he is a  gambler. Often he leaves his Church to come to the Pimlico Club and gamble. It  was there that I met him. He was the friend I spoke of when I first saw you,  Se&ntilde;or Herrick&mdash;the friend who told me about Colonel Carr. As I had the secret  of this padre I used him as an intermediator between myself and Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  was surprised to hear this about Corn, and could easily see how the unfortunate  man had been kept under the thumb of this adventurer. &ldquo;You are certainly  skilful in finding tools,&rdquo; said he dryly and with a glance at the silent Joyce.  &ldquo;So you were at the rectory on that night? How can I be sure that you were not  at &lsquo;The Pines?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  You want to accuse me of the murder!&rdquo; said Don Manuel rather amused. &ldquo;I assure  you I did not kill Carr. It was not my aim to do so. I wished to get the money  without danger from your laws. To be plain Se&ntilde;or, I went to Pentland Corn, to  see if he could bribe or force Frisco into betraying Carr into my hands. I came  to Beorminster by a late train, and went to Saxham by the public coach. About  nine I came to the rectory. The Reverend Corn was out, but I waited for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  could not have been out,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Mrs. Marsh was with him, and her son  had come to fetch her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right except as to the time, Se&ntilde;or. Mrs. Marsh had gone by nine, and her  son also. Corn came back and said that he had taken them to the public  conveyance. He was pale, and looked haggard. I told him he lied. He lost his  nerve and threw on the table a pistol&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!  The pistol you gave to Joyce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same,&rdquo; replied Santiago coolly, &ldquo;the weapon with which Carr was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say that Corn killed the Colonel?&rdquo; cried Herrick starting to his  feet. &ldquo;It is a lie. I do not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why ask me to tell you the truth. It was Corn who killed Carr. He was a  gambler, and deeply in the Colonel&rsquo;s debt. Those visits he paid to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo;  were not to convert Carr as he alleged, but to gamble with him. He lost much  money to Carr. The Colonel threatened if he did not pay, to denounce him. Corn  knew that he would lose his position, if this was done. He knew also that Carr  was a threatened man; I had told him. It then occurred to him to kill Carr, and  he thought that the suspicion might be shifted on to those who had lost the  treasure. Thus his secret and himself would be safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is incredible!&rdquo; said Herrick, and even Joyce looked amazed. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo;  replied the Mexican. &ldquo;Of course if you will not believe me I really cannot help  it. I know that Corn is guilty. He told me so himself, and I took from him the  pistol by way of proof. Being thus in my power, I forced him to do my bidding.  You can see now, how he declared that I had not left him on the night Se&ntilde;or  Marsh was assaulted. It was I who struck him, and Corn by my directions proved  the alibi. That is the whole story Se&ntilde;or. Is there anything else you want to  know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whereabouts of Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  I can&rsquo;t tell you that. Frisco trusts no one, not even me. When Joyce or myself  want to see him, we have to put a cipher into the &lsquo;Telegraph.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you must do so now; I want to see the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  He is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you say. But I have yet to be convinced of Pentland Corn&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joyce  jumped to his feet. &ldquo;I am sure my father is innocent,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but I will get  him to see you if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it would be better,&rdquo; said Herrick dryly and took up his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Santiago quietly, &ldquo;how do we stand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall do nothing until I see Corn, and learn if he really killed Carr as you  say. In the meantime Joyce can go back to his flat, and you can remain here Don  Manuel. You are perfectly safe from the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you will have us watched?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;  said Herrick with a nod, &ldquo;you see I cannot trust you. Besides I want you to  write down all you have told me, and sign it. I have Joyce&rsquo;s confession. I want  yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will do so with pleasure,&rdquo; replied the Mexican after a pause, &ldquo;I have done  nothing against your law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,  except try to kill Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  you have promised to hold me guiltless of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough. You are safe so far as that is concerned. There is honour amongst  thieves, Se&ntilde;or Manuel. I have come lately so much into contact with people like  you and Joyce, that I feel rather a bad lot myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Mexican drew himself up and his eyes glittered. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, you shall answer me for  those words. I am a gentleman, and I challenge you to a duel. You dare not  refuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  see about that, when this matter of Carr&rsquo;s death is settled, Don Manuel.  Meantime, remember that every move you make, I shall know of and baffle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Santiago  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The fine scheme is ended,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this little fool  has spoilt all. I will do what you wish Se&ntilde;or, since you are too strong for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. And Joyce, you must get your father to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I can,&rdquo; muttered Robin with a glance of hatred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must,&rdquo; answered Herrick going to the door. &ldquo;Good-bye gentlemen, I shall leave  you to settle your own affairs now.&rdquo; And he went out laughing.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    The Revd. Pentland Corn</b></h2>
  <p>Herrick  did not take all that Santiago had said for gospel truth. The Mexican was too  clever and too bold a man to give in so tamely, seeing what was at stake. For  the moment he had recognised that he was powerless, and had surrendered until  such time as he could recover his position. Dr. Jim could have stopped all his  machinations, by having him arrested for the assault on Stephen. But he did not  wish to bring the police into the matter at present. In the first place so many  lies had been told about the Case, there were so many things to be explained,  that he was not sure of his ground. And for the sake of Stephen he did not wish  to create a scandal. Colonel Carr&rsquo;s reputation was quite bad enough without  making it worse.</p>
  <p>Therefore  the only thing that Jim could do was to have the two scamps watched. Certainly  they might warn Frisco to clear out; but whatever Santiago did, Herrick felt  sure that Joyce would not counsel such a course. The little man knew well  enough that his safety depended upon Herrick, and would do nothing which might  jeopardise his safety. The Mexican might plot and plan; but Joyce would  certainly obey orders. Also, they could do little if closely watched. Herrick  then gave his orders to Kidd and Belcher, and returned the next day to Saxham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  anything important occurs,&rdquo; he said to the ferret, &ldquo;you can wire me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we are in the dark,&rdquo; protested Belcher, &ldquo;if you would only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Belcher,&rdquo; interrupted Jim sharply, &ldquo;we settled all that before. All you have to  do, is to see if either of these men tries to leave the country, or if they  meet a man who looks like a sailor. Then you can wire me. I shall come up to  town at once and deal with the matter myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  might be the sailor&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be anything,&rdquo; replied Herrick dryly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do Belcher. You are not to  know my aims until I choose to let you know. If you will not work for me on  these terms, just say so and I&rsquo;ll get some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do whatever you like Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; said the ferret submissively, and went away  to fulfil his duties devoured with curiosity. In spite of his regard for Dr.  Jim, the man wanted to make money out of him. He therefore determined to learn  all he could about Joyce and the Mexican, and treat with them on his own  account if he gained any knowledge likely to be useful from a blackmailing  point of view. The ferret and his partner were rogues in grain. They did not  even keep faithful to their employer, or to each other for the matter of that. &ldquo;Honour  amongst thieves&rdquo; was not a proverb practised in the Strand office.</p>
  <p>Herrick  had another talk with Joyce before he returned to Saxham. The little man had  gone back to his flat. Having him all to himself, and the yoke of Don Manuel  being to some extent broken, Dr. Jim was able to deal more easily with him. He  promised the poor fool, that if he remained faithful and did not intrigue any  more with his father or the Mexican, that he should be given a new chance of  leading a clean existence. Indeed Herrick spoke so seriously that he reduced  Joyce to tears, and to many protestations that henceforward he would be all  that was good. It was not improbable that he would mend. He had had a severe  lesson, and had narrowly escaped getting into the clutches of the law. With a  less kindly man than Herrick, his position would indeed would have been a  serious one. He therefore appreciated the kindness accorded to him&mdash;or said he  did&mdash;and Jim departed satisfied that so far as Robin was concerned, he had  nullified the schemes of Santiago. In this way he hoped to take the heart out  of the conspiracy against Stephen and Stephen&rsquo;s money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  next person to deal with is Corn,&rdquo; he said to himself as he got into the train,  &ldquo;he is another fool if not worse, as Manuel told me. I seem to have dealt with  nothing but fools and scoundrels ever since I started out on that unhappy  walking tour. Colonel Carr was evil in his life, and he has left an evil  influence behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later  on Dr. Jim reproached himself for blaming the walking-tour. If it had brought  him into trouble it had also given him a promise of future happiness. But for  that walk he would never have met Bess. After all his anxiety in London Herrick  wanted to have a quiet hour with the girl who was the light of his eyes. Jim  did not call her this, for he was not a romantic person; but he felt he would  like to be with her. And he was anxious to know what she had discovered about  the pistol. Bess had not sent him a report as she had promised, and Herrick  concluded that she had discovered nothing worth the sending. All the same he  wished to see her at once. But he put off the happy hour. There was business to  be done before pleasure could be taken.</p>
  <p>It  was after nine o&rsquo;clock before Herrick arrived at the Beorminster Station. He  had not sent for the cart, as he did not wish Stephen to know of his arrival at  present. Dr. Jim had made up his mind to call in and get the truth out of the  clergyman before returning to &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; Therefore, determined to get his  plans into thorough order, Jim left his portmanteau at Beorminster to be sent  on the next morning and himself walked to Saxham.</p>
  <p>In  due time he arrived at the rectory, and was shown into the rector&rsquo;s study,  where he found the man himself. The Revd. Pentland looked nervous at this  untimely visit, and more so as he saw that Dr. Jim was not in evening dress and  must therefore have come straight from town. Corn&rsquo;s conscience was uneasy, and  every untoward event fluttered his nerves. However he composed himself with a  strong effort, and asked Herrick to be seated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have just come from town I see,&rdquo; he observed with a nervous glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  And I want particularly to have a chat with you before going to &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo;  and on a painful subject, Mr. Corn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rector shivered, and turned even paler than usual. &ldquo;Is there anything wrong?&rdquo;  he asked faintly. &ldquo;Let me know the worst at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you expect any worst Mr. Corn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man shook his head and passed a handkerchief across his dry lips. &ldquo;I want to  know the worst,&rdquo; he said again, without heeding the question. &ldquo;I can see by  your face that there is something wrong which concerns me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  gave a short laugh. &ldquo;Upon my word you are a singularly indiscreet man Mr. Corn,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;you give yourself away right and left. When I met you first of all,  you behaved in a foolish manner. Now you are very little better. You are a  clergyman and a gentleman with an assured position. Why don&rsquo;t you assume the  defensive and ask what I mean by such speeches as I have made&mdash;as I am now  making!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I would have to tell you all about myself sooner or later,&rdquo; said Corn in a low  voice. &ldquo;You are a strong man, and I want to confide in someone like yourself. I  am not strong. I was&mdash;once&mdash;but something happened,&rdquo; he sighed and nodded, &ldquo;a  terrible thing happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  wondered if he was about to confess to the murder. However he did not wish to  hurry the confession, which he saw Corn was on the point of making. He wondered  that such a smart and soldierly-looking man should own himself to be so weak. &ldquo;I  am quite at your service,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;and for my own part Mr. Corn I do  not think you have used either myself or Mr. Marsh over well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; This time Corn really did look amazed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told a lie to shield Don Manuel. It was the Mexican who struck that blow at my  friend, and you knew it. How could you a gentleman, and a clergyman stoop to  shield a would-be murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corn  rose to his feet and braced himself to a great effort. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said  frankly, &ldquo;but I was compelled to such a course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded. &ldquo;I know. I have heard all from Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corn  recoiled. &ldquo;He told you,&rdquo; he grasped sitting down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  He told me how he had you in his power; how he forced you to lie for him. I  made him tell me the truth; now I wished to hear the confirmation of this story  from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true; it is true!&rdquo; cried Corn desperately. &ldquo;If he told you that I was a  gambler, that I owed money&mdash;it is true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean that so much,&rdquo; said Herrick sharply, &ldquo;as to the accusation he makes  against you of having murdered Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  clergyman, who had been leaning his head on his arms in an agony of grief,  looked up suddenly with a bewildered stare. &ldquo;Santiago said that about me?&rdquo; he  demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the foulest lie he ever spoke!&rdquo; cried Corn with indignation. &ldquo;I am bad in  many ways Dr. Herrick&mdash;yet I have my excuses, as you shall hear. But as to  murdering Carr, I did nothing of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was it then that Don Manuel obtained from you the pistol with which the crime  was committed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corn  looked round the room, and went to the door. Opening this he looked out for a  moment to see that the coast was clear. Then he shut it locked it and came back  to the fire-place looking more like a ghost than ever. &ldquo;I picked it up,&rdquo; he  said in a whisper, &ldquo;yes, on the lawn of &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; I knew that Colonel Carr  had been shot with it. But I dare not tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not? Were you afraid of being inculpated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Corn hesitated and wiped his face. &ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; he said with a gasp, &ldquo;there  is no help for it! This secret has weighed on my soul until I can bear it no  longer. It was a woman who shot Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  rose slowly hardly believing his ears. &ldquo;A woman?&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
  <p>Corn  nodded and whispered again, &ldquo;Mrs. Marsh,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  said Herrick, &ldquo;is a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth; I swear it is the truth. She shot Carr because he was about to  disinherit her son. If you will sit down I will tell you all I know. I am glad  that it has come to this,&rdquo; panted Corn wiping his forehead, &ldquo;I am glad that I  can tell you. The secret has nearly killed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you tell Santiago?&rdquo; asked Dr. Jim seated again and much bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I told no one. Santiago on the evidence of that pistol really believed that I  was guilty. But it is a lie&mdash;a lie, and he used it to force me to hide his  wickedness. I protested my innocence; but he would never believe me. And that  because I refused to say who was guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  placed his hands on the shoulders of the agitated man and forced him into the  chair. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he in a more friendly tone, &ldquo;you are not so weak or so bad  as I thought Corn. You took the blame on yourself. Oh, I know you protested  your innocence to Santiago; still he would always think you guilty. He is not  the man to believe that any human being would shield another. Why did you  shield Mrs. Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  her son&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Corn, &ldquo;and for the sake of Ida Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. &ldquo;What has she got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  love her,&rdquo; said Corn in a low voice shading his eyes with the palm of his hand,  &ldquo;but she told me that her whole life was wrapped up in Stephen&rsquo;s. If he knew  that his mother had killed Carr, he is quixotic enough to throw up the whole  fortune out of shame. Then he would not be able to marry Ida and her heart  would be broken. It is for this reason that I held my peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you let Stephen be assaulted,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;his death would have ruined the  life of Ida just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know about the assault until after it was committed,&rdquo; said Corn  quickly, &ldquo;then Santiago&mdash;but I cannot tell you the story in scraps like this.  Better let me tell you all about myself, and what led to my present weakness.  Then you will appreciate what I have gone through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded, &ldquo;it is best so. Go on. You can safely confide in me, Corn. I only  retain the right to use such information as may clear up the mystery of this  murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corn  seized his arm. &ldquo;You will not tell about Mrs. Marsh?&rdquo; he panted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  without consulting you. Be certain Corn that I am too true a friend to Stephen,  to do anything harmful to him. But there is much at stake and I must be allowed  to use my own judgment. You can rely on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure of that,&rdquo; said the clergyman in admiration, &ldquo;you are a strong-willed  man. I was strong myself once&mdash;in a way. But my crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Crime!  I thought you had not killed Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Corn in a low voice, &ldquo;But I have the blood of a fellow creature on my  hands for all that,&rdquo; and he buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  judge no man,&rdquo; said Herrick after a pause, &ldquo;but do not tell me anything that  may render it difficult for me to keep sacred your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there is nothing you need fear from that,&rdquo; replied Corn drearily. &ldquo;It was an  accident. Wait till I recover myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man took a turn up and down the room. After five minutes he resumed his seat  and spoke composedly. &ldquo;My name is not Corn,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;Langham is my  name&mdash;Francis Langham. I was in the army.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Bess Endicotte said,&rdquo; nodded Herrick.</p>
  <p>Corn  smiled faintly. &ldquo;Yes! I let that slip one day, when she was talking of my  looking like a soldier. But she does not know my real name. No one does save  the Bishop who gave me this living. Ah! he was a good man. He is dead now. But  I have to thank him for saving my reason and my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was that?&rdquo; asked Herrick settling himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was quartered in the West Indies,&rdquo; said Corn after a pause, &ldquo;and I there had a  friend, who joined about the same time as I did. I need not tell you his name  or the number of my regiment. All you need know is the simple story of my  misery. My friend and I were always together; they called us David and Jonathan  in the regiment. Well,&rdquo; here Corn nerved himself to a tremendous effort, &ldquo;we  were out shooting ducks. We were parted amongst the reeds on the borders of the  lake. I thought I saw the brown back of a duck through some reeds. Without  thinking I fired, and&mdash;I killed my friend! Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  the man&rsquo;s head went down on the table, Herrick clasped him by the shoulder. He  was profoundly moved by the miserable story, and could well understand how a  once strong man had been changed by this tragic deed into a weak, tremulous,  creature. He did not say a word of comfort. It would have been useless. After a  time Corn recovered himself and continued in a dull hard voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was an inquiry. I was exonerated from all blame. But I knew that I had killed  my friend, that I had the blood of a fellow creature on my hands. I left my  regiment and sent in my papers. Under another name I returned to England. All  my relations were dead save my uncle the Bishop. He tried to calm me. I would  not be calm. I would have committed suicide but that I felt that it was my duty  to suffer for my crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a crime,&rdquo; interposed Herrick gently &ldquo;an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  It was. Yet I can&rsquo;t help&mdash;but no matter. I took to gambling to drown my remorse  and grief. I had never touched cards before. They became a passion with me.  Other men take to drink,&mdash;I to cards. But all in vain. When the excitement of  the game was over&mdash;in the morning, then my misery came back. I went to my  uncle. He implored me to find peace in the bosom of the church, for he did not  look upon me as the guilty wretch I was. I consented. As Pentland Corn I  studied for the church. I became a priest,&mdash;a curate and worked in the slums of  the East End. I left off gambling, and felt more at ease, thinking I was  expiating my folly. In an evil hour&mdash;after years of hard work&mdash;my uncle gave me  this living. I took it. Shortly afterwards he died. Then I realised the folly  of accepting a charge where I had time to brood. The past came back to me,  and&mdash;I took to gambling again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was weak Corn,&rdquo; said Herrick decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it was&mdash;but I was in a manner driven to it. There was little work to do  here. Society had no attractions for me. So then I had long&mdash;long hours of  agony. I wanted to forget the past, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should have gone back to the East End.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corn  nodded. &ldquo;I should have done many things,&rdquo; said he bitterly, &ldquo;but that accident  had taken all the manhood out of me. I drifted&mdash;drifted. Well to make a long  story short, I took to going away to London at times to indulge in gambling and  forget my sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. And you went to that club in Pimlico.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did. Santiago told you that I suppose. I met him there. In an incautious moment  I told him about Colonel Carr. Then I heard of the grudge he bore against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know the story of that expedition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  of it. I warned Colonel Carr against his enemy. He laughed, feeling safe in his  tower. Then learning that I was fond of cards, Carr made me play with him. It  was said that I went to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; to convert the man. It was to gamble&mdash;so  low had I sunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shook his head. But he was so sorry for the man that he could not blame him for  his folly. Corn resumed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Night  after night I gambled there. Also I went to London, and met Don Manuel at the  Pimlico club. So, the life went on. And now for the story of that night.&rdquo; Here  Corn drew his chair closer to that of his listener, and continued his  revelation in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew Mrs. Marsh very well and saw much of her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she was a very  violent and terrible woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; said Herrick remembering his own experiences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oftentimes  I tried to check her wrath. She would call and see Carr, and they always fought  when they met. I think Carr enjoyed tormenting her, for he never forbade her  visits. He was a wicked man, Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the worst, judging from his reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  he had his good points. He helped me with money to pay my gambling debts not  twice, but thrice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he know your story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I could not tell it to him, he would only have laughed at my remorse. It would  have seemed foolish to him. He thought that I was simply a profligate  clergyman, and liked me for that very reason, Oh, I do not defend myself  Herrick; I sank low, very low, but my excuse must be the sorrow of my life. It  took all the courage and self respect out of me. But after this I shall give up  this charge and return to the East-End. There I will work hard and forget my  folly, my sorrow. The gambling will lose its hold over me then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will be wise. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  on that day of the murder Mrs. March came to me in a rage. She had heard  through Frisco&mdash;he had spoken in one of his drunken fits&mdash;that Carr was going  to disinherit her son. She went to see him from this house. I tried to stop  her; but she would go. They had a furious quarrel in the afternoon, and Mrs.  Marsh swore that she would kill Carr if he disinherited Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not kill him in the afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Because he was alive after five o&rsquo;clock. Someone saw him at the window of the  tower. Well, Mrs. Marsh dined with me. After dinner she worked herself into a  rage. Carr had laughed at her on that afternoon, and had said that he would do  what he liked with his money. In fact from all she told me, he treated her like  a brute; he was one you know Herrick,&rdquo; and Jim nodded, remembering the torture  of the Indian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stephen  was to come for her,&rdquo; said the rector wearily; the telling of this story  fatigued him. &ldquo;Somewhere about nine o&rsquo;clock she was to meet him at the Carr  Arms, and take the bus back to Beorminster. After eight she went out. It was so  early that I wanted her to stop. She refused. At nine Stephen arrived. He could  not find his mother. She was not at the Carr Arms. I then guessed that she had  gone to see Carr again. In my fear lest she might do something dreadful I  blurted out my suspicions. At once Stephen understood what I meant. He went  himself to &lsquo;The Pines;&rsquo; I waited for some time. Then I was in such a state that  I followed. The house was all ablaze, but I heard nothing. This was about half  past nine or a quarter to ten. I went up as far as the door. On the steps I  picked up that pistol&mdash;which I guessed had been used by Mrs. Marsh. I slipped  it into my pocket. Then I returned home. I went also to the Carr Arms and  learned that Stephen and his mother had caught the bus some time after nine o&rsquo;clock,  I tried to think that Mrs. Marsh had not shot the man. I returned here to think  it out. Santiago was waiting for me. He had come by the last bus from  Beorminster, and had been waiting since nine. In fact he came just after I went  after Stephen. It was really a quarter past nine when he came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he had been to &lsquo;The Pines?&rsquo; asked Herrick keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know. But you can learn that from the busman who drove him here. I did  not inquire myself. He had come to get me to take him to see Carr. I refused,  and without thinking I threw the pistol on the table. I was much agitated, and  he saw that. He got out of me that I had been to &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; After looking at  the pistol he said he would go to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; himself. I refused to let him go.  After a time I gave him some money and persuaded him to go. I drove him to  Heathcroft station in my cart. He took the pistol with him. I did not notice  that he had done so. In a day or two when the murder became known he wrote and  accused me of being the criminal. I denied it. But he had read the report of  the death and how the wound had been inflicted by an old-fashioned weapon. When  he came here with Joyce he insisted that I was guilty. I said that I was not  but would say nothing about Mrs. Marsh. It was this knowledge that he used to  make me hold my tongue about the assault on Stephen. What could I do Herrick?&rdquo;  said Corn piteously. &ldquo;Appearances were against me. Santiago could prove that I  had the pistol. I had been to &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; and I owed Colonel Carr money. Also  there was my own story. Had I been arrested, all would have come out. No! I had  to do what Santiago told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim, &ldquo;I can see your dilemma. And what about Mrs. Marsh? Did Stephen  suspect her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He told me that he had gone to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; and looked at the house. He saw  nothing and heard nothing. He therefore returned to the Carr Arms, and found  his mother waiting for him. She said that he had missed her, and evidently  invented a story which satisfied him. No Herrick, I do not think Stephen  suspected his step-mother. But she shot the Colonel I am sure. She left my  house in a rage and she several times threatened to kill him. Then she was not  at the Carr Arms. After nine the man was shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded. &ldquo;Did you ask Mrs. Marsh to explain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  She fell ill if you remember, and took to her bed. I could not bring myself to  see her. I therefore held my tongue, and I should have continued to do so but  that Don Manuel threatened me. Therefore I determined to tell you all when I  could. What you heard from him is in the main true. But I did not kill Carr.  The blood of one human being on my hands is enough. Do you despise me Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim rose and took the hand of the unhappy man. &ldquo;My friend, I pity you from the  bottom of my soul. If you had only found some one to advise you, all this  trouble would not have occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true. But my uncle who knew the story of my misery was dead. I shrank from  telling anyone. But when I got to know you and saw how strong and self-reliant  you were, and recognised also the goodness of your heart I felt that I could  safely confide in you, You will not tell anyone what I have told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need  you ask me that!&rdquo; said Herrick with a hearty shake of the hand. &ldquo;Of course your  secret is safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  about Mrs. Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall see into that,&rdquo; said Herrick gravely. &ldquo;Remember Santiago is a dangerous  man. I do not know what trouble he may yet cause. If necessary I must use what  you have told me about the crime. But you may be sure that for Stephen&rsquo;s sake  and for yours, I shall be circumspect in my dealings with the matter. As for  you, my friend, wait here until this mystery is quite solved; then go back to  the East End, or to the Wild Lands as a missionary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Corn with a sigh, &ldquo;I know. Only in that way shall I find rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men shook hands and parted very good friends. Corn returned to his study  intensely relieved by the sympathy, and by the fact that he had some one to  share his secret. Herrick walked home to &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; wondering at the  perplexity of the case. He thought less of Corn than of Mrs. Marsh. Suddenly he  stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;this was why Mrs. Marsh poisoned herself with an  overdose of chloral. Poor woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    Another Mystery</b></h2>
  <p>The  first thing that struck Dr. Jim the next day, was an alteration in the  demeanour of his friend. When Herrick arrived at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; after his visit to  Corn, the Squire had already retired to bed, and was asleep, so the servant  said. Not wishing to disturb him, Jim had supper all to himself, and went to  his own room after a brisk walk on the terrace. It struck him as curious that  Stephen did not come down to breakfast the next morning as he was now  comparatively well. On asking for the Squire he was informed that Marsh-Carr  had gone out for a walk. Herrick therefore had another lonely meal, wondering  the while what had taken Stephen out so early. The young man did not return  till late in the afternoon, and then excused himself by stating that he had  been to see Petronella at Beorminster.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is still in that dull house,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr gloomily, &ldquo;although I think she  is tired of it and wants to go to her own country. But she refuses to go all  the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is her reason?&rdquo; asked Herrick sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t get it out of her. She says my mother left a message with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  you, I suppose? Well why doesn&rsquo;t she deliver it and get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  message is for you Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim stared. &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, what possible message can your poor  mother have left for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  really do not know,&rdquo; replied Stephen indifferently, &ldquo;you had better see  Petronella and ask her. She is looking very ill and if she stays much longer in  that damp house she will die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right,&rdquo; replied Herrick coolly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look her up some time. I daresay the  message is only one asking me to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  Dr. Jim said, but in his heart he was wondering if the dead woman had left  behind her any confession of her crime. She might have done so. Yet if she had  poisoned herself to escape the consequences, it would have been foolish of her  to incriminate herself. Herrick resolved to see Petronella at the first  opportunity and learn what it was that she had to tell him. If there were any  really important message it was strange that the old Italian had not delivered  it long ago. He had seen her frequently and there had been ample opportunity  for her to fulfil her mistress&rsquo; dying wish. However Herrick put this out of his  mind for the moment and turned his attention to Stephen. &ldquo;You are not looking  well Steve,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;your face is white, you have dark rings round  your eyes, and a haggard look as though you had not slept all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not yet quite myself,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr in a far more irritable tone than  Herrick had ever heard him use before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can see that, and being someone else has not improved your temper. I hope I  have not offended you by going to town Steve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. How can you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Dr. Jim looking at him, &ldquo;it struck me that you have been trying to avoid  me lately. If you are tired of me Steve, you need only say so, and I&rsquo;ll pack up  and go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I&rsquo;m hanged if you will,&rdquo; said the Squire vigorously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do without you. I  have been worried a trifle and it has told on my present state of health. I&rsquo;ll  be all right in a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there anything I can help you with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  It is a private matter, and concerns myself only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the face of this intimation Herrick could not press his inquiries and began to  speak on other subjects, Stephen replying more or less absently. As soon as he  could he withdrew to his own room, saying he wanted to lie down. Herrick did  not seek to detain him, but shook his head. &ldquo;Something is wrong and he won&rsquo;t  tell me what it is,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I wonder if Santiago has been tampering with  him in any way. Perhaps Bess may know the reason for this change. I&rsquo;ll see her  at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the extraordinary thing was that he found Bess changed also. He had left her  bright and merry, anxious to probe the secret of Colonel Carr&rsquo;s death. He  returned to find her nervous, ill at ease, and disinclined to continue her  detective investigations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think we shall arrive at anything,&rdquo; she said when Herrick pressed her. &ldquo;I  spoke to Inspector Bridge and he can do nothing. He is a professional, and if  he fails, how can we hope to succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inspector  Bridge is a conceited ass,&rdquo; replied Dr. Jim gravely. &ldquo;He knows absolutely  nothing. I know more than he does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see the Mexican and Mr. Joyce?&rdquo; asked Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw them and I spoke to them, and I have found out something which I need not  tell you just now. It would be useless to do so. I must search out the matter  for myself, and when I succeed you shall know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  sighed. &ldquo;I do not mind in the least,&rdquo; she said mournfully. &ldquo;I have ceased to  take an interest in the matter. If Frisco did not kill Colonel Carr I do not  know who did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  You are changeable, like all women,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim rather puzzled by her  attitude, yet never guessing its cause. &ldquo;By the way, did you find out anything  about that pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Bess thought she might as well tell him, as he would certainly learn the truth  sooner or later from Bridge. &ldquo;The bullet fits the barrel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought so,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;It is the weapon which was used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  answered Bess; then after a pause. &ldquo;I made another discovery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you did? And about what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bullet which was used. It is of silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  silver? What do you mean? Isn&rsquo;t it lead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  laughed rather irritably. &ldquo;If it was of lead how could it be silver?&rdquo; she asked  and then went on to tell how the jeweller had examined the missile. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it  curious?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded absently. His eyes were fixed on the ground and he was trying to think  of the reason Mrs. Marsh could have had for using so expensive a bullet.  Certainly the weapon was old-fashioned and she would have to manufacture the  bullets for herself. But why use silver in preference to lead, or pewter? In an  ordinary household the supply of the last two metals was likely to be more  plentiful than the first. This was a problem, but one of so trifling a nature  that Herrick dismissed it almost immediately. He turned his attention to Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  have you and Stephen been doing with yourselves?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Bess  started violently and changed colour at once. &ldquo;Nothing Jim,&rdquo; she said stiffly, &ldquo;why  do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  you both look ill. Stephen is avoiding me, and you are as silent as an owl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  so stupid I hope,&rdquo; said Bess with a laugh. At this moment Ida entered the room,  and nothing more was said. But Ida also complained of Stephen&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;I wish  you would make him stay in bed Dr. Jim,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am certain that he has  got up too soon and is not strong enough to go about. Look how pale he is, and  silent. I can&rsquo;t get a word out of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded. &ldquo;I am not pleased myself Ida. This comes of my running away to Town. I&rsquo;ll  exert my authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke to Stephen and urged him to lie up for a few days. The young man obeyed  meekly enough, and this very meekness made Herrick uneasy. He would rather that  Stephen had shown fight. But the Squire remained in bed, took what was given  him, and hardly ever opened his mouth. Ida was in despair; Herrick was puzzled,  and the two met to discuss the situation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  did he change like this?&rdquo; asked Dr. Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it was the day after you left,&rdquo; replied Ida tearfully, &ldquo;I went to  Beorminster to see Flo, and left him quite bright. When I met him again, he was  dull, and quiet, and white. Yet Bess was with him while I was away, so he  should not have missed me so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Jim with sudden interest, &ldquo;so Bess was with him, was she? H&rsquo;m! It strikes  me that Bess herself is not so bright as she might be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you are right there,&rdquo; said Miss Endicotte, &ldquo;she is sad and silent just like  Stephen. Or else she is so gay that I think she is too excited. She cries for  the least thing, and laughs without any cause.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  Sounds like hysteria to me. Yet Bess is not given that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not,&rdquo; said Ida repelling the suggestion hastily, &ldquo;she is a strong,  healthy, sensible girl and above such weakness. But as you say she and Stephen  have both changed. I think,&rdquo; here Ida hesitated and looked down. It amazed  Herrick when she looked up to see that her eyes were filled with tears. He  could not understand it all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear girl what is the matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed irritably, &ldquo;are you ill also. The  devil has broken loose here since my departure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;help  it,&rdquo; sobbed Ida, &ldquo;I thought that Bess and Stephen might&mdash;might like one  another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they do Ida. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t understand what I mean. I wonder if they were in love with one another  and regret their engagements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  burst into such a hearty fit of laughter that she was cheered. &ldquo;I never heard  such nonsense in my life!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is your women&rsquo;s wit Ida? Why, Bess  loves me devotedly I am certain. As for Stephen, he adores the very ground you  walk on. No! It&rsquo;s not that my dear girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  what can it be?&rdquo; asked Ida drying her tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall question Bess until I find out,&rdquo; said Herrick grimly. &ldquo;You have no idea  how I can torture people with cross examination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>True  to his idea, Dr. Jim sought out Bess. He came across her in the Pine wood  beside the fairy circle. Her eyes were cast on the ground and she looked  despondent. When she saw Herrick she made as if to go away.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim felt wounded. &ldquo;Bess! Don&rsquo;t you want to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do,&rdquo; she said brightly, &ldquo;only, I&rsquo;m not very well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  is Stephen,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, and he saw by her start that the remark made her  nervous. &ldquo;Have you two quarrelled?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  we have not; we are great friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you in love with one another then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  grew crimson and stamped. &ldquo;How dare you say such a thing as that even in jest?&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;What would Ida say if she heard it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Ida&rsquo;s own idea,&rdquo; replied Herrick with a smile, &ldquo;seeing you two so glum, she  fancied that you regretted your engagements and wanted to marry one another.  Just say if this is the case Bess and Ida and I will console each other! That  would be only fair, you know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  first smile that Herrick had seen on her face since his return dimpled the  cheek of Bess. &ldquo;I never heard such nonsense. I like Stephen, but you are the  man I love. You stupid Jim; you know that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not quite sure if I do,&rdquo; said Jim gravely; &ldquo;in love there should be complete  confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely  there is, between us,&rdquo; said Bess nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t look me in the face and repeat that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  made the attempt, and failed. &ldquo;It is nothing!&rdquo; she said obstinately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  <i>is</i> something however,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim sternly, &ldquo;you and Stephen have some  secret between you which is making you both ill. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  there <i>is</i> a secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t be questioned like this!&rdquo; cried Bess with angry evasion.</p>
  <p>Herrick  took her by the arm and forced her to look into his face. &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;I am to be your husband, and you must obey and consult me in all things.  If you are playing with fire, I must know. Do you not trust me Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But the secret is not my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  that case I won&rsquo;t press you for an explanation,&rdquo; he said relaxing his grip, &ldquo;you  are a foolish girl to have any secrets from one who loves you. But I suppose  you have given your word not to tell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I cannot break my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  nodded. &ldquo;I do not ask you to. The secret of Stephen shall be respected. I do  not even ask you if it has to do with the murder of his uncle. There is no need  to ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  looked at him irresolutely, her face scarlet. Then without a word she went  slowly away. Herrick looked after her and nodded to himself. &ldquo;I believe she has  found out something about Mrs. Marsh, and has told Stephen; that would account  for their melancholy and for the secret which she says exists between them. I  shall ask Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  same afternoon Herrick went back to &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; and into the bedroom of  Marsh-Carr. The young man was lying staring at the ceiling. He seemed listless  and worn-out. When Jim entered he turned his face towards the wall so as to  avoid his friend&rsquo;s eyes. Herrick pretended to take no notice although he was  cut to the heart by the avoidance of his gaze. He was very fond of Stephen, and  mourned over this thing which had come between them. However it was necessary  to take extreme measures if the situation was to be improved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo;  said Herrick formulating a plan, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat alone any longer, you must come  down to dinner to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stephen in a muffled tone, &ldquo;I am too ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know you are. Life and brightness and my society are what you need. I was wrong  to send you to bed. As your doctor I now order you to get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  turned sulky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not know what is good for you my friend,&rdquo; said Herrick coolly, &ldquo;I shall  expect to find you dressed and down to dinner at eight. After a good meal you  will be more like your old self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this way after much coaxing, scolding, ordering and threatening Jim got the  young man to get up and dress. Marsh-Carr did so reluctantly enough, for he was  desperately afraid of betraying the secret he had told Bess, to the sharp eyes  of Herrick. However he was really tired himself of being alone. This seclusion  could not be kept up for ever, and it was as well to make a beginning and get  back into the old routine. He therefore dressed with some care after a bath,  and came down into the drawing-room looking much better. Herrick was standing  on the hearth-rug, big and masterful. &ldquo;Here you are at last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just in  time for a glass of sherry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  protested, but Herrick insisted. &ldquo;You want something to make you eat after  being in bed all day. This sherry and bitters will do for a medicine. I want  you to eat and drink well to-night Steve. You must get colour into your cheek  and fire into your eye. What will Ida say if I attend to you so badly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  drank the sherry and felt better. Then they went to eat a capital dinner and  Dr. Jim saw that his friend tasted every dish. He also made him drink  champagne, and talked the whole time in a lively way that was infectious. By  the time dinner was over Stephen felt positively happy. Then came cigars,  coffee, and cognac, in the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  Steve, don&rsquo;t you feel better?&rdquo; said Herrick when they were seated vis-&agrave;-vis  beside a blazing fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied the Squire and looking round the gorgeously-coloured room, at the  evidence of wealth and luxury spread out on every hand. &ldquo;I feel immensely  better. I suppose I shall pick up soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you follow the advice I shall leave with you, I think you will,&rdquo; said Herrick  with intention and stared at the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean Jim? You don&rsquo;t intend to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  but I do though Steve. I cannot stay with anyone who does not trust me wholly.  I want to be your friend. Your step-mother asked me to look after you. I  promised to do what I could, but unless you give me your unreserved confidence,  it is useless for me to remain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  rose agitated and began to pace the room. &ldquo;I trust you in every way Jim; you  know I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know nothing of the sort Steve. You trust Bess though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  She has told you?&rdquo; cried Marsh-Carr angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  she has told me nothing. But I am not a fool Steve and I have eyes in my head.  I saw that she was as sad as you, and by putting two and two together I became  certain that there was something between you to make both sad. Bess would not  tell me anything, nor did I ask her. She is a loyal little woman. Still from  her manner I guessed there was a secret. I am certain,&rdquo; added Herrick looking  steadily at his friend, &ldquo;that such a secret can only have to do with the death  of your uncle. Now, as I am looking after this case you must tell me what you  know. If you do not, I shall throw up the matter and leave you. I must be  trusted all in all, or not at all, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  Herrick was speaking Stephen had sat down. He changed from red to white from  white to red again and his breathing became short and hard. He saw that Herrick  was in earnest, and that he would either have to tell or lose his friend. In a  tumult of anxiety he rose again and began to pace the room. &ldquo;You put me to a  hard test,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  I do,&rdquo; replied Dr. Jim calmly, &ldquo;but it is to prove your friendship and your  manhood. Tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will despise me if I do,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr thoughtlessly and regretted the words  almost as soon as they had left his mouth.</p>
  <p>Herrick  appeared unmoved although he was inwardly surprised. &ldquo;I do not think anything  you could say or do would make me despise you,&rdquo; he said in his calmest tone. &ldquo;I  know you too well to think you would do anything dishonourable. Come what is  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Stephen still remained silent, his eyes on the ground, He was debating whether  he would go on or not. Herrick saw his hesitation and guessed its cause. &ldquo;You  have got over the worst now,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;Come along, Steve. Sit down  and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Stephen hoarsely, &ldquo;I prefer to stand up.&rdquo; Then suddenly. &ldquo;It was I who  fired those three shots into the body of my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it?&rdquo; said Herrick quietly. &ldquo;And why did you do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I was mad at the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you not better tell me the whole affair? Then I shall be in a position to judge  of your madness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  was amazed at the calm way in which his friend took the intelligence. However  he had gone so far that there was nothing left to do but to confess all as he  had confessed to Bess. In a hurried manner the young man repeated the tale, and  informed Herrick how Bess had found out the truth by means of the revolver. &ldquo;And  now you must despise me&rdquo; was his final remark. He sunk into his chair with a  groan.</p>
  <p>Herrick  paused for a moment to think. Then he carefully lighted his pipe. &ldquo;I do not  despise you by any manner of means,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;but I must admit that I  think you are quixotic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  word&mdash;to Stephen&rsquo;s mind was so inapplicable to the situation that he looked up  astonished, scarcely believing his ears. &ldquo;Quixotic!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I do not  quite see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Herrick nodding, &ldquo;you see Mrs. Marsh is dead, so no harm can be done to  her. It is good of you to screen her memory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!  Stop! What do you mean Herrick?&rdquo; cried the Squire much agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that you have taken this guilt on your head to screen your step-mother&rsquo;s  memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  paused. Then he looked up resolutely. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I may tell you, if I  tell no one else. It was my mother who fired those shots. Bess found out about  my pistol which my mother used, so I took the blame on myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  chivalrous ass!&rdquo; said Herrick with a growl, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve been fretting over  this? Why didn&rsquo;t you save time by telling me before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind what you thought. After you came to seek your mother at the rectory, and  did not find her, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  stared. &ldquo;How do you know that I did not find her there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know more than you think. Tell me all that you saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw nothing,&rdquo; replied Stephen. &ldquo;Corn said that my mother had gone to the Carr  Arms. I could not find her there. I fancied in one of her rages, she might have  gone up to &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; I went there but saw nothing. Then I came back to the  Carr Arms and found my mother. She said I had missed her. I thought she spoke  the truth. I never questioned her even after I heard of Carr&rsquo;s death. It never  entered my head that she had killed the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how did you guess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  came into my head like a flash when Bess said that my revolver was empty in  three chambers. I was certain that when I put it away the whole six were  loaded. Even as Bess spoke it entered my mind that my mother must have taken  the revolver, and have gone up after she left the rectory a second time, to  threaten the Colonel. She must have found him dead and then have fired the  three shots into his body. Then she replaced the revolver. I never thought of  looking at it. It was brought here along with some other things and it was only  when Bess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; nodded Dr. Jim, &ldquo;now look here Steve, had your mother another pistol&mdash;an  old-fashioned horse pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I am sure she had not. At least, I never saw her with one. It was with such a  pistol that Carr was shot. Good heavens Herrick, you do not mean to say that my  mother killed the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well;  I have heard your account and I have heard the account of Corn. I do not know  how to reconcile the two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Corn&mdash;Corn  the rector? What has he to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  good deal. So have Joyce and Santiago and others. See here Steve, I have been  searching for evidence in this case for a long time. To spare you I said  nothing, but now that your step-mother has been brought into the matter it is  but right you should know. Sit down. I will tell you a long and interesting  story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rather  dazed, Stephen did as he was told. Then Dr. Jim related all that he had  learned, bringing the narrative down to the end of his interview with the Revd.  Pentland Corn. &ldquo;Now what do you think?&rdquo; he asked when the whole story was told.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know what to think. My mother&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe that she would&mdash;would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does seem strange,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;but I tell you what. It is my opinion that  this message Petronella will deliver, will tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    A Message From The Dead</b></h2>
  <p>The  old Italian woman looked very ill. Her form was shrunken, her face thin and  white, her eyes unnaturally large. Evidently the misty climate of the midlands  chilled her to the bone. She had developed a hacking cough, and shook with ague  when the east wind tormented Beorminster. Herrick was shocked at the change  which had taken place in her appearance during these few short weeks.  Apparently Petronella was not long for this world. But the near approach of  death did not appal her; she was terribly lonely, now that her mistress was  gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Dottore,&rdquo; she croaked when Herrick made his appearance, &ldquo;you have come to see  me. That is good. But you will not cure me. No. I am dead Signor. Dio mio! what  does it matter?&rdquo; and she ended with a characteristic shrug, punctuated with a  cough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you do look ill Petronella,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim sympathetically. &ldquo;I must ask the  Squire to send over someone to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the old woman obstinately, &ldquo;I am well here. And it will not be for long  signor. Soon shall I be in my beautiful Italy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  least, come over to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; Petronella. You will be better attended to  there, and it is warmer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Petronella crossed herself with pious horror. &ldquo;Go to that devil casa Signor!  Not me. He had the evil eye, that man who died. Si Signor. I went one day with  the padrona, and he swore at me. I had an accident the next day. Cospetto; a  jettatura that Signor. But come in, come in, Signor Dottore. This is the best  room,&rdquo; she led Herrick into what had once been the drawing-room. &ldquo;Un bicchi&eacute;re  de Chianti Signor. Signor Stefan sent me some Chianti.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  thank you Petronella,&rdquo; replied Herrick sitting down on a dusty seat, &ldquo;I want to  have a chat with you. We will talk in your own language if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  no, Signor, I speak the English well, thanks be to the saints. My padrona was  fond of speaking the English. So, we will talk Signor Dottore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  acquiesced with a shrug. He was quite prepared to talk any language she chose  provided he got what he wanted. He was not very certain how to go about the  matter. Petronella was a shy bird, and inclined to be obstinate. He felt his  way in a round-about fashion, so as to take her by surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be glad to get back to Italy Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si!  Si. To the little town by the Adriatic. There I was born Signor, and there will  I die&mdash;if I die not here. Ah Dio!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are in pain I fear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Petronella  shrugged her lean shoulders &ldquo;I am always in pain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my legs and  body&mdash;all pain. But the padrona left me something to take thanks be to her,  povera signora, and the pain goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  chloral, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si  Signor. A little bottle of chloral. I take not much, only when I am bad, so  bad. Then the pain goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  careful what you do Petronella. Remember your mistress died from taking too  much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be careful,&rdquo; muttered the old woman, &ldquo;eh Dio mio! what does it matter if  I die? All alone in this big house, and Signor Stefano away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw him the other day he told me,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim carefully approaching his  business, &ldquo;he told me you had some message for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Petronella  nodded and screwed up her thin lips. &ldquo;Only when he is in danger Signor. Not  now. He is too well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean Petronella?&rdquo; asked Herrick puzzled by her nods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor  Dottore,&rdquo; said Petronella standing very straight, &ldquo;my padrona before she died  called to me. She gave me a large letter, and told me to give it to the Signor  Dottore when Signor Stefano was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Herrick&rsquo;s eyes flashed. He had always wondered how it was that Mrs. Marsh had  died without making any sign. After the conversation she had had with him he  quite expected that she would have left him a farewell message. It appeared  that she had done so, but that the letter had been withheld by Petronella,  according to instructions. &ldquo;When did she write this Petronella? You said  nothing about it at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I did what I was told to do Signor. Ecco Signor Dottore, it was in this way.  After my padrona got the letter from the postman in the middle of the day, she  was very angry and afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid!  Why was she afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chi  lo sa,&rdquo; shrugged Petronella, &ldquo;she said nothing to me. But she told me to bring  pen and ink and paper. All the afternoon she was writing. Eh, how she did  write! Then she put all the writing into an envelope Signor, and wrote our name  on it. She told me to give it to the Signor Dottore when Signor Stefano was in  danger. She said the Signor Dottore was a good man.&rdquo; I give it to you Signor,  but not now; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Petronella closing her mouth firmly shook her aged head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you had better give it to me this very minute Petronella,&rdquo; said Herrick  rising, &ldquo;for Signor Stefano is in very great danger indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  how Signor Dottore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may be accused of murdering his uncle, Colonel Carr!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh  Dio mio!&rdquo; crowed the old women. &ldquo;Did I not say that the dead man had the evil  eye! Did I not tell the Signora that evil would come to the young Signor from  this death?&rdquo; She caught Herrick&rsquo;s arm and fixed her glittering eyes on his  face. &ldquo;You swear to me that this is true what you say? Signor Stefano is in  danger. Eh? Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  swear he is Petronella,&rdquo; replied Herrick earnestly, &ldquo;and this packet you talk  of may save him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  si! Well do I know Signor Dottore that is so. My padrona said that it told how  the danger could be set aside. You understand. In this letter Signor, there is  a strange story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you now what it is Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signor Dottore. The padrona did not tell me. But she said it was a strange  story. And to be read when my young Signor was in danger. I will go and bring  it. La! La! La! It is danger. Dio mio! That wicked Signor who is  dead&mdash;birbanti&mdash;ladroni. The evil eye&mdash;the evil eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coughing  as she went the old woman hobbled out of the room. Dr. Jim sat still wondering  if he was about to learn the truth at last. If Pentland Corn was to be  believed, Mrs. Marsh had been at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; about the hour when the crime had  been committed. Herrick did not now believe that she had killed the man herself,  as she had been possessed of the modern revolver with which the three shots had  been fired. It was impossible to imagine that she had fired one shot with an  old-fashioned weapon, and had then reverted to the use of the new revolver. No!  The first shot,&mdash;the death shot had been fired by some one else, possibly by  Frisco. Mrs. Marsh had met the assassin in the house, but for reasons of her  own had not divulged the name.</p>
  <p>Also  judging from her conversation she had known a great deal about Carr and Frisco,  especially about the latter, seeing that she had warned Jim that Frisco might  attempt to kill Stephen. As a matter of fact although the man had not struck  the blow himself, he had guided the hand of Santiago to strike it. Herrick  wondered if Mrs. Marsh would say anything about the Mexican. &ldquo;At all events I  shall know the truth at last,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After reading this letter, the mystery  will be one no longer. But why did Mrs. Marsh delay such important information  all this time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a question he could not answer. He was still puzzling over it when  Petronella entered the room carrying a large blue envelope, sealed with the  Carr crest. This she handed to Herrick with much ceremony. &ldquo;There is my trust  Signor,&rdquo; she croaked, &ldquo;bear witness by all the saints that I gave it only when  the young Signor was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is all right Petronella. I shall read it here. Will you stay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Signor Dottore. I do not want to hear the secrets of my padrona. I go to make  myself a meal Signor. You stay here and read. A glass of wine Signor Dottore.  Eh, pour l&rsquo;amor di Dio, un bicchi&eacute;re de Chianti?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  politely refused the attention, and Petronella went grumbling out of the room.  She was a hospitable old soul, and liked the doctor. When he was alone in that  dismal, deserted, apartment, he drew up his chair close to the window and  opened the envelope. Five or six sheets of closely-written paper fell out; also  a typewritten letter. After a glance at this last, Dr. Jim smoothed out the  paper and began to read. The story&mdash;as it might be called&mdash;commenced abruptly.  This impetuosity was extremely characteristic of Mrs. Marsh. After a glance  round the room Dr. Jim settled to read. The manuscript was as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a wicked woman and an evil woman. There you see Mr. Herrick I place my  character before you in the first line. I know you are no fool, or I should  not make such a confession. But when you read these pages I shall be in my  grave, so what you say or think does not matter. If these pages are made  public, there will be blame enough from other people. To save my boy they must  be made public. I can foresee that he will be accused of the murder of that  beast Carr. I swear that he is innocent. He knows nothing. From the grave I  send out my voice to defend him. And you are a clever man Herrick. The defence  of my poor boy I confide to you. If you do not do your best I swear to haunt  you if it be possible for the dead to return. But after all, you are too  sensible to be frightened by this talk. Let me get to the facts of the case.  Those will interest you more than the ravings of a dying woman. So I begin:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have said that Colonel Carr was a beast. I repeat it. He was a cruel tiger.  Rolling in wealth, he refused to give me any money. Yet he knew that I was  accustomed to luxury, and that Stephen was his nephew. No wonder I hated the  man. Again and again I implored &lsquo;him almost on my knees to allow me sufficient  to live on. He always refused with his sneering laugh. Often I wonder that I  did not kill him. Yet he had one good point. He had loved his sister, and out  of love for her memory, he made Stephen his heir. He also caused him to be  educated, but when that was done, he refused to allow him an income to live  like a gentleman. I hated Carr for that. Even if he had not allowed me money,  still his own sister&rsquo;s child should not have felt the pinch of poverty. I love  Stephen. He is a kind, good boy, and has put up with my vile temper all these  years. Now that he is rich I hope he will marry Ida, if she does not prefer you,  and I do not think that is likely), and live the happy life of a country  gentleman. My blessings on them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  come to the point which I know you want to reach. On the night of Carr&rsquo;s murder  I was at the rectory. It came to my ears through some words dropped by Frisco  when he was intoxicated, that Carr intended to disinherit my son. Whom he  intended to favour I do not know, nor do I care. But I could not stand meekly  by and see the lad robbed of what was righteously his own. I went into Saxham  that afternoon to see Carr and to remonstrate against his committing the  monstrous injustice he contemplated. He saw me with the greatest coolness and  behaved quite in accordance with his character. In vain did I point out that  Stephen was the sole living representative of his blood, and was entitled by  law to the property. Carr said that he had another relative living; a cousin  descended from an uncle of his, who had been turned out of doors by his  grandfather. This uncle had married in America, and had died, leaving a  daughter who married a Yankee. It was the son of this daughter to whom Carr  referred as his cousin. Furthermore he declared that his cousin had a son about  the age of my Stephen. I asked him if he intended to leave the property to this  cousin and his brat. But this he denied. He said that he had made the money  himself and would leave it to whomsoever he pleased. In a word he defied me. I  was helpless. I could do nothing, and that afternoon I left &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; mad  with rage, after a threat to kill Carr. Needless to say he laughed at my  threat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did I not kill him then you will ask? Because I wanted to give the man one last  chance. I warned him that I would shoot him if he persisted in his injustice. I  said that I would return that evening for my answer. Then I went to the rectory  and had dinner with Pentland Corn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,  my dear Herrick, I may state that I had brought a pistol with me&mdash;or rather a  revolver. It belonged to Stephen who at one time had a craze for shooting. The  revolver was put away in its case, which was on the mantelpiece of his study. I  remembered that it was there, and on looking I found that all six chambers were  loaded. I knew that Stephen never troubled about the weapon, so I took it with  me to &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo; But on that afternoon I did not use it. Carr, I said to  myself, should have his chance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stephen  was to come to the rectory for me about nine. Some time before that I told Corn  that I would go to the Carr Arms to meet Stephen, but I intended to go to &lsquo;The  Pines;&rsquo; Corn never suspected my intention. I went quickly up to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo;  shortly before nine. I found no one in the lower part of the house. Frisco, I  suppose was sleeping off his drunken fit, as I heard from Napper that he had  been drinking in the afternoon and had uttered threats against his master. I  knew that if anywhere, Carr would be in the Tower. The table was laid out for  dinner, but he was not in the dining-room. I went upstairs, and found him in  the tower chamber. He was in evening dress lying dead with his face downward. I  turned him over, and saw that he had been shot through the heart. At once I  guessed that Frisco had carried out his threat and had murdered the Colonel.  But I thought Carr might have altered his will before dying. I was quite mad  with rage, thinking he had cheated me. Then I did what you will consider a  terrible and a barbarous thing. I fired three shots into his dead body. I  suppose it was wicked of me, seeing that the man was dead. But I am Italian as  you know, and I was mad with fury at the thought of how this beast had treated me.  The only revenge I could take was to have my share in his death, so I fired  three times. It did me good, and I came away much calmer. I see you raise your  eyebrows in horror, my virtuous Herrick! Ah bah! you are English, and  cold-blooded as a frog. I am Italian, and I did what I did. I have no other  excuse to make.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was only a few minutes in the tower chamber. Then I came down to get away lest  I should be accused of the crime. At the door below I met Frisco. He had his hat  and coat on, and a small bundle in his hand. I said, &lsquo;You have killed him. He  lies dead upstairs.&rsquo; Frisco denied that he was guilty, and referred to my three  shots. I explained, and told him he could call up the whole countryside to hear  what I had done. At the same time I warned him that as I had found the Colonel  dead I would accuse him of the murder. Frisco repeated that he had not killed  him, but said he might have done so later on, Carr had treated him so badly. He  was entitled to the money: he was a relative of Carr&rsquo;s. I saw at once that this  was the cousin, and said so. Frisco did not deny it. He told me he would have  to go away as he might be accused of the murder, and could not afford to remain  and face the matter out. But he warned me that if Stephen took the property he  would find means to get rid of Stephen. I laughed at him: but I was afraid.  Frisco was almost as big a brute as his master and cousin. Then seized with a  sudden panic, he ran out of the house and into the Pine wood. I left also, and  got down to the Carr Arms, where afterwards Stephen came for me. I told him  that I had been there all the time but that he must have missed me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is the truth as regards the events of that night. I found Carr dead, and in  anger I fired those three shots. Who killed the man I do not know. I am  inclined to believe it was Frisco in spite of his protestations of innocence.  But you know how he ran away. He went to London, and from London he wrote to  me. I enclose his letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  next few days and the murder was known. I said nothing. I replaced the revolver  in its case; I persuaded Stephen that I had not been to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; on that  night, and he believed me. Then he became possessed of the property, on certain  conditions. I breathed freely. Carr had not had the time to make a new will,  and my boy was safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far, so good, then came the bolt from the blue. I received the enclosed letter  from Frisco, in which he threatened to write to the police and denounce me. If  he does this I am lost. It will be difficult for me to defend myself. The  evidence against me, if the matter is looked into, will be too strong. But you  can see that for yourself Herrick, so I need not be more explicit. Under these  circumstances and to save Stephen I have made up my mind to die. If the truth  about my visit came to light, even although I were proved guiltless of the  murder, Stephen is quite foolish enough to give up the money. He is a good boy  but weak,&mdash;quixotic. The only way I can save him&mdash;and myself also for that  matter&mdash;is to die.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not afraid; I have had such a wretched life that I do not think things will  be worse in the next world. Besides the chloral, against the abuse of which you  are always warning me, affords me a chance of slipping quietly and painlessly  out of a world that is much too hard for me. If I die, Stephen will be safe,  for Frisco can do nothing. His threats will fall harmless on the dead. The man  is dangerous though. He might try to murder Stephen. I gave you a hint of that  Herrick. But I know you are clever and so long as you are with my boy I do not  fear for him in that way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  as regards the rest. It is possible that Frisco may denounce Stephen as guilty  of murder. Stephen told me he went to &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; that night to see if I had  gone up there. Some one may have seen him. Then I used his revolver. That would  also be evidence against him, and even if I destroyed the weapon that would  still be evidence against him. While I live I dare not tell the whole truth.  Therefore I make this confession and I shall give it to Petronella. She will  deliver it to you when danger threatens Stephen. From the contents of this you  will know how to act, so as to thwart Frisco. Stephen is innocent, and I verily  believe that Frisco is guilty in spite of his denial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can die in peace now, for I know when this confession is in your hands that  Stephen will be safe. I trust to your head and to your heart, Herrick. I am  sure you will not fail me. No doubt you think I am going to extremes in dying.  That may be. But I am sick of this life. Even if I lived I should have nothing  but trouble. Besides my poor Stephen has had quite enough of me. I hope he will  marry Ida and be happy. Were I to live and remain with them I should spoil  their happiness. What would a sour old woman do with two such lovers? Well  Herrick I am about to seal this up and then I shall take a dose of chloral&mdash;an  overdose. Thus my death will appear to be an accident. The world will think so.  I wonder if you will? You also may be deceived. But I think you will be clever  enough to doubt the accident, for you know I am not the woman to be careless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not show this to Stephen unless you are absolutely compelled. I love the boy  and I want him to think the best of the woman who is gone. So no more. Good-bye  to you, my dear Herrick. You have been a good friend to me. Continue to be so  to my boy. And also if you have any religion (which I doubt) pray for the soul  of Bianca Marsh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  here I sign my name for the last time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bianca  Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Herrick finished this extraordinary document, he laid it down with a sigh for  the memory of the wrong-headed impulsive woman who had written it. She had  acted foolishly, but for the best. And since the poor soul had gone to her  account Herrick could not find it in his heart to blame her. After a pause he  took up the typewritten letter.</p>
  <p>It  was typed in purple ink, was without date or address, and even the signature of  Frisco was in print. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you do not make your son do justice to me and to my &lsquo;son, I will write and tell  the police that you murdered Colonel Carr. I must have half the money left by  Carr allowed to me by arrangement. You can answer my letter by an advertisement  in the Daily Telegraph. Then I will write to you and make arrangements. All I  want to know now is whether you will insist upon your son giving the money, or  face the disgrace of being arrested for the murder. I have a witness who can  prove your presence in the house. If necessary I will come forward and give  myself up. I can save myself and condemn you. Choose. I shall look every  morning in the paper.</p>
  <p>Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  read this precious letter over twice. He wondered that it was typed instead of  written, not that he did not see the reason for this, but that he wondered how  a hunted fugitive like Frisco could procure a machine. Then the truth flashed  into his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Robin,&rdquo;  said Herrick rolling up the papers, &ldquo;Frisco met him, went to his chambers, and  disclosed the fact that he was his father. Ha! Between the two of them they  wrote this letter so as to frighten Mrs. Marsh into giving them the money  through her influence over Stephen. Robin typed the letter and sent it. The  little scamp. He did not tell me that. Humph! I shall go again to town and see  him. Then Frisco must be produced from his hiding-place. Robin can and shall do  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was all very well, but still the mystery of Carr&rsquo;s death was unsolved. Mrs.  Marsh was innocent. She declared Frisco to be guilty. On the face of it, he  was. But Herrick had his doubts. The case was getting more difficult at every  fresh discovery. For the first time he mistrusted his own powers of dealing  with the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must consult Stephen and Bess,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, and left the house. In his pocket  was the confession of the late Mrs. Marsh.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    The Unexpected Happens</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next twenty-four hours, Dr. Jim kept his counsel. He said sufficient to set  Stephen&rsquo;s mind at rest about his mother, but did not tell the whole story or  show the confession which he had obtained from Petronella. He wanted to turn  matters over in his own mind before doing this. The fact is Jim was getting a  little weary of the whole affair. Every new piece of evidence that came to  light seemed only to complicate it. He had felt sure that the paper left by  Mrs. Marsh would solve the mystery; but although it told much it did not reveal  all. She declared in a half-hearted sort of way that Frisco was guilty. But she  gave no proofs; the man in that hurried conversation at the door, had denied  the charge, and beyond the fact of his flight there was no evidence against  him. It occurred to Jim that the best thing to do would be to drop the matter  altogether. It seemed useless to follow such a will-o-the-wisp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still  I do not like to do this on my own responsibility,&rdquo; he thought after much  consideration, &ldquo;it will be best for me to lay all the facts before Bess and  Stephen, and go by what they say. If they want to go on with it, well and good.  If not, I shall end it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  this idea, a most sensible one under the circumstances. Herrick called a  council of war. Bess came over from Biffstead, and met Stephen and Jim in the  library by appointment. There Herrick again told the whole story of his  dealings with the matter, and ended up by placing Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s letter and its  enclosure before them. When the Squire and Bess had read the documents, and  were in possession of all the facts connected with the murder of Colonel Carr,  Herrick made a speech to them on that basis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it is foolish going on with this matter. From all  that I can see Frisco is the guilty man. But he has disappeared, and I do not  think it is worth while hunting him down. To hang him for the murder of a  scoundrel like Carr&mdash;I beg your pardon Steve but your late uncle was a  scoundrel&mdash;will be no gratification to any of us. Moreover if he were caught  and tried, this letter might have to be produced. I think it best to stop short  at this point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  Stephen could give his opinion, Bess interrupted him, to dwell, after the  custom of a woman, on a minor point. &ldquo;You foolish boy,&rdquo; she said in reproachful  tones. &ldquo;I see that you took the blame of your mother&rsquo;s doings on yourself. That  was stupid. You might have trusted me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Bess, I could not blacken her memory, even to you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not; but I should have understood. Now that I think of it,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I  wonder that I was so foolish as to believe you. It was entirely opposed to your  nature to fire at a dead man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  winced. &ldquo;Do not say anything more about it Bess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she did that. Let  the matter rest there. And now about continuing the search. I agree with  Jim;&mdash;it is best to do nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that,&rdquo; replied Bess obstinately, &ldquo;you see Santiago may still  try and get the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Jim positively, &ldquo;I do not think so. He has been found out. His conspiracy  is at an end. He knows that any further move on his part will meet with  failure. Believe me, he will return to Mexico, and give up fighting. The wisest  thing he can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Joyce?&rdquo; asked Marsh-Carr.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is worse than useless. Take away Don  Manuel, and Joyce is lost. He has neither the pluck nor the intelligence to  carry through a plot on his own account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  his father Frisco may use him as an instrument.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  has to clear himself first. Joyce knows if he does anything with his father  that I can have him arrested. Rather than that should happen I believe he  would give up Frisco to justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  shuddered. &ldquo;His own father!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  as to that, you can hardly blame Joyce if he does not feel particularly filial.  His father has done nothing for him. Besides Joyce senior deserted his wife,  and Robin was devote to his mother. It is one of the best traits in his  otherwise poor character. No, Bess, I think if Robin came to chose between his  own skin and that of Frisco, his father would be the one to suffer. Robin  believes in everyone for himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is a wicked little wretch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is and he is not. Weak rather than wicked. His scheme to mix you up in the  murder by means of that pistol was invented by the Mexican. Joyce only did as  he was told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  in that case,&rdquo; said Stephen looking up, &ldquo;I do not see what Santiago had to  gain. Robin wanted Bess to marry him. He wanted to inveigle her into the case  so that she might not refuse out of fear. But what would that matter to  Santiago. Her marriage with Joyce would not have helped on his schemes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough,&rdquo; said Herrick musingly, &ldquo;but I daresay it was Frisco who suggested the  marriage. He wanted to get the money through his son, and perhaps thought he  would get more if he put off Robin with Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Endicotte reddened. &ldquo;Thank you for nothing Jim,&rdquo; she said indignantly, &ldquo;I was  evidently to be a pawn in the game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems to me that we have all been pawns,&rdquo; said Jim grimly, &ldquo;just consider the  mistakes that have been made while we have been searching for the true assassin  of Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  laughed. &ldquo;First of all I was suspected,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no; that was only a half-hearted attempt on the part of Frisco and his precious  son. There was no real evidence to implicate you Bess. I think&mdash;speaking for  myself&mdash;that I first suspected Robin Joyce. It was your remark about his income  Stephen, that aroused my suspicions. Well the chain runs as follows,&rdquo; and  Herrick ticked off on his fingers, &ldquo;Joyce first on the authority&mdash;mainly&mdash;of  the pistol. He said he got it from the Don so I suspected Manuel. He proved his  innocence, and accused Pentland Corn. I saw him and he told me he had picked up  the pistol on the lawn of this house. It was his belief that Mrs. Marsh was  guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  myself?&rdquo; said Stephen with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you were like Bess and came into the matter on your own account. I never  believed you had anything to do with the affair. But your step-mother is the  last whom I believed might have something to do with it. Certainly she had; but  from her letter we know she didn&rsquo;t kill the man. And here we come to a dead  stop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Frisco?&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe he is the guilty person,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim positively, &ldquo;are you going to  defend him, Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl looked troubled. &ldquo;I admit that matters look black against him,&rdquo; she said  slowly. &ldquo;He threatened the Colonel; he was alone in the house with him, and  Mrs. Marsh found him ready to fly. On the other hand there is something to be  said in his favour. Evidently he should have had a share in this treasure. For  some reason the Colonel would not give it to him during his life, and only  afforded him a chance of getting it after Stephen&rsquo;s death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  even then,&rdquo; interrupted Herrick &ldquo;for if Stephen had fulfilled the conditions of  the will, the fortune would become his absolutely and he would be able to will  it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;unless Frisco knew of this unjust will&mdash;for  that it is, if he helped to get the treasure&mdash;and murdered the Colonel out of  revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe he did,&rdquo; said Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  put in Dr. Jim briskly, &ldquo;I do not agree with you. It is my opinion that what  Mrs. Marsh said to me before she died was the right view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  and the Colonel fought a duel. I believe that Frisco came back from the inn  drunk and filled with fur against the Colonel. It might have been, that through  the visit to Mrs. Marsh in the afternoon he had found out all about the will.  The Colonel probably defied him, and then Frisco would suggest a duel. He fired  first and the Colonel fell with his still loaded weapon in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is all theory,&rdquo; said Bess still defending the ex-sailor, &ldquo;but you seem to  forget Jim that the death shot was fired with that clumsy pistol. If there had  been a duel Frisco would have had at least as good a weapon as the Colonel.  There are plenty of revolvers of the new pattern in the gun-room. I am sure  Frisco would not have placed himself at such a disadvantage. And again the  silver bullet. Why should Frisco have used that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim rubbed his head with a vexed air. &ldquo;I am afraid you are right Bess,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;a duel is out of the question. I can&rsquo;t see anything ahead. So far as I  am concerned, I give up trying to solve the riddle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr, &ldquo;I know now that my poor mother did not kill the man,  so that is all I care about. Let the matter rest Herrick. You can send Santiago  to Mexico I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but I think he will want some money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give  him what he wants and let him go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that will be best, and as for Joyce I&rsquo;ll see that he keeps quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  struck in. &ldquo;What about Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must look after himself,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;innocent or guilty we can do nothing  with him so long as he remains in hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you can find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Through  Joyce. Yes, I can. But on the whole I prefer to let sleeping dogs lie. No,  Bess. The whole thing is ended. Now come the peaceful times. It is necessary to  cultivate our garden, as says Voltaire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  laughed. &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for my part I intend to put the whole  matter out of my head and arrange with Ida as to the date of our marriage. As  my poor mother has died so lately, we can have a quiet wedding; but married I  shall be and as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Bess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the first place I want Ida to be my wife because I love her dearly, and in the  second I want to marry her and make my will after the marriage in her favour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t you make it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would not be legal. Marriage invalidates a will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  who had been thinking, looked up with bright eyes. &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are  afraid of Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am. He may try and murder me to get the money, so by marrying Ida and leaving  it to her, I shall put the matter out of his power. Once he gets to know that  the money has gone from him for ever, he may leave me alone. He tried through  Santiago to kill me once, and failed. He may not fail the second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is something in that,&rdquo; said Herrick, and then the council of war&mdash;as Bess  called it&mdash;broke up. The final decision of the three was to let the case stand  where it was. They washed their hands of the whole affair.</p>
  <p>For  the next fortnight there was absolute peace. Stephen and Ida arranged to be  married in two months, and Dr. Jim began to talk of his future with Bess. Jim  did not want to live with Stephen after the marriage, and yet he could not  leave him, without forfeiting his income. Of course Stephen insisted that  Herrick should take a certain sum a year, until he got on his feet, but Jim  would not consent to this. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take money I do not work for,&rdquo; he said  decisively, &ldquo;if you will lend me a small sum, I&rsquo;ll go back to London and start  a practice in a new place. I expect it will be a long time before I am able to  marry Bess. But she will wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  expressed herself favourably on this point. She would wait for Jim till her  hair grew gray, and meantime she could manage Biffstead for Frank, after Ida  was settled at &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo; Neither Stephen nor Ida could do anything with this  obstinate couple, and they gave up the attempt in despair. &ldquo;But I think it is  an infernal shame your leaving me in the lurch,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;remember what  my mother said!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I intend to see you through the year, in case Frisco should attempt to stop  your visits to the vault,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;But after that I must go and carve out  my own fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  who knows what may happen by then,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr. He was determined in some  way to benefit Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to force the money on the fellow he grumbled to  Ida.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess  is just as obstinate,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;however they will be with us for some  months yet. Wait and see, Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  meanwhile was priding himself that all was at an end. He wrote to Joyce stating  that he intended to do nothing, and also let Santiago know his decision. From  neither did he receive an answer. But this he did not mind. &ldquo;They are powerless  to do harm,&rdquo; he said to Bess.</p>
  <p>And  indeed he never expected to hear of the pair again. But one morning Bess came  to him with the Daily Telegraph and pointed out in silence a cipher message in  the agony column. It was worded similarly to that put in before, and asked  Frisco to meet the inserter at Hyde Park Corner at three o&rsquo;clock in two days. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Jim meditatively, &ldquo;Robin wants to see his father again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will you do Jim?&rdquo; asked Bess anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Robin meets his father they will plot against Stephen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  can&rsquo;t do anything but physical harm, and I am always with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Bess was not to be put off in this way. &ldquo;I really think you should write to Mr.  Joyce about it Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will not answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not. But he will see that you have your eye on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True  enough. I&rsquo;ll see to it, Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  fully intended to do so, but foolishly put off the matter for a few hours. He  wrote to Joyce only on the day before the appointed meeting, an on the next day  received a telegram, to the effect that it was not Joyce who had inserted the  cipher nor, so said the wire, had Don Manuel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the devil does this mean?&rdquo; said Jim to himself. &ldquo;Is it a lie, or a truth? If a  lie, Manuel and Joyce are plotting. If true, someone else is taking a hand in  the game. I&rsquo;ll see Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  advice of Bess was that Jim should go up to Town without delay. &ldquo;I am sure  there is some mischief brewing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you had better go up by this  afternoon&rsquo;s train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Jim after a pause, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Steve first. He must know all about this  before I go. In fact I think I&rsquo;ll take him with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he has gone away for the day,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;you know he went out cycling with  Ida. He won&rsquo;t be back all day. You have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  wait until he comes back,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I tell you what Bess; this may be a  scheme to get me away from Stephen, in order that they may try and hurt him  during my absence. After that assault of Manuel&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m never easy in my mind  away from the boy. I can&rsquo;t leave him here. If I go up to Town he must come with  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  was struck by this view of the matter. There might be something in it, she  thought. The consequence was that Herrick waited the return of Stephen and  arranged to go up to town with him the next morning. All the same Stephen  laughed at Dr. Jim. &ldquo;You are a a perfect old woman about me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can  look after myself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure you can deal with honourable foes,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;but here there is every  probability you may be struck in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Very well Jim. You know best. We can go to town by the  mid-day express, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  before they left &ldquo;The Pines,&rdquo; they received a surprise. In the Times newspaper  which usually arrived shortly after eleven, Stephen found some news which  surprised him. He went at once in search of Dr. Jim and found him buttoning his  gloves on the door-step waiting for the cart to come round. &ldquo;What do you think  of that Herrick?&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  devil!&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, and well he might. There was a paragraph in the paper to  the effect that the man called Frisco who was wanted for the murder of Colonel  Carr of Saxham, had been captured on the preceding day. No further details were  given, but what Herrick read was quite sufficient. He dropped the paper and  stared at Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  we need go up to Town now?&rdquo; asked the Squire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  We must catch this train. Here comes the cart; I shall go and see Joyce at his  flat. He may know what this means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Bess?&rdquo; asked Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have no time to talk over the matter with her now. She will see the news in the  &lsquo;Telegraph.&rsquo; We can send her a wire from Beorminster station, not to worry  herself. Jump in Steve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  a few minutes they were driving hard for the cathedral city. At the station  Herrick sent the proposed wire to Biffstead, and they caught the express. &ldquo;We  shall be in town for a few days over this,&rdquo; said Herrick when they were  comfortably settled, &ldquo;I think I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  what?&rdquo; asked Marsh-Carr. &ldquo;What it means. This is the revenge of that blackguard  Santiago for losing the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think he put in the cipher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure he did, and gave information to the police meantime. No doubt when  Frisco arrived at the rendezvous thinking to meet his son he was arrested by  officers in plain clothes. I have not much sympathy for Frisco, who, I fear, is  a bad lot. All the same it is hard that he should be tripped up in his stride  by that brute of a Greaser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might be so. I wonder if Don Manuel has stayed to see the matter out. It is the  kind of thing he would like to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am sure of that Steve. All the same he wants to look after his own skin. When  Frisco is tried, he will tell all he knows about the Mexican&rsquo;s doings out of  revenge. Santiago can&rsquo;t face an inquiry as you know. His assault on you, is  enough to get him into serious trouble. No, my friend; Don Manuel has done his  mischief and cleared out. By this time he is on his way to the new world.  Beast!&rdquo; muttered Herrick between his teeth, &ldquo;I should like to make it hot for  him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  arriving in Town Herrick sent Stephen with the luggage to the hotel in Jermyn  Street and himself drove off to West Kensington. He learned from the porter  that Joyce was in, and ran upstairs. In a few minutes he was seated in the  little man&rsquo;s drawing-room listening to his reproaches.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not think you would sell me like this Herrick!&rdquo; said Robin wringing his  hands in his usual womanish way, &ldquo;whatever I may have done to you, you should have  kept faith with me. You always pretended to be so superior.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  Did I?&rdquo; said Herrick calmly but a trifle bewildered at these accusations. &ldquo;And  now perhaps you will tell me what I have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know well enough. You put that cipher in the paper and betrayed my unfortunate  father. I did not think it of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was arrested at Hyde Park Corner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  At three o&rsquo;clock yesterday. Of course he thought that I put the cipher in and  came to meet me. But why do I tell you all this. You are perfectly well aware  of the success of your treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his shoulders. At the present moment he did not think it necessary to  correct the man. &ldquo;How about your friend Santiago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish he was here to punish you!&rdquo; cried Joyce venomously, &ldquo;he was quite as  clever as you Herrick. But you waited till he sailed, before plotting to  capture my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the Don has sailed? When did he go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  days since,&rdquo; replied Robin dropping into a chair, &ldquo;as if you didn&rsquo;t know! Why  do you come here to exult over me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I wish to tell you that you are wrong in thinking I put that cipher in the  paper. As I wrote to you from Saxham I decided to let the matter rest. Whether  your father was guilty or innocent I did not care so long as you and he left  Marsh alone. The man who put that into the paper was Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;As you please; but it is true for all that. I know the  cipher, but I give you my word I did not insert it. You knew the cipher, and I  am sure you did not use it to betray your father. The only other person who  knew it was the Don, and he has left this last sting behind him out of revenge  for losing the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  shook his head. &ldquo;I might believe that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I did not know it was you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I tell you it was not!&rdquo; cried Jim impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was. It was. Those private detectives who worked for you told me all about it.  You told them to have my father arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Belcher  and Kidd!&rdquo; cried Herrick jumping up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  you know the name. Yes. They gave notice to the police and had my poor father  taken. I guessed it was their work and through you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim stood for a moment in a brown study. He saw well enough what had occurred.  The ferret had made use of Santiago to find out the business, and knowing of the  reward had made use of the information extorted from Santiago. &ldquo;I expect they  let him leave England on condition that he told them the business and helped  them to trap Frisco by means of the cipher. The scoundrels!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Robin &ldquo;what are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to see Belcher and Kidd,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;and I tell you Robin that  your friend Santiago has done all this. I have had no hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should Santiago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better ask your father that,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I suspect he has no cause to  love that Mexican! You can believe me or not Robin. But the truth is the truth.  I have not played you false.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Robin  shook his head. He still doubted. Dr. Jim tried no longer to convince him, but  left the flat to have it out with the treacherous firm he had employed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    The Story Of Frisco</b></h2>
  <p>It  was not until Herrick was well on his way back to the centre of the Town, that  he remembered his omission to ask Robin about the typewritten letter. But after  all, it did not matter. He knew perfectly well that Joyce had typed it at his  father&rsquo;s dictation, and the denial or admission of the little man would make no  difference. Things had got past that point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see Belcher and Kidd,&rdquo; said Herrick to himself, &ldquo;and learn exactly how  Santiago managed the business. Then I&rsquo;ll give Frith a look in. I must find some  way of speaking to Frisco. Now that he is driven into a corner, he may tell the  truth&mdash;that is, if it is not likely to hang him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  he arrived at the Strand office of the private inquiry firm, he was received by  Kidd. Belcher, it appeared, had gone out for the day on business. Kidd was a  heavy man with a red face, and a pair of leering grey eyes. Dr. Jim could put  up with the ferret but Kidd he detested. However, as Kidd was the only representative  of the firm present, he tackled him, and with no light hand, for Jim was in a  royal rage at the way he had been tricked by this cunning pair of rascals.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this I hear about the arrest of the man Frisco?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  this doctor,&rdquo; replied Kidd in his heavy voice but civilly enough &ldquo;Don Manuel  Santiago gave Belcher the tip how Frisco could be trapped, and as me and him  wanted to earn the reward, we fixed the matter up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against  my wish,&rdquo; retorted Dr. Jim, &ldquo;did I not say, that you were not to meddle in the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  why shouldn&rsquo;t we get the reward if we could sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had my own reasons that Frisco should be left at large. You have spoilt a plan  of mine, and likely as not have caught the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to that sir,&rdquo; said Kidd doggedly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But right or wrong we&rsquo;ve  caught the man and claim the reward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is offered by Mr. Stephen Marsh-Carr,&rdquo; said Herrick coolly, &ldquo;and the matter is  in my hands. It is just as likely as not that I may stop Mr. Marsh-Carr from  paying you one penny. You had better have done my business properly Kidd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  did do it properly,&rdquo; said Kidd in a surly tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. It was my wish that the Mexican should be watched. You have let  him leave the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; protested Kidd, who would have been insolent but that he was afraid of  losing the reward, &ldquo;that was Belcher&rsquo;s game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Belcher&rsquo;s  price for receiving instructions how to trap Frisco,&rdquo; scoffed Herrick. &ldquo;Do you  think I don&rsquo;t know that Santiago taught the cipher to your damned partner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might be civil Dr. Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall be what I please. You were engaged by me to do certain business, and you  have done it badly. Had I wanted Frisco caught I should have told you. Now just  you let me know, how it all came about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the reward sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see to that. You fools&mdash;to go against me like this. I can do your business  considerable damage by telling the way you have tricked me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir! you won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; growled Kidd now thoroughly frightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  all depends upon how you conduct yourself. The harm is done, but I must know  how Santiago managed the business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was this way sir,&rdquo; replied the cowed Kidd. &ldquo;Belcher watched the foreign cove  sir, and kept out of sight. But the Don knew him from going to the gambling  club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that&rsquo;s another matter I can spoil for you Kidd. I know too much of your shady  business for you to play the fool with me. Go on man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  took Kidd all he knew, to keep his temper under this speech. But he knew that  Dr. Herrick would do what he had threatened if he was not implicitly obeyed.  Had Jim been a smaller man, Kidd might have tried conclusion with his fists;  but he knew Herrick too well to attempt such folly. Once upon a time Kidd had  seen the doctor thrash a larger and much heavier man. From that day, he  resolved never to have a fight with a man so versed in the noble art as this  high-tempered gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  sir,&rdquo; he continued in a sulky growl, &ldquo;it was this way. Santiago spotted  Belcher, and asked him what he was up to. Belcher would not tell, but in the  end, the Don got the truth out of him. Then he said that if Belcher and me  could catch Frisco we could get a bigger sum of money, than by watching him.  Belcher was always anxious to know what was at the back of all this. When he  heard it was the Carr murder case, he saw it was a big thing for him and me. So  he said he would let the Don go, if he helped him to catch Frisco. Then the Don  showed us the cipher&mdash;he wrote it out himself, and put it in the newspaper.  Frisco came to the place, and me and Belcher had a detective and a warrant. We  caught him easy. He is now in quod sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Santiago is on the high seas on his way to Mexico. You are a precious pair of  scoundrels Kidd. Why did you tell Mr. Joyce that I had managed all this  business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the Don as asked us to do that sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  make trouble I suppose,&rdquo; said Herrick rising, &ldquo;you send Belcher to see me at  the Guelph hotel this evening. I have something to say to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  care sir. The ferret ain&rsquo;t an easy man to tackle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  paused at the door and looked the big man up and down. &ldquo;Confound your  insolence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you think you or that rat can stand up against me. I  can ruin you both if I choose, and stop your getting that reward. As for  Belcher, if he is impudent I&rsquo;ll wring his neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry we did it sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may well be,&rdquo; was Herrick&rsquo;s grim reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I ain&rsquo;t going to be bullied by anyone,&rdquo; said Kidd with sudden anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is quite enough my man,&rdquo; replied Dr. Jim opening the door and speaking quietly,  &ldquo;if you try that game, you&rsquo;ll get the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kidd  looked dangerous for a moment, but after a glance into the eyes of his proposed  antagonist he cooled down considerably. He knew perfectly well, that Herrick  could smash him. Moreover the calm courage of Herrick quelled his brute  passion. Dr. Jim waited for a time, then departed leaving Kidd growling and  cursing in impotent rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dangerous ruffian,&rdquo; thought Herrick as he went into the Strand, &ldquo;but I think he  and Belcher know me too well to play the fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the moment he intended to go back to the Guelph Hotel and see Stephen; but on  reflection drove to the solicitors. It was necessary that he should interview  Frisco, and Frith would be the man most likely to obtain for him the permission  to do so. The lawyer was in, and expressed his pleasure at the capture of  Colonel Carr&rsquo;s assassin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  to that, I am not certain,&rdquo; said Herrick lightly, &ldquo;I want to hear what he has  to say Frith, and you must get me permission to see the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think he killed Carr?&rdquo; asked Frith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the face of it, I do,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;all the same there have been so many  surprises in this case that I am prepared for more. Besides, I am rather mad  over the business,&rdquo; and he told Frith how he had been tricked by Belcher and  his partner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couple  of scoundrels,&rdquo; said Frith nodding, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the first dirty trick they have  played. Don&rsquo;t you engage them again Dr. Herrick. I&rsquo;ll find men who are more to  be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope to heaven that I won&rsquo;t have occasion to employ any more private detectives.  I tell you what Frith, ever since I have engaged in this affair I feel as  though I had been bathing in dirty water. But that I promised Mrs. Marsh to  protect her son, I should not have done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have gone pretty exhaustively into the business,&rdquo; said Frith after he  had heard the whole story, &ldquo;for an amateur you have managed remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed, &ldquo;I have made mistakes I admit. But then, as you say, I am only an  amateur and not the detective of fiction. He never makes mistakes. I wish he  had had this case to deal with. However the thing is nearly at an end, thank  goodness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will end with the hanging of Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  knows. He may have some other story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may be sure he will swear that he is innocent,&rdquo; said Frith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo;  responded Herrick, &ldquo;and the queer thing is Frith that he may really be  innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  looks to me, from what you have told me, as though he were guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  as to that, I&rsquo;ve thought several people guilty and have always found out that I  am wrong, when they came to explain. However, I want to see this man and hear  what he has to say. Can you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  see what I can do. You are at the Guelph Hotel ain&rsquo;t you? Very good. I&rsquo;ll see  to it. I might come along and call on Marsh-Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should, if I were you,&rdquo; replied Dr. Jim with a laugh, &ldquo;always be attentive to  your clients Frith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving  the solicitor to arrange matters, Herrick went back to the Hotel and dinner  with Stephen. He told him all that he had done, and the Squire was much interested.  &ldquo;I hope it is coming to an end though,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have had about enough of  this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think  of me,&rdquo; said Jim with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you have behaved like a brick Jim. I do not know how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh  my dear chap. There is no question of thanks between you and myself. I promised  your mother to see you through, and I intend to keep my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you won&rsquo;t let me make things right for you,&rdquo; grumbled Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  till everything is squared up, then we will see. I may ask you to be my banker  after all. Well Steve, Santiago has gone away, so you are relieved of at least  one of your enemies. Joyce can do nothing without his father, and that  gentleman is in gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you want me to go with you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  prefer to see him alone. I&rsquo;ll get more out of him in that way. I wonder what I&rsquo;ll  hear this time. However let us think no more of the matter just now. We might  take a turn down to see the Earl&rsquo;s Court Exhibition. There&rsquo;s always something  going on there. It&rsquo;s not exactly like a theatre Steve or I should not ask you  to go. But you must be cheered up somehow. We can&rsquo;t stay in this dismal hotel  all the evening talking about a criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  assented, as he always did to whatever Herrick proposed. They went to the  exhibition and spent a pleasant evening. When they returned Dr. Jim retired  straightway to bed, &ldquo;I shall have a lot of talking to do to-morrow so I must  get as much rest as I possibly can,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>In  some mysterious way, Frith obtained the required permission, and Herrick found  himself introduced into a small cell, where Frisco sat on his bed in a gloomy  frame of mind. After exchanging a few words with the warder, Frith got the man  to go away leaving Herrick and Frisco alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you are Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; remarked Frisco calmly, &ldquo;I am glad to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  spoke in a rather refined voice, and did not at all look like the truculent  ruffian Herrick had expected to meet. He was no longer fat, but had quite a  shapely figure. Also his face had lost the redness of incessant drinking. Misfortune  had sobered and improved the man. He was plainly dressed in a suit of black  serge, which as he afterwards informed Herrick had been supplied by his son.  But even if he had been still more changed Dr. Jim would have recognised him  from the cries-cross scar on his forehead. Frisco saw him looking at it, and  smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Colonel&rsquo;s handiwork,&rdquo; said he quietly. &ldquo;He marked me with a bowie in Los  Angelos one drunken evening. But I gave him as good as he gave me Dr. Herrick.  He lost a finger.&rdquo; And Frisco fell to whistling at the pleasing recollection.  There was no doubt about the man being a scoundrel. Herrick felt his way  carefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know me?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>Frisco  smiled, &ldquo;I heard the man who came with you, call you by your name. As for the  rest, of course Robin has told me all about you. You are a clever man Dr.  Herrick, and I think a kind one. If you had not been, you would not have  burdened yourself with that miserable rat I have the misfortune to call my son.  All the same,&rdquo; added Frisco with a scowl. &ldquo;You trapped me in rather a shabby  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  That is one reason why I came to see you,&rdquo; said Herrick coolly, &ldquo;I did not trap  you at all. No one was more surprised than I at the news of your arrest. It was  Santiago who put that cipher in the paper and told the police about you. And  Santiago is beyond your reach on the high seas. So you see that I am not so  mean, as you thought me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  it,&rdquo; said Frisco, &ldquo;you always fought fair and I could not understand your  playing low down like this. So it was the greaser was it? By Heaven! when I  catch him&mdash;&rdquo; Frisco doubled his arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time he was out of the world,&rdquo; said  Frisco, &ldquo;a beating&rsquo;s too easy. I&rsquo;ll go west for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean you&rsquo;ll go west?&rdquo; asked Herrick thinking of the man&rsquo;s position which  was&mdash;apparently&mdash;considerably within the shadow of the gallows.</p>
  <p>Frisco  looked at him with a careless laugh. He understood, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been in worse  holes than this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why once in California the rope was round my neck  for horse-stealing. Carr got me out of that mess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were a great friend of Carr&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  said the man slowly, &ldquo;he was my cousin you know, and we had the same blood in  us&mdash;the bad Carr blood. How I ever came to have such a brat of a Methodist  parson for a son I can&rsquo;t make out. Got it from his mother I suppose, she was  always a whimpering devil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t come here to discuss your son and wife Joyce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco&rsquo;s  my name for the time being,&rdquo; said the man coolly, &ldquo;when I get across the pond  again I&rsquo;ll take to a more Christian one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  You won&rsquo;t have an easy time getting out of this scrape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  no, you&rsquo;re about right there Herrick. You don&rsquo;t mind me dropping the Mister I  hope. I feel friendly to you. You&rsquo;re about the only man of the whole lot.  Stephen isn&rsquo;t a bad chap; but if he hadn&rsquo;t had you beside him, I&rsquo;d have got  that money. Well I&rsquo;m to be tried for my life. What are you going to do Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  quixotic,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;Robin has no money, neither have you, so I am  going to supply you with a solicitor and see you through. If you are guilty I  wish to see you hanged, if innocent free. All the same,&rdquo; said Herrick frankly, &ldquo;I  tell you candidly Frisco, that I don&rsquo;t think it fair to hang you for the  killing of a brute like Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  stared at Dr. Jim in a hard unwinking manner, but he was visibly moved. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a white man Doc,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m a bad lot. All the same if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&rdquo;  he held out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  take that only on one condition,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;that you tell me you are  innocent of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  drew back his hand, and recovered his hard manner. &ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that  is where Carr had the pull over me. There are two Towns in South America I  daren&rsquo;t go near&mdash;&rdquo; he burst out laughing. &ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t shake hands,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;well  I don&rsquo;t blame you. I am a bad lot&mdash;but Carr was a damned sight worse sonny. You  can take that from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are wasting time I think,&rdquo; said Herrick coldly, &ldquo;I want to help you if I can.  You shall have a lawyer, to defend you. But I want to ask you as man to  man:&mdash;Did you shoot Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  thought for a moment stroking his chin. &ldquo;Well there&rsquo;s not many men I&rsquo;d tell my  mind to but you are one. I did not kill Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you in a few minutes. But you let me reel out my yarn first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know  most of it from Robin and Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know all,&rdquo; replied Frisco quietly &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Carr these twenty years  and more. He was a devil and treated me like a dog. I helped him to get that  treasure and he cheated me of my share of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t think you were the man to be cheated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in an ordinary way, you bet. But the Colonel had the bulge on me I guess. He  could have handed me over to the authorities in San Francisco for a murder. Oh!  don&rsquo;t look scared Herrick. I&rsquo;m not going to own up to all my crimes. I have  committed heaps though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  damn your beastly talk,&rdquo; said Herrick angrily, for the shamelessness of the man  made him sick, &ldquo;just tell me about that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  in good time sonny,&rdquo; said the unmoved Frisco, &ldquo;I stayed with the Colonel and  let him keep my money because I did not want my wife to know I was alive. She  was a good woman and I treated her like a brute. That was one reason. The  second was because of my own skin. I did not want to be hanged, and Carr could  have hanged me any day. The third reason,&rdquo; and here Frisco looked curiously at  Herrick, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll hardly believe the third reason. But it was a kind of  tenderness for Carr. Somehow, devil as he was, I liked him. Never met a man I  cottoned to more. He saved my life, I saved his, we fought with knives and with  fists, and played the devil with one another all round. Yet somehow we stuck  together, and never went back on one another. Rum thing wasn&rsquo;t it Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honour  amongst thieves,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; retorted  Frisco. &ldquo;So you can see Herrick that I was not the sort of man to put Carr out  of the way. I got drunk, so did he but we held together in that blamed house  always waiting for death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  The Indians, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santiago  told you that I guess,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Yes, there was some half Spanish half  Indian greasers in Lima that would have followed us to the end of the world had  they spotted our whereabouts. Santiago was one, but he wished for the money on  his own hook and didn&rsquo;t split. Well Carr is dead so he is safe enough, but if I&rsquo;m  not hanged I guess Santiago will let out on me. Then I&rsquo;ll have a time getting  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it on account of this fear that Carr built the tower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it. Queer chap Carr, a mixture of bravado and fear. He  threw down all the fences and walls and left the doors of the house open every  night just to show he was not afraid. All the same he never slept but in that  tower. I didn&rsquo;t. If any of the greasers had come, they&rsquo;d have knifed me easy enough.  Well Carr went under before his time but by the hand he least expected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was it?&rdquo; asked Herrick impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  drawled the ruffian &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Marsh. We had a talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all about that. I also saw the letter you wrote her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you did. She kept that as an ace. Robin typed it on his blamed machine for me.  I wanted to get the money quietly, but the old lady went under in time and  spoilt my game there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  killed herself,&rdquo; said Herrick curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she now,&rdquo; said Frisco in admiration, &ldquo;she was a screamer of a woman&mdash;not like  my wife. Killed herself. Lord,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a story isn&rsquo;t it. Well I guess it was this way. I let Carr keep the money,  when he was alive on the understanding that it was all left to me. He made a  will in my favour, and then, the devil made a later one giving the money to  Stephen with a reversion to me if his bones weren&rsquo;t looked after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said Herrick coolly, &ldquo;and you tried to have Stephen disabled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  you are; and the blamed Santiago bungled the affair. If I had been on the  spot&mdash;well that&rsquo;s all done with. About the will. Mrs. Marsh came and kicked up  a row about the will in favour of her son saying the Colonel was going to alter  it. She picked up something of that from me when I had a cargo aboard. But I  never knew till after she came, how Carr was tricking me. When she went&mdash;and  she did curse him&mdash;I had a row with Carr. He told me the kind of will he&rsquo;d  made. We had almost a stand up fight. He brought in the murder business about  me as usual, and I knuckled under as usual. Then I went off to drink rum at the  Carr Arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and to threaten the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  that wasn&rsquo;t on my own account. All I meant was that if I gave the tip to the  Lima greasers, Carr would be knifed. That fool Napper thought I meant to do the  job myself. Well sir I came back and lay down to sleep off the rum. Carr got  his own dinner, and then dressed himself up as he always did. Blamed  foolishness I always called it. Cooking your dinner and then wearing a starched  shirt to eat it. Pah!&rdquo; Frisco spat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wanted to keep his self-respect I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had no occasion for an article of that sort Herrick. Self-respect and  Carr!&mdash;well I should smile. However, I was asleep. When I was pulling round  sober, and thinking of getting up to eat, I heard a shot. Oh! I am too used to  the sound of shooting not to know it when I hear it. I wondered if Carr was in  the shooting gallery. After a time&mdash;twenty minutes maybe I got up and went into  the gallery. No one there. I went up to the tower after visiting the  dining-room. I found the Colonel dead. I was in a fright I can tell you. In a  flash I saw that my neck was in the rope. I had threatened the Colonel and they&rsquo;d  think I&rsquo;d killed him. Also I was wanted in Frisco and South America and half a  hundred places. My name would come out may-be (but I am not afraid of that now  Herrick) and I would be turned off as sure as a gun. I went downstairs and  drank some wine. In the house&mdash;and coming down from a room under the one in  which Carr lay shot&mdash;I saw someone. As he came down the tower steps, it is my  opinion he shot the Colonel. If it wasn&rsquo;t him I don&rsquo;t know who could have done  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who was it you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!  don&rsquo;t jump Herrick. It was Sidney Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  stared. &ldquo;That lad never killed the Colonel,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  who did?&rdquo; asked Frisco impatiently, &ldquo;that boy just hated Carr. I never could  make out why, and he was half-witted besides. Then there was the pistol I read  about in the papers. It is just the kind of weapon a boy of that sort might  pick up cheap in a shop of sorts. A man like me would have used a Derringer.  No, I&rsquo;m sure that boy shot him. He came right upon me, as cool as you like and  says, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s quite dead.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  swear he did, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite dead,&rdquo; says Sidney, &ldquo;then before I could get my  breath he went out into the night, and I lost him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you not follow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to think of my own safety. It was no use my accusing a boy and a half idiot  you see. No one would believe he&rsquo;d killed Carr when I was in the house&mdash;and  with my blamed past. I just went to the back to make up a bundle and clear out.  While I was packing I heard three shots, and jumped for the door. Lord I was in  a fright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was Mrs. Marsh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  She came down looking like a tigress, and said I&rsquo;d killed Carr. I was at the  door with my bundle. I denied it, and said I&rsquo;d make it hot for her. She said I&rsquo;d  better look after myself and cleared. I didn&rsquo;t wait you may be sure, for in  spite of her firing the shots I didn&rsquo;t know but what she&rsquo;d rouse the village.  So I went straight across the moor and caught the train at Southberry. Here I&rsquo;ve  been hidden in London ever since. I had money. When that ran out I dropped  across that cipher in the paper, and met my fool of a son. Then&mdash;well you know  the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a strange story,&rdquo; said Herrick much distressed. It did not seem at all  unlikely, but that Sidney had killed the Colonel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a true one. Well, what are you going to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall see this boy, and find out if what you say is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  I expect he&rsquo;s such an idiot that he&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s done something fine and own  up. But that my neck is in danger, I would not split on Sidney. But they&rsquo;ll  only shut him up in an asylum. They would hang me, so of two evils I choose the  least. Are you off Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ll see if this is true, and get you a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  old man. You&rsquo;re a good sort. So-long,&rdquo; and Frisco quite calm waved his hand as  Dr. Jim left the cell. He did not seem to be in the least afraid, and evidently  thought his release was a foregone conclusion. A dangerous cool-headed ruffian  was Frisco.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    Sidney Speaks Out</b></h2>
  <p>After  that interview with Frisco, Dr. Jim took Stephen straight off to Saxham. There  was nothing left for him to do in Town. Frisco was in prison and safe enough.  Joyce shut himself up in his flat, and would not even reply to the note Herrick  wrote him. Belcher&mdash;for obvious reasons had not called at the Guelph  Hotel,&mdash;and with his partner was keeping out of the doctor&rsquo;s way. Jim saw Frith  for a brief few minutes, instructed him to see after the defence of Frisco, and  then drove to Paddington where Marsh-Carr awaited him. By favour of the guard  and five shillings they secured a smoking carriage to themselves. When the  train was fairly out of the town, and whizzed through a desolate winter  country, Dr. Herrick looked at Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of it all?&rdquo; he asked lighting his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  story of Frisco&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It&rsquo;s a living truth. I can see by your face that you wish to believe the man a  liar. He is, but not in this instance. What he says is absolutely true. I saw  his eyes when he spoke. The tongue may lie, but a man&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&rdquo; Jim shook his  head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; cried Stephen looking white and worried, &ldquo;good heaven&rsquo;s Jim,  if Sidney really shot Carr, think of the disgrace to Ida and Bess. Ourselves! I  don&rsquo;t mind that. But these poor girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Jim after a pause, &ldquo;you see it&rsquo;s not so bad as it might be. I am sure you  must know of the estimation Sidney is held in, round about Saxham. If it comes  out that he shot the Colonel, no one will express any surprise. It&rsquo;s no slur on  the girls, Steve. Sidney is looked upon as something beyond the pale of  humanity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  will they do with him?&rdquo; asked Stephen anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he really did commit the crime, he will be placed in an asylum. The boy is too  queer to be judged by ordinary standards. Frisco cleared out although he knew  Sidney had killed Carr, because he thought no one would believe the boy had  done it. The suspicion certainly would have rested on Frisco. He would have  been wiser to have given himself up. But for the reasons I told you of&mdash;the  same reasons that kept him quiet under the Colonel&rsquo;s unjust appropriation of  his property&mdash;Frisco preferred to cut. He is wiser, now that he has had time  to reflect over the matter. His devilries in the Americas were done under other  names, and as Joyce he will not be wanted in San Francisco. I daresay if he had  not been caught he would have given himself up in the long run. It was the Don  he was afraid of. Now the Don is away, Frisco is convinced he will be set free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must stand his trial?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I have told Frith to see after him. But his defence will be that Sidney killed  the man. There is no way of averting that. The question in my mind,&rdquo; said  Herrick looking at Marsh-Carr &ldquo;is, whether the boy really did do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you any doubt on the subject?&rdquo; asked Stephen eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a great many  doubts,&rdquo; replied Jim dryly, &ldquo;and until the person who really murdered Carr  confesses, I shall continue to doubt. You see Steve, ever since I took up this  matter I have been following up false trails. Every person I have stumbled  upon, and to whose guilt the evidence at the time procurable, pointed, has laid  the blame on some one else, who in turn has passed on the guilt to another  party. I suspected Joyce. He accused Santiago. The Don said Pentland Corn was  guilty. Corn declared that Mrs. Marsh had fired the shot. Now we know from  accurate evidence that all these persons are innocent. Frisco was suspected from  the very first. He is caught and swears&mdash;truly enough according to his own  belief, that the boy murdered the Colonel. How do I know but what Sidney may be  able to prove his innocence, and accuse someone else. The chain may go on  endlessly so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand the difficulty,&rdquo; replied Stephen wearily, &ldquo;but I cannot for the life  of me see why Sidney should kill the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  comes in the queer character of the boy,&rdquo; said Herrick &ldquo;he detested the  Colonel&mdash;said he was a bad man. He might have got into his head in some way or  another that such a man was better out of the world. If so, he would make no  more account of killing Carr than he would of putting a fly out of existence.  Indeed he would rather spare the fly, for I have noticed that he is tender to  all that breathes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  would he keep quiet over the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. Sidney was never the boy to talk. Then there is the pistol Stephen.  That is an old-fashioned weapon that a boy might buy in Beorminster for a few  pence, or he might have found it in the lumber room of the Grange&mdash;there are  many of these ancient firearms to be found in the houses of old families. If  Sidney dropped across such a weapon he might have then concluded to kill Carr.  You see, from the account of Frisco, that he came down the Tower stairs and  said, quite calmly, that the Colonel was dead. He may just as calmly admit to  me or to you that he killed the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad!  Mad!&rdquo; groaned Marsh-Carr, &ldquo;he must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  That does not follow. The boy is strange. There are things about him which I  cannot explain. So far as I can see Sidney does not come within the range of  science. That foretelling of your mother&rsquo;s death, and his extraordinary  statement that you were in danger, puzzled me beyond words. I must believe,  because I am convinced by the evidence of my own senses. All the same I cannot  explain or understand. There are laws of Nature with which we are unacquainted.  I believe that this boy comes under some unknown laws. You cannot account for  the actions of such a person. The boy would do things which we should call  wrong, yet he would see no harm in doing them. If he is guilty, he will be put  away in an asylum. At the same time I am sure he is perfectly sane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am puzzled myself about him,&rdquo; admitted Stephen, &ldquo;and he is a most uncomfortable  boy to have about one. Still I have always found him upright and honourable. I  have never known him to tell a lie. But he must know all about this case and  how Frisco has been accused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not so sure of that. Sidney lives with his head in the clouds. He perhaps has  heard that Frisco has been accused, but, as the man does not now come across  his path, he never thinks of any possible danger to him. Again Stephen, that  silver bullet is queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you mean queer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  you know the medi&aelig;val superstition that a warlock can be killed only by a  silver bullet. A thing of that sort, is exactly what would appeal to the dreamy  nature of Sidney. He is something of a mystic himself remember. He might have  taken it into his head, that Carr was a warlock who had dealings with the devil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure he would have every reason to think so,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr, &ldquo;if any man  was hand in glove with Satan, my uncle was that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see what you say yourself. Then Sidney thinking in a less sane fashion on the  same subject might have considered it his duty to deliver the world from such a  wizard. He would certainly then use a silver bullet, thinking (according to the  medi&aelig;val superstition) that the man could not be killed by ordinary lead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all theory,&rdquo; said Stephen gloomily, &ldquo;and fantastic at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you say&mdash;all theory and fantastic,&rdquo; admitted Herrick, &ldquo;but you must remember  that we are dealing with a fantastic nature. But we must see this boy and  question him when we get home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will deny everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary if I know anything of the boy, he will calmly admit what he has  done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not tell Bess or Ida?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  would be unwise. We must be certain of Sidney first. We shall say nothing  to-night, but get Sidney to come over to &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; on the morrow and ask him  frankly if he killed Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bess  is sure to ask you about Frisco,&rdquo; said Stephen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I can baffle her curiosity,&rdquo; replied Herrick. &ldquo;I shall tell her nothing about  my visit to the man. All about his arrest she can know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think it will be better to hold our tongues altogether Jim. Ida is getting  worried by this incessant mystery, although she knows very little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t wonder. I&rsquo;m worried myself. However, we must learn what we can  from Sidney. I hope to Heaven the lad is innocent, but if he is not, I don&rsquo;t  look upon him in the light of an ordinary criminal. He is a freak of nature.  Were I put into the witness-box I could not say on my oath that he is mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us drop the subject,&rdquo; said Stephen who looked haggard, &ldquo;I am getting nervous  and anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim  acquiesced in this sensible view and the two betook themselves to the magazines  and newspapers. Until they arrived at Beorminster, they said little to one  another, and even then were&mdash;for them&mdash;taciturn. A groom and cart awaited them,  and they drove to Saxham in silence. It did not do to talk of Sidney with a  servant at their elbows. But curiously enough the groom had news for Stephen,  which brought in the name of Sidney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please  sir, that Italian woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with her?&rdquo; asked Herrick who was driving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is very ill sir, and it is said she will die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Die!&rdquo;  echoed Stephen in surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was not bad enough for that when I saw her last. What do you think Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  looked very sick certainly, but so far as I can judge was in no immediate  danger of death. Who says this Parry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  groom sunk his voice to a whisper, and seemed nervous, &ldquo;Master Sidney,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
  <p>Both  men looked round at this. Then at each other. Herrick was the first to break  the silence. &ldquo;When did Master Sidney say that Parry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday  sir. Mr. Napper, he met him in Beorminster in the Cathedral Square about four o&rsquo;clock.  He asked him joking-like where he was going. Master Sidney said, just as quiet  as he does speak sir, that he was going to see the Italian woman die. Napper  was that taken aback you could have knocked him down with a feather sir. Then  Master Sidney said she would die in two days, which I take to mean sir, that  she&rsquo;ll go off to-morrow. And I&rsquo;m sure she will sir,&rdquo; added Parry with  conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this story known Parry?&rdquo; asked his master rather vexed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  sir. Napper went at once to see Miss Endicotte when he came back to Saxham. She  asked him to say nothing about it, but he had already told Phelps the gardener  sir. Then Phelps told us all sir, but we have said nothing outside about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  you don&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; said Stephen sharply, &ldquo;the first of my servants who says a  word will be discharged, mind that Parry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  groom touched his hat and relapsed into silence. &ldquo;Where is Master Sidney now  Parry?&rdquo; asked Herrick after a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the house in Beorminster sir. He has been there all night. Miss Endicotte went  over, but she could not get him away. He says he must stay there until the  Italian woman dies sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  You need say no more Parry,&rdquo; and the doctor drove on in silence. But Marsh-Carr  knew from the way he urged the mare, how perturbed he was over this  information. Stephen was upset himself. There was something disquieting about  everything in connection with Sidney.</p>
  <p>After  dinner at &ldquo;The Pines,&rdquo; Herrick made Stephen lie down, as he was yet far from  strong, and walked across to Biffstead. Here he saw the two girls and Frank,  who were very much troubled by this latest freak of their brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to do with him,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I went over and insisted he  should come home. I took him by the shoulder to force him out of the house, but  he got in such a passion that I thought he would have a fit. So I left him  until you came back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  go over and get him away Jim,&rdquo; implored Ida, &ldquo;you have more influence over him  than anyone else. I have gone and Bess also, but he will not come. We can&rsquo;t  carry him back by main force and make a scandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  go,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;but I did not know that I had any influence with him. He is  a lad one can do nothing with. How does the old woman take his telling her she  is about to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is quite calm. Evidently she thinks Sidney is a kind of prophet. He is telling  her not to be afraid and talking the queerest things to her. I am sure Sidney  is mad,&rdquo; sobbed Ida, &ldquo;he will be shut up in an asylum someday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  said nothing. The poor girl little knew how truly she spoke. If Sidney had  indeed killed Carr, he would certainly be shut up. Considering his  extraordinary character, perhaps this would be all the better for his friends  and relatives, if not for himself. &ldquo;I will go over in the morning,&rdquo; said  Herrick on reflection, &ldquo;he may be more reasonable in the morning. I am  beginning to understand him a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ida, and Frank echoed her opinion. This was natural enough.  No man is a hero to his relatives.</p>
  <p>All  this time Bess said nothing. While Jim was away, she had worried much over her  brother&rsquo;s freak, but now that the doctor had returned she was satisfied that  all would be well. Herrick exercised over Bess, the same influence he did over  most people he came into contact with. Stephen and the girls, were both more  than ordinarily intelligent, but they deferred to Jim in a most remarkable  manner. If any one could manage Sidney, Bess felt that Herrick was the man. Jim  was not so certain himself. The boy had never come under his influence, and in  his own calm way held his own against everyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about Frisco?&rdquo; asked Bess who had followed Herrick down the avenue, &ldquo;has he  really been arrested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim nodded. &ldquo;Santiago betrayed him to some private Inquiry Agents I employed,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;a mean shabby piece of work Bess. Joyce put it down to me. I assured  him that I had nothing to do with the matter, but he refused to believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is so mean himself, that he cannot believe any good of other people,&rdquo; said Bess  scornfully, &ldquo;what is to be done now about Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am thinking,&rdquo; replied her lover evasively, &ldquo;when I have come to a conclusion I&rsquo;ll  tell you Bess. But I fancy the end is in sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope so,&rdquo; sighed the girl. &ldquo;I am so tired of this anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shortly  you will have no more, dear,&rdquo; and Jim took her in his arms to kiss her  good-bye, &ldquo;the night is dark, but the dawn is breaking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next  morning Dr. Herrick walked over to Beorminster. He left Stephen at home  although the Squire wanted to come also. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;it is best for me to  speak to the boy alone, I&rsquo;ll get more out of him.&rdquo; And Stephen recognised that  this was the more sensible course.</p>
  <p>It  was eleven o&rsquo;clock when Herrick rapped at the door of the Beorminster house. It  was opened by Sidney, who looked calm and complacent as usual. &ldquo;I heard you had  come back Dr. Jim,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  your prophetic instinct tell you that?&rdquo; asked Herrick testily.</p>
  <p>The  boy was so difficult to understand that he could not help feeling annoyed. A man over thirty does not like treating a lad of sixteen as his equal. Yet  Sidney somehow compelled that respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied he sweetly. &ldquo;I am very stupid about some things. When a thought comes  to me, it comes. I cannot call it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  the thought came to you that Petronella would die?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will die Dr. Jim. Two days ago I felt that she would die. So I came over to see  her. She was afraid of death, till I talked to her. Now she is quite peaceful.  She does not fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you afraid of death Sidney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I be? I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  there is nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo; The boy spoke quite serenely and without any  suggestion of pose. He had conducted Herrick to the dining-room and the two  were seated opposite one another. On the table were the remains of Sidney&rsquo;s  breakfast,&mdash;a glass of milk, some fruit and a loaf of bread. &ldquo;I had to get  these myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Petronella is in bed in Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s room. She is very  ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew she was ill some time ago,&rdquo; replied Herrick trying to assert himself, &ldquo;but  I think I can cure her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will not live,&rdquo; said Sidney, staring in the most unwinking manner at Dr. Jim. &ldquo;She  will die before sunset. I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you explain how you do know?&rdquo; asked the doctor roughly.</p>
  <p>This  time it was the boy who was puzzled, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel that  Petronella will die. I can say no more than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  groaned. It was useless to try and understand this extraordinary lad. Evidently  he did not understand himself. Yet his former prophecies had come to pass so  absolutely, that Dr. Jim could not help thinking that this last would come true  also. However, this was not the business about which he had come. &ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; he  said after a pause, &ldquo;do you know that Frisco, who used to be with Colonel Carr,  has been arrested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard Bess say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never thought of it at all. He is in no danger, Dr. Jim. It was not Frisco who  killed Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo; asked Herrick startled. Was the boy about to confess that he  was guilty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in the house just after Colonel Carr was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  Then you did not shoot him yourself?&rdquo; Sidney frowned, but appeared very little  disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I have killed him?&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Colonel Carr was a wicked man. I  told him he would die by violence some day. But he only laughed at me. He  thought I was mad or a fool. You do also, Dr. Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; said Jim angrily; &ldquo;I never met anyone like you  before, Sidney. If I had not some knowledge that the things you say come true I  should think you were pretending. A boy like you ought to be whipped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what the Colonel said,&rdquo; replied Sidney quietly. &ldquo;But tell me, Dr. Jim, did  you really think I had killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not. But Frisco says you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he believed that, he would not have run away,&rdquo; said Sidney shrewdly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well  come to the point. Who murdered the Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Petronella,&rdquo;  said Sidney.</p>
  <p>Herrick  rose up with a look of surprise. Astonished as he was he could hardly help  laughing. This statement bore out his speech to Stephen. He had said that  Sidney would accuse someone else. Now it only remained for Petronella to shift  the blame on to the shoulders of a third party. &ldquo;I do not believe that,&rdquo; said  Herrick, &ldquo;why should Petronella kill Carr?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had better come up and hear what she has to say Dr. Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a moment. But tell me how you know&mdash;through your instinct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sidney  shook his head. &ldquo;No. That feeling only comes at times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not  pretend to know everything. I said so before. I don&rsquo;t know why you should look  on me as queer Dr. Jim,&rdquo; he continued plaintively, &ldquo;it is not my fault if  things come into my head. When they do, I sometimes tell people, but not  always. I don&rsquo;t like being laughed at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a queer fish,&rdquo; muttered Dr. Jim, annoyed by this human problem he could not  understand. &ldquo;I should like you to be examined by a committee of doctors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  would not understand Dr. Jim, and I can&rsquo;t explain. But you want to hear how I  knew. Well on the night Colonel Carr was killed I went to the Pine wood after  seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  you any premonition that he would be murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I had no feeling of any kind. I was in the wood for some time. At half past  seven I felt hungry, but I did not want to go to Biffstead as I knew Ida would  try and keep me in. It was raining, but I did not mind that. I like the open  air where I can breathe. A house makes me choke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I was hungry I thought I would go and get something from Colonel Carr. I  sometimes went to see him, though I did not like him. He was always kind to me,  although I think he was afraid. Well I went into the house just before eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said half past seven just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not go in at once,&rdquo; said the boy, with a gesture of irritation; &ldquo;do not  interrupt me, Dr. Jim. I went to the dining-room and found the dinner on the  table, but the Colonel was not there. I took a piece of bread and some water.  While I was eating I heard a shot. I wondered what it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not feel that murder was been committed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should I have felt? I Just wondered what the shot might be. After a bit I  went out into the hall to see if the Colonel had come in. I thought he might be  out. I saw Petronella run through the hall and out into the night. I wondered  what she was doing there, and followed her, but I lost her as she went through  the woods. Then I walked about for a time, up till nine. I thought again about  the shot and went back to the house. I went up the tower and saw Colonel Carr  lying dead, so I knew Petronella had killed him. I came down the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  was it you did not meet Frisco, who had gone up to see the Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard someone coming and went into a lower room. I thought it might be  Petronella coming back. I saw it was Frisco and saw him come down again. Then I  came and said to him &lsquo;He is quite dead,&rsquo; and went out. After that I went on the  moor. Then some time afterwards I heard three more shots. I saw Bess and her  lantern and went home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you say nothing of all this before?&rdquo; asked Herrick. &ldquo;There was no reason.  If Frisco had been caught before, I should have told you. But he had got away,  and I did not think it was right to tell about Petronella. Colonel Carr was a  wicked man, and he deserved to be killed. He did a lot of harm,&rdquo; said Sidney,  with a shudder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  comes it you tell me now, Sidney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Bess told me Frisco had been arrested. He is wicked too, but I did not want him  to be hanged for shooting Carr, as I knew that he was innocent. I came over to  see Petronella, for I had a feeling that she would die, and I wanted to know  from herself before she died if she was guilty. She denied it at first, but I  said I would not go away until she told me all. That was why I stayed all  night. She tried to run away. I said I would tell the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was unlike you Sidney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the boy positively, &ldquo;I knew that Petronella was the one who  shot Carr. If she did not confess, Frisco would be hanged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never thought you might be accused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I did not do it,&rdquo; replied Sidney calmly, &ldquo;why should I be accused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  sighed impatiently. The boy could not, or would not, understand, &ldquo;I suppose  then Petronella confessed in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I made her write it down that she killed Carr. It is in Italian but I do not  know the language. You must see that it is all right Dr. Jim. I did that  because I thought she might die before you arrived. But now that you are here,  come up and see her. I will go for Inspector Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim was aghast. Here was Sidney in a new character. &ldquo;Why for Bridge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must hear her confession,&rdquo; said Sidney putting on his hat. &ldquo;Perhaps she has  written down something different in the Italian. I will give you the paper when  I come back. But I must go for Bridge,&rdquo; and Sidney, before Herrick could say a  word, was out of the room. Dr. Jim heard the front door close behind the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is not much insanity about this act,&rdquo; muttered Herrick to himself, I shall see  Petronella at once, he smiled grimly, &ldquo;I wonder who she will accuse,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    The Truth</b></h2>
  <p>In  the room where Mrs. Marsh had died, and in the same bed, lay the old Italian  woman dying also. She was sitting up, with a red woollen shawl wrapped round  her bony shoulders, and her lean hands told her rosary. Whatever views Sidney  might have instilled into her regarding life beyond the grave, Petronella still  remained within the fold of Peter. She was muttering prayer after prayer with  feverish haste and the black beads slipped quickly from between her fingers.</p>
  <p>The  room was dusty, dark and untidy. Near the bed was a bottle of Chianti and some  bread, but the flask was full and the loaf untouched. Petronella was past  earthly food. Herrick saw the mark of death on her yellow face. She seemed  pleased to see him and not at all afraid. Receiving him with a chuckle, she  interpreted the look in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  he has told you, that young Signor,&rdquo; she said in her own tongue, &ldquo;ah! I thought  he would. It was time&mdash;but too late Signor Dottore&mdash;too late for the prison. I  go into Purgatory. Ten pounds for masses Signor. You will see that they are  said. Then I may get into Paradise to rest. I need rest. All my life I have  worked hard. The Good God will not be hard on poor old Petronella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim took a chair by the bedside, and felt her pulse. &ldquo;You need nourishing food  Petronella,&rdquo; he said soothingly, &ldquo;a cup of soup now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  Eh Signor Dottore that will not help me. I am dying. You do not know. I have  never told you. Cancer Signor&mdash;a bad cancer. I shall die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  may be able to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not want that. They would put me in prison. Let me die. The young Signor  said I would die. It is foolish to live. I will go to my Padrona and explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you did shoot the Colonel, Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si!  Si!&rdquo; the old woman coughed, &ldquo;he was a devil-man. He was cruel to my padrona, to  the young Signor. Also he had the evil eye. Hard to kill. Oh, yes,&rdquo; she  chuckled, &ldquo;but the silver bullet&mdash;ah yes the silver bullet.&rdquo; Dr. Jim looked at  her in silence. He wondered that he had not suspected Petronella before. After  Bess had told him about the bullet, he had been certain that the person who had  fired the shot, was of a superstitious nature. Mrs. Marsh being Italian might  have thought of the same thing. But she was educated, and above such folly. Petronella,  a woman of the people with feudal instincts, had clung to that wild belief of  the Middle Ages. She was the one person of Dr. Jim&rsquo;s acquaintances, who would  have dreamed of such a thing, and her, he had not suspected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you use a silver bullet Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh!  the man was a diavolo&mdash;a witch creature&mdash;he had the evil eye. Did I not meet  with an accident after he had over-looked me. It was better he should die,  rather than live to ruin the Signora. A silver bullet. Only in that way Signor  can those aided by the devil perish. I am not sorry. No. It was a good deed.  The young Signor said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same Petronella I must tell you that Frisco is accused of this murder. He  is in prison. It is unfair that he should suffer for what you have done, so you  must make confession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have done so Signor Dottore. I wrote with my own hand in my own language, that  I Petronella had slain this devil-man with a silver bullet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even  so,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;but I want to write down your confession myself. You can  sign it and the police officer can witness it. Thus, will the man who is in  prison for your crime be saved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  police,&rdquo; echoed Petronella, &ldquo;ah, I knew they would come. But they will not put  me in prison Signor. I die. I die, and that soon. Eh! as you will. You have  been good to me. I will do what you want. Yonder in the corner Signor&mdash;the  padrona&rsquo;s ink and pen&mdash;also the paper. Write down what I say, and I will sign.  What does it matter now I die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Jim found the materials and placing them on the little round table looked at  Petronella. She nodded and muttered a prayer, then began to speak in her usual  rapid manner. She spoke in Italian, but Dr. Jim for the benefit of Bridge  translated it into English. Luckily Herrick was an excellent linguist and found  no difficulty in doing this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signor,&rdquo;  began Petronella, &ldquo;it happened in this way. I was at the house of that  devil-man with the Signora&mdash;oh a long time ago. The padrona went to ask him for  money. He refused, the cursed robber,&mdash;and we were so poor&mdash;so poor. My signora  the last of a great race, poor. Gran&rsquo; Dio. It was evil that she should be poor.  But the devil-man would give not one lira. Ah no! He kept all. I was angered,  because of my padrona. I saw on the table a cup of silver, and that I took.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  stole the cup?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not. My padrona was poor. That devil-man saw me, he struck me&mdash;yes, even me  Petronella a free Italian. And he over-looked me with his evil eye. I  shuddered. I knew that I would have an accident. And the next day I hurt  myself. Ah the wicked wretch. I gave back the cup, as he made me. But when we  went down the stairs I took another of silver. This time he saw me not, and I  carried it here under my shawl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did Mrs. Marsh say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  padrona was angry. But I did not care. I did not sell the silver cup as she was  angered, but I kept it, yes, for the silver bullet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  looked up from his writing. &ldquo;Had you made up your mind then to kill Colonel  Carr?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not then. I should have liked to: because he cast on me the evil eye. Ah Dio  mio I made horns, but it was no use. I had an accident. No Signor Dottore I did  not wish to kill him then&mdash;very much. Later on when the will&mdash;the will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know about the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si!  Si! It was that Frisco told me. I was in the market. He also, and he had the  wine in him. He talked foolishly, and said that his Signor would make another  will leaving all the money to him. I saw that my poor padrona and the young  Signor Stefano would be ruined. I came back and told the Signora. She was angered.  Then she said she would go to see this devil-man. Signor,&rdquo; here Petronella  clutched Herrick by the wrist, &ldquo;I knew that my padrona had a temper. She could  rage. I feared what she might do. I watched&mdash;eh! yes, I watched. She was to  dine with the padre at Saxham, and then see the wicked Signor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you not know she would see him in the afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  She said she would go about nine and see him. That after his dinner he would be  in a good temper and might not do this wrong. Signor, I saw that she took with  her a pistol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  revolver of Mr. Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si!  Si! She took it from the case in the room of the young Signor Stefano. I saw  her. I knew that if the devil-man laughed at her she would kill him. Yes. She  would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Petronella,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim soothingly, &ldquo;she only meant to frighten him. So she  said in the letter you gave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  Signor,&rdquo; replied the old woman indignantly, &ldquo;the daughter of the Micholotti  would not be so weak. She would have killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  my soul,&rdquo; muttered Herrick, &ldquo;I believe she would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was in great alarm Signor,&rdquo; went on Petronella. &ldquo;I thought if she did so, that  she would be put in prison. It was terrible to think so. I was angered against  the devil-man. He had struck me; he had looked upon me with the evil eye. Now  he would tempt my Signora to kill him and so be put in prison. I saw that all  would be lost. Then I said to myself, to me Petronella, that I would kill him  alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old woman drew herself up in bed, and looked majestic as she spoke. Herrick was  profoundly sorry for her. She had carried her feudal instinct to excess, and so  had jeopardised her life for the sake of her mistress. He understood well how  she had been urged to this. The blow, the evil eye, the possibility of her  young master being ruined by another will, and above all, the chance that her  Signora might kill the man herself&mdash;a fiery faithful creature like Petronella  could not let such things be. As she said, she made up her mind to kill Carr,  before Mrs. Marsh could see him. Where she made the mistake was, that she  thought her mistress would see the man at night. As a matter of fact she did,  but already had seen him in the day. Perhaps Mrs. Marsh guessed what Petronella  might do, and she had told a falsehood about the time of calling at &ldquo;The Pines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  the Signora departed,&rdquo; said Petronella, rocking to and fro, for she was in  pain, &ldquo;I got my pistol. Si, Signor, it was the pistol of my husband. He fought  for the King when we freed Italy. I too, was in the war. I shot many&mdash;oh many.  He showed me; I was not afraid to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  piece of information showed Herrick how it was Carr had been shot through the  heart. Petronella, having been in the Italian war of liberation, knew how to  handle firearms. Probably she was an excellent markswoman. The shooting of Carr  proved her to be so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had bullets,&rdquo; said Petronella, &ldquo;but they were of lead. I knew that the devil  man protected by the Wicked One, could not be slain by only a leaden bullet. I  wanted a silver one. Ah Gran&rsquo; Dio! there was no silver in this house. Then I  thought of the cup I had taken. I got it and melted it down over a big fire. I  made three bullets in the mould of my husband. I took his powder flask, but it  was empty. The young Signor Stefano had powder in his room&mdash;I stole it. Then I  loaded the pistol and set it aside till the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  was Mr. Marsh all this time?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was in the house in the afternoon, and went to eat with a friend of his, Signor  Barker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  newspaper editor,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim. He remembered that this was the man who looked  after the Beorminster Chronicle and took an interest in Stephen&rsquo;s poetry, &ldquo;he  dined with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si  Signor, and said he would not be back till late. He was to bring home the  Signora from Saxham. I was all alone and I saw what I could do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what did you do Petronella?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hid the pistol in my shawl and walked to Saxham. I got there before eight. I  went to the big house, I found it empty. I climbed the stair where I knew the  devil man would be in the tower. He was standing by his bed dressed to eat. He  took up a pistol but let it down when he saw it was only old Petronella.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean he still held the pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I waited for a moment as he stared at me, and then shot him. I aimed for the  heart,&rdquo; said Petronella hugging her knees. &ldquo;The silver bullet went through the  heart. Oh, my husband showed me how to shoot Signor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  made sure the devil-man was dead. He fell on his face. Then I went down the  stairs. I saw someone, I did not know who it was. But the young Signor told me  he was there. I ran through the pine wood, and he followed, I hid behind a  tree, and then after a time I got home. No one knew that I had been out, and  when the Signora and the young Signor Stefano came back I said nothing. The  Signora looked white. She said nothing to me but I knew that she had seen the  devil-man. What did I care. She could not kill him again. That is all Signor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lost the pistol?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  lost my husband&rsquo;s pistol,&rdquo; said Petronella precisely, &ldquo;it dropped from my  pocket when I ran, I did not care. No one would know that it belonged to me.  Then I heard Frisco had gone. I was glad. They would not think I had killed the  devil man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  Mrs. Marsh suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  signora? No. She said nothing. I was certain she had fired the other three  shots for I know my signora. Also I looked at the revolver in the case when she  put it back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Frisco had been arrested at once would you have spoken out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Frisco was a bad man too. I would be glad if they put him in prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you tell now then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  young Signor made me tell. Ah! he is a terrible young Signor. He makes me  afraid. He said I would die, and that I must tell at once or he would speak to  the police. Well I have told and I die. Have you all down Signor. I will sign.  Ah! Dio mio!&rdquo; she started up in bed, &ldquo;the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was indeed Bridge who entered with a red face and astonished eyes. He was  followed by Sidney looking calm, just as though the Inspector had not been  scolding him all the way because he had not told about Petronella before. But  it took someone stronger than Inspector Bridge to frighten Sidney. For a moment  the Inspector stared at the bed, and at his prisoner as he regarded the old  woman. Then he spoke to Dr. Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is an extraordinary thing sir,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  assented Herrick, &ldquo;I only knew of it myself an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought this young gentleman was telling me a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth,&rdquo; said Petronella pointing to Herrick, &ldquo;the Signor has written all  down. Here, see me sign my name, and you can say I signed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector  Bridge wanted to talk, but Dr. Jim made him a sign to be silent. The old woman  was sinking fast and there was no time to be lost. With great difficulty she  signed her name. Herrick and Bridge appended their signatures, and all was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  will set Frisco free,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;and now I must see about getting a warrant  out for this woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is too late,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;she is dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; said Bridge with a disdainful smile, &ldquo;all this is done to cheat the  law. I have a policeman downstairs. He shall come up and watch her, while I go  for a warrant of arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  will die before sunset,&rdquo; said Sidney calmly, and went to the old women. He took  her hand. &ldquo;Good bye Petronella. You will be happy soon. You know what is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Si  Si. I know. I am happy. I will go to my husband,&rdquo; said Petronella. Then she  looked at Dr. Jim with a worn smile. &ldquo;I did it for my signora,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you  can go. You can do me no good now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrick  saw that well enough. However he went to see if he could get a nurse to heat  some soup, and revive the woman. To be sure it was little use bringing her back  to health and strength just to hang her. But Dr. Jim acted for the best. He  went out with Sidney and the Inspector, leaving two policemen in charge. Bridge  had the confession in his pocket, and intended to go up to town to deliver it  into the hands of the proper authorities. Frisco had to be released seeing that  he was innocent. &ldquo;And I always thought he was,&rdquo; said Bridge lying in the most  shameless manner.</p>
  <p>Sidney  looked after the man with a queer smile when he went away. &ldquo;He is only wasting  time,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  may keep the old woman alive till to-morrow,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>
  <p>Sidney  shook his head. &ldquo;She will die before sunset,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Out  of sheer perversity Dr. Jim wanted to thwart this prophecy. He saw that bad as  Petronella was, she could be kept alive by stimulants, and this he intended to  do, if only to baffle this extraordinary boy. For once in a way, he wished to  prove Sidney in the wrong. The boy perhaps guessed his intentions, for he  smiled again, and then said abruptly, that he was going back to Saxham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you tell them what has happened?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Sidney, after a pause, &ldquo;I am not fond of talking. You can tell them if you  like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim coolly, &ldquo;then you ask Ida, Frank, and Bess to be at &lsquo;The  Pines&rsquo; about five o&rsquo;clock. I shall return by that time and then everything can  be explained. Thank heaven we know the truth at last. It is about time the  matter came to an end. Will you be at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am going to have a long sleep,&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;I feel very tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned away with a nod, and Herrick stared after him. Jim was a doctor of the  most advanced school, he had studied much, he was quick in seeing things, and  on the whole prided himself on his knowledge. But he could make nothing of  Sidney. The boy and his ways were beyond him altogether. Sidney would have  baffled a committee of Doctors.</p>
  <p>Herrick  searched for a nurse and found one speedily, for he knew where to go. He  brought her back to the house, and set her to heat some soup. Then he gave  various directions, sent out for certain medicine, and did what he could to  revive the strength of the old woman. Bridge allowed Petronella to have the bedroom  to herself, but he kept the two policemen in the house and got out his warrant.  Nothing was known in the town about the matter, as Bridge wished to wait until  all was in order before telling the public. He foresaw that glory would accrue  to him by the story he intended to tell. He had resolved to give Sidney and  Herrick no more credit than he could help. Dr. Jim guessed as much when he  heard Bridge talking. But he was rather pleased than otherwise. He did not want  this latest freak of the uncanny changeling to be talked about. Besides, Bridge  amused him. He was so very human in his love of praise.</p>
  <p>His  philanthropic work being ended, Herrick walked back to Saxham. He reached &lsquo;The  Pines&rsquo; some time after five, and already found the assembled party impatiently  expecting his arrival. Sidney, it appeared, had just said sufficient to pique  the curiosity of his family. He hinted that some untoward event had occurred  with which Herrick was connected, but refused to say what it was. Then he had  retired to bed in full daylight, and announced that he was going to sleep for  twenty-four hours. What was to be done with such a boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  grows more eccentric every day,&rdquo; sighed Ida.</p>
  <p>Stephen  laughed, &ldquo;Oh! his eccentricities are harmless enough. That is if&mdash;&rdquo; here he  caught Herrick&rsquo;s eye and hesitated. He did not know but what Sidney might have  confessed the crime of which Frisco accused him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jim cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is?&rdquo; asked Bess, wondering at the sudden relief expressed on Stephen&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Jim,  you have something to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Something very important&mdash;about the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  murder of Carr,&rdquo; cried Frank astonished. &ldquo;Oh! I thought that was done with long  ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, &ldquo;I have been working at it all these months trying  to learn the truth. Stephen and Bess have been helping me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Ida, looking from her lover to the doctor, &ldquo;I do call it mean. I should  have been told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would only have worried you, dear,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what is the difficulty?&rdquo; cried Frank puzzled. &ldquo;Frisco killed the Colonel. There  was no secret about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisco  did not kill Carr,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;the jury were wrong, so were we all. It was  Petronella who shot the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  jumped up, as Bess uttered a cry of amazement. &ldquo;Petronella,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Thank  God! Sidney did not do it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sidney!&rdquo;  cried Bess and Ida in a breath.</p>
  <p>Herrick  hurriedly explained. &ldquo;Frisco accused Sidney because he was in the house at the  time of the murder. That was when you were looking for him, Bess. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No wonder I could not find him. But Petronella.  Was the pistol hers and the silver bullet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are you talking about, Bess dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me explain,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim, before Bess could answer Ida, &ldquo;it is a long story  and I think you will find it interesting.&rdquo; And then Herrick told the whole  complicated case from the time he and Joyce found the dead body of Colonel Carr  in the Tower which now no longer existed. He was frequently interrupted with  exclamations of horror from Ida, and of rage from Frank. When he ended, the  latter jumped up. &ldquo;If I meet that little wretch, Joyce, again,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  break every bone in his body. The idea of trying to mix up Bess in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has received a worse punishment than a thrashing,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;I think you  can leave him to the punishment of destiny, Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  babel of voices ensued. Everyone was talking at once, and for fully an hour  they discussed the case in all its bearings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose Frisco will be released now,&rdquo; said Bess triumphantly. &ldquo;I knew that he  was innocent. I said so all along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  the same he is a bad lot,&rdquo; remarked Herrick, &ldquo;the less we have to do with him  the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll come down here again in a hurry,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr thankfully,  &ldquo;and Santiago has sailed for Mexico. Thus we are rid of the whole gang. Hullo!  What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; It was a violent ringing at the door, and Herrick started to his  feet, looking perturbed. &ldquo;I hope nothing is wrong now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am getting  so nervous with all this, that I am always expecting the worst of tidings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he spoke, the footman ushered in Inspector Bridge, in a state of excitement.  The man could hardly speak, and was scarlet in the face with suppressed rage  and alarm. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said to the company; &ldquo;but this  woman&mdash;Petronella&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; asked Dr. Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  looked at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  before sunset,&rdquo; remarked Herrick, thinking of Sidney. &ldquo;How did it happen,  Bridge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had a bottle of chloral under her pillow, and while the nurse&rsquo;s back was  turned, she drank it. I was called, too late. She is as dead as a door-nail,  and has spoilt a most beautiful case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leaving  the others to discuss the matter with Bridge, Herrick hastily excused himself.  He ran across to Biffstead, and up into Sidney&rsquo;s bedroom. The boy was sleeping  quietly, but Dr. Jim woke him promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say,&rdquo; he cried, shaking the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Petronella,&rdquo;  said Sidney drowsily, &ldquo;I know she is. I said she would die before sunset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told her to take that chloral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Sidney in a sleepy manner, &ldquo;she wanted to take it before she confessed,  but I stopped her. But she was bound to die; I said she might get out of the  world more easily if she took it. I daresay she died quietly&mdash;in a sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have behaved shamefully,&rdquo; cried Herrick wrathfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  She was bound to die in any case. Why should she not die as she pleased? Go  away, Dr. Jim, I want to sleep,&rdquo; and Sidney closed his eyes.</p>
  <p>Herrick,  in the face of this calmness, was helpless, so he departed. The boy had baffled  him to the very end.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    A Final Surprise</b></h2>
  <p>In  this way the trouble left as a legacy by the wicked Colonel came to an end.  Frisco was duly tried, and on the confession of Petronella he was acquitted. A  very meagre report of the proceedings appeared in the newspapers. In taking  down the confession Herrick had not inserted the fact of Mrs. Marsh&rsquo;s  connection with the matter. Frisco said nothing to his counsel about the three  shots fired after the Colonel was dead. Therefore the name of Stephen&rsquo;s  step-mother was spared the disgrace of her mad impulsive act. For obvious  reasons the most interesting part of the case was left untold, and the public  never knew the complications that had ensued in searching for the assassin.  Frisco was tried briefly, was acquitted, and when set free he disappeared.  Where he went no one knew, and no one cared.</p>
  <p>By  the advice of Dr. Jim, Stephen paid to Belcher and Kidd the reward that he had  promised for the capture of Frisco. Herrick was afraid that if it was not paid  that the two might search into the matter more particularly than would be  agreeable to the feelings of Marsh-Carr. Stephen saw this danger himself, and  gladly sent a cheque for the money. But Belcher and Kidd will get no more  business from Dr. Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I hope I&rsquo;ll never come into connection with detective business again,&rdquo; said  Herrick earnestly, &ldquo;it is all very well to read about: but in real life it is  not so pleasant. However we have done with it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Certainly  he was done with the case, but not entirely with Frisco. One day the ex-sailor  arrived at Saxham, and asked to see Mr. Marsh-Carr. At the time Stephen was  indoors, and luckily for him Dr. Herrick had not gone out. When the name of  Frisco was given the two looked at one another in surprise. They had hoped  never to hear it again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I see him, Jim?&rdquo; asked Stephen doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  I shall see him also,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;he can have come here for no good  purpose. But I would rather have him as an open enemy than striking in the  dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  consequence of this speech was that Frisco was shown into the library. He was  glad to see Marsh-Carr and visibly annoyed to find that the doctor was present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  business is private,&rdquo; said Frisco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must tell it to me in the presence of, Dr. Herrick,&rdquo; said Stephen, scenting  trouble; &ldquo;I do nothing without his advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Worse  luck,&rdquo; growled Frisco, and sat down with a scowl.</p>
  <p>Herrick  laughed. &ldquo;You do not seem pleased that you have escaped the gallows, Frisco,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;or perhaps you are sorry the criminal did not turn out to be Sidney  Endicotte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care a fig who it was so long as it wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; replied the ex-sailor. &ldquo;Huh!  fancy Carr being shot by an old hag after going through all the dangers he did.  I always thought he&rsquo;d have a mean end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is beside the point,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;as I suppose you did not not come here to  criticise my uncle, you had better tell me your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not pleasant business,&rdquo; said Frisco coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I should expect, seeing that you have come about it,&rdquo; said the Squire; &ldquo;however,  I shall be pleased to hear what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  took a paper out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you will,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have here, Mr. Marsh-Carr, the last will of  the Colonel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stephen  started to his feet and turned pale. Herrick, who had been listening intently,  struck in: &ldquo;I suppose it leaves all the money to you, Mr. Joyce-Frisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  growled Frisco, &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t Se&ntilde;or. It&rsquo;s a good will for you if it&rsquo;s true  what Robin says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what does Robin say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you are to marry Miss Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is perfectly true,&rdquo; replied Herrick coolly, &ldquo;but I do not see what she has to  do with your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will soon Dr. Herrick. The money is left to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo;  cried Stephen loudly, &ldquo;Carr has left his money to Bess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  bet. Here&rsquo;s the will,&rdquo; and Frisco threw it across the table. &ldquo;He said she was  the only man amongst the lot of you. See how honest I am Herrick. I want to  make you a rich man &lsquo;cause you stood by me in trouble I never forget a pal, not  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime  Stephen and Jim were looking over the paper. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried Herrick bursting into  a laugh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not worth the paper it&rsquo;s written on. Here is the Colonel&rsquo;s  signature, but there are no witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you see that do you,&rdquo; said Frisco with a chuckle, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so. But I tell you  that if my milksop had married the girl&mdash;my fool-son Robin I mean&mdash;there would  have been witnesses, and the will would have been proved in law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; said Stephen who sat down again with a recovered colour, &ldquo;well, even  if this will had have been genuine I should not have minded. There is no one I  would give the money to sooner than Dr. Herrick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stuff  and nonsense!&rdquo; cried Jim, although he reddened with pleasure at this tribute of  friendship, &ldquo;as if I or Bess would have taken a penny of it. Oh! I see what  your game was Frisco. You wanted Robin to marry Bess, and then you would have  got witnesses to this will, and taken the money from Stephen. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is so,&rdquo; rejoined Frisco leaning back, &ldquo;as the fool could not get the girl, I  tried the other plan of stopping Marsh going to the vault. That failed because  of you Dr. Herrick. If it had not been for you I&rsquo;d have had that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  confess your villainies very coolly,&rdquo; said Marsh-Carr sharply, &ldquo;do you know  that I can lay you by the heels for that assault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no you can&rsquo;t. T&rsquo;was Santiago struck you. You can&rsquo;t prove that I had anything to  do with it. And,&rdquo; said Frisco impudently, &ldquo;you would not if you could.  Remember, I held my tongue about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes,&rdquo; said Stephen hastily, &ldquo;it was good of you to say nothing about my unhappy  mother. I am so far indebted to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve come about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked Jim sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord!  Doc, you ain&rsquo;t half sharp enough. I want the Squire here to give me a thousand  pounds to start afresh. I and Robin are going back to the States, and we want  something to begin life on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is only fair,&rdquo; put in Stephen eagerly, &ldquo;I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a bit,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;let us hear on what grounds Frisco asks you to do this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  was quite ready to show grounds. &ldquo;Well in the first place I held my tongue  about Mrs. Marsh firing at the dead body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I owe you something for that,&rdquo; said Stephen flushing and wincing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the second,&rdquo; said Frisco raising his finger. &ldquo;I brought you that will  unwitnessed so that you can still keep the money. If Robin had got the girl I  shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. My name as one witness and Santiago as another, and  where would you be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Santiago  was never in this house,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;and a will has to be signed when the  testator and the witnesses are together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;d have arranged all that. My own signature you could not dispute as I was  Carr&rsquo;s right-hand man. I&rsquo;d have paid Santiago half a year&rsquo;s income to sign. He&rsquo;d  have done it like a shot. And the will would have stood any test then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true enough,&rdquo; said Herrick reflectively, &ldquo;so long as the Colonel&rsquo;s signature  was right the rest was easy. Where did you get this will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was on his table. He must have been fooling with it when the old woman  Petronella shot him. It was about this will that Mrs. Marsh made such a fuss,  only she thought the money was to be left to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  You let that out yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being  drunk,&rdquo; said Frisco with a laugh, &ldquo;well I took away the will and afterwards  thought to use it, by marrying Robin to Bess Endicotte. But you see Mr. Marsh,&rdquo;  he added turning to Stephen, &ldquo;I did not have the witnesses names put, so you  keep the money instead of handing it over to Miss Bess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whether  he had done so or not,&rdquo; cried Dr. Jim hotly, &ldquo;Bess would not have taken it. The  money is rightfully Stephen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  That brings me to the third point,&rdquo; said Frisco unmoved, &ldquo;I worked for that  money. I went through hot and cold and danger to get it. Half of it should have  been mine. But Carr had the whip hand of me, so I&rsquo;m out of it. Now gentlemen, I  know where that c&acirc;che is. If you&rsquo;ll give me a thousand to fit out an expedition  we&rsquo;ll cry quits. I and Robin are going to get more treasure. Carr didn&rsquo;t take  away the lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  remember that the Indians are warned,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;they have very likely  removed the rest of the jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I&rsquo;ve got to find out,&rdquo; said Frisco, &ldquo;and Robin is coming along with me to  be made a man of. Well, these three points, Mr. Marsh, are clear enough. I  ought to have half the money, but as you have the upper hand, I ask a thousand  pounds&mdash;as my right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  certainly think you are entitled to that much,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;what do you say,  Herrick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  with you, Steve. Give him the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Frisco  chuckled while Stephen wrote out a cheque for the amount. When the ex-sailor  placed it in his pocket he stood up to go. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with  some sort of emotion, &ldquo;I thank you for this treatment. You are both white men.  I have behaved badly, but this makes all square. I can tell you one thing, Mr.  Marsh, that you will have no further trouble about the money. Even if the  Indians knew, they would do nothing to you, now that Carr has gone. As to the  plan, I daresay his body by this time is&mdash;well no matter. I go out of your life  gentlemen, so does Robin&mdash;to be made a man of. There remains Santiago. He won&rsquo;t  trouble you. I&rsquo;m going to shoot him when I drop across him in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can do what you like there, Frisco. I daresay another crime won&rsquo;t matter much to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t be a crime but an act of justice. He played me a dirty trick, Dr.  Herrick. However, I&rsquo;m off. You won&rsquo;t shake hands so I don&rsquo;t offer. So long  gentlemen both,&rdquo; said Frisco walking towards the door, &ldquo;and may you live long  and be happy. As to that devil Carr&mdash;&rdquo; Frisco spat and then departed. They  never saw him again.</p>
  <p>A  year later information came through a newspaper, stating the fate of an  expedition that had gone into the interior of Peru. The Indians of the  Cordilleras had attacked the camp and the three white men who led the  expedition were killed. Their names were Joyce, alias Frisco, his son Robin,  and a Mexican called Santiago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Robin,&rdquo; said Herrick when he read this to his wife, &ldquo;he was a mean little  scoundrel, but I&rsquo;m sorry that he came to such an end. As to Santiago, Frisco  must have made it up with him and taken him to look after the treasure. Well,  the whole three are dead. Let us forget them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this is anticipating. On the evening of the day when Frisco appeared, Stephen announced  to the assembled Biffs that Dr. Herrick intended to accept half the income of  the wicked Colonel with the permission of Bess. Jim was on his feet at once. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  he cried, very red, &ldquo;I intend to do nothing of the sort. What rubbish are you  talking, Steve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only ask Bess to read this paper,&rdquo; said Stephen and gave Bess the incomplete  will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  true,&rdquo; replied Herrick, &ldquo;it is only fair that she should decide for herself.  But I&rsquo;ll have no part in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Colonel going to leave his money to me,&rdquo; cried Bess, &ldquo;well I never heard such  nonsense Stephen. As if I would take a penny from you, or Ida.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told you so,&rdquo; cried Dr. Jim triumphantly, &ldquo;I knew Bess would think the same as  I. Hurrah! Bess, kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this a proper will, Steve?&rdquo; asked Ida looking at the paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Frisco brought it here to-day to cause trouble. But as you see there are no  witnesses, so it is not valid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  yet you want to offer me half the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it, Bess,&rdquo; cried Ida, &ldquo;I am sure Stephen and I can live well on four thousand a  year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bess, &ldquo;these were the Colonel&rsquo;s intentions&mdash;very kind I&rsquo;m sure.  But even if the will were legal I should not accept. Jim, am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  right, darling. You and I will make our own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all nonsense,&rdquo; said Stephen, &ldquo;you must take some money. It is only fair that  the Colonel&rsquo;s intentions should be respected in some way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a great deal of argument. Finally Bess and Dr. Herrick agreed to take one  thousand a year for life. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Ida kissing her sister, &ldquo;I hope that is  all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now Jim will go away,&rdquo; said Stephen gloomily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  until the year&rsquo;s end, and until the money is firmly in your possession,&rdquo; was  the reply of the doctor, &ldquo;remember you have some months&rsquo; visits to pay to that  vault. Even though Frisco has gone we must carry out the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  at the end of the year?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  establish myself in practice somewhere,&rdquo; said Dr. Herrick, &ldquo;perhaps in  Beorminster so as to be near you. Bess can then go on writing for the &lsquo;Weekly  Chronicle.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I shall write a novel,&rdquo; cried Bess, &ldquo;I want a London fame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  so it was settled. For a year Herrick remained at &ldquo;The Pines&rdquo; with the Squire.  Then there was a double wedding. Ida and Stephen came back to live in the  Wicked Colonel&rsquo;s house, and Dr. Herrick and his bride established himself in a  comfortable mansion in Beorminster. He became immensely popular, and also  having married into a county family, he was much sought after by the county  invalids. Frank and Sidney were left at Biffstead and Flo came home to keep  house for them.</p>
  <p>The  Rev. Pentland Corn gave up his charge of the Parish, and went out to the East  as a missionary. No one could understand the reason for this folly&mdash;as they  called it&mdash;save Herrick. He understood only too well, and his was the last hand  Pentland Corn clasped when he left England for India. His place was taken by a  young and amiable rector, who will probably marry Flo Endicotte. Then Frank  will have to keep the house himself or marry in self-defence.</p>
  <p>As  to Sidney, the queer boy. Herrick took that young gentleman in hand and tried  to make him a healthy man. He made him ride, shoot, swim, and indulge in all  manner of out-of-door sports. At first Sidney rebelled, but as he was really  fond of Herrick he began to take kindly to the regime. The consequence was he  became more of a boy in a few months, and actually began to eat meat. Herrick  watched over him with the greatest care and gradually Sidney lost his  unpleasant faculty of &ldquo;seeing things.&rdquo; He went to college, and there he now is,  becoming rapidly more of a normal person. Once he met with a Theosophist who  told him, after hearing his story, that he had sunk the spirit in the flesh and  blamed Herrick severely. In fact, this gentleman took a journey to Saxham to  see and expostulate with Herrick on the wickedness of debasing the psychic  gifts of the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would rather see him a healthy man,&rdquo; said the doctor impatiently, &ldquo;in what you  say there may be a good deal. But the boy is now in better health and easier to  live with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  you do not deserve to have such a person in the family,&rdquo; said the theosophist, &ldquo;but  your work will not endure for ever. You have made Mr. Endicotte eat meat, and  materialised him. But in a few years he will recover his gift. It will be  stronger than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I hope he won&rsquo;t come here,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;I have every respect for persons so  gifted, but I don&rsquo;t like them. To have one at your elbow, who sees into the  future and foretells death, and is always seeing creatures of the air is  horrible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a sceptic, Dr. Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I think there are many things of which we know nothing&mdash;I mean in regard to  what we talk about. But for my part I want to do my duty in this life and leave  all these occult things to people who like them. I should like my  brother-in-law to act likewise. However, he is in good health now, and I should  be sorry to see him relapse into the state he was when I first met him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thereupon  the Theosophist sighed and departed. All the same he is keeping a watch over  Sidney, and should the boy again develope the clairvoyant faculty, he will be  made better use of, by those who understand.</p>
  <p>And  then a happy day came when in Stephen&rsquo;s arms was placed a boy. Bess Herrick  placed him therein. &ldquo;Do you know who this is?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  son and heir,&rdquo; replied Stephen, bending over the infant, &ldquo;what else, or who  else should he be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first the very first really innocent creature who has been in this house for  close upon a century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is complimentary to us all Bess,&rdquo; said her husband who had entered the room, &ldquo;but  what if he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bess  looked solemn. &ldquo;I think he is the guardian angel of Ida and Steve, to keep away  the evil spirit of Colonel Carr.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now Bess, you are not like Sidney. You have not seen&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen nothing Jim. But the village people are already making a legend about  the Wicked Colonel. They say he walks. I hope, now that this innocent child is  here, that they will leave off inventing such horrid things. I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;The  Pines&rsquo; to have the reputation of being haunted. And you know how stories grow,  Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know this,&rdquo; replied Dr. Herrick, &ldquo;that Carr was murdered in a room which has  vanished into thin air. If his ghost walks anywhere it must be in the Pine  wood. There is no call for him to haunt this place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some  one repeated this saying of Herrick&rsquo;s, and what he had said in jest was spoken  of in earnest. In a few months it was commonly reported that the Wicked Colonel  had been seen in the Pine wood, surrounded with a red glow, significant of the  habitation his spirit, for its sins, dwelt in. In vain more sensible people  laughed at this tale. It came to be firmly believed in, and it was said that  when any misfortune was about to befall the Marsh-Carr family, that the shade  of the Colonel appeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the penalty of greatness,&rdquo; said Dr. Jim to Stephen, &ldquo;a county family is not  really respectable until it has its private ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  in this way Wicked Colonel Carr became a tradition.</p>
