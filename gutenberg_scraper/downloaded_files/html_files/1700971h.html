<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="first">DIZZY LAINE, baptised Paul Disraeli Laine, crime
expert of the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> refers to
Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer's most celebrated case under the
title of "Saul and the Spinster."</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer blushes, insofar as any Inspector of Police,
be he English or Australian, can be said to blush.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dizzy Laine, nee Eva Poulton, and once subject of
Inspector Murmer's official suspicions, laughs gently and
slightly; Miss Paddy Burke, a young lady who figures rather
intimately in the case, matches the Inspector, blush for blush,
glancing furtively at a certain young gentleman who appears
incapable of proceeding more than six linear yards from her
side.</p>

<p>There appears to be some doubt as to the exact point when
Inspector Murmer first came in contact with Miss Mathilde
Westways, the well known Sydney <i>modiste</i>, owner of
"Florabella" and&mdash;the Spinster in the case.</p>

<p>Official records indicate that the investigation was not
allotted to Inspector Murmer by his superior officer,
Superintendent George Dixon. Dizzy Laine voices the popular
theory when he states that the case did not become official until
just before Inspector Murmer discovered the solution of his
problem; that the famous detective became involved in the matter
through a very reprehensible habit he had acquired of frequenting
notorious night-clubs when free from official duties.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer retorts that journalists of the "Dizzy"
persuasion should be confined in "unnamed" places when police
matters are under discussion. Dizzy is rather too fond of
referring to the affair; his wife prettily matronly and with her
husband in complete subjection, sometimes bars discussions. Dizzy
obeys, with a grin; to intimate friends he confides that his
spouse shows no such reticence in the privacy of the connubial
chamber, there frequently speculating when "it" will take place,
and whether "Florabella" will be converted into a limited
liability company with Inspector Murmer's term of exchange
expires, and he returns to the ugly red-brick building on the
Thames Embankment, named New Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>So much will serve to introduce the leading honest characters
in what can be claimed to be the most extraordinary case
Inspector Murmer handled during his sojourn in Australia. Lacking
the Inspector's official reports for this narrative, Dizzy
Laine's rather highly-coloured journalese and personal
reminiscences have been taken as a basis, amplified by Miss Paddy
Burke's retrospective suggestions. Both authorities declare the
curtain to rise at the Green Lagoon night-club&mdash;and Miss
Mathilde Westways raises no objections to this.</p>

<p>SAUL MURMER left Police Headquarters shortly after five
o'clock on the 6th day of September, 1931. Passing through the
big gates to Central-lane, he nodded recognition of the salute
from the constable on duty, and walked up to Castlereagh Street.
There he mounted a city-bound tram, and alighted at King Street.
A short interval spent in shopping, and he boarded a car for
King's Cross. A few yards along Darlinghurst-road from the tram
stop he entered a block of flats and ascended in the elevator to
his own quarters. A shower and a change, and he went down to the
restaurant in the building and dined.</p>

<p>This daily routine well performed, he returned to his
sitting-room and gave his exclusive attention to that day's
newspapers. This last duty, in the mind of Inspector Murmer, was
as essential as his dinner. He considered newspapers mines of
information, especially regarding the activities of his frailer
fellow-men. Many times the Inspector had speculated, sitting in
the comfortable armchair fitting his rotund figure so perfectly,
that if criminals realised the dangers of the publicity they
sought in vanity, the tasks of magistrates, judges and juries
would be considerably lighter, while the police force, and
especially the detective branch, would be vastly overworked.</p>

<p>A little after eight o'clock Saul Murmer stacked his
newspapers neatly on a side table and went to the house
telephone. For some moments he lingered, the receiver to his ear,
listening to the bell ringing in Inspector John Pater's flat, in
the same building. He realised that John Pater was not at home,
and a few seconds later thanked the switch-girl for conveying
that information to him verbally. He went to his bedroom and
arrayed himself in the conventional evening attire of the
Englishman the world over.</p>

<p>Descending to the main hall of the building, he paused at the
office window, and again inquired regarding Inspector Pater. He
was told that the officer had not yet returned home, and sighed.
He had a feeling that he deserved companionship&mdash;and had
elected John Pater victim. Now he would have to find
entertainment for himself. He strolled out to the pavement and
acknowledged the inquiring eye of an alert taxi-driver with a
brief nod.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?" asked the man when Saul Murmer was
comfortably ensconced in the car. The Inspector pondered. Now he
wondered why he had arrayed himself for the evening. Had he done
so because he anticipated John Pater as companion to one of the
gilded halls of Sydney entertainment? That might be correct. But
John Pater was not with him. If he had anticipated being left to
his own resources, would he have troubled to dress, or would he
have arrayed his ample figure in a simple lounge suit and
indulged himself in a stroll through one of Sydney's quieter
suburbs, speculating on the houses and the people he passed in
the past, similar strolls had proved profitable to his
reputation.</p>

<p>"Try the Green Lagoon," decided, after a considerable
pause.</p>

<p>"The Green Lagoon. Yes, sir." The man closed the car door and
trotted round the vehicle to his seat. A moment, and the car
joined the stream of traffic heading city-wards.</p>

<p>Outside the noted night-club a commissionaire who gave the
impression that he had recently resigned the field-marshalship of
a South American army, deigned to open the car-door, saluting
smartly. Saul Murmer alighted and descended the long flight of
softly-carpeted stairs beyond the gaily illuminated doorway, to
the lounge of the nightclub. There he was received by a severely
garbed head-waiter, who bowed and preceded his important guest to
a table set in a coveted corner of the large supper-room; an
advantageous corner from which a full view of the dancing floor
and the adjacent tables could be obtained.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer was well known at the Green Lagoon, and his
partiality for this particular table understood and acquiesced
in. Hardly had the Inspector arranged his ample form to the
chair, held by the head waiter, than the table waiter appeared at
his elbow, carrying in a cradle basket a dirt-encrusted bottle,
partly shrouded by a very white napkin.</p>

<p>"Expecting m'sieu, I took the liberty of ordering a bottle of
wine," announced the waiter in a soft whisper.</p>

<p>"And pubs shut at six&mdash;or should!" commented Saul Murmer.
"The lowly navvy goes home thirsty, while we, in these glided
haunts of vice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir." The head waiter, who had been standing close by, looked
shocked&mdash;insofar as a valued client could shock a
well-trained head waiter.</p>

<p>"Never mind," decided the detective. "I will have a glass. I
have an idea I telephoned the order for wine this morning."</p>

<p>"M'sieu remembers!" agreed the night-club official, with a
beaming smile.</p>

<p>"But didn't I order two bottles? I shouldn't be surprised if I
had not," continued the stout Inspector. "If John Pater turns up,
I shall certainly want them. His thirst&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Supper, m'sieu?" A menu slid discreetly on the cloth before
the detective.</p>

<p>"Ten-thirty." Saul Murmer accepted the silver pencil tendered,
and ticked off a series of dishes, "Um-m! I think that will
do."</p>

<p>"M'sieu performs admirably," applauded the man. Suddenly the
Inspector found himself alone at the table, a glass of wine
beaming benevolently up at him&mdash;and the intriguing bottle
reposing in its cradle to one side.</p>

<p>Again settling himself comfortably in his chair, and savouring
his first sip of the wine, Saul Murmer glanced about the room,
discreetly lit to a dusky evening glow that partially hid,
partially revealed, the few tables yet occupied. So far as his
inquisition showed he had no acquaintances in the place. He did
not want them for the moment; certainly not the usual
acquaintances one makes at a night-club.</p>

<p>John Pater might follow him, although he had not left word of
his destination at the flat-offices. Dizzy Laine might arrive; he
and Mrs. Laine often danced. There were a few more whose company
he might welcome, and the rest&mdash;His wandering eye came to a
table on the opposite side of the dancing floor.</p>

<p>At it was seated a lady of middle age, very well dressed and
preserving many of the charms of her youth, with an old-world air
of dignity and reserve.</p>

<p>"Fine woman," thought Saul Murmer, who was himself comfortably
fleshed. "Apparently plenty of money; plenty of brains, too, Good
business head. Someone's wife having a lonesome night out?
No."</p>

<p>He had caught sight of a ringless left hand. "Spinster! Now
what&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady looked in his direction, and Saul Murmer quickly
resumed his scrutiny of the room. He feared the lady might be
embarrassed if she found him staring at her.</p>

<p>"Though," thought the Inspector, "she is not the sort to show
embarrassment at anything not entirely out of the ordinary; more
likely to call the head waiter and send him with a message for me
to abate the nuisance!"</p>

<p>He chuckled. "And I a detective-Inspector of Police!"</p>

<p>Automatically his eyes returned to the lady's table. To his
astonishment he found that she was looking at him, and that
without a shade of embarrassment. Their eyes met for an instant
and, to the detective's amazement, the lady made a beckoning
gesture with her fan&mdash;a fan that glittered in the pale
greenish twilight that flooded the hall.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer hesitated, doubtful if the lady's signal was
intended for him. The gesture, slight and imperative, was
repeated. The Inspector covered a sudden grin.</p>

<p>"A pick-up! I am surprised" he muttered. "Naughty! Does she
realise that I'm a police officer? What a shock I'd be! But, who
knows. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer's greatest grievance against Fate swept on
him again with renewed force. He was totally unlike what a
detective should be, in real life or in fiction. He was short;
when he had joined the metropolitan police force he had barely
topped the height standard, while succeeding years had,
apparently, taken from those scanty inches. Girth had come to
him, in spite of exercise and a pathetic devotion to patent
reducing drugs. Big baby-blue, innocent-staring eyes looked out
from a round face of girlish-textured skin, requiring but slight
attention from the morning razor. His nose was small and, on the
authority of an old schoolmate, now Chief-Inspector Murchison, of
the "pug" variety. A well-formed chin was topped by a set of lips
that might have been taken as a model of the perfect Cupid's bow;
and they were red, as if lip-sticked.</p>

<p>He was not a detective; not in appearance. Saul Murmer's ideal
detective stood five feet ten inches; had a slim body, of the
strength and flexibility of whalebone; a sun-weathered
countenance; and thin, hard lips that held dexterity in rolling
black, rank cigars from side to side of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Inspector came out of his reverie to find Luke Lenoire,
<i>mâitre d'hôtel</i> of the Green Lagoon, silently awaiting his
pleasure; before him on a small silver tray, lay a plainly
engraved visiting card.</p>

<p>"Madame's compliments, and she will be grateful if m'sieu will
give her a few minutes of his most valuable time," said the man
gravely.</p>

<p>"A pick-up!" The Inspector puckered his full, red lips
impishly. "Do you allow that sort of thing in your gilded halls
of vice, Luke?"</p>

<p>"M'sieu jests." The man smiled. "Madame is well-known at the
Green Lagoon, and is of the most discreet."</p>

<p>The Inspector glanced at the card before him. "Miss Mathilde
Westways," he read.</p>

<p>"Luke&mdash;" he paused. "Yes, Luke, will you inform Madame I
shall have the pleasure of attending her&mdash;in a few moments,
when I recover from the shock, in a few moments?" The <i>mâitre
d'hôtel</i> bowed, and faded into the gloom of the synthetic
evening.</p>

<p>A minute, and he reappeared on the opposite side of the
dance-floor. Miss Westways glanced up quickly, smiled and nodded.
At the sign of approval the Inspector struggled to his feet and
ambled across to the opposite table. Before the lady he halted
and bowed, regretting that he had not Luke Lenoire's supple
figure and easy, practised obeisance.</p>

<p>"Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer." Miss Westways' voice was
low, sweet and assured. "We have never been introduced, I
believe, but&mdash;" she hesitated. "Really, this is most
embarrassing."</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion came to the detective's mind. "Shall we
name this interview 'official,' Miss Westways?" he asked; in very
official tones. "You will understand, police inspectors on duty
don't wait for introductions."</p>

<p>"How nice of you," beamed the lady, obviously relieved. "May I
assume that Mr. Paul Disraeli Laine has informed you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paul Disraeli&mdash;" Saul Murmer stuttered in amazement.
"Oh, you mean Dizzy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is even better." Miss Westways was now entirely at
ease. "May I understand that Dizzy has informed you of my trouble
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your trouble, Miss Westways&mdash;" The detective showed his
perplexity. "What trouble?"</p>

<p>"My dilemma, yes, Inspector." Miss Westways interrupted,
speaking in matter-of-fact tones. "Someone is threatening my
life."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="first">"PLEASE sit down, Inspector." Miss Westways
indicated the chair on the opposite side of the-table.</p>

<p>"Thank you." Saul Murmer felt he was in need of a seat. It was
not a strange experience for the Inspector to be informed by
individuals that their lives were threatened. Investigation
usually showed that the facts did not agree with conclusions, in
spite of the wealth of details accompanying the complaints.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer smiled, recalling the case of Sir Abbeyford
Aldersham, who almost caused the resignation of a Chief
Constable, gave sleepless nights to a number of hard-working
policemen, and agitated the press of England. A solution of the
threatening letters was only obtained when, enraged by the
authorities' refusal to arrest his nephew and heir, Sir Abbeyford
turned his hitherto unsuspected abilities as a letter-writer to
an anonymous attack on the Chief Constable of his county.</p>

<p>A movement at his elbow caused him to look up. Henri was
standing close beside him, his brows well-defined interrogation
marks. The detective nodded and the man disappeared, to return
almost immediately with the cradled bottle and glasses.</p>

<p>"If I may be permitted, Miss Westways." The Inspector lifted
his glass, watching the bubbles rise through the amber liquid. He
felt he needed that drink; had already earned it. He drank
delicately.</p>

<p>"You were saying, Miss Westways&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I believe that my life is being threatened." The lady
repeated her statement gravely; then laughed. "No doubt you think
I am mad, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Not at all." Saul Murmer was polite and abstractly truthful.
If the lady had said "unbalanced" he would have been forced to
silence, or untruthfulness. "Er&mdash;quite a number of people's
lives have been threatened at times."</p>

<p>"And yet live out their numbered days. Is that what you
intended to say, Inspector?" Miss Westways laughed gently. "You
were implying that I have no reason to worry&mdash;yet you have
no knowledge of the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Is there a case&mdash;" The Inspector appeared to be
addressing the tablecloth. He glanced furtively at the woman on
the other side of the table. Somewhere in the forties, he
decided; then flushed. He suddenly remembered that he was
forty-six. And&mdash;she was wonderfully attractive! Brown hair,
with a few peeping grey hairs that lent an illusion of moon-halo;
a fair skin bearing just the right amount of make-up to perfect
its attractiveness; a well-developed body, its charms accentuated
by a dark grey dress that softly whispered "Paris"&mdash;and worn
with that exclusive accent so rarely seen outside the city of
feminine authority. And the card the <i>mâitre d'hôtel</i> had
brought him had borne in one corner a single, quoted word.</p>

<p>No address was needed. Even essentially masculine Police
Headquarters knew of "Florabella," the Mecca of every Australian
woman&mdash;the leading <i>modiste</i> establishment of
Sydney.</p>

<p>"So many people desire death!" Saul Murmer looked up, his full
girlish lips parted in a smile, the baby-stare eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>"Not for themselves, but for those they
consider&mdash;er&mdash;redundant. Their reasons? Mainly an
overworked inferiority complex! Er&mdash;you were saying, Miss
Westways&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady smiled; the exclusively feminine smile how far
from gods they may be.</p>

<p>"You think I am&mdash;er&mdash;unbalanced, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Miss Westways." The detective hastened to refute
the idea. "I have admired the cool, collected manner in which
you&mdash;er&mdash;discuss their&mdash;er&mdash;threat." He
paused helplessly.</p>

<p>Miss Westways went to his rescue.</p>

<p>"Why should I be flurried and distressed?" A note of asperity
came in her voice. "In a business matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blackmail?" Saul Murmer nodded, speaking in a whisper. "In a
sense, yes." Mathilde Westways also nodded.</p>

<p>"I have received messages."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Inspector Murmer sighed. He liked documentary evidence,
especially in a blackmailing ease. "And the letters&mdash;"</p>

<p>Not wishing to embarrass the lady in the disclosures he now
believed to be inevitable, Saul Murmer had half-turned from the
table and was staring down the room in the direction of the
entrance. Suddenly he stiffened slightly, then laughed. All he
had seen was Mrs. Laine entering the room preceding a brilliantly
dark young girl and her husband.</p>

<p>Eva Laine saw Miss Westways and the Inspector directly they
entered the room. She waved gaily, crossing the room directly to
their table. Saul Murmer watched the group form, somewhat
relieved that his <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Miss Westways had been
interrupted. He had started the evening with thoughts
anticipating enjoyment. Apparently he had been slated for
disillusionment. John Pater had let him down, and Miss Westways
had shown decided signs of repeating the performance.</p>

<p>Eva Laine's appearance suggested relief; beside the most
perfect dancing floor in Sydney she would permit nothing that
savoured of serious life. In regard to the blackmailing letters,
Saul Murmer decided that he could obtain them from Miss Westways
at some other interview. He felt suddenly elated at the thought
of another interview with this fascinating lady.</p>

<p>"Room for three more?" Eva called gaily as she came to the
table.</p>

<p>"Only myself, a husband, a little girl. Auntie Westways, may I
introduce your niece in a perfectly perfect new 'Florabella'
gown."</p>

<p>The young girl curtsied deeply, spreading out the voluminous
skirts of the lovely red frock. "Isn't it adorable, Mattie. I
couldn't resist it this afternoon." She swung with a flurry of
flounces and frills on the waiting detective, holding out her
hand frankly. "You're Dizzy's friend, Inspector Murmer, aren't,
you? I'm not going to say 'Pleased to meet you', for that would
make Eva jealous; she looks on you as her own, private,
particular lion, guaranteed to roar for her alone. She's awfully
mean, even with her husband! Why, this afternoon she wouldn't
even let me kiss him&mdash;and haven't kissed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paddy!" Miss Westways' tones were very firm.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mattie." Paddy's voice was suddenly meek. "Oh, the
frock! I did tell Miss Lancing to put it down to my account,
truly! And I haven't had a frock for ages and ages. And I haven't
a rag&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's hardly a rag this side, Paddy," said Dizzy
judicially. He was standing behind the girl.</p>

<p>"Pig." Paddy turned on the journalist. "For that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paddy, are you aware your allowance is sadly overdrawn."
Mathilde Westways spoke softly, a twinkle of affection in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"So is the national exchequer, if the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>
financial expert is telling the truth," observed Dizzy
lazily.</p>

<p>"Then Paddy's allowance account looks like a diminutive
national exchequer," laughed Eva. "She came to me the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Telling tales, out of school!" The girl shook her black
curls. "For that&mdash;Dizzy, you shall dance with me, and if you
kiss me in that dark corner by the band I won't even bleat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you children!" Miss Westways reproved. "There's plenty of
time to dance. Sit down, all of you!"</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine pulled out a chair for his wife, glancing from the
Inspector to the table, which Henri was busily setting for
supper. "Who wouldn't be a Detective-Inspector of Police?" he
said lugubriously. "Eva, you made a mistake when you picked a
journalist for a soul-mate. You should have sought a police
officer; they can afford the material joys of life&mdash;wine,
women and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eva! If Dizzy sings I shall go straight home," said Paddy
explosively.</p>

<p>"For your sins, Murmer&mdash;" The newspaper man grinned.
"Paddy, for your and his sins, you shall sit next your latest
'nice' man. Good! Now, perhaps I shall have one evening's
quietness amid a torrid desert of dancing nights. Miss Westways,
please extend your well-known abilities as a chaperone to protect
me from the evil designs I see glittering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;and a chaperon!" Paddy's pretty lips curled
scornfully. She moved into the chair next the Inspector. "Please
don't take any notice of Dizzy, Inspector."</p>

<p>"I don't." Emphasis empressed the detective's voice. "He is a
newspaper man&mdash;one of those annoyances, like mosquitoes,
ants, and other things, sent to try us good people."</p>

<p>The girl clapped her hands. "So you know him as well as
that!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, she spoke across the table to
Miss Westways. "Mattie, what do you think of my dress? It's one
of yours, you know."</p>

<p>She turned quickly to Saul Murmer. "I mean, it came out of her
shop&mdash;not her wardrobe."</p>

<p>"Paddy!" expostulated Miss Westways.</p>

<p>"We all have them," retorted the young girl defensively.
"Wardrobes, I mean; though sometimes they're more a deficit than
an asset."</p>

<p>The elder lady sighed, though the shadow of a smile hovered at
the corners of her lips.</p>

<p>"That is why we named her Paddy," explained Dizzy carefully.
"Because of her peculiar ability to say the wrong thing at the
right moment."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Burke Irish?" asked Saul Murmer, with very apparent
innocence.</p>

<p>"Only by etymological adoption." explained Eva. "By birth she
is a Jewess. I have a suspicion that her Irish veneer was induced
by a frantic, but hopeless, passion for Dizzy."</p>

<p>"Gott in&mdash;" Dizzy leaned back in his chair limply.</p>

<p>"Eva!" Paddy's high, clear voice rose above the murmur of
laughter. "Why will you not respect my girlish confidences? Now
he will pester me to run away with him, but I won't go unless you
come, too."</p>

<p>With the quick turn of thought characteristic of her, she
turned to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I'm quite thrilled to sit next to you, Mr.
Murmer. Please tell me what you and Mattie were discussing before
we came. My sins?"</p>

<p>"Nothing so important, Paddy," replied Miss Westways quickly.
"I was telling Inspector Murmer of those strange missives I have
received lately."</p>

<p>"Aren't they thrilling!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Saul Murmer guardedly.</p>

<p>"He uses lovely notepaper&mdash;the kind you get at
Salfvalley's for sixpence a dozen sheets, and violet ink," the
girl continued. "But he can't match colours, or draw, not a weeny
bit."</p>

<p>"Sounds interesting," observed Dizzy. "Why haven't I heard of
these love-letters before?"</p>

<p>"Because you're dangerous," retorted the girl. "Eva says you
wrote up your own wedding for the newspapers, and then sent them
bills for the 'news' at space rates."</p>

<p>"Well, it cost a lot to marry Eva," said the journalist
defensively. "I had to get it back somehow. Wait until you are
married&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll do my own publicity, thank you." Paddy turned her
well-defined nose up. "Besides&mdash;I shall never
marry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that a vow of celibacy&mdash;or a hint at something
improper? As a good Jewess you're an anti-assimilationist, and I
haven't forgotten that Theo is a heathen
Gen&mdash;<i>ough</i>!"</p>

<p>Dizzy broke off suddenly, bending and rubbing his shin.</p>

<p>"But what of those letters?" asked Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>"They're not proper letters," interposed Paddy before Miss
Westways could speak. She added, hastily: "I don't mean they're
improper, as Dizzy understands it, only they're drawings, not
words."</p>

<p>Eva Laine lifted her glass and sipped meditatively. "Paddy, I
do happen to know this is your first glass of wine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had a cocktail with Theo when we had dinner at Prince's!"
exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"Do modern University students run to cocktails and dinners at
Prince's?" asked Dizzy. "Why wasn't I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have married you if you had been," Eva laughed.
"Theo is a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"University student," completed her husband.</p>

<p>"He's a B.A.," announced Paddy complacently. "And his father
has oceans of money."</p>

<p>"You can't, really, Paddy," protested Dizzy, in mock
alarm.</p>

<p>"Eva did," replied the girl darkly.</p>

<p>"Eva's a Gentile," defended the journalist.</p>

<p>"She assimilated you&mdash;and looks as if she's had mental
indigestion ever since!" Paddy put in her thrust triumphantly.
She turned to her aunt. "What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"You are talking too much." Miss Westways hesitated. "Our new
generation is so... so...."</p>

<p>"We don't want brains," drawled Dizzy "We've got
wireless."</p>

<p>"But what of those letters?" asked Saul Murmer inquisitively,
when the laughter had died down. Miss Westways opened her bag and
took out a thick mauve envelope. She handed it to the
detective.</p>

<p>The police officer took it delicately and extracted a folded
sheet of mauve paper. He spread it open on the tablecloth. The
paper was of fair quality, matching the envelope. On it had been
drawn, in violet ink, a crude illustration of a box. There was no
other mark on the paper.</p>

<p>For some moments Saul Murmer examined the drawing in silence.
A strange, creepy feeling grew on him. He could not suppress the
idea that the sketch was intended to represent a coffin. He
fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and produced a very thick
monocle. Screwing this into his left eye, he bent again to the
paper.</p>

<p>"Isn't that dinky?" Paddy clasped her hands admiringly. "Mr.
Murmer, when we're married I shall insist on your always wearing
a monocle."</p>

<p>"While you wear his bracelets," suggested Dizzy,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Not his kind," retorted the girl with a little shiver.
"If you please, I'll choose my own. I hate bracelets to match,
except on the same wrist."</p>

<p>She paused, a sudden thought striking her, and touched the
engrossed Inspector on the arm. "Mr. Murmer, please lend me your
handcuffs."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;what?" Saul Murmer looked up astonished.</p>

<p>"Your handcuffs, please. Don't tell me you haven't brought
them!" Paddy was growing excited. "Mattie! I've got a simply
gorgeous idea! A new fashion! Oh&mdash;it's a wow! A real
humdinger! Listen, all of you!" Her excited hands swept over the
table, nearly sending several glasses to destruction. "Sorry,
dears; but this is important! I've found a new fashion. Listen!
Listen!"</p>

<p>"Quiet, darling!" Dizzy spoke soothingly. "You'll tell the
world, and then Miss Westways won't be able to make a million or
two out of it."</p>

<p>"It's great! It's a booster-boost; the king of wiggle-boys!"
In her excitement Paddy rose to her feet. "Listen! I'm going to
get a pair of silver handcuffs made, and wear them."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" Dizzy lifted pious hands. "My cigarettes and
your aunt's purse will at last be safe."</p>

<p>"Not on different wrists, silly-darling," Paddy patronised.
"Both on the same arm. Isn't it great, Eva? We'll set a new
fashion, and Mattie shall pay us well for the idea, and
advertising it&mdash;and then I won't have any deficit for you to
worry about. And I can have all the frocks I want. Eva, I saw a
perfect dream of a dance-fr&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sans back, tight-fitting breastplate in front, a bewildering
mass of frills and furbelows at foot, to twine and twist round a
poor man's ankles&mdash;" complemented Dizzy.</p>

<p>"Poor men don't come to expensive night-clubs," chided the
girl.</p>

<p>"Journalists are taken to nightclubs by wives&mdash;and
they're poor men," defended the newspaper-man. "But go to it,
Paddy. It you can show Eva how to relieve the deficit in the
domestic budget, I'm all for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's Theo!"</p>

<p>In a moment the girl was running down the room to greet a
tall, blonde young man, standing, just inside the doorway, a
somewhat vacant look on his round, pleasant face.</p>

<p>"Wireless triumphant over brains," observed Dizzy, somewhat
disparagingly.</p>

<p>"You're jealous. He's only typical," retorted Eva. "He's
working for his M.A."</p>

<p>"Or his father is." Dizzy was in one of his obstinate moods,
determined to have the last word.</p>

<p>From the half-lights appeared Henri and a subordinate waiter,
carrying laden trays. Inspector Murmer folded the mauve
notepaper, replaced it in its envelope, and slipped it into his
pocket. He sat back, to watch Paddy Burke approach the table, her
hand in the crook of the tall youth's arm.</p>

<p>"Here's Theo&mdash;Theo Manning, people," announced the girl.
"Henri, we shall want another chair, please. Sit up tight, for
Theo's going to sit with us. Now, Mattie, no scowls. If you
frighten him away to another table, I shall go, too&mdash;and
that will shock all your Early Victorian minds."</p>

<p>"The feminine Victorian mind, or the University Victorian
mind?" asked the newspaper-man, with apparent innocence.</p>

<p>"Bother those streamers," The Green Lagoon was festooned with
a number of gay paper streamers, dependant from the floor of the
gallery over the tables, and arching over the dancing floor. One
of these had broken loose from its fastenings on the wall, and
had fallen between Dizzy and the waiter, busy arranging the
dishes on the table.</p>

<p>The journalist caught at it and tugged. To his surprise it
would not break. It fell against the edge of the table again.
Theo Manning leaned across Dizzy, drawing the streamer towards
him. It caught on the edge of the table and, at the same moment,
was hauled boldly up by someone in the gallery above. The table
tilted sharply, and before anyone could interfere dishes, glass,
cutlery and wine were cascaded into Inspector Murmer's lap.</p>

<p>Miss Westways blanched to the lips; a frightened look came in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I expected that," she said softly. "What on earth does it
mean?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="first">MANY times during his service with the police,
in England and Australia, seriously-speaking men and women had
informed Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer that their lives were
threatened. Many persons were willing, even eager, to furnish
elaborate details; but in no instance had a previous statement
been followed by the decanting of an elaborately laid supper into
his lap. The incident of the overthrown table gave Murmer reason
to take Miss Westways' statements seriously, apart from the
lady's undoubted personal charms.</p>

<p>The table had not been overthrown accidentally. The streamer
had not fallen accidentally; nor had the swift hauling of the
cord, concealed in the streamer into the gallery above, been a
coincidence. Saul Murmer had been in the gallery above the table
at which his party had been seated within sixty seconds of the
first, <i>hors-d'oeuvres</i> reaching his immaculate
trousers.</p>

<p>The place was deserted, the idle chairs and bare tables
looking ghostly disconsolate in the dim lights reflected from the
hall below. The <i>mâitre d'hôtel</i>, Luke Lenoire, volubly
assuring him that the gallery was closed that evening to Green
Lagoon clients; that it was never used except on carnival nights,
and then only when the main floor accommodation was insufficient.
Scanning the ruins of the once immaculate garment he believed
fitted perfectly, Saul Murmer gave a liberal discount to Luke
Lenoire's assurances of "impossibilities."</p>

<p>The search he insisted on resulted in the discovery of a
silken cord, slight but of undoubted strength, under one of the
tables, the gaudy papers of the streamer now only half-concealing
it. It was only then that he allowed himself to be escorted to
the dressing room, and temporary repairs executed.</p>

<p>When the detective rejoined the party, the younger members
were inclined to make a joke of the affair and chaff the
Inspector on his monopoly of the good things.</p>

<p>Miss Westways, however, noticed Saul Murmer's uneasiness, his
surreptitious rubs and concealments of his damaged raiment, and
decided she was tired. She asked the Inspector to escort her
home, and in her flat at Elizabeth Bay ensconced her new friend
in a well-fitting chair, a generous glass filled with an
enticingly aromatic liquid on a low table beside him.</p>

<p>His suspicions of the contents of the glass fully confirmed,
Saul Murmer sighed comfortably and looked at Miss Westways,
seated in a similar chair to the one he occupied, and, on a low
table beside her, a miniature delicate glass to the one that had
provoked his admiration.</p>

<p>"Mathilde," he thought, "a really fascinating name for a very
charming lady."</p>

<p>"I suppose you think me very foolish, Inspector." Miss
Westways broke the long, satisfying silence. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Saul Murmer; and for once felt he meant
it.</p>

<p>"The letters alone are not worrying me," continued the lady.
"There have been other things."</p>

<p>"Other things?" queried the Inspector comfortably.</p>

<p>"Surely you understand, Mr. Murmer?" A slight accent of
asperity in the lady's tones awoke the police officer to the
knowledge that not even a high official of the New South Wales
Police Department could be in a spinster's flat at midnight
without impropriety, unless chaperoned by "business."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly. Yes, surely!" A short effort, and he was
sitting upright. "You are thinking of the&mdash;er&mdash;supper
incident?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Miss Westways settled comfortably on her cushions
again. Saul Murmer pondered the suggestion. He could not see a
light.</p>

<p>"Young men and girls sometimes lose their little wits at night
clubs," he suggested indifferently. Then more boldly: "It may
have been a practical joke."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Miss Westways.</p>

<p>Silence came on the two persons in the comfortably furnished
sitting room. Saul Murmer began to find the chair, on which he
sat not quite so comfortable: the liquor in the tall sparkling
glass seemed to have a&mdash;something! The cigarette between his
lips "bit" his tongue. It was his own tobacco, so he could not
complain of that. He shifted uneasily in the deep chair&mdash;and
suddenly remembered a cosy flat at King's Cross. That was it. He
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"There are five of those mauve envelopes, each containing a
drawing of a box." A slight gesture of Miss Westways' right hand
indicated a small pile of letters on the table beside the
Inspector. "Directly after each letter arrived there was
a&mdash;" the lady hesitated&mdash;"a practical Joke."</p>

<p>"Five letters&mdash;and five&mdash;er&mdash;practical
Jokes&mdash;" The round baby-blue eyes opened wide with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"That is so." Miss Westways spoke emphatically. "The first
letter was followed by Paddy finding a live mouse in the
letter-box." She paused and resumed speaking meditatively: "I
have since wondered who was the most startled&mdash;I put salt,
instead of sugar, in my tea. Paddy can scream!" Again Miss
Westways paused. "I understood nothing frightened the modern
girl!"</p>

<p>"So long as it wears&mdash;er&mdash;pants," explained the
Inspector gravely. "Nothing! And&mdash;the other occasions, Miss
Westways?"</p>

<p>"Things just as silly! Someone took the main electric light
fuse the night before the second letter came, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, everybody!" The sitting room door swung quickly open,
and Paddy Burke came into the room with a flurry of draperies and
a breath of the cool, clean, night air.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer looked at the girl with interest. She was
beautiful, with her dark, glowing, almost Eastern colouring, the
vivid sparkle of intense young life in her western eyes. Not yet
for her the meditation and remorse of this world of doubts. Her
life was still in the present; her thoughts hesitating on the
threshold of womanhood, her feet still treading the paths of
adolescence.</p>

<p>Theo Manning had entered the room, immediately following the
girl. The youth had been a problem to the Inspector all the
evening. He had rarely spoken, never unless directly addressed.
Yet he was not sulky; keen, rather old-worldly eyes had followed
every incident since he had joined the party. He was tall and
very blonde; light blue eyes not relieving an almost colourless,
expressionless face.</p>

<p>The youth had puzzled the police officer. He had wondered what
attraction the youth held for the girl. That there was an
attraction he had no doubt, the proof was in her tones and
gestures, careless though they seemed. Saul Murmer sighed. He
admired the girl immensely; he felt he would like to make her a
friend, in one of those semi-avuncular relationships that only
can take the place of equality between the very young and those
who have lost the fires of life's morning.</p>

<p>"Found the box, Mr. Murmer? Let me have a look,
please&mdash;or is this only an informal evening call?"</p>

<p>"This latter would be ruled out of order at this time of
night!" remarked the detective with a smile. He glanced at his
wrist-watch, shrugged, and commenced to rise to his feet. Two
firm little hands pressed against his shoulders, forcing him back
on the seat.</p>

<p>"That's not fair," Paddy protested. "It's only half-past one,
and you look so comfy." She perched herself on the arm of the
detective's chair. "You know, I'm only allowed out until one,
sharp, and Mattie waits up for me, even when I'm with Theo; and
he wants a chaperon more than I!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry Mr. Murmer, Paddy." Miss Westways spoke with a
suspicion of petulance. "Police Inspectors are not always
detecting."</p>

<p>"I observe that." The girl spoke with a little restraint. She
hesitated a moment. "Eva took Dizzy home."</p>

<p>"I expected they would bring you home," observed Miss Westways
carelessly.</p>

<p>Miss Burke shook her dark curls. "Theo had his car," she
explained. "At least, it's his father's car&mdash;but that's the
same thing."</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer changed the subject. The ladies were tired
and cross; yet there were questions he wished answered before he
left. The sketches, the small practical jokes, must have some
hidden meaning.</p>

<p>"Miss Burke," he said. "Have you seen anything about your home
resembling the box of the sketches?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Nor at 'Florabella?'" he continued.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer thought the girl answered almost too quickly. She
changed the subject, glancing down at the Inspector's attire. "So
Mattie cleaned you up. Awfully mean to collar all our supper like
that! Still, Mr. Lenoire did well for us&mdash;and Henri told us
you said to save the bill for him&mdash;and Theo almost fought
him for it; didn't you, Theo?"</p>

<p>The tall, thin young man nodded. He was lounging against the
wall, staring solemn-eyed at the girl. Paddy nodded gaily to him.
"I just adore Theo," went on the girl. "I love talking, and he
never interrupts. Other boys&mdash;" she made a little
moue&mdash;"think they have to entertain a girl&mdash;and think
that they should talk for heaps more than half the time." She
paused! "Theo did say something last week, and I was so surprised
that I could not remember what I had been talking about for a
full minute."</p>

<p>"Paddy!" Miss Westways expostulated gently. The girl turned
slightly sideways on the chair-arm, swinging a shapely leg and
kissing her fingers to the elder lady. She glanced down at the
watching police officer.</p>

<p>"Isn't auntie pretty, Mr. Murmer," she whispered
semi-confidentially. "You know, if I were a man I should fall
desperately in love with her." Then noticing Saul Murmer's look
of surprise, she added. "Didn't you know that Mattie was my aunt,
Inspector? I don't think much of you as a detective, if you
didn't detect that!"</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Saul Murmer gravely. "You see, missy, in the
days of my youth, little girls didn't call their aunts by their
given names."</p>

<p>Paddy laughed. "I am supposed to be rebuked," she replied;
then sprang to her feet, facing the detective. "But detective,
dear, if you only knew how safe it makes one to feel, especially
for a girl as young as I am. And&mdash;and I do call her 'auntie'
sometimes&mdash;when I know the people about me, or when we're
quite by ourselves, and I know it's absolutely safe."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer stared his astonishment. Miss Westways made an
apologetic gesture.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand, really?" Miss Burke looked down, almost
pityingly on the Inspector. "Surely you know that the girls of
to-day emancipated from crinolines, bustles, leg-o'-mutton
sleeves, and chaperones&mdash;poor auntie tries to be a very
competent latter&mdash;have to be so very, very careful;
especially when they possess young and pretty aunties&mdash;" The
girl watched the Inspector's face, amusement, dancing in her fine
eyes. "You are stupid," she considered. "You don't understand one
bit&mdash;and you call yourself a detective! Have you remembered
that when auntie marries&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paddy!" said Miss Westways sharply.</p>

<p>"Of course you are going to get married, auntie." Paddy turned
swiftly, then again faced the seated Inspector. "You see, Mr.
Murmer, when that happens, and I've a hunch it won't be so many
months ahead of us, I shall have to call her husband 'uncle,' if
I call her 'auntie' now! And, just imagine! Supposing I don't
like him. To call him 'uncle' and just hate the sight of him will
be too awfully shrieking! Why&mdash;" She glanced over her
shoulder at Miss Westways, and then at the detective, and there
was subtle meaning in her glances. She broke into a series of
little giggling laughs. "&mdash;so, you see, I call her 'Mattie'
just for the time, and until I know whom she intends to marry.
When she does make up her mind, and takes a pick from the nice
men trailing on her skirts, I promise, faithfully, to call him
'uncle'&mdash;and her, of course, 'auntie'&mdash;haven't I,
Mattie? But if she takes one of the nasty ones, however much she
loves him, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paddy, dear&mdash;" Then Miss Westways laughed. "Inspector,
you will come to believe I live in a constant state of 'Paddy,
dear,'" she continued; "Though she is a bit of a
handful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dear," corrected the girl. With a swing of her voluminous
skirts she again seated herself on the arm of the Inspector's
chair, swinging her legs and showing rather more of silk-clad
limbs than before. She rested her arm on the back of the chair,
bending down to peer into the police officer's face. "I know
auntie thinks I'm everything that's awful&mdash;and everything
nice; and I think she's the dearest, darlingest, bestest auntie
that ever a girl could have! And I think you're nice, too, Mr.
Murmer. Your name is Saul, isn't it&mdash;and Dizzy's Paul. Isn't
that funny&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused and again scanned the smooth-skinned, round face
just below the level of her shoulder. "I do think you're nice,
Mr. Murmer. No, I'll call you 'Uncle Saul.' Now, isn't that just
too sweet? And, let me whisper. Uncle Saul&mdash;I think Mattie
thinks the same as I do."</p>

<p>"Paddy!" exclaimed the horrified lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, but she does, in spite of that 'Paddy'&mdash;and I
daresay she'll give me a big, big kiss and a bear-hug, when
you've gone&mdash;so that I'll know that if I have said
something&mdash;something I shouldn't have said&mdash;though I
won't understand why&mdash;" She laughed, looking teasingly at
Miss Westways. She hesitated. "Yes; I think I could very easily
call you 'Uncle Saul'&mdash;and mean it&mdash;and now and then
give you big, big, uncley kiss&mdash;when you do something I like
very especially."</p>

<p>Miss Burke swayed dangerously on the arm of the big chair
towards the stout Inspector, her eyes glowing with mischief. For
a moment Saul Murmer thought she was going to experiment in
a&mdash;a perfectly "uncley" manner, and his ingrained English
Puritanism caught fire. He struggled to rise to his feet,
glancing suggestively at his wrist-watch. From his wrist-watch
Inspector Murmer glanced at the girl above him. With an effort,
he covered his embarrassment with a veneer of officialdom.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;suppose, Miss Burke, you have seen nothing
of a box in any resembling the&mdash;er&mdash;drawings sent to
Miss Westways," he asked, apparently forgetting that but a short
quarter-of-an-hour before he had asked a very similar
question.</p>

<p>"The box&mdash;Oh! But, Mr. Murmer, you are not going to leave
us?"</p>

<p>Paddy had a single-track mind. "Oh, please don't go; I was
just beginning to&mdash;No, I said that at the night-club. But,
you know, Uncle Saul, if you go, Theo will have to go,
too&mdash;you really can't leave a sheik like him with two
unprotected females at this time of night. Don't go, please!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shook his head. He felt there was safety in
flight. Also he noted Miss Westways' face, and gathered from her
expression that an adjournment of the evening would meet with her
entire approval. Again he shook his head. Suddenly Paddy smiled,
waltzing across the room with a little shriek of delight.</p>

<p>"I know! Uncle Saul, you live at King's Cross, don't you? Then
Theo shall drive you home. It's on his way, and he has his
car&mdash;I mean his father's car." She beckoned imperiously to
her cavalier. "Theo, you are to drive Inspector Murmer
home&mdash;and, Theo, none of your speeding tricks while he's in
your charge&mdash;" She broke off with a squeal of delight,
clasping her hands to her breast and gazing rapturously at the
police officer, "Oh, isn't it gorgeous, Mattie! Just think of it!
Theo, with his craze for speed, doing it through Sydney suburbs
with an Inspector of Police in his car!"</p>

<p>She swung to the youth again. "Theo, you can speed as much as
you like, and the faster you go the more I'll love you&mdash;"
She paused, glancing from one to the other; then, impatiently:
"Oh, don't you see? He can't arrest you for speeding while you're
the means of him getting safely home at this hour of the night!
Yes, yes! Inspector Murmer, we've got the goods on you, and over
the night-club affair, too! You paid for our supper&mdash;and it
included spirituous liquors bought after licensing hours!" She
turned to her aunt, rapturously: "Oh, gorgeous! gorgeous! He's
delivered right into our hands for ever and ever! We've got
the&mdash;the goods on him&mdash;as he tells all the nice crooks
when he puts them in those nasty, dark, damp cells! Oh,
good-o!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer grinned, and something like a smile dawned on Miss
Westways' lips. Miss Paddy Burke was, in her own phraseology,
something of a handful. The Inspector clasped the slender hand
frankly extended to him, with a visible thrill of pleasure. He
knew the girl liked him&mdash;and he was absolutely certain he
liked her. He went to take leave of the elder lady, in somewhat
incoherent words, for all his life he had been a very lonely man,
and the homely chaff of the girl had brought back memories of
what might have been had he devoted less time to business. As he
turned to the door, the girl sped before him.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mattie. I'm seeing, 'Uncle Saul' out. You know, I
can't trust you early Victorians&mdash;or early
Edwardians&mdash;which is it, Theo, with your tender
love-passages in our little hall at two in the morning. Come on,
Theo, it doesn't take you all night to say 'good-bye' to Mattie.
Yes, I'm turning you both out. Theo, you're to drive Uncle Saul
home and then&mdash;then I'm not going to be responsible for
you&mdash;until we meet again."</p>

<p>In the car, on the silent suburban streets, and throughout the
drive to King's Cross, Theo Manning preserved his pose of silent
watcher.</p>

<p>Only when Inspector Murmer had alighted from the car and was
turning to thank him for the lift home, he abandoned his sphinx
pose, making his first spontaneous remark for the evening.</p>

<p>"Paddy's a goer, isn't she?" he observed suddenly. "Awfully
pretty and a good kid, though. Think so?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer nodded. He was not prepared to discuss the ladies
with this very wordless young man.</p>

<p>"Say, Inspector&mdash;" Theo broke in on the detective's
thanks. "Paddy's got a wheeze."</p>

<p>"Is that original?" asked the Inspector coldly.</p>

<p>"She's got a wheeze," repeated the young man imperturbably.
"It's a wheeze that we&mdash;she and I&mdash;should hunt up this
artist feller who's drawing those boxes and sending them to Miss
Westways. Awful bore, y' know; but what's a feller to do when the
girl says so!" He paused, then added, in less lazy tones. "I
thought perhaps you might&mdash;" His voice faded beneath the
Inspector's stony stare.</p>

<p>"You thought I might, what?" asked Paul Murmer.</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this&mdash;" The light, lazy voice drawled
on. "Just like this. If Paddy says 'So,' its 'So'&mdash;and so
I've got to line up with Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Thorndyke, Deadwood
Dick, and all them beastly masters of energy. Y' know, they don't
have classics on detecting at the 'varsity, though why, I don't
understand, or I'd swot it up there. So I thought you'd give me
a few pointers on how you fellers go about the biz. Not that I
want you to give away any of your patents, or copyrights, or
anything like that. That wouldn't be fair to you fellers who have
to earn your living at the swot. All I want is just a few hints
on how to catch the feller&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer laughed. He considered; perhaps it would not be a
bad thing to give this empty-headed youth something useful to
do&mdash;though, of course, he would not allow him or the girl to
run themselves into any real danger.</p>

<p>"A few hints!" Inspector Murmer apparently considered. "Well,
I don't see any reason why I shouldn't. Suppose you and the young
lady just keep your eyes open&mdash;for the man who drew those
sketches, and&mdash;and for the box they refer to. You may get on
to something&mdash;" He paused, and his voice took a stern note.
"That's all you can do: just watch. When your certain someone is
taking a suspicious interest in Miss Westways and her business,
come to me. Do nothing else. I'm not going to have you children
run your heads into danger. Understand?"</p>

<p>He waved a brief farewell, and turned towards the block of
buildings. Almost as his foot touched the step, the youth's voice
halted him. "Hey, Inspector! There's one thing Paddy and I have
seen. There's been a feller hanging about 'Florabella' quite a
lot of late. Tall feller, wears a monocle; drawls his words, like
all you English&mdash;" The Inspector thought this rather rich of
the young man, even though he claimed Australian birth. "Dresses
well, and all that," continued Theo. "Oh, and I remember. He's
got quaint eyebrows, or at least one of them&mdash;the left one,
I think, comes right down to a peak&mdash;and then he has a bit
of a limp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which leg?" asked Saul Murmer sharply.</p>

<p>"Left. Goodness&mdash;why he's all left, I remember. Left
eyelashes, left leg for the limp; and monocle screwed in his left
eye. By Jove! That's quaint! All left! Know him, Inspector?"</p>

<p>The detective considered a few moments, repressing thoughts
that had sprung to his mind. "Can't say that I do," he replied
carelessly. "That limp sounds interesting; and those eyelashes
should certainly place him. I'll have a few inquiries made, but
if you should see him again, just tip off any of our men who
happen to be near." Murmer paused, then added hastily; "I mean
you&mdash;not Miss Paddy. You don't want to mix her up in this
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Couldn't keep her out of it," drawled Theo Manning, with his
usual wan smile, "She's the sort who takes to dangers and
adventures like a puppy laps milk. Goo'-night!"</p>

<p>Manning accelerated the engine of the car, and Saul Murmer
turned again to the entrance of the block of flats. Suddenly the
sounds from the engine died away and, involuntarily, the
Inspector turned. The youth beckoned him to come to the car
window again.</p>

<p>"Say, Inspector, I forgot!" There was no trace of excitement
in the young man's voice. "The johnnie wears one of those queer
old-fashioned tailed coats&mdash;what the English call morning
coats. Awfully quaint! Say, dad says he's going to send me to
England when I've finished at the coll.&mdash;to study the
people. He says they're worth it, but I don't know!
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and bent again to the gears. "S'pose you want your
beauty sleep, so I won't keep you. Just keep one eye open for the
feller&mdash;and when you see him call on me. We'll have him in
Long Bay, or wherever you keep those johnnies before
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>The car shot forward trailing a "W-e-l-l, s-o-o l-o-ng!"
behind it.</p>

<p>For a few moments Saul Murmer stood on the pavement watching
up the road in the direction the car had travelled. He turned to
the steps leading up to his home, a puzzled frown on his round,
good-humoured face.</p>

<p>"Peaked eyebrows, limp, monocle, old-fashioned morning coat!
Yes&mdash;I guess I'll know that man!"</p>

<p>He put the matter from him as he ascended to his floor in the
lift, and ten minutes after unlatching his front door, was fast
asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="first">THE people of the city of Sydney boast of many
things. They claim their city to be the biggest in the southern
hemisphere, and that it has the largest shops and most dignified
office buildings. They boast of their fine parks&mdash;and their
harbour. Of late years they have added a bridge to their
repertory, as proof that they inhabit the finest city in the
world. They forget to mention that Sydney possesses some tortuous
and inconvenient streets. And they do not boast of their public
buildings. It is possible their constant evidence of the "Bridge"
is to offset that structure against their Parliament House,
which, in appearance, suggests suffering from a permanent "night
out."</p>

<p>The city police headquarters executive offices, as is usual in
the public service of the State, are situated in a building in
one street, and the working departments in another street, far
distant. To interview a working officer of the Police Department
is an interesting experiment in archaeology, science and
adventure. Adventure dictates an expedition to one of the most
tortuous and narrow sections of Pitt Street. There a very narrow
lane must be located&mdash;a lane that looks no different from
its many fellows surrounding it. Half-way down this lane is a
dark gateway, the doors of which slant permanently open. Beyond
this gateway lies a gloomy maze of pillars&mdash;mute evidence
that the latest contribution to science was not unknown to
builders of a bygone generation. Searching amid these pillars, a
narrow doorway, the interior several shades gloomier than the
pillars area, may be located. Just inside the door is a large
notice-board, recording a list of "Missing Persons."</p>

<p>Irreverent newspapermen have been known to observe that the
names on the board should include those from whom they require
information.</p>

<p>Occasionally adventurers, penetrating far into the bowels of
Police Headquarters, have chanced upon a quaint little office, of
three walls and a glass door, occupied by "Sergeant" Ben
Bunty.</p>

<p>It must be recorded that the rank of sergeant is entirely
honorary, for Ben Bunty had never risen past the rank of
second-class constable. His pre-emption of this office was
preceded by a lengthy sojourn in hospital, owing to a difference
of opinion with a "wanted" gentleman from a certain city far
south of Sydney. Returning to the Department labelled by the
medical authorities "permanently unfit for active duty," Ben
Bunty found that a sympathetic Commissioner of Police had created
for him the post of "messenger" to the Superintendent of
Detectives.</p>

<p>As George Dixon, the present superintendent, preferred to
"run" his own messages, "Sergeant" Ben found himself possessed of
considerable leisure. Had the Police Department been other than a
makeshift, in strict accordance with the permanent policy of the
State, "Sergeant" Ben would have found his true vocation amid the
archives of headquarters. To explain not as an exhibit, but as a
memory stultified by tradition.</p>

<p>Sergeant Ben possessed a memory&mdash;a memory that soon came
to be recognised by everyone concerned, from the Commissioner to
the newest recruit. Failing messages to run, Sergeant Ben found
his vocation in life by taking daily journeys through the police
buildings, particularly through the passages between cells,
surveying the occupants with satisfaction to himself and value to
the Department. He frequented the police courts, and was
particularly inquisitive concerning those escorted in the
buildings by zealous officers.</p>

<p>He had, also, a penchant for portraits&mdash;none of which
would have been considered artistic by curators of galleries. As
time progressed, Sergeant Ben's little foible for "portraits"
became of increasing value&mdash;and various incumbents of the
office of Superintendent of Detectives willing forwent the few
little services they had hitherto exacted from their reputed
"messenger." Amid the rank and file of the Department, Sergeant
Ben became the last Court of Appeal. His recognition of a visitor
as "Sydney Tones" was stubbornly accepted in spite of all
protests that the gentleman's real name was Albert Lithe.</p>

<p>His identifications were accompanied by such a wealth of data
that investigations among the musty files of the Department
invariably supported his contentions, quite good alibis had a
habit of fading into questionable untruths under the stare of the
light-brown eyes in the big ruddy, round face.</p>

<p>Within a week of his arrival in Sydney, from London, on
exchange duty, Detective-Inspector Murmer was escorted to the
little "office" to be formally introduced, to Sergeant Ben. Saul
Murmer had heard of the man, and stared at the little cubby-hole
of an office and its occupant with much interest. He was somewhat
disappointed, for he had expected to see an office crammed with
filing cases, the desk littered with photographs and papers.
Instead, he saw a apace approximately six-by-six, containing a
small desk, a chair, and quite a number of charcoal portraits, of
cartoon nature, drawn on the whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>Wedged in the chair, between table and wall, was a stout,
ruddy man, in a constable's uniform. The large head was almost
entirely bald, possibly due to the sergeant's habit of exciting
thought with the palm of his left hand. Beneath the shining dome
were very heavy brows and light-brown, small eyes. Further south
appeared a snub nose, apparently supported by a huge, brown
moustache. When Sergeant Ben smiled, two rows of even, very white
teeth glowed as&mdash;as pearls among seaweed.</p>

<p>Some days later curiosity again led Saul Murmer to the
cubby-hole and its occupant. Later, he made other visits. These
were discovered by the alleged wits of the Department. On his
next visit to Sergeant Ben he found a thin red string leading
from the door of his office to the cubbyhole. The Inspector
accepted this as a reply to a complaint he had uttered, that
Police Headquarters should be supplied with direction signs.</p>

<p>The morning following his evening at the Green Lagoon,
Inspector Murmer found himself, still lamenting the loss of a
favourite pair of evening trousers, slated for an interview with
his superintendent. Affairs of importance adjusted to the
Superintendent's satisfaction, Saul Murmer sought Ben in his
alleged office.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer, like other visitors to Sergeant Ben, made
his interview from where the door-mat should have been. He found
Sergeant Ben intently surveying a remarkable series of charcoal
sketches by famous Sydney cartoonists; all the cartoons being of
the noted "sergeant," although some not too flattering.</p>

<p>On seeing the Inspector, Sergeant Ben sat upright and saluted
smartly. He did not rise to his feet&mdash;that would have meant
vacating his office.</p>

<p>"Morning, sir! Fine day!"</p>

<p>This was pure conjecture on the sergeant's part, as there was
no window to the office&mdash;and he was optimistic regarding
Sydney climate.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shook his head sadly, surveying the portly figure
in the chair.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Ben," he said mournfully. "When you develop as far
as I have developed, you will have to requisition for a new
office."</p>

<p>Sergeant Ben dissented. "I'd be sorry to leave the old spot,"
he answered, surveying what he could see of his office with pride
and affection. "Though, as you say, it is somewhat of a tight
fit. Tain't as large as the one I 'ad at old p'lice headquarters,
an' the dust be truly awful; but it's 'ome from 'ome, as you
might say; for I'm like you, Inspector: I ain't found a woman as
is good enough to marry a police officer." He shook his head
sorrowfully. "There ain't many as is made that way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps women don't think police officers are good enough
for the homes they make," suggested the stout detective. "That's
a thought you might ponder, Sergeant Ben. Police officers are a
bit&mdash;er&mdash;irregular in their habits&mdash;not that I'm
suggesting they're at all irregular in their conduct."</p>

<p>"I'm as regular as the Central Station clock." Sergeant Ben
bridled. "I come 'ere at eight-thirty each morning, and I leaves
at five-thirty, except on Saturday, when I leaves at twelve or
thereabouts. No man can be more regular than that."</p>

<p>"No." Inspector Murmer spoke with a slight drawl. He changed
the subject. "I've been having a little conversation with the
Superintendent, Sergeant Ben."</p>

<p>The old man shook his head lugubriously. "About night-clubs,
sir, if I may be so bold as to mention the subject?"</p>

<p>Again Sergeant Ben shook his head. "He knows your partiality
for sich places, as I've heard 'im say on more than one occasion.
Not as I agrees with the superintendent&mdash;not by no manner of
means, 'e does things as I can't agree with&mdash;not as 'e ain't
got th' authority, but authority ain't allus right, if you
understands what I mean?"</p>

<p>Shortness of breath, or perhaps the sharp edge of the
office-table against the lower portion of his anatomy, caused
Sergeant Ben to pause. Sergeant Murmer waited.</p>

<p>"It ain't right, by no means whatsoever," continued the
Sergeant, trying to push the table through the office wall. "It
ain't right, an' me sitting here from eight-thirty to
five-thirty, except on Saturdays, when I leaves at twelve, as
I've said. And, what if I do take a little stroll round the
precincts of the courts, as I acknowledges I do sometimes. It's
only to give the boys a hand, as you might say. But it's the
Sooperintendent's duty to sit at his desk and press the little
knob as is marked 'Messenger.' For how can he see you gents as
wants to see 'im, if he's running his own messages?"</p>

<p>Again Sergeant Ben paused, gathering new breath, "As I ses,
an' as you'll say, he ain't no more right to do it than for them
h'English perdoocers to come here to Orstralyer and make pictures
as makes us out ter be convicts and blackfellers, and kangaroos
and bushrangers. Not as we ain't got some of the best convicts in
the world. I stands up for Orstralyer in that, as I does in
everything else. There's convicts as we've got as we're proud
of&mdash;real proud to 'ave in our prisons."</p>

<p>Again Sergeant's Ben's voice faded into nothingness. Inspector
Murmer nodded agreement in general, gravely.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Superintendent Dixon occasionally rings his bell, and
you're not here."</p>

<p>"P'haps I wasn't here," agreed Sergeant Ben, in no way
abashed by the suggestion that he had been absent from duty. "But
if I wasn't here I was still on public duty. There ain't messages
allus to run, Inspector, as you may say. If there ain't no
messages, then I turns my attention to other things but them's
always police duty, as I'm paid to perform and does. There's
clues, sir, as you well know, and them has to be handled by
experts&mdash;and where in this Police Department will you find
them with the experience as I've got? As you know, sir, I ain't
one to sit down with folded arms and feet."</p>

<p>Sergeant Ben broke off suddenly, noting that Inspector
Murmer's eyes were gravely surveying the little office, bare of
any sign of paper record.</p>

<p>"It ain't papers and them things as I makes knowledge, sir,"
reproached Sergeant Ben. "Papers, and files, and card indexes be
good for them people as ain't got memories, and there's plenty of
'em in this department, if I may be so bold as to say it. No,
sir! Sooperintendant 'as a 'abit of running his own
messages&mdash;and draws a salary from th' Department. With the
Sooperintendant doing what he does, I had to find work becoming a
man of my experience. And I found it, sir. There's those in the
Department as ain't ate up in their own pride and consequence as
'as found Sergeant Ben useful, if he ain't ornamental. They knows
as they've only to give me one look at a questionable party, and
if I ain't seen him for twenty years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Inspector," continued Sergeant Ben, when an interval had
replenished the internal atmosphere. "You mayn't know, Mr.
Murmer, if I may make so bold as to drop your title for the
moment, not being one of our regular officers, as I've got a
memory as is known in this Department. I ain't one to boast, sir,
but it was me as ses to Inspector Williams; 'That's Ooke Kettigan
in th' dock, when he fooled 'em he wasn't.'" Sergeant Ben
coughed. "You didn't know Ooke, Mr. Murmer; no, he was afore your
time, but he was a great kidder. They hadn't his finger prints,
for it was in them days when we couldn't take their finger prints
afore they were convicted. He called himself Algernon Courteney,
and he was brought in for the Western States affair&mdash;and I
laughed. I knew no mother 'ud let her son wander into a cold,
hard world with a moniker like that hanging on to him; and I
thought, and I presently I wanders close to the dock, and I ses,
in a quiet and conversational voice: 'Hullo, Ooke, and how's the
little second-hand book-shop down Redfern these days?'&mdash;and
you should have seen him collapse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sergeant Ben suddenly deflated himself. He struggled for fresh
air, and words. Inspector Murmer interposed:</p>

<p>"Ever come across an Englishman with a partiality for a
morning coat and striped trousers?" Saul Murmer winced at
thoughts of trousers and his recent bereavement. "A tall man with
a long, thin face, and a monocle in his left eye. Speaks with a
drawl. Walks with a limp in his left leg&mdash;" The detective
paused. "Thought you might remember him, especially as his left
eyelashes come down to a peak on his cheek when he closes his
eyes. Quite a strange malformation."</p>

<p>Sergeant Ben muttered the word "malformation" thrice. He was
fond of words&mdash;especially unusual words. Inspector Murmer
waited. If this man had ever come into the hands of the New South
Wales Police Department, Sergeant Ben would remember him.</p>

<p>Clasping his hand behind his hack, and teetering on his toes,
he waited: not for long, as it happened. "Left eyelashes come
down to a peak," muttered the old constable. "A malfermentation!
'Course it would be! You're right, Mr. Murmer, sir, though he
ain't been in the 'ands of the police, as you may say, quite
official."</p>

<p>"How's that, Sergeant Ben?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it happened like this, and it's some time ago. The
boys put up a raid on one of them clubs as they have in
Darlinghurst, and they brought in the catch here&mdash;and a fine
squeeze we had in the cells, for a time. Some of them had
friends, as they telephoned to come, and bail them out. A few
weren't quite so lucky, and had to make themselves comfortable
for the night as best they could. We let 'em send out for
breakfast in the morning, and anything else they fancied, except
spiritualous liquors, of course. One of 'em as hadn't luck was
this man with the malfermentation. I remember the malfermentation
when I saw it in the line-up, when I went down to see as it I
could pick out them as we wanted for other things. That was the
time when I spotted 'Bingo' Samuels, the bloke as we wanted for
the Landley jewellery robbery, not as he took much; there wasn't
much in the shop to take. And didn't he just say things when I
spotted him and called him by name&mdash;though why he should
try to be rude, I can't say as you may say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What about the man with the peaked eyelashes?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Oh, him?" Sergeant Ben went searching back in the wilderness
of words he had released on the Inspector. "Oh, him! He got the
usual; a quid for being on unlicensed premises, and drinking.
That was, all, though he looked as if a h'angel 'ad come from
'eaven when he saw Gaoler Franklin open the dock door and let
him out."</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer laughed quietly. "You missed that time,
Sergeant Ben. You had 'Winny' Demmage in your hands and let him
go. And, now Scotland Yard wants 'Winny' badly. They hadn't an
idea he had come to Australia or this department would have been
notified. If you see him again, let me know before handing him
the key of the street."</p>

<p>"Glad to, Mr. Murmer." Sergeant Ben beamed with pride. "I'll
keep an eye open, sure!"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer was turning from the small office when he was
halted by the old man, with a question: "If I may make so bold,
Inspector, just what has 'Winny' done?"</p>

<p>As the Inspector hesitated he added: "You see, sir, it's all
meat for the cat, as you may say. If I know his usual lay can
look for him among the usual gents as come in on that game. They
ain't, original, as you well knows, sir thing, so as to
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blackmail; snow-drifting; anything with easy money and no
hard work," said Paul Murmer briefly.</p>

<p>"Ah, is that so?" Sergeant Ben nodded his heavy head
thoughtfully. "No hard work! Yes, sir; cracking a can is hard
work, as they tells me, an' no mistake about it."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="first">THERE are quite a number of people in the city
of Sydney who know the Salom Club; but usually they prefer that
this knowledge shall be tucked away in some private corner of
their minds. On occasions, some frequenter of the club receives a
shock when one sees some friend or business acquaintance escorted
through the premises by the proprietor, Captain Artimus Pontifex.
Between the two, for a few moments, recognition may be awkward,
but relations are soon on a normal footing, and old-time
friendship closer by reason of a mutual secret.</p>

<p>The Salom Club has a history. Popular rumour states that it
was founded by certain army bloods in the history of Captain
Bligh, and that its history is continuous from that date. Members
are shyly proud of this record, while not prepared to openly
confirm it. Tradition enters largely into the history and
procedure of the Salom Club. Just as drinking and gambling were
the primary objects in its early days, to-day, gambling is its
chief object, under the benevolent proprietor&mdash;though not
personally indulged in.</p>

<p>It is difficult to locate the Salom Club. The inquirer has to
penetrate the wealth of small, winding streets, rock-bound and
narrow, on the west side of Circular Quay. The club-house is of
stone and shows signs of its many years' resistance to storm and
sunshine. In appearance it is an ordinary dwelling-house,
standing amid a welter of old-fashioned dwelling houses, now
converted into factories and stores.</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex's immediate predecessor had been a good
business man. Deliberately avoiding publicity, and approaching
only men of wealth who care for a little "flutter" far from any
chance of limelight, he had considerably increased the club
membership during his term of proprietorship.</p>

<p>Finding within the original building a certain lack of
accommodation, he had purchased the two houses in the rear. The
three yards of the building, under a competent architect, had
become an adequate supper-dance hall. The three main buildings
had been comfortably linked with this hall, and the upper floors
converted into chambers where matters not approved by the forces
of law and order were operated.</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex was proud of his establishment; it was his
daily custom, when he arrived at the corner of Gatlow Court and
Platlow Street, to pause and observe the sombre grey-faced
building he owned, with pride and satisfaction. Often he
reflected on past days when he had not dared to dream of his
present comfortable circumstances&mdash;days in London, New York,
Paris, Berlin&mdash;and the gradual slow descent in the social
scale to Singapore and Suez. At the latter place he had barely
managed to obtain a living, until a noble Englishman with a
passion for exploration and gambling had one night frequented his
lowly establishment.</p>

<p>The Englishman had opened his eyes to the next day's daylight
in a small hovel on the outskirts of the town, which he found he
was sharing, democratically, with a Turk, a negro, a Senegalese,
and a dago of obese and perfumed frame. Captain Pontifex had left
before dawn for parts unknown, to reappear in Sydney,
Australia.</p>

<p>Only chance had brought the gallant captain to
Australia&mdash;the chance of the first discreet ship he could
find. Now he flattered himself he was set for life. He preened
himself that he had learned lessons from past experiences; he
believed he had schemed out a means to an adequate livelihood
that would last him until&mdash;</p>

<p>At that point he always stopped. He had never employed an
auditor; he had never audited himself&mdash;and he dreaded his
appearance before the Final Auditor of Human Lives.</p>

<p>While the gallant captain, regiment unknown, prided himself
that his club was only known to, and appreciated by those, who
found their needed pleasures within its walls, the New South
Wales Police Department had quite a respectable dossier regarding
the place, its proprietor, and its frequenters. Had Captain
Pontifex known that his club and himself had occupied many hours
of a conference of Police Department heads, he would,
doubtlessly, have journeyed to fresh fields and pastures new,
without the preliminary work, or packing.</p>

<p>That the knowledge did not filter to Captain Pontifex was
satisfactory not only to his swelling banking account, but to the
authorities. The conference had decided that the Salom Club was a
nuisance, but a necessary nuisance. In result, orders were given
to leave the place severely alone&mdash;and that membership
should be obtained for certain officers, who were made
responsible for the seasonal plucking from its branches those
with whom the Police Department had inquisitive occasions. These
memberships were obtained without the proprietor being aware of
the purposes behind the applications for membership, and through
the nominations of city men of repute, who had a passion for what
a former generation terms "slumming."</p>

<p>Not long after his arrival in Australia, Inspector Saul Murmer
heard of Captain Pontifex and his Salom Club. Disregarding an old
axiom that curiosity is far worse than a disease, he
investigated. To his gratification his discovered in Captain
Pontifex an old London acquaintance. If Captain Pontifex did not
feel the same gratification as the police officer, he nobly
concealed his real feelings.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer became a valued member of the Salem Club. He was
not so innocent as to register under an imaginary name, knowing
the physical disabilities which made the disguise impossible for
him. All he required from Captain Pontifex, beyond the necessary
permission to frequent the club, was a discreet silence regarding
his occupation, and a complete "red-herring" when any club
frequenter became knowledgeable and inquisitive.</p>

<p>So complete was Captain Pontifex's control of his club and
members that it was more than two months after the Inspector's
initiation before Superintendent George Dixon knew of the fact.
Police rumours state that Superintendent Dixon, on receiving the
news, swore very emphatically.</p>

<p>The Salom Club opened, or rather unbolted, its steel-lined
doors exactly at mid-day on seven days of the week. Its hours of
business, from mid-day to nine in the evening, were "light grey"
compared with its hours of relaxation, from nine onwards past
midnight. It is a coincidence that from six each morning, until
Commissioner McFee arrived at his office, is occupied by worthy
officers of the department in writing detailed reports in which
the name of the Salom Club frequently appears.</p>

<p>The eighth morning after Inspector Saul Murmer met Miss
Mathilde Westways at the Green Lagoon night-club, the Englishman
attended by request, at Superintendent Dixon's room. The
conference, and it would have been called a "conference" by
Sergeant Lionel Leyland, who doted on such conferences,
surrounded the history of one Montgomery de Leuce, formerly
named by misguided but doting parents, Benjamin O'Connors.</p>

<p>Montgomery de Luece had been, in an English existence, a
teacher of handwriting in a large public school. The advent of
shorthand, typewriting, dictographs, and the peculiar trend of
modern education&mdash;establishing the theory that the more
illegible a student's handwriting the higher his culture and
education&mdash;rendered handwriting experts superfluous. M. de
Luece had, as time progressed, found his fine upstrokes, his
graduated down-strokes, and well-contrived loops, a drug on the
scholastic market. He had to bewail the fact that the fine German
script of the Victorian era had fled before Georgian motor-cars,
aeroplanes, and a radio-whines.</p>

<p>Mistakenly, he took his only asset to the commercial markets.
There, a slight slip in the curvature of a loop had proved the
down-stroke of his career. M. de Luece rested, at a benevolent
Government's expense, while then-Sergeant Murmer pondered deeply
on the whereabouts of a sum of three thousand and ten pounds,
nineteen shillings and sixpence. M. de Luece had always been
artistic in detail, even while signing other people's
cheques.</p>

<p>While a guest of His Britannic Majesty, in one of the palatial
castles situated in lonely spots in England, Signor Montgomery de
Luece became interested in history. He learned of the old-time
punishment of transportation, and directed his attention,
therefore, to such history of Australia as could be obtained in
the country of his birth.</p>

<p>He found Australia intriguing, and when freedom came,
transferred himself and his ambitions to the land under the
Southern Cross. There he found men of wealth who had never
learned the secrets of expert handwriting, and returned to his
former artistic work. Again the cheering cup betrayed&mdash;and
Superintendent Dixon evolved a supreme desire to discuss
handwriting with so great an expert. Naturally, he called on
Inspector Murmer to secure an interview at an early date.</p>

<p>Leaving his Superintendent's office, Saul Murmer decided to
walk down to Circular Quay. After the long and technical
interview his primary desire was a longing for air; at the foot
of Pitt Street he acquired a secondary desire&mdash;for
information, and turned westwards. He arrived in Platlow Street
to witness Captain Pontifex performing his morning genuflections
to his property.</p>

<p>Quickening his steps, Saul Murmer drew level with the club
proprietor at the moment he was reaching out a hand to press the
little knob to announce his arrival to the stalwart doorkeeper
unless that individual mistook the summons to be that of another
"sheep" announcing his intentions to contribute his mite of
fleece to this city-grazier's coffers.</p>

<p>"Consider the shearer of the lilies," misquoted Saul Murmer
softly. "Solomon in all his glory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lilies?" Habit brought Captain Pontifex to a smart military
salute. "Lilies?" he repeated. "I wouldn't call them lilies, my
dear sir!"</p>

<p>"No?" Saul Murmer tilted his soft hat well to the back of his
head and wiped his fevered brow. He disliked walking.
"Then&mdash;shall we call them lambs?"</p>

<p>"Lambs?" The gallant captain spoke scornfully. "No, sir, we'll
not call them lambs."</p>

<p>"Neither lilies nor lambs," the stout Englishman pondered
mournfully; "Really, captain, you are difficult to please. Now a
shearer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A shearer is a common person who shears sheep," stated the
club proprietor in the tone of one instructing abysmal
ignorance.</p>

<p>"How clever!" Saul Murmer's tones held reverence. "May I ask,
my dear captain, if you acquired that profound knowledge while
earning a precarious living as a line sergeant in His Britannic
Majesty's army&mdash;Arthur Wesley?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="first">THE secret history of Sydney records that a
stern and grasping employer of labour, who had absorbed wealth in
spite of the relentless battle waged against him by
self-sacrificing high-souled labour leaders, once purchased for
his son and heir an elaborate electric model railway
system&mdash;and kept the apparatus in his office, in full work,
for six consecutive weeks. When, reluctantly, he determined to
part with the toy to the expectant recipient, he had first to
call in an expert to repair working parts and install new
batteries.</p>

<p>This example has only been quoted to exemplify the childish
nature of man, who in spite of accumulated years, delights to
prick any bubble. In the above sense of mischief, it may be
conceived that Saul Murmer witnessed the sudden and complete
collapse of Captain Pontifex, with delight. For long moments he
watched the deflation his two uttered words had wrought. "Now,
Insp&mdash;Mr. Murmer!" Glassy eyes and a pendulous lower lip
showed to what depths the club proprietor had been plunged. He
spoke pleadingly; "Er&mdash;I don't mind you having your little
joke&mdash;but&mdash;but can't you forget that? There's a limit.
You know, Mr. Murmer; there's black sheep&mdash;and I'm
confessing I'm one&mdash;in every good family."</p>

<p>"Even in the family of a Walworth Street greengrocer?"
Inspector Murmer simulated surprise. "Now I must remember that,
for future use." The lazy blue eyes, scanned the deflated
military form curiously. "I&mdash;er&mdash;thought you were going
to take me into your excellent club."</p>

<p>Still Captain Pontifex did not move. His lips were working
spasmodically; the glassy gaze in his small, predatory eyes had
faded into one of malignant hatred. He struggled for speech.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he said at length. "I'm striving to run
straight to put a discoloured past behind me."</p>

<p>"Did you consider the roulette board at the Winter's Night
Club quite straight?" asked Saul Murmer innocently.</p>

<p>Again the captain squirmed. "A lapse of integrity on the part
of an underling," he muttered, recovering in some measure his
acquired poise. "You know, Insp&mdash;Mr. Murmer, I paid the
fine&mdash;and the magistrate accepted my explanation like the
gentleman he was."</p>

<p>"While Bert Jones, the underling in question, retired to a
poultry farm of long ambition," added the detective.
"And&mdash;Bert Jones had four and tuppence in his banking
account on the morning of the raid." He paused, then added: "I
understand Bert Jones is doing excellently&mdash;on the poultry
farm."</p>

<p>"I am not interested." Captain Pontifex reached out a steady
hand and pressed the bell-knob firmly. "However, I am delighted
to hear that a former&mdash;er&mdash;employee, who dropped
into&mdash;er&mdash;error, has reformed and is making good.
Er&mdash;are you coming in, Insp&mdash;Mr. Murmer?"</p>

<p>"As you so kindly invite me, I think I will."</p>

<p>"Always delighted to welcome you to my poor house of
amusement." Captain Pontifex waved the clouded Malacca cane in
airy salute to the doorkeeper.</p>

<p>Now completely ignoring the detective, Captain Pontifex strode
firmly towards the interior of his club. He was on familiar
ground; where he was master of men. He passed through the large
supper room and an adjoining office, opened a door and ascended a
flight of narrow, steep stairs to the upper floor. Outside the
door of his private office he became aware that he was not alone.
It was hardly a shock to recognise behind him the portly form of
the English detective.</p>

<p>"You wish to consult me, Mr. Murmer?" The assurance which had
grown while passing through his domain, fell abruptly from
Captain Pontifex's shoulders.</p>

<p>"My dear captain, your conversation is always so
charming&mdash;" Casually Inspector Murmer pushed past the
hesitant club proprietor and entered the handsomely furnished
office. For a moment he stood blocking the captain's entry,
surveying the room. Then, having apparently selected the most
comfortable armchair in sight, he ambled across the room and
carefully lowered his full bulk into it.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Captain Pontifex entered his own office as if afraid of
hidden trails. For a moment he stood before his official chair
and his desk.</p>

<p>"I merely called to inquire if you had seen an old and valued
mutual friend&mdash;one 'Winny' Demmage."</p>

<p>"Winn&mdash;" The club proprietor sat down so suddenly that
the room shook. "Is Winny&mdash;is he in Australia? I
thought&mdash;" He finished in a stuttering blur of words.</p>

<p>"Where the carcase is&mdash;" Saul Murmer smiled sweetly. "Not
that I'm calling you a 'carcase', or even one of the
vultures."</p>

<p>A few efforts at contortion, and Saul Murmer succeeded in
reaching into a side pocket of his jacket and extracting a rather
crushed packet of a popular brand of cigarettes. "May I offer you
a smoke, captain? Those black cigars to which you are addicted
are really bad for your nerves&mdash;and your nerves this
morning! Tut, tut!"</p>

<p>With a visibly shaking hand the club proprietor reached across
his desk and flicked back the lid of a large humidor, extracted
one of the cigars disapproved of by the detective. Mechanically,
he bit off the end and searched for a match.</p>

<p>"A light, captain?"</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex ignored the lighter extended towards him. He
struck a match which flickered out. Throwing it down with
unnecessary violence, he struck another. His elbow resting firmly
on the desk top, he succeeded in applying the tiny flame to the
end of the cigar.</p>

<p>"So it's a split!" The gambler spoke bitterly. "Another split;
what I have to pay for the privilege of conducting a decent
business decently." He turned on the lounging detective.</p>

<p>"I suppose if I don't split, you'll tell 'Winny' that Captain
Pontifex is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should be very sorry to encourage major crime to that
extent." Saul Murmer did not look pained, in spite of his words.
"Shall we say that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An infernal split!" Captain Pontifex spoke to infinity.</p>

<p>"Do you think Bill Stevens entirely trustworthy, captain?"
Saul Murmer spoke in the tones of a director of a company
consulting with the managing director the sins of an employee. "I
have watched him at the tables."</p>

<p>A queer, swift motion of the detective's hands illustrated the
remark. "I noticed that&mdash;an&mdash;er&mdash;important client
of this establishment did not appear&mdash;er&mdash;too satisfied
the other night. He appeared to think that Stevens
was&mdash;er&mdash;too efficient. Of course, I understand I am
discussing a very delicate matter."</p>

<p>"I'll sack him!" declared the virtuous captain
explosively.</p>

<p>"Would that be wise?" The Inspector blew two successive smoke
rings towards the ceiling. "He might&mdash;you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;can't." The Captain's heavy hand descended on the
desk top with a force that set its equipment dancing.</p>

<p>"You keep a members' book, captain?" Many people found Saul
Murmer's habit of changing subjects in top gear disconcerting.
Then noticing Captain Pontifex's hand dropping to a certain
drawer of the desk, he added: "Please, Captain! It would pain me
exceedingly to read your record of my erring Sydney brethren. If
you would be so good as to inform me if a certain gentleman,
named Manning&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex looked blankly at his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"A captain of modern finance&mdash;an influence in the
church&mdash;a powerful politician&mdash;umph! Ah, yes, a certain
Carrington Manning&mdash;" Saul Murmer murmured in easy,
indifferent tones. Still Captain Pontifex stared bleakly before
him. A short pause, and the detective officer announced:</p>

<p>"He is the proud possessor of a son. A Mr. Theodore Manning,
in appearance a tall, distinguished blonde&mdash;and silent. Yes,
silent&mdash;one of those strong silent characters women are
reputed to love to distraction. A student, possibly, at our
University&mdash;he may be only a daily visitor there. Certainly
a student at Prince's and similar unhallowed haunts of Sydney
vice, where they charge you six and eightpence for addressing a
haughty waiter, and thirteen and fourpence for speaking
familiarly to the band conductor."</p>

<p>"I don't know Mr. Manning," stated Captain Pontifex flatly. He
turned suddenly in his chair. "What's the joke, Insp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Saul Murmer's soothing tones cut short the captain's
fevered and almost impassioned speech. "Not here, in the sacred
precincts of the Salom Club, hallowed by a history running back
into the dim aeons of a convict ancestry. Not here,
where&mdash;But, tut, tut, man! What would my superintendent say
if he knew I was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope he'd say a lot!" answered the club proprietor
unkindly. "I hope he'd say 'Get out!'"</p>

<p>"Surely not before you've enlightened my ignorance," Saul
Murmer meditated. "So Mr. Carrington Manning does not indulge in
a little secret flutter? A pillar of the church and&mdash;What a
pity&mdash;My dear Captain, you must know him; I am only quoting
a lady of my acquaintance&mdash;and they always know what they
mean, even when mere man considers they are slightly ambiguous.
Now, my dear captain, a captain of finance, a pillar of the
church, is surely useful, especially when the baccarat table is
under suspicion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The whole cursed place is under suspicion, according to you,"
snapped the captain. "Now, listen here, Murmer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mister</i> Murmer." The lids fell over the baby-blue eyes
tiredly; the cupid bow lips pursed sweetly. "Please,
<i>Mister</i> Murmer&mdash;I am entitled to it, I think,
captain."</p>

<p>For a brief moment the eyelids lilted, then dropped again. "I
always call you 'captain'&mdash;and I do like the truth."</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex suddenly wilted. He passed his hand wearily
over his high brow. "What do you really want to know, Mr.
Murmer." The bold voice was now very conciliatory.</p>

<p>"Just what do you know of Winny Demmage."</p>

<p>"Dem&mdash;" A groan strangled in the club proprietor's
throat. He struggled for words; at last they came: "Say,
Inspector, you're joking, aren't you. Winny ain't in
Australia&mdash;Now, straight?"</p>

<p>"Winny is interested in a lady of my acquaintance; he is also
interested in art." Saul Murmer was choosing his words carefully.
"I am afraid he is a bad artist. I do not approve of his
drawings&mdash;they are far, far too crude and in subject are
open to suspicion."</p>

<p>A certain satisfaction peeped from the dimples surrounding the
full red lips. The half-opened eyes were bland, yet in their
depths held the content of the hunter who sees his prey at his
mercy&mdash;and has none for it. For many seconds the Inspector
waited, lolling back at ease in the comfortable chair. Captain
Pontifex did not speak.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you have no knowledge of Winny
Demmage; that you are unaware he is in Australia&mdash;and above
all, that you and he are not bosom friends?"</p>

<p>"Him?" The club proprietor blazed to sudden passion. "If I
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forgive your friends; do to them who hate you." The gentle
smile had returned to the detective's lips. "I always do. Stern
fate has cast me for the part of the gentlest
shepherd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'm the blooming sheep!" Captain Pontifex spoke
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you mixing your metaphors?" asked Saul Murmer
gently.</p>

<p>"Metaphors shouldn't interest you dicks," snarled the club
proprietor. "S'pose you're implyin' I'm the bloomin' goat! Well,
I am, and I know it&mdash;sitting here talking to the likes of
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Walworth Road on a Sunday morning!" Saul Murmer viewed the
ornate ceiling of the office through a haze of his own tobacco
smoke. "You're afraid of Winny, Captain. Now, I wonder&mdash;just
why?"</p>

<p>"It you've got a search warrant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that?" The full, round face showed surprise. "Really,
Captain Pontifex! I'm only Mr. Murmer&mdash;Saul Murmer&mdash;a
man with a rather thick streak of inquisitiveness
regarding&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodness! I'd say thick&mdash;" Captain Pontifex cast up his
eyes devotedly. "Not a streak&mdash;No, a whole bloomin'
bucketful. Bah!"</p>

<p>There are times when the whole English
language&mdash;admittedly the widest and most voluminous in the
world&mdash;becomes entirely inadequate; and Captain Pontifex
believed he had stumbled on one of these rare occasions. For a
moment he fervently wished he knew German&mdash;a language in
which every word, carefully uttered, can be made to sound the
very depths of defamation; where word combinations can be infused
with a strength of objurgation that would hasten the Recording
Angel to turn to a new and unsullied page in his library of
ledgers.</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex merely stuttered, stuttered again, felt
calmer, paused, then spoke: "So you haven't a search-warrant,
Inspector. Sorry! You'd need that, you know, for I don't like
'inquisitive streaks'&mdash;or whatever other fancy names you
like to call them. I've got other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say 'other fish to fry,'" urged the detective,
not making any attempt to vacate his chair. "May I suggest?
Say&mdash;"</p>

<p>A low knock came on the door panel. It was so soft that it
merely caused Saul Murmer to stop speaking, yet be doubtful
whether there had been a knock or not. It was repeated. Captain
Pontifex heard this time, and growled an order for the
interrupter to enter. The door opened, slowly, and a man stood in
the room. At sight of the Inspector in the room, he muttered
something and made to retreat.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me, Freddie," said Saul Murmer kindly. He smiled
benevolently on the man. "I wouldn't like to disturb the usual
routine of this establishment through a friendly morning chat
with my dear friend, Captain Pontifex."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. If you please, sir!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" The club proprietor did not look at the
man in the doorway, his whole attention being centred on the
detective, lolling comfortably back in the deep chair, apparently
set for a long and painful interview.</p>

<p>"It's the gentleman in No. 4, sir." The waiter backed quickly
into the passage as Captain Pontifex turned suddenly and glared
at him. "I think they have been quarrelling,
and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well!" barked the club proprietor.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a sound, sir!"</p>

<p>"A sound? How strange!" Saul Murmer opened inquisitive eyes.
They scanned the man idly, then wandered to where Captain
Pontifex sat, gaping surprise.</p>

<p>"He heard a sound! I thought you had the walls of this
palatial edifice specially deadened, captain?"</p>

<p>The club proprietor jumped up from his chair, his face
suffused with anger.</p>

<p>"I've just about had enough of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of noises," interjected Saul Murmer, nodding entire
agreement. "Sydney is a city of noises. There are tramcars,
railway trains, aeroplanes, and radios, not to mention bridge
clubs, tea-shops and motor bikes, politicians and Domain orators.
And if we try to avoid these painful accessories of modern
civilisation, and wander into the sylvan retreats so generously
provided by paternal Governments, you find out-of-work musicians
practising banjo accompaniments to soul-harrowing songs, labour
leaders of personal zeal, politicians of brands unknown to
<i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>, and teachers of religions so weird
and fantastic that one wonders if the hereafter is not a
continued Christmas pantomime complete with Columbine and
Harlequin; not to mention a first-class clown in cassock and
surplice. Various and different, you say, yet they have one thing
in common; a speech that would have made the Tower of Babel
builders appear to be talking an ancient Esperanto, and with a
volume that makes one hope that there are limits beyond which
loud speaker inventors will not be permitted to go."</p>

<p>The detective shifted lazily in his chair, until he had a
better view of the man in the doorway. "What sort of noise, my
man? A noise like someone imbibing an unexpectedly offered drink,
like a Salvation Army hymn in a quiet street, or merely our
friend the milkman at an unusually unearthly hour of the
morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It sounded like a motor-car backfiring, sir," replied the
man, stolidly. "But I don't think it was, for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the Salom Club doesn't run to motor-cars on the
premises," completed the detective. But the man was not now
listening. Captain Pontifex had reached the the door in a couple
of quick, lengthy strides, and had shoved him into the passage.
Saul Murmer was not far behind him. In spite of his girth he had
slipped out of his chair very easily. A bland, childlike smile on
his full lips, he ambled up the stairs on the club proprietor's
heels. On the second floor of the building Captain Pontifex led
down a narrow passage to a certain door, pushing the waiter
before him. At the door, Saul Murmer slipped in front of the two
men.</p>

<p>"Knock at the door," he commanded the waiter. The man knocked
quietly. Saul Murmer, his ear pressed against the panel, could
not hear any sounds within the room. At the detective's signal
the man knocked again, then let his hand fall to the door-handle.
The Inspector brushed him aside hastily.</p>

<p>"You say there are some gentlemen in this room?" he asked,
still addressing the waiter.</p>

<p>"Three, sir."</p>

<p>"What are their names?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated, looking at his employer. Pontifex answered:
"I understand they are Mr. Buller, Mr. Myson, and a friend."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Saul Murmer spoke quickly. "You came into
the club this morning with me. You have been with me since you
entered, and I know you have not spoken to anyone without my
hearing."</p>

<p>Captain. Pontifex scowled. "They spoke to me about the room
last night," he said. "Myson told me he and Buller wanted a room
this morning to discuss business with a third party."</p>

<p>"Business? A business conference!" The detective lifted
well-arched brows. He turned to face the waiter. "And you heard
a&mdash;er&mdash;backfire?" For a moment he pondered, then turned
to the club proprietor.</p>

<p>"Do you know, my dear friend, I have the opinion we shall only
find one of your friends here&mdash;and he
won't&mdash;er&mdash;answer questions."</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex backed so hastily from the door that he
stepped on the waiter's toes. The man emitted a groan, which made
the gallant captain jump in alarm.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" reproved Saul Murmer. His eyes were sparkling
maliciously. "Very careless! It would have been far more to the
point if you had jumped forward&mdash;to open the door, as I
do."</p>

<p>Draping his handkerchief carefully over the door-handle, the
detective grasped it delicately, and released the lock. He pushed
the door back slowly. Unconsciously the two men behind him
crowded forward, pushing him into the room.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer saw before him a medium-sized room, well
furnished. In the centre of the room stood a large baize-covered
table. Above the table hung an inverted frosted globe, in which a
powerful electric bulb still glowed. Opposite the door was an
old-fashioned open grate, in which stood an ornate radiator.
Against one wall stood a fair-sized buffet, showing that, in
spite of fair attention by the club servants, it bore a large and
expensive part in the room's use. Half-a-dozen high-backed chairs
were scattered about the room and the table, while before the
fireplace were two deep lounge chairs, with the necessary
accessories for masculine comfort close at hand. The eyes of the
three men did not linger on the appurtenances of the room. A
quick glance around the room, and their eyes focussed on the
table, and the man sprawling across it. His head rested on the
green baize, and about it the cloth was stained a deep, dark
crimson.</p>

<p>The man was dead; it did not need an expert to tell the
detective that; every muscle limp and awkward, supported the
evidence of the dark liquid stain spreading across the green of
the table.</p>

<p>Instinctively, Saul Murmer's left arm went out to the far
doorpost, barring entrance.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly." The perfectly shaped lips were rounded. "As I
thought&mdash;only one person."</p>

<p>He turned sharply on the club proprietor. "Artemus, my friend,
I shall have to trouble you to ring up Police Headquarters." He
thought a moment. "Yes, distasteful as the task will be to one of
your susceptibilities, you must handle the telephone, and no
other."</p>

<p>As Captain Pontifex reluctantly turned to the door, Saul
Murmer added; "Ask for John Pater, Artemus&mdash;and there is no
need to mention that I am here&mdash;or have been here. Simply
inform Inspector Pater, with your sincere compliments, that a
friend of yours has&mdash;er&mdash;met with an accident&mdash;and
that you will appreciate his official presence here."</p>

<p>Artemus Pontifex still lingered in the passage, grumbling
under the wide-flowing moustache he nervously pulled. Slowly his
restless eyes scanned the contours of the room. Saul Murmer
backed into the passage, pulling the door closed, and turning the
key in the lock. A moment, and he turned, resting his broad
shoulders against one of the door-posts.</p>

<p>"Artemus, my friend!" Inspector Murmer's slow voice had again
assumed the customary lazy drawl. "You will forget that I am
here. I don't want to be here&mdash;unless you force me to be
here&mdash;and then I may be very, very, unpleasantly&mdash;for
you&mdash;here. I may even be so short-sighted to facts within my
cognisance that I may accuse you of being accessory before and
after the&mdash;er&mdash;murder. Now, most righteous one, man of
unblemished impeccability, the telephone&mdash;and linger not, or
worse befall thee, friend."</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex turned towards the head of the stairs, his
limbs moving uncertainly. Half-way to his immediate objective; he
paused and looked back:</p>

<p>"But&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not here," said Saul Murmer, very kindly, yet the
baby-blue eyes had acquired a hard, puzzling stare. "Please
understand, friend of my boyhood days&mdash;I am not here. But I
shall be here, outside this door, until I hear your loud and very
impressive cough while you escort Detective-Inspector John Pater
and the myrmidons of the law to this room. It may be that the
cough you will&mdash;er&mdash;utter, will break the spell,
dissolving my wraith-like form into the atmosphere&mdash;to your
immediate satisfaction. Yes, dear friend, look at me! You may not
think it possible for me to disappear&mdash;but I shall do so.
But not until I know John Pater is with you. Thank you for your
kind attention, Artemus."</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex had retreated to the head of the stairs
before the flow of Saul Murmer's eloquence. Dazedly, he took a
few steps down in the direction of his office, and halted;
turning and showing to the waiting detective the upper part of a
magnificent torso, discreetly clad, a round, red face, ornamented
by flowing moustaches, tangled with overmuch exercise.</p>

<p>"But Insp&mdash;Mr. Murmer. There is only one way out of the
place&mdash;er&mdash;the front door."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shook his head gravely. "Heaven will provide," he
said devoutly. "He, and you, Artemus, and this gentleman in the
baize apron, who will stay with me, know that I am not now
interested in front doors&mdash;not a fraction as much interested
in them as you are in the contents of this room. Inspector Pater
will be interested&mdash;and I shall not be here to be
interested, Now, Artemus&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shrug finished the sentence, very eloquently for the gallant
captain. He went downstairs to his office, leaving the portly
form of the detective pacing the passage outside the murder-room,
fearfully watched by a fascinated club-waiter. Twenty minutes
later, heavy steps sounded on the stairs. From down in the depths
of the building came the rolling, sonorous voice that had once
ordered privates in His Britannic Majesty's military forces. A
lighter voice spoke, indistinctly&mdash;and Saul Murmer,
listening, smiled.</p>

<p>Then came a cough&mdash;a cough so severe that it appeared to
shake the old building to its foundations. The ascending steps
sounded more plainly. Again Captain Pontifex coughed. It was, as
if he had acquired a serious and malignant form of influenza
since be had parted with Saul Murmer. The detective smiled
secretly, turning to the waiting waiter:</p>

<p>"Now, Tommy-John, or whatever your name is, we do our famous
fade-away act. On this floor there is a room&mdash;and a door. I
know of them&mdash;you know them. Please don't shake your head;
you wouldn't, if you knew Inspector Pater. He is of the hard,
cold callous world, which delights in third degrees, loaded
lengths of rubber hose, and similar inflictions that make my
gentle soul shudder. And, if he saw me, I might have to tell him
that you know everything. Get me,
everything&mdash;about&mdash;this&mdash;murder. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;" stammered the man.</p>

<p>"The room&mdash;and the door, Tommy-John. And quickly!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" The man showed astonishment. "You
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know nothing," repeated Saul Murmer soothingly. "You know
nothing. Two nothings make nothing, if not&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thirty seconds later Inspector Pater turned the angle of the
stairs, and his head and shoulders rose to a level with the
passage-way. The long space before, him was empty&mdash;yet the
detective had an uneasy feeling that he had heard a sound
somewhere at the far end of the passage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="first">AT Police Headquarters Inspectors John Pater and
Saul Murmer were considered privileged persons. Authority had,
for some reason, set apart a small chamber in which they were
supposed to pursue those cogitations, and other mental
gymnastics, which resulted in the undoing of New South Wales
malefactors. This private office measured approximately ten by
twelve. In it stood two small desks of undoubted vintage, two
supposedly desk-chairs, which daily squeaked protests at overdue
retirement age; a very comfortable, broad, lounge chair, assuming
far more than its fair share of the room; and two high-backed
chairs of supposedly Windsor pedigree for visitors.</p>

<p>The walls of this palatial abode had once been distempered;
the ceilings had, by records, once known a whitewash brush
intimately. The door, skirting, and an alleged picture rail,
were, by courtesy, painted. The floor was covered with open-work
linoleum, through which seeped the dust of disintegrating
floor-boards. At times, former occupants of the room had sought,
by pages culled from various magazines, to allay the
greeny-yellowy tone of the four walls. Other literary enthusiasts
had overlaid these gems of art with publications in single-sheet
form, issued by the Government printer who, obviously, had no
soul for art.</p>

<p>On taking possession of his office, Inspector Pater had spent
considerable time enlarging the space at his disposal by
stripping the walls. Some space had thus been obtained&mdash;and
then a callous Commissioner had absorbed still more space, and
added to the rooms decoration, by decreeing that Saul Murmer be
of the room a fixture. Additional space was used by the
introduction of a desk for the Englishman's use&mdash;and a desk
chair, blood-brother to that used by Inspector Pater. Saul Murmer
introduced the space-filling lounge chair&mdash;and the desk and
chair allotted by an unobservant furnisher to the newcomer was
used as a depository for papers of all sizes, sorts and
condition, not immediately required by the room's legitimate
occupants. The lounge chair was Inspector Murmer's unofficial
abode while he was constrained within Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>Strangers visiting the Inspectors were considerably startled
on entering this office. The escorting constable, knowing the
area beyond the door, opened it gently, and then stood well back
in the corridor. The visitor barged in&mdash;to recoil in
amazement; wondering if he had seriously damaged the tall,
military-looking gentleman just beyond the opening, or rebounded
from the rotundity of the gentleman asleep in the oversized
chair. The second time he entered more cautiously and found a
seat in the corner of the room&mdash;the one corner available.
The door was closed by the constable&mdash;and a feeling of
restriction came over the room's three occupants.</p>

<p>Only Dizzy Laine entered with the feeling that God was in his
heaven, and all was well on this noble earth. The morning
following the murder at the Salom Club, Inspector Saul Murmer
disorganised tradition by appearing at Headquarters shortly
before eight o'clock. Tradition shattered when Superintendent
Geo. Dixon walked through the big gates and sought his office
exactly as the clocks were holding their eternal dispute as to
the correct second of the hour. So much did this dereliction from
things ordered disturb Constable A. Quarts, on duty that morning,
that he mentioned the double event to Inspector Pater when he
walked past him at nine o'clock. Yet the lounge chair before the
open window, overlooking the solitary plane tree, was vacant when
Inspector Pater reached his office. It was still unoccupied when
Inspector Pater received the information that Superintendent
Dixon would be glad of his invaluable advice on a matter of
departmental interest.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater had been astonished to learn of Saul Murmer's
early arrival; he had been still more astonished to find the
lounge chair unoccupied; he was astounded to find Superintendent
Dixon alone in his office. Stupefaction overwhelmed him when he
was informed that Inspector Murmer would not be with him on the
Salom Club case, and that his right hand and confidant in the
matter would be one, Sergeant Lionel Leyland. Words failing, he
grunted something that might be taken for assent to organised
authority. He did not like Sergeant Lionel Leyland; considering
him a pushing pest and a foul blot on the otherwise impeccable
escutcheon of Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Inspector Pater returned to his office in a
mind totally adverse to the critical, phlegmatic, impartial,
dignified and authoritative attitude imposed on Inspectors by
police regulations. Saul Murmer greeted his return to the
fold&mdash;i.e., office&mdash;with a casual wave of a
cigarette-decorated hand, without looking up from a perusal of
Dizzy Laine's eloquent account of the Salom Club affair in the
<i>Post Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater strode to his desk and sat down heavily; so
heavily that little jets of wood-dust spurted through the
openwork pattern of the oil cloth. Saul Murmer sneezed. For some
time John Pater sat fluttering documents on the blotting pad
before him, really seeking some conversational opening with his
partner. At length, abandoning pretence, he swung round in the
protesting chair.</p>

<p>"Say, Saul," he sputtered, "have you ever noticed how certain
letters of the alphabet become associated with certain
nations?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer cooked a halt-open eye.</p>

<p>"For instance," continued the tall detective, "the letter M is
intimately connected with Italy You know: Mussolini, Marconi,
macaroni&mdash;and quite a number of other things."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer smiled. He gave the problem a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>"Bad deduction," he announced. "If you are going to argue on
those lines you're going to say that you have your own particular
'L'; Lyons, Latham, Lang, and&mdash;What's on your mind,
John?"</p>

<p>"I'm solo on the Salom Club affair." blurted the tall
detective, colouring slightly, "At least, solo except that
Sergeant Leyland is detailed as my assistant. I'm waiting for him
now. What I want to know is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" The baby blue eyes made a further appearance when John
Pater paused.</p>

<p>"Why aren't we working together as usual?" The colour in
Inspector Pater's cheeks deepened. "We've always been together
since you came out here, except when there's been a rush of
important cases&mdash;and that is not so now."</p>

<p>"There's no reason why we should not talk over things, if you
wish, John."</p>

<p>The very innocent eyes came fully into view. Almost a sigh of
relief escaped the Australian's compressed lips.</p>

<p>"Well, if you feel like that, Saul&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dixon has put me on to an English investigation," stated Saul
Murmer, awkwardly. He did not like deceiving his old comrade; yet
he could not say that he had requested Superintendent Dixon to
relieve him from participation in the Salom Club affair on the
grounds that it would negative certain investigations he had been
making into the club and its members.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good enough, Saul; yet I feel like a fish out of
water without you. And Leyland&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know I'll do what I can, John." The Englishman levered
himself more upright in the big chair. "Unofficially, of course,
in this case."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>The desk chair uttered its usual protest when John Pater swung
back to his blotting pad. It became a wail of anguish when the
Inspector, having retrieved the notes he wanted, swung again to
face the man in the window seat.</p>

<p>"Now, listen! Twenty minutes past one yesterday I received a
personal telephone call from Captain Artemus Pontifex, stating
that there had been an accident at his Salom Club. Sergeant
Leyland happened to be the only ranking officer in the common
room, so I took him along." John Pater hesitated a moment, then
continued: "Suppose that's the reason Dixon has foisted him on me
in the inquiry now."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Inspector Murmer wore an expression of utter
ignorance. "Why did Artemus Pontifex&mdash;or should I say,
Arthur Wesley&mdash;ask for you and not for Superintendent
Dixon?" He grinned. "Can't it be that Police Headquarters secrets
are public property, and that it is generally known that
Superintendent George Dixon invariably lunches between one and
two, or acquires a heavy grouch on everything for the rest of the
day?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater smiled sympathetically. "Well, anyway, he rang
me up, and I went. When I got to the Salom Club, Pontifex met me
at the front door and escorted me through the building." He broke
off suddenly. "Say, Saul, I never knew the place covered so much
ground."</p>

<p>"It is big," assented the Englishman. "You'll get to know how
big it is presently."</p>

<p>"Pontifex took us upstairs to the room where the 'accident'
happened," continued Pater. "Accident&mdash;I like that. The man
had been deliberately shot&mdash;through the head, left temple,
and at approximately a distance of four feet. The doctor
confirmed that when he arrived."</p>

<p>"Anyone else there?" John Pater turned and stared intently at
the Englishman for some seconds.</p>

<p>"Strange you should ask that question, Saul. I noticed that
Pontifex made considerable noise when we were going upstairs,
coughing and talking loudly. Warning someone, I thought. Leyland
agrees with that conclusion&mdash;one of the few times he agrees
with anyone. I'm certain there was someone in the passage outside
the murder-room and that Pontifex was warning them of the arrival
of the police. Still, when we got there, we saw no one." Pater
paused again. "I'll swear, though, I heard footsteps at the other
end of the passage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you do?" asked Saul Murmer lazily.</p>

<p>"Sent Leyland, with a couple of men to search the floor."</p>

<p>"And found?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul." Inspector Pater paused. "Yet I'll swear there
was someone up there while we were on the stairs."</p>

<p>The convenient cigarette stifled the inconvenient smile that
parted the cupid-bow of the Englishman's lips.</p>

<p>"Carry on," he commanded, when he could control his voice and
features.</p>

<p>"Well, we found no one." Inspector Pater paused. "I waited
about the doorway until Leyland returned. In the meantime the
fingerprint men and the photographers did their stuff."</p>

<p>"Then, with Leyland, you turned your attention to the room.
There was only the dead man. There wasn't a scrap of paper, nor a
fingerprint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's so." Inspector Pater nodded. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Guessed. Our modern murderers don't leave clues&mdash;only in
mystery books."</p>

<p>Yet Saul Murmer was astonished. How had Pontifex managed to
clean the room. It had been cleaned, because he had a suspicion
that the club proprietor had certain interests in the murder room
that he had waited outside the door until he knew Inspector Pater
was with the man. Almost he was sorry that he had not started the
investigation himself.</p>

<p>"Did you get the murdered man's name?" he asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Only as 'Mister' Catlow. Pontifex stated that he didn't know
the man's given name. He said there were three men in the room
most of the morning. They came soon after ten o'clock and were
taken up there by one of the cleaners. I had the man fetched, and
he said they were on perfectly friendly terms when he closed the
door on them."</p>

<p>"And the other men?"</p>

<p>"Names, Alfred Myson and Arthur Duller. I find that both of
them have English records. Catlow hasn't a record, so far as we
can discover at present, but, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Time will tell," suggested the sleepy-looking Inspector. "So,
Messrs. Myson and Duller were absent."</p>

<p>"And Pontifex swears there is only one way from the room to
the street&mdash;the way we came up."</p>

<p>"Yet there is another," said Saul Murmer firmly.</p>

<p>"I'll swear to that." John Pater waited a moment. "And I'll
find that other way if I have to pull the damned place to
pieces!"</p>

<p>"What did Pontifex have to say?" asked Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>"Quite a lot," Inspector Pater grinned. "I hope he didn't
think I believed it all. He lies like a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An angel," suggested the Englishman.</p>

<p>"I'm not specifying colour." John Pater grinned.</p>

<p>"What of the others on the premises?"</p>

<p>"All of them had clean alibis." The Australian looked
perplexed. "They all swear they had not been on the floor since
ten o'clock that morning&mdash;and they were all able to give
names of other attendants who had been in their company most of
the time." John Pater flushed angrily. "I'd have the cursed place
shut up if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it wasn't so useful to us." Saul Murmer wriggled round on
his chair and gave a little attention to the world outside the
window. "How many 'wanteds' have we plucked from the Salom tree
in our time, John?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater nodded. He realised that the Salom Club had to
be considered inviolate by the Police Department for the good of
the city and State.</p>

<p>For long moments there was silence in the room, broken by an
imperative knock on the door panel. He barked an irritated
permission to enter, and the door was thrust open.</p>

<p>There are types of police officers who do not endear
themselves to their associates. They are few, considering the
number of police enlisted for the preservation of law and order.
Of this class, Sergeant Lionel Leyland was not an average
example; he was far, far above the average&mdash;so far that
certain officers cursed under their breath at the mere mention of
his name.</p>

<p>Sergeant Lionel Leyland had a firm and implicit belief in
Sergeant Lionel Leyland, a belief that was only shared, for brief
periods, by the newest recruits to the plain-clothes squad. Also,
he had a grievance&mdash;and a wide flowing, dark-brown
moustache. He stroked both frequently, and Inspector Saul Murmer
declared that he could not decide which purred the loudest.</p>

<p>No-one, inside or outside the department, denied that Sergeant
Leyland was a fine figure of a man. He would never deny that
statement himself; his wife would not deny it. One of the
traditions of headquarters was that in the privacy of his
connubial chamber, Sergeant Leyland had established a full-length
plate glass mirror&mdash;and because of that proud possession,
was invariably late for duty. He dressed expensively, and rather
flashily, pluming himself that he was the "perfect gentleman" in
every grade of society.</p>

<p>Hyde Park nursemaids and chophouse waiters saw through this
deception. Arrayed in full-evening dress, he gave a very passable
imitation of a second grade variety comedian who, in making up,
had forgotten to paint his nose red.</p>

<p>Detective-Sergeant Lionel Leyland&mdash;he always, insisted on
the "detective" in reference to himself, and looked down on the
personnel of the uniformed branch with utter disdain&mdash;had
once informed Superintendent George Dixon that he had read every
published book on criminology. Geo. Dixon's reply became a
classic in the Department, though carefully guarded from the
common herd without headquarters' walls. In result, quite a fair
trade grew up between America and England on the one hand, and
Australia on the other, in pamphlets and superior tomes on such
subjects as "How to Become a Secret Service Agent;";
"Fingerprints and Crime;" "Be a Detective and Enjoy Fortune;" and
"The Fine Art of Criminal Detection."</p>

<p>At one time Sergeant Leyland wondered greatly at receiving
from the City of New York, U.S.A., a statement from the Police
Board that they regretted his application for the post of
Commissioner could not be entertained&mdash;on the grounds that
the present incumbent was still in good health. Incautiously, a
puzzled Sergeant Leyland spoke of this letter to a casual
intimate in the common room&mdash;and three very junior officers
celebrated well, though not too wisely, that night.</p>

<p>Following the imperative knock on the door of Inspector John
Pater's office, Sergeant Leyland strode into the room, announcing
an aggressive "good morning." Without invitation he drew forward
a chair and, seating himself, threw back the left lapel of his
coat. From an imposing array lining the top left-hand pocket of
his waistcoat he selected a long, black cigar and tucked it
carefully under the spreading moustache.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer coughed; he could not stand rank tobacco smoke.
Sergeant Leyland turned swiftly on his chair, and "froze" the
disturber in a super-concentrated glare. Sergeant Leyland
considered Inspector Murmer superfluous in New South Wales.
If Scotland Yard required any education in the ways of
Australian crooks then he, Sergeant Leyland, was quite willing,
for an adequate consideration, to journey there and devote his
profound wisdom for their instruction.</p>

<p>"Morning, Inspector." Lionel Leyland, confident that he had
won a Battle of Hastings over the English, turned his attention
to his superior officer <i>pro. tem.</i> "We've got work to do, I
believe." The inference that Inspector Murmer was unnecessary in
his own office was so obvious that the Englishman snuggled closer
into his comfortable chair.</p>

<p>John Pater grinned.</p>

<p>"About that Salom Club affair," continued the sergeant. "I had
a word with the Commissioner this morn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Inspector Pater stiffened.</p>

<p>"He's in the building, y' know." The sergeant's tones
suggested that his Inspector was derelict in duty not to be aware
of that important fact. "He came in at the gate with me,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John, you were speaking of the association of letters of the
alphabet in certain countries." Saul Murmer's voice was low and
pleasant. "I rather doubted your conclusions at the moment, but
now&mdash;now I am beginning to think we have but own particular
'L' in this very building."</p>

<p>Inspector Pater's laughter intrigued Sergeant Leyland. He
swung round on his chair and stared hostilely at the stout figure
in the chair before the window.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Didn't the Commissioner make one?" queried John Pater.</p>

<p>"He did say 'Good morning,'" added Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>A dim idea was penetrating Sergeant Leyland's mind that in
some unfathomable manner the joke was on him. He faced Inspector
Pater squarely, a very cold shoulder turned towards the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"About this Salom Club affair," he repeated, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Yes?" replied John Pater. "Have you brought in Myson and
Buller?"</p>

<p>"I think we should have a conference in private," stated the
Sergeant.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;what?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"A conference." Sergeant Leyland was emphatic. John Pater
dared not meet the police officer's eyes. He stared past him and
found Saul Murmer's face. One eye in the placid round face gently
opened and closed. Inspector Pater gained the impression that he
had been winked at.</p>

<p>"Is there an office-boy in the department?" asked Saul Murmer
of the disgruntled plane-tree without his office window. "They're
awfully useful&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"I think a conference should be postponed until these men have
been brought in," suggested John Pater.</p>

<p>"Buller has a nasty reputation," suggested Saul Murmer
dreamily. "He used to carry a gun in England; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, a gun!" Sergeant Leyland was contemptuous.</p>

<p>"He used it&mdash;on occasions," continued Inspector Murmer.
He knew the Sergeant's horror of firearms in the hands of
crooks.</p>

<p>"I believe both Buller and Myson have reputations as killers."
Inspector Pater choked on the words. Saul Murmer chuckled
gleefully at the picture John Pater's words conjured up. Myson, a
slinking hypocrite, frightened at his own shadow, with a gun in
his hand, his back against a wall, the spectre of the noose at
the end of a rope behind the oncoming police, throwing lead to
resist capture, was enticing. Suddenly the plane-tree in the yard
became intensely interesting.</p>

<p>"They're both big men," he contributed over his shoulder, when
he could trust his voice. "I wouldn't care to tackle either of
them single-handed."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland bridled. "I'll take a few men and bring them
in at once. But&mdash;" his aggressiveness shed, "I think a
conference would be advisable before we move in the matter."</p>

<p>"A conference? No, I think not. You know all the facts,
Sergeant." Inspector Pater was now very official. "Please keep
away from Pontifex; I'll handle him. Take Matthews with you to
track down Myson and Buller; he's a good man. I don't think you
will require anyone else, until you have located your men."</p>

<p>"Located my men!" Sergeant Leyland rose suddenly. "I'll have
them both downstairs this afternoon."</p>

<p>Conscious that he had not made the impression he had intended,
Sergeant Leyland swung on his heels and strode to the
door&mdash;one long step. He caught at the handle and pulled
suddenly, forgetting to turn it; then swore under his handsome
moustache. He wrenched again, turning the handle, and the door
swung open. As he made to go through the doorway he drew back
abruptly. A constable was standing outside. As the sergeant drew
back, the man entered the room.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Inspector Pater."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer's cupid-bow lips pursued in a soundless whistle as
a slender man of medium height, very blonde, and faultlessly
dressed, walked into the room. He passed the upright Sergeant
without so much as a glance. Sergeant Leyland sniffed officially,
and waited.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Arthur Buller," said the Englishman
sweetly. "Delighted to see you in New South Wales."</p>

<p>"Buller!" Sergeant Leyland took a step forward, his right hand
raised aggressively.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sergeant." Inspector Pater's voice cut like the
snap of a whip. "I will let you know when I require you. Please
shut the door after you, carefully."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="first">QUITE a large number of persons, particularly
those of the gentler sex, may be unable to locate the
Commonwealth Bank, Parliament House, or their local suburban
lock-up, but few of these persons would fail to take honours in
an examination regarding the precise location of "Florabella" in
Sydney.</p>

<p>A lady writer, whose articles adorn a well-known newspaper,
once described "Florabella" as "the inner shrine of modernistic
fashions." Dizzy Laine, by accident, for he is not a reader of
"ladies' realms," saw the article and, cutting it out, forwarded
it to Lieut-Col. Malcolm Wade, the noted press agent for
"Florabella," and with soaring hopes whenever chance or work took
him into the presence of the proprietress. Unfortunately the
gallant colonel, in an excessive desire to please, used the
phrase in an advertisement, thereby evoking derisive comments
from those Sydney journals who delight in exposing the errors of
their contemporaries. He is still endeavouring to live down the
affair.</p>

<p>For the information of the insignificant one per cent of
Sydney's population who live in abysmal ignorance, it may be
recorded that "Florabella" is situated in Swayne Row, a very
quiet backwater to the strenuous flowing stream of humanity in
Pitt Street. Its exclusiveness is not only due to the fact that
Swayne Row is a "cul-de-sac."</p>

<p>Swayne Row is more a square than a row and, supreme dignity,
it is paved with huge blocks of time-weathered stone on which
stand large green painted pots overflowing with ambitious shrubs.
Between these green pots are iron seats frequently re-painted, to
the startled horror of cavaliers who serve, long standing and
waiting.</p>

<p>Swayne Row is not exclusive to "Florabella." Its square
contains Manson's Parlour, where hats of extreme simplicity sell
at prices that make bank managers gasp with envy. "Viola" also
has a place in "The Row," and "Viola's" cosmetics have a value
that sometimes make even well-trained husbands groan in their
sleep. "The Capstone" library and bridge club occupies a
supposedly private house at the far end of the Row. As a library,
it contains exactly 24 books, handsomely bound in vellum and
carefully locked in a glass case. As a bridge club, it has 70
tables, and imports its cards direct from England.</p>

<p>Behind Manson's Parlour, "Viola," and "The Capstone" in the
revolution against "Florabella's" exclusiveness in "The Row" are
a few minor establishments, such as "Alford's," who will supply
furs straight from highly subsidised animals all over the world,
at appropriate prices. Lieutenant to "Alford's" is "The
Afternoon," specialising in confections, not the confections
dispensed by "Florabella" and other establishments who pander to
the outer woman, but confections succulent and tasty, meet only
for those who do not take two bites at a 20-shilling cherry,
glacé or otherwise. "The Afternoon" claims to be more exclusive
than "Florabella," and the "Mrs. Suburbia" who happens to have a
wealthy squatter cousin to escort her to afternoon tea there,
boasts of the episode for the rest of her life. Other lady
subordinates who have no wealthy cousins, yet get escorts who can
afford "The Afternoon," go there at the risk of their
reputations.</p>

<p>Entering Swayne Row from Pitt Street and dodging the banked
array of potted shrubs screening this holiest of holies from
public gaze, the adventurer may notice a small script sign on a
modest doorway. Only the word "Florabella"&mdash;but that is
sufficient. Next to the door is a framed space&mdash;in other
streets called a shop window. This is always camouflaged as a
lady's boudoir, with one, and perhaps the most essential, wall
missing. The scene portrayed by a display artist who considers
that Cabinet Ministers are ill-remunerated for their labours,
usually consists of a glove, carelessly dropped, R.U.C., a
flop-jack, open, with accompanying puff, on a chair, L.D.C., a
carpet, that looks as if it had been imported direct from
Aladdin's Cave, all over the stage, a lady, of a beauty and
cubist possibilities unimagined by modern artists, C., dressed in
a "Florabella" creation, a stock, so squat and ugly that its
value must be enormous, I.D.C., and a mirror, B.U.C., of a design
so exquisite that any French queen must surely have lost her head
over it.</p>

<p>Of the contents of the "boudoir," only shows the front view of
the creation; the mirror, a very realistic view of where the back
of the dress will be when "Florabella's" designers and
work-people have had time to finish the model. The door to "the
inner shrine of modernistic fashions" opens far more easily than
the door to Aladdin's Cave. Male creatures, attending their
womenfolk on visits to "Florabella" have listened intently for
the magic password of entrance, only to be disillusioned when
stumbling over a very diminutive page in russet-brown livery.
They venture a few steps forward, to be halted by a twin brother
of the doorkeeper, who relieves them of hat, stick, gloves and
other such articles of male attire as it is considered indiscreet
to admit into "The Shrine."</p>

<p>It is peculiar to "Florabella" that while male visitors must
be stripped to the ultimate of decency, furs, bags, handkerchiefs
of remotest use, umbrellas, lipsticks, powder-puffs of strange
shapes and unknown origins, books, hats, gloves, and such
oddities of feminine attendance, are scattered about in
bewildering profusion&mdash;and rarely miss finding their
exclusive owners when required.</p>

<p>The space in "Florabella" between the door and the "Inner
Shrine" is described by Miss Westways and her staff of beautiful
mannequins as "The Vestibule." Here ordinary male cavaliers are
strongly discouraged from thoughts of further explorations,
provided with literature entirely feminine and leaving nothing to
their feeble imaginations, and left to their own devices. The
furnishings of this vestibule are melancholy, reminding the male
intruder very painfully of his last visit to his
dentist&mdash;the analogy is obvious, unless he has forgotten his
cheque-book.</p>

<p>On rare occasions, such as the first visit of an adoring,
just-returned-from-the-honeymoon bridegroom in attendance on his
bride, or favoured male things on Miss Westways' private list of
privileges, are males allowed to penetrate beyond the vestibule.
In ordinary, they emerge from the "Inner Shrine" mopping heated
brows with very damp handkerchiefs, wilted collars and hoarse
voices mumbling strange sequences of figures and words, in which
one word, "Bankruptcy" appears to be predominant. In 99.9 per
cent of cases where a second visit is proposed, the male half of
the proposed expedition invariably "has to see a man about a
loan!"</p>

<p>It may be added that "Florabella" is a word very strictly
barred in Australia's clubland, and heatedly spoken in the
offices of lawyers who specialise in arranging domestic
differences.</p>

<p>Dizzy Laine, by virtue of his standing as super-journalist of
Sydney's leading daily, his preponderance of Irish blood, and a
definitely adventurous spirit not yet properly haltered by
matrimony, is a frequent visitor to "Florabella"&mdash;not only
to the vestibule, but to the "Inner Shrine." Diminutive
doorkeepers, cloakroom attendants and messengers, respectfully
salute him, beam broadly at his jokes; mannequins smile on him,
and head-girls nod most cordially. Mrs. Dizzy Laine says she has
suspicions, but so far has made the statement with a smile.</p>

<p>For Dizzy, Miss Westways always has a greeting, while Miss
Lancing, who considers herself the main pillar of the structure,
relaxes her habitual frown&mdash;and almost smiles. In fact Dizzy
is a privileged person at "Florabella," yet even he has not dared
to penetrate to regions where bare shoulders flash, silk rustles,
and women are more than natural.</p>

<p>Almost at the moment when Inspector Murmer introduces Arthur
Buller, of London, to Inspector Pater, of Sydney, and prepares
for an interesting talk, Mrs. Eva Laine, followed by Miss Paddy
Burke, and a "husband," enters the guarded door inscribed
"Florabella." Dizzy is buttoning up his coat. The gesture is
instinctive but, peculiarly, most male things who penetrate
"Florabella" button up their coats&mdash;and if possible their
pockets. A few original souls have a habit of discovering about
this time, that they have left pocket books and cheque books at
their offices. Dizzy does not descend to such subterfuges. Mrs.
Dizzy Laine is a practical woman, and realises the limitations of
her husband's income.</p>

<p>In the vestibule, Dizzy surrenders hat, gloves and stick. He
also makes to pull off a signet ring he wears on his left little
finger, and hoist from nether pockets key-container and cash.
This gesture merely excites the attendant page to derision. He
winks and coolly turns a diminutive back.</p>

<p>Paddy Burke led through the Inner rooms. Here she was queen in
her throne-room, saluting mannequins, show-girls and apprentices
with swift smiles and complexly-worded greetings. Beyond the
second display room, which to masculine eyes held nothing to
display, she opens a door leading into a room which, at first
glance, appears to be a luxuriously furnished boudoir. In
reality, it is "Miss Westways" private office.</p>

<p>Dizzy, instructed male, knows that the general business
offices lay still further forward towards the heart of the
establishment, opening directly on to Marlowe Lane, another
backwater from the Pitt Street stream.</p>

<p>This afternoon Miss Westways was seated at a Chippendale
writing table of apparently fabulous value. She glanced up as the
girl impetuously entered the room, smiled at her, and nodded to
Dizzy and Eva, then returned to her letter, Paddy whispered to
Eva, who nodded, and whispered shortly to her lord and master.
Both girls then disappeared through another door.</p>

<p>Dizzy, understanding that he had received the equivalent to
the dog order: "Lie down," obeys by staring intently at etchings
by famous Australian artists decorating the walls of the
boudoir-office.</p>

<p>"Where are the girls?", asked Miss Westways, her letter
finished, speaking through the intimate gesture of sealing
it.</p>

<p>"I blush to think; I fear to guess," answered Dizzy sombrely.
"Yesterday I received a pay-envelope&mdash;this visit to-day is
significant."</p>

<p>Miss Westways laughed. "Eva won't sting you," she declared.
Then, abruptly; "Have you seen Inspector Murmer lately?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask <i>me</i> that?" An emphasis on the "me"
brought a slight colour to Miss Westways' cheeks. She hastened to
reply.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> haven't seen him for weeks," announced
Dizzy&mdash;and the accent was again noted by the lady. "Not
since the night before last when he so callously absorbed our
suppers."</p>

<p>"The night at the Green Lagoon," supplemented the lady.</p>

<p>Dizzy ignored the correction. He was busy interviewing a
Norman Lindsay portrait of a lady who, obviously, did not
patronise "Florabella"&mdash;or any other known
<i>modiste</i>.</p>

<p>"I have had another of those strange letters," said Miss
Westways after a pause.</p>

<p>"Is Inspector Murmer calling?" asked Dizzy of the lady in the
picture.</p>

<p>"I have not informed him of this letter." Miss Westways tones
were frigid.</p>

<p>"He is a detective&mdash;or supposed to be one," protested the
journalist. "I happen to know that he draws immense sums from the
Government, on that supposition."</p>

<p>Miss Westways laughed again. "You are a very ridiculous young
man, Dizzy. I don't know how Eva puts up with you, unless the
<i>Post-Advertiser</i> bribes her to keep you in good humour."
Miss Westways hesitated, then added: "After all, there cannot be
anything in those stupid drawings."</p>

<p>"Have you asked Saul Murmer?" suggested Dizzy, who possessed a
single-track mind.</p>

<p>"I do not see the slightest necessity to trouble Inspector
Murmer. He has been most kind in bearing with my stupid
complains&mdash;And, after all, what are they but simply
childish, meaningless drawings."</p>

<p>Dizzy could not answer. He had been married ten months, and
already could have passed an elementary examination in the
feminine art of saying one thing and meaning another. He devoted
himself to a more critical survey of the feminine figure divine,
as depicted by the famous Australian artist. The silence grew
oppressive, Dizzy began to worry. Feminine silence is not
soothing; it frequently betokens a rising anger.</p>

<p>Carefully addressing the portrait of a lady who had lately
forgotten her slimming exercises, he spoke:</p>

<p>"When I was young, we were forced to learn Euclid's definition
of a straight line." His voice was very mournful.</p>

<p>Eva Laine entered the room quietly at the moment Dizzy spoke.
She glanced from her husband to Miss Westways, then back to her
lord.</p>

<p>"What is troubling my poor darling?" she asked. Not receiving
an immediate answer, she went to a couch and curled herself up
thereon, in excellent imitation of a domestic cat. "Don't be
frightened, Mattie, Dizzy talks like that. He hasn't taken to
writing verse&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Waste of time," grumbled the journalist, "while the artists
are usurping all the privileges of our highbrow poets. Where's
Paddy?"</p>

<p>"Very, very much engaged," smiled Mrs. Laine. "I'm sorry,
dear, but you will have to put up with the undiluted society of
your lawful spouse&mdash;at least for a time."</p>

<p>"Another straight line," complained Dizzy.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Eva bridled, laughed, and subsided again on the
couch. "Mattie, Dizzy called either me, or this gown which you
own&mdash;if he hasn't yet paid your bill&mdash;a straight
line."</p>

<p>The newspaper-man grinned suddenly. "That's all right,
darling," he soothed. "I'm talking Einstein, not Euclid&mdash;and
he says there's no such thing."</p>

<p>"No such what?"</p>

<p>"No straight lines, lovey. He says everything in this world is
like beautiful women, discreet and lovely curves, expending into
space."</p>

<p>Eva Laine's eyes roved perplexedly round the room. Suddenly
the frown on her brow lightened. "Oh, now I understand, dear
boy." She slipped to her feet with the facile grace women
acquire, and strolled to where her husband stood. "You're
studying art?"</p>

<p>"Well, these artists appear to know women."</p>

<p>"Apparently." Mrs. Laine glanced disapprovingly at the lovely
damsel pictured in the water-colour. "Yes. Apparently."</p>

<p>Miss Westways' smile developed into silvery laughter. Someone
knocked at the door. Miss Westways answered, and one of the
diminutive pages entered and whispered a message.</p>

<p>"Show him here," said Miss Westways. There was a slight
increase of colour beneath her rouge as he turned to Eva Laine;
"Inspector Murmer has called."</p>

<p>"As Saul says: 'Where the carcase is&mdash;'" commented
Dizzy.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked his lady.</p>

<p>"Miss Westways has informed me she has had another of those
peculiar letters," explained the newspaperman patiently. He
turned to Miss Westways: "I told you he was a detective!"</p>

<p>The ladies exchanged significant glances, and Miss Westways
coloured again, Eva returned to her lounge, and Dizzy to his art
studies.</p>

<p>The door opened to admit Inspector Murmer. He glanced quickly
and somewhat furtively about the room, then went straight to Miss
Westways. Dizzy sensed that the stout Englishman was
instinctively seeking shelter, and grinned. It was certainly
something of an ordeal for a man, especially a bachelor, to
penetrate "Florabella" for the first time. He laughed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Saul," he said. "I was just mentioning detectives.
Miss Westways has had another of those peculiar missives."</p>

<p>"Have you?" Eva Laine turned interestedly to the elder
lady.</p>

<p>From a drawer of the table at which she sat Miss Westways took
a mauve envelope and handed it to Inspector Murmer. He examined
it carefully and placed it in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Nothing else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet." Miss Westways shrugged slightly. "No
doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer waited politely for the lady to finish her
sentence. When she did not, he shrugged agreement with what she
had said.</p>

<p>"I want to have a stroll about your establishment," he said,
after a slight pause.</p>

<p>"My hero!" Dizzy, made admiring gestures. "Do you really mean
that, Saul?"</p>

<p>"Is it so very dreadful," asked Miss Westways, smiling.</p>

<p>"He's unmarried," objected Eva. "Mattie, you mustn't submit
the innocence of an Englishman&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dizzy guffawed,</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, addressing his wife. "They boast of living
next door to Paris and yet preserving their pristine puritan
impeccability."</p>

<p>Miss Westways touched a bell on her desk. Immediately the door
opened, and one of the diminutive pages entered.</p>

<p>"Lawrence, will you please escort Inspector Murmer through the
establishment. He is to go wherever he requires."</p>

<p>"Mortals rush in&mdash;" Dizzy buttoned up his jacket and drew
a lugubrious face. "Saul, I will accompany you, whistling
appropriate music from an appropriate oratorio. Let the obsequies
proceed!" He nodded to the page, who swung the door open, with a
smart salute.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer, passing the page, suddenly stopped and looked at
the youngster in some perplexity.</p>

<p>"I know." Dizzy's expression was painfully solemn, "Miss
Westways, Inspector Murmer wants to know where you get 'em." He
turned to the waiting detective. "No, old man, he's not the one
who showed you in here. Miss Westways has 'em by the dozens.
Where they come from&mdash;page-boys to order, out of a box,
alike even to the last trousers button&mdash;I don't know. The
only explanation I have to offer is that either she, or Miss
Lancing, breeds them."</p>

<p>A well-aimed cushion caught the famous journalist on the side
of the head. It was followed by a wifely voice; "Dizzy!" A pause.
"You're too ridiculous. Please don't take any notice of him, Mr.
Murmer."</p>

<p>"Motion out of order." Dizzy was irrepressible. "He's noticed
the specimen. I quite agree with you, Saul. This establishment
should he officered by girls only&mdash;and the prettier the
better. But then I understand Miss Westways' designers find these
boys very useful. They expose their creation to their critical
gaze. You know the old proverb: 'When youth blushes, strong men
grasp the lifeline.' Will you have to report this to the Child
Welfare Department, Inspector&mdash;or the Home for
Incurables?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer laughed. He turned to the waiting page, "Lead on,
friend," he ordered, "I want to see everything."</p>

<p>"You mean that?" Dizzy gasped, moaned, and braced his
shoulders. "Never let it be said that Dizzy let a friend down. I
am with you every inch of the way." He bowed solemnly to his
wife. "Eva, you may go home and prepare the prodigal's fatted
calf."</p>

<p>"You're sure to bring him home," stated Mrs. Laine, with
emphasis. "I'm not so sure about the prodigal."</p>

<p>"Woman, I have taken on my shoulders the duty of chaperon,
without tremor or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The closing door cut short the sentence. Eva Laine looked at
Miss Westways, and laughed. Then, somewhere in her mind was bred
the thought; Chaperones would be advisable for the weaker
sex&mdash;in <i>modiste</i> establishments. She was going to
speak, when something in the older lady's expression attracted
her attention.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mattie?"</p>

<p>Miss Westways did not answer immediately. She drew a letter on
the desk towards her, then pushed it away again. Very quietly she
turned to face Eva, "Eva, I know what those sketches mean now."
In spite of her self control her voice trembled.</p>

<p>Eva stared unbelievingly. "Then&mdash;why didn't you
tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I dare not." Miss Westways buried her face in her hands. "Oh,
I dare not."</p>

<p>"But Inspector Murmer is searching the place."</p>

<p>"I know." Miss Westways looked up, speaking almost hopefully:
"But he won't find anything."</p>

<p>"Not find anything?" exclaimed Eva, puzzled.</p>

<p>"No." The elder lady straightened, her face drawn and grim.
"No, he won't find anything, for it isn't there&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" Eva spoke after a pause. "Surely, Mattie, if
you know what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know&mdash;not until Dizzy told me. At least, I
wasn't sure."</p>

<p>"Dizzy?" Eva went round the desk and put her hand on the elder
woman's shoulder. "What does Dizzy know. You know he wouldn't do
anything to hurt you."</p>

<p>"He can't. Dizzy doesn't know what he knows." Miss Westways'
voice held a more hopeful note. "No, Dizzy doesn't know&mdash;but
he said something, and then&mdash;then I guessed."</p>

<p>"Eva, he was strolling round the room in that queer, restless
manner of his, looking at the etchings, and he said
something&mdash;something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" The girl interjected gently.</p>

<p>"He told me&mdash;he said something, and then I knew&mdash;and
oh, Eva, I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"Tell Inspector Murmer," replied Eva, sensibly and promptly.
"If you're in a fix, he'll get you out of it. That I do
know."</p>

<p>"That's just what I daren't do." Miss Westways was gathering
her courage in both hands. "No, Eva, I daren't do that. I don't
know what he might think, if he knew."</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="first">IT was strange for Detective-Inspector Saul
Murmer to feel nervous&mdash;and he did not like the feeling.
More, it was unusual&mdash;and in the male sex the unusual is not
welcomed. On the other hand, ladies delight in the
unusual&mdash;they seek and welcome it. In the same manner, they
love and adore strong silent men; they delight in being abducted;
or being forced into marriage with utter strangers, or near
strangers&mdash;or so our lady novelists instruct us.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer was not subject to nerves. In his days he had
followed and interviewed gentlemen who carried much lethal
artillery on their persons. On one occasion, on the track of an
absconding bank manager, he had suffered shipwreck; other persons
of legal interest he had followed into the wild parts of the
world. During the war days, and until increasing girth suffered a
closer attention to gravitation, he had suffered aeroplanes which
should not have been licensed, except to members of the Suicide
Club&mdash;if such an organisation really exists.</p>

<p>Yet none of these slight episodes had induced such nervous
tremors as he felt when following his diminutive guide into the
bowels of "Florabella." He looked down on the lad in russet-brown
striding manfully before him, and smiled, and almost felt glad
that Dizzy Laine was but a few paces in the rear, although that
half-whistled, half-hissed funeral dirge was distinctly
irritating. The boy before him intrigued, and he could not but
compare bulk. Then, his surrounds were strange.</p>

<p>He smiled at the thought of the <i>modiste</i> establishment
being paged by these boys&mdash;all small, all uniformed, and as
alike as two peas in a pod. He viewed his guide again; boy,
cherub, or demon? Like all good Englishmen, he had a nodding
acquaintance with the work of Dante Gabriel Rosetti, and a simile
rose to his mind. Was he proceeding on an investigation of one of
the circles of the Inferno&mdash;a circle of which the noted
author had never dreamed: for the ladies of his days and
imaginations were definite; They were either fully
dressed&mdash;or definitely not.</p>

<p>Through every room and corridor he trod warily, knowing that
he was in "Florabella," where every male thing, except the
page-boys, trod warily. Door after door swung open before the
pressure applied by "Lawrence the Small."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer noticed, with some astonishment, that there were
no apparent locks to these doors&mdash;also that "Lawrence the
Small" had many apparent blood-brothers&mdash;and no bashfulness.
With superb aplomb, the boy led amid a wealth of ladies, and the
detective discovered with misgivings that there were more species
of femininity than he, in his abysmal ignorance, had imagined. He
saw women, tall, short, medium; fat, thin, medium; fair, dark,
medium; curved, straight, medium. In time he almost came to
believe that "medium" was a natural state of womanhood; yet he
could see that "mediums" were individualistic to a degree.</p>

<p>Pondering this new problem, yet keeping a wary eye open for
the unusual, the Inspector decided that women, in bulk, were
unusual, but that they did not appear so in average life because
of a leavening of males restoring surroundings to normality. At
length, after what appeared miles of indirect travelling,
"Lawrence the Small" stopped at a door and knocked. Now Saul
Murmer realised that for some time he had been missing
something.</p>

<p>He looked round and realised that Dizzy Laine was not marching
in his rear, offending the air with his absurd rendering of a
funeral dirge. He shrugged, and as it waiting for his thoughts to
order, a rather high-pitched, feminine voice called permission to
enter.</p>

<p>The page-boy pushed the door open, and stood on one side,
saluting, as the detective entered the room. Saul Murmer stepped
forward&mdash;to halt abruptly. Now he realised that he was up
against the goods "Florabella" sold. His ordered mind asked a
quick question: What in this year of grace did women call their
attire? Mentally, he named them dresses, but some instinct told
him that the word of his youth had slipped into a feminine
discard. Frocks, he thought, might pass; robes appeared taboo;
creations might at a pinch&mdash;His mind revolted at the
subterfuge; he could only name them to himself "scraps."</p>

<p>And colours! He had never realised that the prism could
contain so many varieties. He was certain that if some wandering
rainbow managed to gain entry into this 'holiest of holies' it
would hide its face in very shame. The rainbow! Saul Murmer
smiled. No rainbow could compete in this bewildering fantasy of
colour, reflected by mirrors set side by side in kaleidoscopic
bewilderment. For the first time since he had donned trousers he
doubted the dominance of the male sex. No male, he mentally
vowed, could equal, much less surpass, the composure of this
tall, cold, graceful, sinuously-majestic creature who floated
down the length of the bewildering room to greet him.</p>

<p>"Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer to see you, miss," chanted
the attendant imp. "Miss Westways asked me to bring him to you.
I'm to wait for him, miss, and take him wherever he wants to
go."</p>

<p>Followed the quick "chocolate soldier" salute which had
amused, while bewildering, the Inspector when he had first
entered the establishment. Then the boy sprung round on his
heels, like a gigolo performing an intricate dance evolution, and
disappeared behind a "something" that flowed voluminously on the
ground while hanging by two insecure-looking threads from what
might be mistaken for the torso of a woman.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Miss Lancing.</p>

<p>"Miss Muriel Lancing?" questioned the police officer. He
didn't really doubt if there were more than one Miss Lancing. It
was the only thing he could think of to say at the moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, Inspector," The blonde coiffure before him nodded; a
smile, apparently at the very obvious confusion of the strange
male thing before her, parted the brilliantly-red, well-curved
lips. For a moment Miss Lancing looked almost human, and the
detective cautiously raised his eyes to hers. He decided her eyes
looked encouraging, and continued to look.</p>

<p>"I should like&mdash;" he commenced.</p>

<p>"It is rather&mdash;" The lady said, at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Overwhelming," continued the detective, and paused.</p>

<p>"Perhaps to the average male," said the manageress, but her
eyes distinctly bid the Inspector remove himself from the
"average male" class.</p>

<p>"Do many gentlemen visit here?" asked the Inspector, as he
thought, daringly.</p>

<p>"Well, no," Muriel Lancing smiled dazzlingly. "Perhaps,
Inspector, you may prefer to come to my office. I can spare you
ten minutes, then Lady Short&mdash;"</p>

<p>A picture of the lady mentioned rose before Saul Murmer's
mind's eye. Involuntarily, he glanced back at the rather narrow
door through which he had wedged a way. Could Lady
Short&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is rather&mdash;er&mdash;" assented Miss Lancing,
becoming still more human.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer's eyes wandered from the door to the "models"
surrounding him.</p>

<p>"Does she&mdash;" There was awe in his voice. Mere words could
not convey; his impressions of what the lady under discussion
would look like in one of the&mdash;er&mdash;by which he was
surrounded.</p>

<p>"Lady Short does not come into this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Saul Murmer sighed with relief. As a conscientious
police officer he would have had to report to his Inspector if
Miss Lancing had answered in any other way. Visions of an
overflowing&mdash;Resolutely he put thought and vision from
him.</p>

<p>Muriel Lancing was walking down aisles of reflections, and
Saul Murmer found himself following. She came to a door, and from
behind the Inspector flashed a russet-brown streak, to hold the
door open for them. In the office the lady motioned to a
comfortable looking chair, and seated herself, very upright,
before a small desk.</p>

<p>"Now, Inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>With effort&mdash;easier because he was now in a room freed
from the "models" that had daunted him in the hall of
mirrors&mdash;Saul Murmer took from his breast pocket the
envelope Miss Westways had given him a few minutes previously. He
opened it and took out the crude drawing.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything like this before, Miss Lancing?" he
asked. "Please have a good look at it."</p>

<p>Miss Lancing, glanced briefly at the sheet of paper, and
nodded. "Yes," she said brightly. "Miss Westways showed me that
some days ago. It is a&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;er&mdash;," repeated Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the lady, rather flatly.</p>

<p>"What does it look like?" asked the Inspector,
insistently.</p>

<p>"Really, I don't think I have ever seen anything it could
resemble&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"You have no cases coming here? Cases containing&mdash;" the
Inspector stumbled at the word, "dresses&mdash;imported
models&mdash;it could by any chance resemble."</p>

<p>Miss Lancing took the sheet of paper and studied the drawing
attentively. Very slowly she shook her head. "I don't think so."
Yet she hesitated. "But my work lies more with our clients than
with the unpacking and receipt&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer pondered. Miss Lancing was difficult. He believed
she could help him considerably&mdash;if he could persuade her to
speak freely.</p>

<p>"You have a warehouse attached to this establishment?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then the warehouse-man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The wardrobe mistress&mdash;" corrected the manageress.</p>

<p>"The wardrobe mistress unpacks the dresses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Models," suggested Miss Lancing reprovingly.</p>

<p>"&mdash;the models." corrected the detective hastily.
Evidently it was the eighth deadly sin to name these wisps of
silk and lace 'Dresses.' "Your wardrobe mistress unpacks
these&mdash;er&mdash;models and sends them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Her attendants carry them, one by one, with the greatest
care, into the room we lately left, or into this room&mdash;"
Miss Lancing rose gracefully from her chair, and pushed open
another door of her office, holding it wide open for the
Inspector to view the room beyond.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer's first impression of the room he now gazed on was
that the miracle of Lot's wife had been repeated infinite times.
Then he realised that he was viewing representations of feminine
beauty: statues that even the great exemplar of Australian
feminine loveliness could not have imagined in his wildest
nightmares. But they held one trait in common with that great
artist's creations. Saul Murmer felt grateful to the many
black-gowned young ladies, who were busy supplying the
defects.</p>

<p>While he gazed the detective noted one of the attendants pick
up one of her "salted" sisters and carry her bodily through
another door.</p>

<p>"Just so!" said Saul Murmer hastily&mdash;and retreated to the
safety of his chair. "Then&mdash;" Miss Lancing hesitated a
moment. When the detective did not speak, she called
"Lawrence."</p>

<p>The familiar sprite chained to her service appeared at the
Inspector's side, gazing expectantly at the manageress.</p>

<p>"Miss Alberts, please." Miss Lancing rose gracefully and
extended her hand, palm down, to the Inspector. He wondered if he
was expected to kiss the rosy-tinged finger-tips&mdash;and
discovered that he would not mind.</p>

<p>"One moment, please." Saul Murmer turned at the door. He was
growing accustomed to his strange surroundings, and bolder. For
the moment he realised that the man who invented "familiarity
breeds contempt" had been ill-remunerated for his wisdom,
whatever he had received.</p>

<p>"Miss Lancing, certain&mdash;er&mdash;peculiar happenings have
attended the receipt of these&mdash;ah&mdash;sketches, by Miss
Westways. Have you experienced any of
these&mdash;er&mdash;happenings?"</p>

<p>Miss Lancing's red lips had parted to speak when the door
opened and Dizzy Laine strolled into the office.</p>

<p>"Mr. Laine!" said the lady, and flushed.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Muriel! Finished with the Inspector?" The
newspaper-man looked curiously about the room.</p>

<p>"Where's Paddy&mdash;I thought she was here playing
chaperone."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Laine, you must not wander about this
establishment, in the manner you do!" Miss Lancing was cross.
"One of these days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Muriel, dear!" Dizzy grinned. "You forget, I'm a
married man&mdash;one of the sub-initiates&mdash;a past master in
the wedded arts. Don't forget, girls can't always get into your
what-do-you-call-'ems alone, and not all husbands can draw
cheques for maids. Fact is, I'm an expert at hooks and eyes,
zips, tapes, and all such things. Eva's a great teacher and her
opinion of thumb-fingers&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question, Miss Lancing," suggested
Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>Before the lady could counter this bold assertion of masculine
individuality in an essentially feminine domain, Dizzy
interposed:</p>

<p>"I will. Remember the 'robot' case, Muriel? That looked like
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like what?" asked Saul Murmer sharply. Neither the man nor
the woman answered. Miss Lancing paled slightly, Dizzy was
smiling, grimly.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" said the lady at length; yet her rouge stood out
startlingly on her pale cheeks. "I&mdash;suppose it did look like
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a what?" asked the detective again</p>

<p>"Like a coffin." Miss Lancing spoke almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Well?" The Inspector looked first at the lady, then at the
journalist. It was the latter who supplied the desired
information.</p>

<p>"A new thing-a-my-bob came here the other day&mdash;one of
those things that look nothing like a woman, yet which they put
their what-do-you-call-ems on. You know, a body which looks as if
it had been copied from a lady who had overdone her slimming
exercises, with a head that could give the best&mdash;or
worst&mdash;gargoyle five points in every hundred, and a bit of
iron where a lady should wear her walking apparatus." Dizzy was
getting a bit mixed in his description. "Funny, the case
containing her ladyship looked just like a coffin. And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night it was smashed to matchwood," stated Miss Lancing
frigidly.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the figure"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the case." The lady laughed suddenly. "Oh, this is
all too ridiculous for words."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I'll see what's left of the case." Inspector Murmer
spoke alertly. "Where is it? In the warehouse?"</p>

<p>Miss Lancing nodded. "I'll go with you," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble, Muriel," Dizzy drawled, moving towards the
door, "Come on, Saul, I'm your chaperon."</p>

<p>He glanced down as Lawrence slipped past him and thrust the
door open. "Hullo, kid! What are you going to do after a spot of
growing?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled impishly at the tall journalist. "I'll have to
get another job then," he answered.</p>

<p>"What's the fancy?" Dizzy leaned against the door-post.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be a physical instructor, sir."</p>

<p>"Humph!" The newspaper-man looked down on four-feet nothing,
and smiled. "Why not a gigolo? There were days when petticoats
were only slung around waists, and when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dizzy!" called Miss Lancing, warningly.</p>

<p>"Ever studied art, Saul?" Dizzy quieted the manageress with a
wide wink. "You should. Especially the modern art of our futurist
painters. You'd learn then why petticoats are not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to see the broken packing-case?"
Miss Lancing had again become the frigid icicle of modern
<i>modiste</i> art, with only the outward semblance of
humanity.</p>

<p>"You should see the packing-cases Norman Lindsay stands his
girlies on." Dizzy grinned. "Oh, well, then; come on!"</p>

<p>He turned again to the door, to have it thrust back on him by
one of Paddy's bewildering quick entries.</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl disentangled herself from the journalist's
arms. "Dizzy, you're up to tricks again!"</p>

<p>"I'm not," defended the journalist. "I don't know one."</p>

<p>"And Uncle Saul!" The girl's face was a study for 'Sorrow';
yet her eyes twinkled mischievously. "To think of finding you
here and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Miss Lancing's office?" asked Dizzy innocently.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're always here&mdash;I don't understand how Miss
Lancing bears with you! I'm speaking to Uncle Saul&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Paddy&mdash;" Saul Murmer felt guilty,
in spite of a suspicion that he was being unjustly accused. He
didn't understand; so decided that an air of repentance would
bring a quick solution and a possible explanation.</p>

<p>"Miss Westways&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now blame it on poor auntie!" the girl challenged. "Poor
auntie, who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" The Inspector was now thoroughly bewildered and
ashamed with a knowledge of unknown guilt.</p>

<p>"Uncle Saul, why did you let Dizzy lead you astray? You
know&mdash;you&mdash;so young&mdash;so innocent&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dizzy coughed.</p>

<p>"In the inner shrine of modernistic fashions," chanted the
girl, "Surrounded by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gargoyles!" suggested the newspaper-man. He pushed the
grinning urchin before him into the girl's arms.</p>

<p>"Hullo, duckie!" Paddy beamed down on the boy. "Have you any
more sketches to show me, Lawrence?"</p>

<p>"Sketches!" Saul Murmer started. "The sketches at that moment
reposing in his breast-pocket looked remarkably like the work of
a mischievous boy. Sketches! And this boy looked mischievous! His
hand went out to the boy's shoulder&mdash;to be caught in Paddy's
warm friendly clasp.</p>

<p>"So you're going to see the coffin, Uncle Saul? Well, in that
case I'll forgive you. But, you understand, this must not happen
again. I can't have my uncle and my future husband&mdash;" Dizzy
whistled a few bars of the Wedding March, modulating into a
popular, melancholy air from "Saul."</p>

<p class="first">MISS ALBERTS, the wardrobe mistress at
"Florabella," and head of the grosser, more materialistic
departments of the <i>modiste's</i> establishment, had not proved
informative.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Peters, a raw and elderly male in a baize
apron and a worried frown, Saul Murmer reconstructed the story of
the "robot" case.

<p>A dress dummy of somewhat novel design had been received from
England the previous week. The wardrobe mistress had not received
the usual bills of lading, nor any invoices of its cost. Miss
Alberts had referred the matter to the head of the firm, and it
had been decided to accept the case and its contents. In this
explanation Miss Alberts stated that at times "Florabella"
received new and interesting display articles from abroad on sale
or return, and she and Miss Westways had assumed this dummy to
come in that category, although no notice of its forwarding had
been received.</p>

<p>"But," interjected Inspector Murmer, in surprise, "you would
have to clear the case and its contents through the Customs,
whether duty is payable or not. And to do that you must have the
necessary papers."</p>

<p>On this point surely Tom Peters was emphatic. A carrier's
lorry had driven up to the warehouse door and delivered the case.
No, he could not definitely state who the carrier was. He had
signed a receipt for the case, but did not remember being given
any part of the receipt form; and&mdash;and that was all he
knew&mdash;or cared.</p>

<p>Shrugging his ample shoulders, Saul Murmer inquired regarding
the case in which the dummy had arrived. There both Miss Alberts
and her attendant were more informative. The case had been placed
with others at the end of the receiving room, awaiting the
arrival of the contractors, who, at intervals, cleared away the
superfluous cases.</p>

<p>Peters was emphatic that the case had not been broken in the
process of extracting the contents. He remembered seeing it,
entirely whole, two days previous, when he was piling more cases
at the spot, and wondering when the contractor was coming to take
them away. He recounted opening the warehouse the previous
morning and finding his cases scattered over the floor space, and
the case in which the "robot" had arrived, splintered to
matchwood. Very openly he stated he knew, and cared, no more.
That wasn't his job. The wood of the case? That had been placed
in the lane with the dirt-tins that morning, and no doubt the
kids who scoured the city lanes for firewood had taken it
away.</p>

<p>In short adjournment was then made to one of the showrooms.
There Saul Murmer was introduced to the "robot" and carefully
examined it. To his inexperienced eyes it appeared only different
from its surrounding fellows by being far uglier. Pleading
important business, Inspector Saul Murmer declined Dizzy Laine's
pressing invitation to lunch with his party.</p>

<p>A glance at his watch as they had entered the show rooms had
indicated that it was almost on the stroke of one, and he was
curious regarding what had happened at Police Headquarters that
morning. He knew that Inspector John Pater made a habit of dining
at Dyson's Silver Grill in Pitt Street, arriving there soon after
the lunch-hour commenced; and John Pater might prove a mine of
information.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater was a confirmed luncher. Breakfast, as a meal,
was more often avoided than forgotten. The most charming ladies
of his acquaintance could rarely lure him to tea-rooms during the
magic hours of the afternoon. Dinner was a movable feast,
dependant usually on business in hand, and often degenerating
into coffee and mixed sandwiches partaken in a suburban tea-shop.
But luncheon was inviolate; even the Police Commissioner knew
better than to occupy that hour for a conference with his
important subordinate. Unlike his brother officer, Saul Murmer
considered all meal hours of the day inviolate. A missed meal
was, in his opinion, of far more consequence than, say, robbing
the Commonwealth Bank. In the latter case, a small amount of
brain power, assisted by a little exercise and a few brother
officers, might recover the loot and bring the offenders to
justice. A missed meal had to be relegated, into the list of
things long lamented and never forgotten.</p>

<p>The above should not be taken as a record that Inspector
Murmer was a gross feeder. He was not; he liked dainty meals,
considering an inadequate cook was just as much a subject for
prosecution by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals as the carter who over-flogged his horses.</p>

<p>Meals, their uses and abuses, were a constant source of
argument between the two inspectors, otherwise in agreement on
most subjects. In one thing they agreed cordially; that Dyson's
Silver Grill could not be improved upon as a luncheon rendezvous.
A further point of agreement, was that a point-steak, flanked by
chip potatoes, a la Dyson, and a tall pewter-pot of bitter ale
was the most satisfactory luncheon dish.</p>

<p>Thereafter came a cleavage of thought. Inspector Pater was a
strong devotee of the sauce named "Worcestershire," and flooded
his steak with that condiment. Saul Murmer, staunch Englishman,
and a Worcestershire-born man, considered that his native
<i>sauce piquante</i> took from the steak much of its subtle
savour, reducing it to the status of a common, or garden,
rump.</p>

<p>Taking farewell of Miss Westways, and "Florabella," Inspector
Murmer went into Pitt Street and turned southwards. Two hundred
yards along the busy, thoroughfare he entered a narrow
passage-way and proceeded along it until he came well in view of
George Street. There he found a narrow door and a flight of
well-kept stairs. Descending these, he entered a long,
low-ceilinged room, decorated in discreet imitation of a very
famous London tavern, but with dainty-set tables instead of the
wooden boards and horn-handled cutlery of its prototype. One end
of the large room was occupied by the famous silver grill, at
which, garbed in spotless white robes, presided two priests of
Epicurus, holding sparkling wands of office.</p>

<p>Many readers are doubtless familiar with this scene, even
though they have not been so fortunate to save the required
admission fees; it has been photographed so often, and visited by
men from so many remote parts of Australia that even the
traveller in the distant unknowns of the Northern Territory, when
proceeding southwards, have been farewelled with "love to Dyson's
Grill." Stockmen who have visited Sydney at Royal Show times,
speak reverently of the founder of the grill, affirming him to be
the one man able to deal fittingly with the best brands of
cattle.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room from the silver grill, in this
temple of a noble art, in a quiet corner, stands a table set for
four persons. Exactly at fifteen minutes to one each day, one of
the white-jacketed waiters tilts forward all four chairs
surrounding this table, in sign that for the next hour this table
is reserved from the common run of mankind.</p>

<p>Exactly at one o'clock, or as near that hour as the inevitable
and hourly disputes between Sydney city clocks permit, Inspector
Pater descends the stairs and sets the chair fronting the
front-wall on its four feet. A few seconds later, taking the last
chime clock chiming the hour as correct, Inspector Murmer ambles
softly over the well-polished floor and seats himself facing his
comrade. Very rarely are the other two chairs at this table
occupied. On occasions, Superintendent George Dixon has made a
third at the table; on one notable occasion all four chairs were
occupied, the third and fourth, by Commissioner McFee and
Superintendent Dixon. A loyal and observant waiter links this
notable event and the fine porterhouse steak served to these
notabilities, with the downfall of the Donabetti Brothers who,
emigrating to Australia, attempted to introduce to harbour-siders
business methods usual in their native Chicago.</p>

<p>On the day Inspector Murmer had visited "Florabella," the last
clock had noted the hour, of one several minutes before Inspector
Murmer arrived at the luncheon rendezvous. As he drew back his
chair, Inspector Pater looked up and nodded briefly. Saul Murmer
nodded, just as curtly, flicked open his napkin, and tucked one
end between the top buttons of his waistcoat. Both men then, as
is the habit of men in dining-rooms, read every word of the long
and elaborate menu-cards, although they had already ordered their
luncheons.</p>

<p>They did not speak. Silver Grillers consider conversation
before meals as irreligious as conversations during services in
church. Acolytes, bearing dishes, approached the table. Saul
Murmer took occasion to feel that his napkin was securely in
place. John Pater broke his crisp roll. The dishes deposited with
mathematical precision on the table, sharp, inquisitorial glances
surveyed the sacrificial meats. Only when jerky nods of
satisfaction gave permission did the waiters bow and return.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, broken only by muttered requests, such as
for "salt" and "pepper." The rolls dwindled to flakes of
golden-brown crust; the steaks were remembered only by the aroma
and the gravy-stained dishes; liquid levels in pewter pots sank
low. John Pater pushed back one chair and sighed; Saul Murmer
grunted, thus signifying that so far as he was concerned God was
in his heaven, and all was right with a very sinful world.
Then:</p>

<p>"All right, John?"</p>

<p>"O.K., Saul. How's things?"</p>

<p>"So-so."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"The Salom Club?" asked Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>"Progressing," replied John Pater. A further pause. "That
Lionel Leyland is a fool."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer struggled his right hand into a tight-fitting
trouser pocket, and withdrew one penny. He passed it across the
table to his comrade.</p>

<p>"I always pay for information," he remarked. "Still, in this
case, I think I am over-generous. Why don't they have farthings
in circulation in Australia?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to over-charge you, Saul."</p>

<p>Both men looked up and grinned.</p>

<p>"Anything you want, John?" asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."&mdash;Inspector Pater hesitated. "I'd like to
talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then talk," said Saul Murmer, and composed himself to
listen.</p>

<p>The preliminaries being thus established, both men were more
at ease. Being men, and British, they realised that a man's meal
made social amenities difficult to resume&mdash;they had to
descend from Olympian heights to a very work-a-day world.</p>

<p>"Had a devil of a job with Leyland," sighed the tall
Inspector. "After you left, he wanted to arrest Butler. Fool! The
man had come to me to talk, and what could be the use of
upsetting him?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"We want a new appointment at headquarters," he remarked.
"Chairman of Conferences&mdash;or something like that. The doors
of the meeting room locked and two of the heftiest patrolmen, in
the department on guard outside. Inside, a permanent and
non-adjourning conference&mdash;of ineffective police officers,
politicians, other talkers, and&mdash;Sergeant Lionel
Leyland."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do it," laughed John Pater. "Have you considered
the effect of strictly confining so much explosive material?"</p>

<p>"But, curse it, man!" Saul Murmer looked up in surprise. "What
would such an explosion in such a room matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," Pater pursed thin lips. "I over-ruled Leyland and sent
him out after Myson. Told him he was to convey a polite
invitation to the man to come and talk with me." He laughed
shortly. "Leyland didn't like that. S'pose he will lodge a
complaint with Dixon against me&mdash;but the Super will know how
to deal with that; then&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tall Australian paused, staring bleakly into distance.</p>

<p>"What did Arthur Buller want see you for?" asked Saul Murmer
at length.</p>

<p>"Apparently to tell me that the dead man was Frederick Catlow,
and that he, the dead man, and Alfred Myson held a conference in
that room that morning."</p>

<p>"Dead marines!" stated the Englishman. "Buller is always like
that. He has funds of information that everyone else knows."</p>

<p>"U-m-m!" John Pater nodded. "I understand that the three men
were organising a pearling expedition to some unknown island in
the South Seas."</p>

<p>"They would!" The full, red lips parted in a winning smile. "A
journey from Sydney Town Hall to Vaucluse on a Government tram
would make Buller as cocky as if he had ventured as far as the
South Pole."</p>

<p>"He said the conference was to establish a small company to
raise the necessary capital."</p>

<p>"Necessary graft!" muttered the stout Inspector.</p>

<p>"Just so." John Pater nodded.</p>

<p>"How does he explain the murder?" asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"There wasn't one&mdash;according to Arthur Buller. His theory
is that Catlow could not raise his share of the capital required
for the enterprise&mdash;and shot himself in vexation."</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-ah." John Pater nodded. "According to Buller, Catlow was
given twenty-four hours to find the money, or his place in the
syndicate would be filled by another. Buller states he and friend
Myson left Catlow and went&mdash;to see a man about a dog. They
parted&mdash;Buller and Myson&mdash;in Pitt Street, and Buller
knew nothing about the accident until he met Pontifex at dinner
last night."</p>

<p>"Life is expensive," murmured the Englishman,
inconsequently.</p>

<p>"It may be, in this case."</p>

<p>"What happened next?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." The Australian reflected. "That brings the
Salom Club affair up to twelve-thirty. At ten minutes to one I
left my office. As I passed the common room I bumped into
Leyland, charging out at a furious rate. S'pose he'd been having
a 'conference' with the newest 'rookies.' I dropped him a hint
that he could pull Buller, if he liked, and give him a bit of a
sweating. That cheered friend Leyland no end. He went back into
conference. S'pose he is now combing the underworld for
the&mdash;er&mdash;victim."</p>

<p>"He would." Saul Murmer opened sleepy eyes. "Say, John, what
exactly did Buller want?"</p>

<p>"Moses sent spies into Canaan," suggested the Australian.</p>

<p>"Did Buller return to his pals bearing grapes and olives?"
Saul Murmer sounded sarcastic. "John, there is something big
behind all this."</p>

<p>"Think so? I'm having another talk with Captain Pontifex."</p>

<p>"Alias Arthur Wesley." Inspector Murmer apparently woke up,
leaning forward. "I ran up against him in London; son of a
Walworth Street greengrocer&mdash;and a damned bad lot."</p>

<p>"Yet he is said to have held a commission&mdash;" commenced
John Pater.</p>

<p>"A non-commission," corrected Saul Murmer.</p>

<p>"Is that so? I wondered where he got his military bearing
from." John Pater looked up from the remains of the roll he was
industriously disintegrating for the benefit of the grill-room
sweeper. "What about a raid, Saul?"</p>

<p>"No." The Englishman spoke more quickly than was his wont. "Do
you know the captain is a married-on-the-left man?"</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Thelma Delevere, one-time Hollywood star, of the dustpan and
broom. Came to Australia to show you savages of the South Seas
how to produce pictures, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" suggested John Pater. He was a great absorber of
information.</p>

<p>"From Kennington, London, to Hollywood, U.S.A., and then to
Australia. How our girls travel!" Saul Murmer was lying back in
his chair, his eyes closed, his hands folded over a more than
satisfactory bay-windowed vest. "Sarah Dolman to Thelma
Delevere&mdash;A two-roomed flat with seven inhabitants and dirty
streets to&mdash;to a flat of seven rooms in St. John's for only
two people&mdash;one the breadwinner. Pity you don't have young
aristocrats out here, John; the lack of proper facilities so
badly cramps our young girls' styles."</p>

<p>John Pater laughed.</p>

<p>"Makes me feel melancholy," continued the Englishman. "And
melancholia always makes me feel sentimental. I want to write
verses&mdash;I believe I could evolve something big on the lines
of 'The Valley of the Moon,' or 'Sonny Boy.' You know, what I
mean, John? Those ditties so many radio announcers are fond of
turning on to the air, through their gramophones."</p>

<p>"A Frenchman recently shot a radio-too-enthusiast," stated
John Pater, darkly.</p>

<p>"Justifiable homicide, must have been the coroner's verdict,"
said Saul Murmer firmly. "That Frenchman must have been
discharged to loud applause. They should have&mdash;No, they
don't have Victoria Crosses in France, outside the Mont de
Piete&mdash;" He paused reflectively. "Now, if I wrote
songs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The jury would declare a verdict of suicide over your
corpse," grinned Inspector Pater. "And there would be no rider as
to the state of your mind. Say, haven't we travelled rather far
from our subject?"</p>

<p>"It's returning to us." The small, baby-blue eyes turned
slowly from John Pater to the stairway.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater's eyes followed his comrade's glances. He
started, and pushed his chair still further from the table. Saul
Murmer's podgy leg came forward quickly, and the Australian
exclaimed, stifling his words quickly.</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater sat back and stared down the long room. Two
men had descended the stairs and were paying the customary
obeisance to the sliver grill. A low whistle escaped his
lips.</p>

<p>"Yes." Saul Murmer shifted slowly so that his back was turned
to the upper part of the room.</p>

<p>"Captain Pontifex and Arthur Buller. You should have brought
Leyland with you, John."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" John Pater straightened from attention to his
injured shin. "He'd have conferenced the cooks until the steaks
were cinders. What the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two devils," corrected the Englishman. He was staring
intently into the palm of his left hand, in which reposed a small
circular mirror.</p>

<p>"No good, Saul," observed the Australian, after a long pause.
"He's caught sight of you; you're too noticeable."</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex had halted with strict military precision. He
caught his companion by the arm; his strong voice rang through
the room; where to raise one's voice above a whisper was
anathema.</p>

<p>"Sorry, me lad!" Heads were raised to listen to the intruder's
oration. "Can't stay to lunch to-day. Important
appointment&mdash;involving thousands&mdash;I may say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Holding Buller by the arm in a firm grip, Captain Pontifex
turned to the stairs. Buller protested, but a word from the
night-club proprietor reduced him to acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Art." Captain Pontifex thought he was
whispering, but his voice carried clearly through the room.
"Can't you see who's here? Man, I'd rather roast in hell than
lunch with Saul Murmer in the same room."</p>

<p>The two Inspectors watched the inglorious exits of the crooks
from the Silver Grill. When even the echoes had faded away in the
distance, John Pater turned to his companion:</p>

<p>"What now, Saul?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall interview Mr. Carrington Manning this
afternoon," the Englishman replied inconsequently! "The time
appears ripe to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?" asked John Pater, much puzzled.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer rose to his feet, pushing his chair back
firmly.</p>

<p>"Where the vultures gather, John," he said gravely. "But
there, you don't want me to instruct you in Australian
history."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE-SERGEANT Lionel Leyland held the firm
conviction that the New South Wales Police Department held only
one really efficient officer. He was also assured that influence,
in its most virulent forms, dictated appointments and promotions
in the department. Otherwise, he frequently asked Mrs. Lionel
Leyland, why had not sheer merit been long adequately
recognised?</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland, in his leisure moments, was a keen admirer
of detective fiction. Particularly he admired the works of a very
famous author who will be known to posterity as the creator of
the "Big Four" and the "Big Three" of Scotland Yard. So long, and
so thoroughly, did Sergeant Leyland study these works that, soon
after Inspector Murmer arrived in New South Wales, he approached
him with reference to the organisation and methods of the Big
Three. That the Englishman proved uninformative and amused, he
considered after lengthy thought, was due to some vow of silence
imposed on him by the secret rulers of London's Metropolitan
Police.</p>

<p>Some months before Frederick Catlow met sudden death in the
Salom Club, Sergeant Leyland purchased "<i>The Emperor of the
Underworld.</i>" This remarkable work of fiction, one of the
great master's outstanding efforts, wore a realistic aspect.
More; it detailed extensively the work of the "Big Three."
Sergeant Leyland was enthralled. He considered the author had
rolled aside the screen that had hitherto shrouded the inner
workings of the men who so sincerely fought England's crime.</p>

<p>Very carefully and exhaustively he studied the book, and after
much cogitation, set down in report form his matured conclusions.
Spending much grudged money on perfect typing of this report, he
forwarded one copy to the Chief Secretary, and another to the
Commissioner of Police. Then, confident that merit could no
longer be hid, he awaited his just rewards.</p>

<p>Inspector Pater declared that Chance, alone, dictating that
Sergeant Leyland should be the only officer available at the
moment when Captain Pontifex telephoned the news of the death of
Frederick Catlow, brought that officer into the case.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland believed that Fate had arranged that he
should have an opportunity to show the world at large and his
superior officers in particular his abilities and the
infallibility of his conclusions. He recognised that he had to
work under a considerable handicap at the moment, for his methods
depended largely on the establishment of "The Big Three" in
continued consultation behind locked doors, and with a retinue of
large constables on guard in the corridor without. Yet, failing
comrades of "The Big Three" he was prepared to do his best. He
was certain he could prove his theories right. Thus, when
Inspector Pater limited him, ordered him, checked him to the
defined lines of the inquiry laid down by the departmental heads,
he was furious.</p>

<p>When Arthur Buller walked into Inspector Pater's office
Sergeant Leyland was filled with joy. Here was an opportunity to
put his theories into practical use. A conference arranged on the
lines used by the "Big Three" amplified by methods peculiar to
Mulberry Street, New York City, would certainly bring matters to
a point where evidence would be obtained and an arrest made. His
thoughts soared to a full confession&mdash;and the glorification
of the officer who, by sheer willpower and ability, had obtained
it.</p>

<p>When Inspector Pater ordered him from his office on a search
for Alfred Myson, Sergeant Leyland groaned in spirit. His
superior officer, in rank, not ability, was throwing away every
chance of solving this intricate case. Slowly, hesitatingly, and
with thoughts of an appeal to the Commissioner in his mind, he
went down the corridor. He did not go to the Commissioner, or
telephone him, for at the back of his mind was the thought that
he alone might possibly retrieve Inspector Pater's mistake.</p>

<p>Could he? A sudden thought flashed into his mind. Hastening
his steps, he went to the Common Room. There he found, as he had
expected, two of the latest appointed constables to the branch.
These he despatched to search for Arthur Buller's English record,
and the list of gun licences. He remembered that Inspector Murmer
had declared Buller to be a dangerous gunman. If the man carried
a concealed weapon without the necessary licence, he could arrest
him. Once the man was in the cells there were ways and means of
forcing from him a confession.</p>

<p>His messengers were long completing their task, but at length
reported. Sergeant Leyland's heart swelled with pride. Arthur
Buller did not possess a licence to carry a weapon; his English
record was one of which any member of the underworld might well
be proud.</p>

<p>Hurrying from the Common Room, Sergeant Leyland bumped into
Inspector Pater on his way to lunch. Sight of the Inspector
caused Leyland's heart to sink. It could only mean that Buller
had been allowed to leave Police Headquarters, a free man. Again
he groaned at the incapacity of his superior officer. The news
that he might bring Buller back, if he could find him, cheered
him slightly. With a grudging salute he went to the stairs and
ascended to the upper floor.</p>

<p>Outside the Inspector's room he hesitated, then loitered past.
When the corridor was vacant he returned and swiftly opened the
door, entering the room. Both desks in the room were bare of
papers, and Leyland had hoped to find on Inspector Pater's desk
some notes of Arthur Buller's statement or, at least, a note of
the man's address. He tried the drawers of the desk. They were
locked. In exasperation, he thought of forcing the drawers.
Surely he was entitled to proceed to extremities when the man who
should lead was proving himself not only incompetent but a
decided hindrance to the investigation in hand. He hesitated,
finally abandoning the burglarious idea.</p>

<p>He was not certain the Commissioner would stand behind his
actions&mdash;the higher officers of the department were hard to
convince to modern ideas, hidebound to obsolete methods which had
created slums of crime in the fair city of Sydney. With a shrug,
he went from the room and out into Central Lane. For the moment
he must abandon much that he thought necessary; yet, given time,
his opportunity would come. Again he thought, and his thoughts
led to the Salom Club.</p>

<p>Passing down George Street, he mounted a city-bound tram, and
took out his expenses book. In it he carefully noted the
taxi-fare from Central Lane to Circular Quay, dealing liberally
in the way of a tip with the mythical taxi driver. The slowness
of the journey irked, for he was anxious to test a new theory
that had occurred to him.</p>

<p>At the Salom Club he asked for Arthur Buller of a gentleman
who wore large cauliflower ears and a broken nose in a broad,
grinning face. The man declared that "Mister Buller" was not on
the premises. Sergeant Leyland then asked for Captain Pontifex,
and was told that he was at lunch. Where did Captain Pontifex
lunch, next demanded the Sergeant, and was informed "in Sydney."
The subsequent expression of disbelief caused two mighty
intellects to clash. Sergeant Leyland decided the man and the
premises required investigation.</p>

<p>When the rocking world steadied, and the walls ceased to jig,
Sergeant Leyland found himself facing a short, tubby man, who
wore an engaging smile. This new individual introduced himself as
the "head waiter," and apologised for Captain Pontifex's absence.
He professed complete ignorance of any person, or persons, with
cauliflower ears and broken noses, and spoke vaguely of search
warrants and such idiotic and restrictive things.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland at length considered. Perhaps he had been too
hasty. Fingering a split lip and conscious of an eye camouflaged
in possible rainbow hues, he decided to accept apologies and
explanations from the tubby person.</p>

<p>Again at Circular Quay, and with a mind searching for some new
angle of approach to his problem certain human clues reminded him
that he had not yet lunched. Thought of lunch brought the
reminder that he had promised Mrs. Leyland to meet her for lunch
at 1.15 p.m., promptly. The Customs House clock declared the hour
to be 1.50 p.m.&mdash;and Mrs. Leyland was not a lady it was wise
to keep waiting on an appointment for lunch&mdash;or anything
else. A vivid picture of his "much better half" rose before the
Sergeant's mental vision. He pictured her seated in the Adele
Café, bolt upright on a hard wooden seat, her eyes bright and
determined, her lips firmly set, her body tensed, her mind
swelling with thoughts of an errant husband&mdash;and he
groaned.</p>

<p>The Adele Café is situated in Hunter Street. Mrs. Leyland had
discovered it, and adopted it, when Police Headquarters, and the
Detective Branch, were located in the ugly red-brick building at
the corner of Hunter and Phillip Streets. The mere fact that the
Police Powers-That-Be had decided to shift the Criminal Branch to
Central Lane had not affected the lady's opinions. Ministers and
Commissioners might have changeable views; Mrs. Leyland boasted
that she always kept to one unswerving course.</p>

<p>Luncheon and a lady occupying his present thoughts, Sergeant
Leyland strode up Pitt Street and at the Hunter Street corner
paused. There he took time for consideration. So far he had not
found an excuse wherewith to explain his tardiness. He knew Mrs.
Leyland would investigate his morning activities, in detail. She
would certainly discover inaccuracies, in cross-examination and
that split lip and swelling eye would&mdash;Well, it just
would!</p>

<p>He moved into Hunter Street slowly. His second stop was at a
very strategic point, a jeweller's shop window. In the mirrors
behind the displayed articles he had a very fair view of the fine
interior of the Adele Café, while himself being carefully
shielded from the lunchers' view. Expertly, he scanned the
interior of the café, and groaned. Mrs. Leyland was sitting in a
position from where she could keep a vigilant eye on the
entrance, and a small portion of the street beyond. A great hope
swelled suddenly in the sergeant's breast. Mrs. Leyland was not
alone. She was lunching with someone&mdash;and that someone was a
man. The sergeant noted that at intervals she inclined a very
rigid body&mdash;and smiled. Mrs. Leyland was a great sticker for
etiquette, and an authority on the subject in her own home. With
a companion at the table she would have to accept any explanation
for tardiness the Sergeant chose to offer.</p>

<p>True, there would be long and explosive explanations to
undergo in the connubial chamber that night&mdash;but in
matrimonial affairs Lionel Leyland had long since decided that
delays, however short, were always for good. The hour of nightly
retirement lay in the future&mdash;and in the interval much might
happen.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland strode into the Café and, before Mrs. Leyland
had time to recognise the stalwart form of her much-married
husband, drew a chair to the table and seated himself. For a
second he mentally flinched as he met her eyes. Almost he
believed his wife's rigid adherence to "correctness" had been
overstrained, and that, for once, the long and arduous
self-tuition in "etiquette for housewives" would fail.</p>

<p>"Sorry, m'dear," the Sergeant muttered quickly. "Very busy at
headquarters. Long conference with the Commissioner and other
heads. Important decisions. Thought I'd have to miss
lunch&mdash;" He grabbed up the menu; then caught at the flying
skirts of a passing waitress. "Grilled steak, onions, chips,
coffee, bread and butter, cheese and make it chippy, m'dear.
Police business&mdash;rush it!"</p>

<p>"Lionel!" Mrs. Leyland spoke ominously. "Lionel, we have a
visitor!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland nodded genially to the little man, his hand
straying to his trousers pocket. Had he enough to pay for three
lunches? He sighed. The afternoon 'nip' would; have to be cut
out&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, sir," Sergeant Leyland surveyed the slight little
man seated beside his wife with disfavour and thankfulness,
mixed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alfred Myson," introduced the lady.</p>

<p>"Mister&mdash;" Sergeant Leyland stared, his mouth sagging,
his rainbow eye hurting at the enforced protuberance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alfred Myson," repeated Mrs. Leyland firmly. "I have met
Mr. Myson in the city to-day, on business. Mr Myson is in
business in the city and for his convenience I have arranged this
interview in his luncheon hour."</p>

<p>A glint of anger-fire in the lady's eyes forbade discussion;
yet the Sergeant felt he must say something. Alfred Myson! Why,
he&mdash;Yes, he distinctly remembered.</p>

<p>"Lionel, what is the matter with your eye?" Mrs. Leyland was
closely scanning her husband's face. "You've been fighting," she
decided. "Yes, fighting."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;er&mdash;" A sudden wave of courage swept the
Sergeant. "Some prisoners
were&mdash;er&mdash;aggressive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;your lip!"</p>

<p>"A terrible case," declared the sergeant. "You were
saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;your ear!" The lady's tones were ascending the
scale rapidly.</p>

<p>"No doubt you will read the full details in the newspapers,
to-night, dear."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland devoutly hoped there had been a "dust up" in
the city or suburbs, somewhere, that day. He could claim that his
name had been wilfully and maliciously omitted from the report.
"You were saying, m'dear&mdash;in reference to Mr.
Myson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Mrs. Leyland took time to consider. "Time to consider"
is an important axiom in <i>Etiquette for the Housewife</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Myson is engaged in business in this city. He requires a
country residence&mdash;and we have a spare room."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland took the "we" as a word of grace. Only when
Mrs was particularly pleased did she use "we." At other times she
spoke of house and home with the pronoun "my"
prefixed&mdash;often in the capital letters.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember your name, Mr. Myson." Sergeant Leyland
felt that he had to say something, and this was the first thing
that came to his tongue. The situation was terrific. He was to
harbour in his&mdash;no, Mrs. Leyland's&mdash;home, a murderer!
Yes, the facts were there; a murderer&mdash;and Mrs.
Leyland&mdash;Myson was a murderer, wanted by the police for the
murder of Frederick Catlow! Soon, through the city, on every
police noticeboard, would be posted handbills asking for the
immediate arrest of one Alfred Myson&mdash;and he would be
arrested. More, through police headquarters and through the State
would spread the dreadful fact; Alfred Myson had been arrested in
Detective-Sergeant Lionel Leyland's Bondi residence. He
groaned.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Lionel?" Mrs. Leyland spoke with some
asperity in her voice. "You have not expressed your pleasure to
Mr. Myson."</p>

<p>"Delighted?" mumbled the Sergeant. "We'll do our best to make
you comfortable!"</p>

<p>Comfortable! If Fate had only ordered that he had found Alfred
Myson before that crook came in contact with Mrs. Leyland, he
would have made him comfortable! Visions of whitewashed walls of
stone, plank beds, of grey blankets, of barred windows, rose
before the Sergeant's mind's eye. If Fate had not been so
unkind!</p>

<p>For the first time since he had stood by Mrs. Leyland's side
and mumbled something that a priest had taken for "I will," he
thought of rebellion. Could he, dare he, rise from that table,
stretch out hard and clutching hands across his wife, yank this
murderer from his seat and inform him that "anything he might
say&mdash;?" He knew he dared not. He knew that at the first
aggressive move Mrs. Leyland would fix him with a basilisk stare;
she would open her mouth, and her "Lionel, how dare you?" would
freeze him to immobility.</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaned forward, holding out his hand across the
table to the&mdash;murderer. He had to be diplomatic. Later,
perhaps&mdash;To his memory flashed a scene created by his
favourite author. There the detective, acting under the guiding
brains of the "Big Three"&mdash;or was it the "Big
Four"&mdash;had shaken hands with the "Master-Mind of Crime," won
his confidence, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Delighted to have you in our home." The Sergeant spoke
heartily. For the moment he felt hearty: his plans were set. He
would cultivate this man, worm his way into his confidence, prise
from him, by subtle questioning, the truth about the murder of
Frederick Catlow, and then, in a brilliant blaze of glory, haul
the perpetrators of the crime into Police Headquarters with every
link of the chain of evidence complete. That, his final triumph,
would make a supine Commissioner, ineffective, self-satisfied
Superintendents and Inspectors squirm! Yes, sir, squirm!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="first">GRADUALLY Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer became
intrigued with a problem in which he could not, at the moment,
see any definite thread of crime. Yet some sixth sense&mdash;that
strange instinct for lawlessness that real detectives
acquire&mdash;insisted that surrounding him were problems that
would presently take all his powers to solve.</p>

<p>When he had met Miss Westways at the Green Lagoon night-club,
he had become far more interested in the woman than in the
problem she offered him. The problem had appeared exaggerated. He
did not believe any threat was intended. The sketches seemed to
emanate from a childish mind intent on revenge for some fancied
injury. He had offered to investigate&mdash;and had made a few
inquiries&mdash;more from friendship and admiration for an
attractive woman than in the belief he would solve some sinister
plot.</p>

<p>He had intended to find the artist; when he did, he believed
that a strong reproof, coupled with some indefinite threat of
action if the offence was repeated, would serve the ends of
justice. But that sixth sense&mdash;the detective
sense&mdash;declared that the Salom club murder should be linked
with Miss Westways and her niece!</p>

<p>"Why," asked Saul Murmer of himself, with some irritation,
"should that be so?" There could be no possible connection;
Frederick Catlow had been murdered by crooks in a place
frequented by the higher circles of crooks, and possibly over a
division of loot. That was a reasonable theory, and a theory
police headquarters was prepared to admit. For the moment, the
loot and the identity of the murderer were unknown. All the
police had to work on was a strange tale told by Arthur Buller,
supported by Captain Pontifex's statement that he had lent the
room at the Salom Club to the three men for a business
conference.</p>

<p>On another angle of the dual affair his sixth sense had
insisted that Saul Murmer did not associate himself with the
Salom Club case. Chance had dictated that he was in the building
at the moment the fatal shot was fired. He had been on the murder
scene within a few minutes of the man's death. Following the
dictates of his "hunch" he had insisted that Captain Pontifex
send for Inspector Pater and to conceal the fact that he, Saul
Murmer, had been on the premises up to the moment of the
detective's arrival on the scene.</p>

<p>Pontifex and his waiter, Catlow, Buller and Myson. Saul Murmer
had reason to believe all five men crooks. He had known three of
the five in London, in connection with his work at New Scotland
Yard. Two of the three had been in prison on convictions the
detective remembered well.</p>

<p>The third, Pontifex, had made frequent appearances in police
courts, on charges connected with the keeping of gambling houses,
and his record of fines was almost imposing. At times the
"gallant captain" had been suspected of more serious offences,
but the Yard had failed to secure sufficient evidence to warrant
arrest and conviction.</p>

<p>Pontifex, Myson and Buller; Saul Murmer knew them well. But he
could not place Catlow. So far as the detective was aware, he was
a newcomer in crime. He was certainly English; his clothes were
of English cut and fashion; the few intimate articles about his
person were of English manufacture. Even his hat was
English&mdash;and that alone was sufficient to indicate that he
had not been long in Australia.</p>

<p>Then, what connection had he with the other three men? They
had left England many years before Saul Murmer had sailed for
Australia. How had Catlow connected with the three suspected
rogues, and for what purpose? And, again, that sixth sense
asserted itself in Saul Murmer's mind. It insisted that he could
couple Miss Westways and her niece with the men.</p>

<p>The Englishman shook himself angrily. The idea was absurd,
impossible! Neither of the women could be crooks, or the
associates of crooks. But the idea persisted, asserted itself,
bringing to his mind's surface impossible theories and
conjectures in vain attempts to prove connections that could not
possibly exist. What connection could there be? The incidents of
the strange coffin shaped drawings? That was absurd. The
meaningless practical jokes that always followed the arrival of
the drawings? Again the theory appeared absurd. Had he to presume
that Pontifex, Buller, Myson, or even that newcomer in the
underworld, Frederick Catlow, would initiate and carry through
some obscure intimidation threat by means of those strange
drawings.</p>

<p>Now, if there had been a demand accompanying the drawings, the
affair would be easy to understand. But, so far as he knew, there
had been no demand&mdash;not a scrap of other writing.</p>

<p>Had there been a demand? It seemed absurd to consider such an
idea. Miss Westways was a wealthy woman; her niece was a petted,
slightly-spoiled child, whose mind was mainly engrossed with
having a good social time with her friends of Sydney's younger
set. What secret could these women have that the gang could hold
over them? Threat of what? The detective shrugged. The men had
made no demand.</p>

<p>Yet the thought could not be entirely ignored. More than one
person of presumably impeccable life had fallen under the
dominance of blackmailers through an error in early life. Miss
Westways had declared her life was threatened, had declared the
drawings to be demands for money; yet she had not produced one
iota of proof of either assertion.</p>

<p>Certainly Saul Murmer passed in review not only the three
rogues, Miss Westways and her niece, but also those persons he
had found surrounding these principals in the little drama. As
names occurred to his mind he wrote them down, crossing them off
his list on maturer reflection. At the end of his work and
meditation he had one name attached to his list&mdash;a name and
personality to which he could attach some slight suspicion.</p>

<p>And that name was Theodore Manning, son of a wealthy father, a
high light in Sydney's younger set; and he was intriguing. Saul
Murmer thought he sensed that the youth was not entirely what he
wished others to think him. He wore a strange mask of
impassivity, posing as the incarnation of male beloved by certain
lady novelists&mdash;the strong, silent man. Until he met young
Manning, Inspector Murmer had not thought the species existed.
Theodore Manning was but a youth; Paddy Burke had declared that
he was not yet twenty-one. Yet the detective decided, on
reflection, that the youth looked and acted far older than his
reputed years.</p>

<p>As a matter of routine, Saul Murmer had made some inquiries
about him. He had learned that at the University Theodore Manning
was not looked on as of any consequence; he had failed badly in
his studies, and he look no interest in sport. In fact, generally
speaking, young Manning was looked upon by the authorities and
his fellow students as one of a large number of persons attending
the University who have no ambitions and use the institution as a
means of social standing&mdash;and to fill in time that often
lays heavily on their hands. Rather regretfully, for Sam Murmer
disliked the youth rather unreasonably, he had to stand him aside
as of no consequence in his problem.</p>

<p>But Theodore Manning had a father, Carrington Manning. Report
stated that Theodore was an only son and was considerably spoilt.
He had far more money at his command than was for his good; he
had considerable liberty, which in many ways he abused.</p>

<p>Reviewing the personal drama he believed was set before him,
Inspector Murmer considered Carrington Manning was worthy of
attention. For one thing, he was an old acquaintance. Carrington
Manning had been in London during the days Saul Murmer had been
working his way up in the Metropolitan Police Force. In the
capital city of the Empire, Carrington Manning had been of little
account. He had been one of the numerous band of commercial
adventurers who labelled themselves financiers. Nothing criminal,
so far as the Inspector knew, had ever been charged against him;
yet he had drawn the watchful eyes of New Scotland Yard, for the
"financiers" of a city are always potentialities to the
ever-alert police.</p>

<p>Carrington Manning had disappeared from London commercial
circles quite a time before Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer had
been offered the opportunity to visit Australia on exchange duty
with the New South Wales Police Department. Rumour had told that
Manning had transferred his business activities to New York, and
had taken out naturalisation papers as an American citizen. New
Scotland Yard had noted that fact, and had then proceeded to file
him&mdash;not to forget him.</p>

<p>Now Carrington Manning had appeared in Australia, with Sydney
his headquarters. The unguarded inquiries instituted by the
Inspector had shown him that the man was working a legitimate,
though highly speculative business. He was a director of several
companies&mdash;mostly of the non-dividend paying order. He
appeared to be interested in anything promising tangible assets
in the future; that is to say, inventions, however bizarre,
immediately drew his attention. He dealt in property companies,
mainly of the futuristic order. The purely speculative adventures
that attract so many men of his kind did not, apparently, attract
him.</p>

<p>He was careful to avoid contact with the known "gold-brick"
sellers, the hawkers of elaborately engraved gold and other
mining script and the promoters of "get rich quick" activities
who throng young and rapidly-growing cities. In fact, in
Inspector Murmer's opinion, Carrington Manning was a person who
would fully repay careful watching.</p>

<p>Immediately after luncheon at the Silver Grill Inspector Saul
Murmer parted from Inspector John Pater, having decided how to
employ his afternoon. His work at Police Headquarters was well in
hand, and for the time did not need his personal attention, and
he was intrigued with the problem that he had already labelled
the "Westways case."</p>

<p>He thought that a few hours spent in quiet investigation might
lead to results, important or otherwise, but certainly results
that might shed some light on a problem that appeared at present
to be shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Had the two Inspectors on that mid-day been aware of Sergeant
Lionel Leyland's little luncheon party in Hunter Street, of the
Sergeant's discovery of Alfred Myson, and Mrs. Leyland's adoption
of that interesting person as "guest" in her suburban home, much
hard and solid spade-work on the two problems of the Westways
letters and the Salom Club murder would have been saved.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for them that they had Sergeant Leyland
working with them, and that the Sergeant had so great a belief in
his personal abilities that he had decided to investigate the
death of Frederick Catlow on his own account and, if possible,
"scoop" his fellow-officers.</p>

<p>Ambling slowly down Pitt Street, Saul Murmer, to the ordinary
observer the personification of a harmless, genial, stout,
middle-aged gentleman of comfortable means, came to King Street
and boarded an Eastern Suburbs tramcar. During the journey to
Double Bay he occupied himself with one point in the Westways
case he had discovered that day&mdash;the peculiar and intriguing
mystery of the dress-dummy, presented to Miss Westways by some
unknown overseas admirer, and the carefully smashed packing-case
in which the "present" had arrived at its destination.</p>

<p>The tramcar rumbled through the nearer suburbs, and in due
course came to a halt in the shopping centre of Double Bay. Saul
Murmer descended from the car with caution and found the
pavement. He saw that he was flanked by a double line of shops,
most of them prosperous looking, yet during that afternoon hour
not too well patronised. He walked a few steps along the street
to the end of the line of shops until he came to private houses,
standing in large grounds. On his north side opened a vista of
country, with Sydney's famous harbour in the foreground.</p>

<p>He looked southwards, and before him, on gently rising ground,
beheld a scene decorated with important-looking houses, set in
wide gardens. He knew that beyond his horizon lay the tall cliffs
guarding the continent of Australia from the wide ocean.</p>

<p>Retracing his steps to the township, Saul Murmer inquired from
an Italian fruit-merchant directions to Harrington Street.
Following the rather muddled directions he had acquired with some
difficulty, and which included thumbnail portraits of local
personalities and trading conditions in Double Bay, Saul Murmer
at length came to the street he sought.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred yards along a wide, almost deserted
thoroughfare, and he found large double gates. Beyond the gates
were spreading lawns and elegant flower gardens. There was a
wealth of trees, for trees are encouraged in Sydney suburban
gardens, though not always in the Councils' streets.</p>

<p>Two individuals were working in the gardens, a man and a boy.
At, the moment of the detective's approach they were struggling
with an electric lawn-mower, a machine that, apparently, required
more muscular power to drive than the non-electric variety.</p>

<p>The house, standing in the centre of the grounds, was of two
stories, of a style very affected by Sydney architects. Before
the house had been erected a marble and brick porch, guarding
three near-marble steps and a small platform, all surrounded by a
decoration of highly coloured tiles. The modest bellpush of
dulled bronze met with the Inspector's solitary approval. He had
feared to be confronted with some shining example of the brass
founder's art.</p>

<p>The application of a rather short, well-fed finger produced
immediate results. The door swung solidly open, revealing a
pretty, smartly-dressed maid, whose roguish eyes mutely asked
the detective's wishes.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Carrington Manning at home?" asked the Inspector in
his well-assumed, sleepy manner.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, but did not retire from her vantage post on
the doorstep.</p>

<p>"I would like to see him," continued Saul Murmer, when he was
convinced that his admission was not at present welcomed.</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Regrettably, no." The police officer allowed his well known
baby smile to part full, red lips. "Yet I have a card."</p>

<p>The maid stepped back so quickly that she appeared to
disappear into the gloom of the hall. Almost as quickly she
re-appeared, holding a silver tray whose polish made the
detective blink. Saul Murmer gave unqualified approval to the
salver.</p>

<p>"My card." He placed a slip of pasteboard on the polished
surface with great care. "I trust it will prove an appropriate
key."</p>

<p>For a moment the girl hesitated, then stepped back, beckoning
to the Inspector to follow her into the wide hall, and with an
over-manicured finger indicated a hard-seated, very upright
chair in ebony.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer looked about him. Over a doorway immediately
opposite where he sat was a mounted stag's head. A few eastern
weapons were tastefully displayed on an adjacent wall. An ebony
table, matching the chair on which the police officer sat, stood
under the lethal display.</p>

<p>Close to hand was a large Chinese temple gong. Around the
hall, suspended from a cornice shelf, were etchings. A polished
parquet, covered with a few real Australian rugs, completed the
surroundings.</p>

<p>About the time Saul Murmer had absorbed these evidences of
undoubted wealth, the maid returned and placed the silver salver
on the ebony table. A toss of her be-frilled cap was interpreted
by the Inspector as an invitation to follow her into the more
intimate regions of the house.</p>

<p>At the end of a passage leading from the entrance hall, the
girl stopped and threw open a door.</p>

<p>"Detective Inspector Saul Murmer, sir," she proclaimed, and
closed the door quickly on the slow moving detective.</p>

<p>"Detective Inspector Saul Murmer, of New Scotland Yard,
London, England," amplified a gentleman seated at a wide, glass
topped desk in a corner of the room, close to the open French
windows.</p>

<p>For a moment the gloom of the room caused the Inspector to
stare short-sightedly before him. As his eyes became accustomed
to the light, he saw, seated before him a man with a big head of
iron-grey hair, framing a small face set with fierce, grey eyes.
On the determined-looking nose perched a gold pince-nez. Under
the strong chin showed a high-winged collar and straightly-tied
tie. Flanking collar and tie were well-sloping shoulders
concealed by the upper part of a high-cut smoking jacket.</p>

<p>Almost Saul Murmer grinned. What a model for a cartoonist!</p>

<p>"Please be seated." The gentleman at the desk waved a hand
toward a chair set with the back from the light. "What can I do
for you, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carrington Manning?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"The same," said Mr. Manning genially. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Formerly of London?"</p>

<p>"And New York," amplified the man at the desk. "May I ask if
you have come out from Sydney&mdash;or London&mdash;" with a
quick glance at the police officer's card&mdash;"to ask me
that?"</p>

<p>"Did I send in one of my London cards?" Saul Murmer was very
innocent. "How stupid of me!" He found his pocket book and
withdrew another card, scanning it carefully. "I should have
given your maid this card. For the present, I am on exchange duty
with the New South Wales Police Department."</p>

<p>"Interesting!" Carrington Manning touched a bell on his desk.
"You'll have a drink, Inspector? Even from Sydney it is quite a
journey to Double Bay, if you haven't an automobile."</p>

<p>As Manning spoke the door opened silently and the maid entered
bearing decanters and glasses on a tray that could only be a
brother to the one which had carried in Saul Murmer's card.
Apparently the girl knew her master's technique for entertaining
police officers.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of Sydney and New South Wales?" asked
Carrington Manning, with ah excess of geniality in his manner.
"Will you help yourself, Inspector?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer did not hesitate. A glance at the contents of the
tray had assured him that whatever guilt could be attached to his
host's tastes in furnishings, his drinks were beyond
reproach.</p>

<p>"Very like London," observed the Inspector, when he had
approved the liquid in his glass. "I have come across many well
known faces in New South Wales."</p>

<p>"The world is a very small place," agreed Mr. Manning. He came
round the desk, a small man with a pronounced stoop, and poured
into a glass half an inch of yellow fluid, filling the glass from
a soda siphon. Saul Murmer shuddered. Good whisky should be
treated with every consideration&mdash;not drowned.</p>

<p>"Everyone is taking to travelling nowadays," elaborated the
host. "What with aeroplanes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know they borrow&mdash;er&mdash;motor cars in the States,"
said the Inspector, stolidly. "I didn't know they were trying to
break Anglo-Australian records in the air."</p>

<p>Mr. Manning looked blank for a moment, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Your mind is still running on crooks, I see, Inspector," he
said. "No, I don't think they are flying to Australia yet."</p>

<p>"Not through the stratosphere," assented the detective. The
whisky was decidedly good.</p>

<p>"But you didn't come here to talk about crooks?" Mr. Manning
raised innocent hands to an ornately decorated ceiling.</p>

<p>"I came to tell you Frederick Catlow was dead," spoke the
detective, still more stolidly.</p>

<p>"Frederick Catlow?" The financier frowned. "Now, where have I
heard that name?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you read it in the <i>Post-Advertiser</i>," suggested
the detective. "They gave him a grand write-up this morning.
Dizzy Laine is a great journalist."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Carrington Manning sipped his diluted soda water. "So I
did."</p>

<p>"And Messrs Arthur Buller and Alfred Myson are suspected of
taking a&mdash;er&mdash;an interest in Mr. Catlow," continued the
Inspector interestedly.</p>

<p>"Really!" Mr. Manning's eyes glowed strangely. "I don't think
I know I those gentlemen."</p>

<p>"They came from England and er&mdash;America," explained the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"England, America." The financier laughed. "My dear sir, in
those combined countries are over two hundred million
people."</p>

<p>"They were all three&mdash;er&mdash;inventors," stated Saul
Murmer softly. "I understand you are interested in inventions,
Mr. Manning."</p>

<p>"Of course." The financier smiled. "I believe in progress.
Inventions are the mainstay of this age. We must have progress,
and continued advancement in machinery."</p>

<p>"Messrs Catlow, Buller and Myson were not interested in
machinery inventions," stated the Inspector blandly, "They were
interested in inventions designed to
separate&mdash;er&mdash;super sensitive humans from what is
generally&mdash;er&mdash;considered necessary for comfortable
existence."</p>

<p>"Money," translated the little man. "Of course," he paused,
"And because I am a financier you consider&mdash;Really,
Inspector!"</p>

<p>"Just an idea that passed through my mind&mdash;some silly
people might consider it the oddments of an epigram." Saul Murmer
smiled sleepily, "I am also interested in Mr. Theodore
Manning."</p>

<p>"Mr. Theodore&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carrington Manning's interest was now thoroughly aroused. "My
son!"</p>

<p>"Quite a well grown lad," assented the detective. "I met him
with some friends, at the Green Lagoon."</p>

<p>"At a night club?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;hardly that." The Inspector frowned thoughtfully.
"Shall we name the Green Lagoon a restaurant specialising in late
meals and dancing, for select people. You see," he continued
confidentially, "Police Inspectors are not supposed to go to
night clubs. Police Commissioners' consciences are delicate
plants&mdash;as delicate as alleged non-conformists' consciences.
We do our best to satisfy them, though," he shrugged.</p>

<p>Mr. Manning did not reply.</p>

<p>"A well grown lad," repeated the detective. "I should say Mr.
Theodore Manning is quite twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Just turned twenty," snapped the financier. A moment, and his
usual suavity returned. "May I ask why you are specially
interested in my son?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carrington Manning died in America, did she not?" asked
Saul Murmer, imperturbably. "Sad for so young a boy to be
deprived of a mother's care."</p>

<p>Carrington Manning rose abruptly from his chair. "I don't
understand what right you have to inquire into my personal
history&mdash;and the history of my family," he stuttered, with
an assumption of dignity. "However, it is my theory that every
citizen should assist the police on all occasions, whatever the
cost to themselves may be. To be brief my wife died seven years
ago, when my son was just thirteen."</p>

<p>"An unlucky age," suggested the Inspector softly. "Do you
know, Mr. Carrington Manning, Mr. Theodore Manning looks quite a
number of years older to me."</p>

<p>"My solicitors will settle the matter for you, if you are
interested," Mr. Carrington Manning walked to the door and opened
it. "I regret, Inspector, that an important appointment does not
permit me time to continue this very interesting
conversation."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer looked only mildly interested. He reached for his
glass and slowly drank the remaining contents, then carefully
wiped his full red lips.</p>

<p>"Pity to waste a good drink," he said, equably. "Sorry about
the appointment; I'll call another day."</p>

<p>"I may be busy; I often am." The little man was holding his
temper with difficulty. "May I suggest that you either write for
the information you require, or communicate with my secretary. My
time is not illimitable."</p>

<p>"Your secretary." The stout Inspector pondered the suggestion.
"No, I don't think I'll trouble him or her. When I have thought
over what you have told me to-day, and considered questions I
should like to ask you, I'll let you know. I'm sure you won't
mind devoting some of your valuable time to satisfying my
inquisitiveness."</p>

<p>The financier did not answer. Saul Murmer glanced past
Carrington Manning into the gloom of the hall where the maid
awaited him. He bent to the little financier confidentially.</p>

<p>"Strange thing, Mr. Manning. You told me your wife died seven
years ago&mdash;and I thought I saw her in Sydney the other
day!"</p>

<p>Before Carrington Manning could reply the detective passed out
of the room, pulling the door shut behind him. On the doorstep of
the house he turned to the maid.</p>

<p>"Interesting man, Mr. Carrington Manning," he observed lazily.
"Quite a personality. I wonder what sort of woman Mrs. Carrington
Manning was? Suppose there's not a portrait, in oils or bromide,
in the house?"</p>

<p>The door shut suddenly, and in spite of padded jambs, with
considerable noise.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer, chuckling softly to himself, walked down the
gravelled drive to the gates, en route for Sydney.</p>

<p class="first">DESPITE A popular and widespread superstition,
ingrained in the reading public by novelists who prefer to depict
gods, not men, members of the police departments of the world
have allotted hours of leisure. They work and work hard, while in
pursuit of criminals; they "rest" just as hard, especially those
attached to British establishments, in the peculiar manner so
astonishing to people of non-British races. Cricket, football,
tennis, and all other forms of sport, including golf, have keen
police adherents, not always of the "hill barracking" type.</p>

<p>Inspector Saul Murmer had, in the days of his youth, been a
keen devotee of all kinds of sport. In his day he had led police
teams to defeat and chortling victory against other police teams,
and privileged groups from the general community. Excess of
flesh, in later years, had relegated him to the English
equivalent of "the bleachers." With the further advance of time,
he had come to prefer solitary evenings in a comfortable chair,
or the pleasures of social life.</p>

<p>Leaving Double Bay, not too well satisfied with his interview
with Carrington Manning, Saul Murmer journeyed to the city and
his office at the police headquarters, in search of any little
details that might require his attention that day. To his relief,
he found that all that was now required of him was to sign off
duty. That formality accomplished, he leisurely journeyed
homeward. Installed in his favourite chair, the daily newspapers
duly scanned and piled on the small table in the corner, a
well-advertised book, not of the detective type, on his knees,
and the wherewithal for a comfortable evening on the low table
beside his chair, the Inspector gave himself up to
reflection.</p>

<p>He had a sense that he should be worried, that "something" in
which he would be vitally interested was about to happen, yet
could not define his feelings more accurately, think as he would.
He had not been satisfied with his interview with Carrington
Manning that afternoon; he had not been satisfied with the
information he had collected during the past few days. He felt
that he had been floundering in a maze of facts that should have
read to him a connected story&mdash;and they were to him, at
present, merely incidents.</p>

<p>To his store of facts he had to add two new ones, gathered
that day. One was that Carrington Manning, one of the financial
jackals of London, was in New South Wales a money-king. That was
puzzling, yet, he realised, not impossible. Many incidents in the
man's history were missing; for instance, he knew nothing of the
man's American history. He was well aware that many a man,
counted of small importance in one country, might have travelled
far under the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>The second fact he had gathered that afternoon was more
intriguing. Some weeks before he had chanced upon Captain
Pontifex in company with a tall, willowy, very blonde dame. Her
face had been familiar and he had sought an introduction. The
gallant captain had murmured: "Mrs. Pontifex"&mdash;which the
Inspector had believed to be a sop to convention.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Pontifex" had appeared familiar to his memory. Some
gentle probing and he had uncovered "Thelma Delevere" and that
aspiring film actress had, before leaving London for Los Angeles,
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Memory had stirred to the knowledge that at the time
Carrington Manning had scratched London's financial gutters for a
living, he had been connected with a certain Sarah Dolnan, a
butterfly then emerging from the grub stage of South London. Amid
a certain circle, and for a period, Sarah Dolnan had posed as
Mrs. Carrington Manning. Now Sarah Dolnan was Mrs. Captain
Pontifex, with the background of Thelma Delevere, noted American
film star&mdash;and Carrington Manning lived at Double Bay, a sad
and lonely widower.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer chuckled. Some pieces of his puzzle had fallen
into place. But those facts did not explain Theodore Manning,
possibly son of Thelma Delevere and Carrington Manning. Theodore
was reputed to be 20 years of age, and he looked older. But
barely 20 years had passed since Carrington Manning has
disappeared from London's police horizon&mdash;and the Inspector
had no memory that the financier had boasted a son. Thelma would
never have boasted of such an event&mdash;and when had she
disappeared from London society?</p>

<p>Saul Murmer fell into reflection. Here were fresh points he
had to elucidate. The gentle tones of the door-gong brought Saul
Murmer from his reverie. That was John Pater, and perhaps the
Australian could help him with his problem. He prised himself
from his chair and ambled to the flat door&mdash;to discover his
visitor was Miss Paddy Burke.</p>

<p>"Sight for sore eyes!" he exclaimed, his Puritan spirit
causing a quick glance at his wrist watch. Nine o'clock! That
was&mdash;"Come in, m'dear! Where's Theo? Have you given him the
night off?"</p>

<p>"Bother Theo," Paddy swept into the detective's sitting-room,
looking about her curiously as women always do when entering a
man's special apartment for the first time. "Theo! Do you think I
keep him in my pocket?" There followed a long, significant pause,
while the lady found a chair to her liking. "I hate those strong,
silent men!"</p>

<p>Well-arched eyebrows indicated thoughts the detective dared
not put into words. Convincing himself that his visitor was
comfortable, the slightest of feminine nods answering his
half-whispered "Cocktail," he became the drink expert known and
well appreciated by his men-friends.</p>

<p>From the sideboard, with his wide-flung doors, he cautiously
watched for the moment when speech would be welcome.</p>

<p>"They are a nuisance, aren't they, Paddy?" he said, busy with
the shaker. "Those silent men, m'dear; they don't give the average
woman just cause for complaint."</p>

<p>Miss Burke nodded. She accepted the cocktail and sipped it
appreciatively. "Uncle Saul&mdash;" she commenced; then
paused.</p>

<p>"Niece Paddy&mdash;" Saul Murmer, a wide grin on his full red
lips, ambled back to his chair and raised the whisky bottle to
the lip of his glass.</p>

<p>"That sounds nice and comfy." Paddy nodded and smiled. "I like
it!" Then in a burst of confidence: "Uncle Saul, you're a
dear!"</p>

<p>"A fat one, I'm afraid." Saul Murmer looked sadly at the "bay
window" that occupied far more of his chair than it deserved.</p>

<p>"You don't talk a lot," continued Paddy. "Only just enough to
make a girl feel comfy&mdash;just enough to excite her interest
and to give her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer looked his alarm.</p>

<p>"M'dear! Is this a proposal?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to!" The girl giggled delightedly. "But if I
proposed matrimony, I'd have to jilt you as an uncle&mdash;and
you might sue me for breach of promise."</p>

<p>"I would." The Inspector's grin matched Paddy's smile. "That's
the truth, m'dear. I'll have no trifling with my young
affections." He waited a couple of seconds. "Now, m'dear. What's
the trouble between you and Theo?"</p>

<p>"Nothing." Miss Burke's lips closed tightly.</p>

<p>"Then there's another man." deduced the Inspector.</p>

<p>"My!" Paddy held up mock-horror hands. "You are clever. I'm
frightened of you!"</p>

<p>"There is?"</p>

<p>"There may be." Paddy had the grace to blush. She waited a
moment. "Uncle Saul, I'm tired of living a useless life."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;what?" The detective stuttered. "Who?"</p>

<p>"Everyone should be of use in this world," Paddy spoke firmly.
"And I'm nineteen&mdash;nearly twenty, and&mdash;a girl is
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Married," interposed the Inspector. "You will be one
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just like you men!" Miss Paddy's fine nose curled
indignantly. "You can think of nothing but husbands, and babies,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M'dear!" Saul Murmer's English Puritanism, never far from the
surface, lifted shadowy hands.</p>

<p>"Well, that is what you meant," challenged the girl. The
Inspector did not reply. He could not deny the charge. He had
been thinking of marriage in connection with Paddy
Burke&mdash;not the "baby" part of it, of course; he had the
usual Anglo-Saxon objection to discussing such a subject with a
young girl&mdash;or even with an old married woman, if there is
such a thing. Why, even with men one spoke circumspectly!</p>

<p>"A girl should have a career," stated Miss Burke with
emphasis, and Saul Murmer thought she was quoting. "No girl
should devote her whole life to thoughts of acquiring a man as a
meal-ticket; no girl should aspire to nothing better than to push
a husband and a pram through the Inner Domain."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer decided that he had become convert to the "strong,
silent man" theory. Speech, he decided, would be embarrassing;
but as his visitor showed no signs of amplifying her statements.
He inquired, as casually as he could:</p>

<p>"Well, Paddy; what do you want to do?" He paused. "Why don't
you speak to your aunt&mdash;and she might find you a position in
her&mdash;her establishment."</p>

<p>He had nearly said "shop," and that would have been a solecism
with the higher hierarchy of Sydney's retail traders.</p>

<p>"To dress fat women in slim girl's frocks!" sneered Paddy, her
lips curling enticingly. "What a career!"</p>

<p>"They're not all fat, m'dear," protested the detective
mildly.</p>

<p>"Most of them are," challenged the girl. "Look at the double
chins you meet in the streets!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer felt he would rather not. Avoiding gender, the
conversation appeared to be taking a personal tone.</p>

<p>"Look at the fat backs you are forced to sit behind at the
theatre." continued the modern rebel. "Think of the fat ankles
you have seen ascending stairs before you. Remember
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer writhed. He murmured something that might be
taken for acquiescence in the shortcomings of Australia's fair
dames; or a denial of inspecting ladies' personalities.</p>

<p>"And you, Uncle Saul&mdash;you suggest that I should spend my
youth in the impossible task of fitting twenty-inch frocks over
forty-inch waists! I am surprised at you&mdash;" And the lady
looked surprised.</p>

<p>The situation with its environments so explained, Saul Murmer
came to the conclusion that he was rather surprised at himself.
He had the feeling that so far he had not exhibited the restraint
demanded from an English gentleman&mdash;even though only in the
detective class. Mixed with a certain sex-embarrassment, and a
vague fear of further revelations not for the hearing of
unmarried males, he could not subdue the feeling that his fair
visitor was unduly stressing adipose.</p>

<p>"You might become a physical instructor." he suggested,
anxious to guide the conversation on to neutral lines. "That's a
good idea. As a physical instructor you could wage determined war
against undue&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And become myself, straight lines and granite faced." Paddy
swung round, with the natural woman's gravitation towards a
mirror, and smoothed down a severely plain frock over delicate
curves. Her hands strayed to daintily-dressed hair. "No, thank
you! I'm going to become a detective," proudly announced the
girl. "I've got a good brain."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer acknowledged that as far as the container was
concerned the brain was nigh perfection. He did not put this
thought into words.</p>

<p>"And you're to help me," concluded the lady, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" The Inspector held tight to the arms of his chair.
For the moment the floor revolved on a bent axis: solid flooring
slipped under his slippered feet.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you want me to do?" he bleated feebly.</p>

<p>"You darling!" Paddy slid on to the arm of his chair. "I knew
you would help me! Now listen, precious! You're to see your
managing-director&mdash;or whatever else he calls
himself&mdash;the very first thing in the morning, and tell him
you've engaged a new assistant."</p>

<p>She paused for a few seconds, surveying the whisky bottle and
soda siphon on the table with a concentrated frown. "I'm not
going to tell you what you're to say to him&mdash;you've only got
to express to him your personal opinion of me and I know he'll be
pleased."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Saul Murmer believed he would never again speak
without stuttering.</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand." Paddy leaned against the back of the
Inspector's chair and spoke thoughtfully. "I understand. You
don't engage new detectives, you&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, I know! You
recruit them!"</p>

<p>"Detectives are selected from the uniformed force&mdash;not
recruited," stated the Englishman with his national regard for
correctness.</p>

<p>"Then all you have to do is to select me," Paddy laughed
sweetly. "That will be nice&mdash;and it might satisfy auntie,
when I tell her." She paused, meditating. "To be selected."</p>

<p>Again she considered the position. "Why&mdash;that's nearly as
good as a proposal! Men select their wives, don't they? All
that's left for us poor girls is to sweetly murmur: 'No, thank
you,' if the wrong man tries to select&mdash;and then all her
relations think they have a right to kick up a devil of a
dust&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl sighed.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The Englishman mopped heated brow with wilted
handkerchief. "Detectives are not selected that way. They're
selected from men who have shown particular ability while in the
uniformed divisions."</p>

<p>Paddy slipped to her feet, smoothing down her skirt and
surveying neat legs and ankles with particular satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Saul, won't I look a dream in uniform! I've got
good legs, you know&mdash;at least I did have until the dress
designers made us all wear ankle-length skirts. And I'll have to
catch jay-walkers and hit-and-run motorists&mdash;" She paused,
gasping. "Why, I'll catch Theo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Theo?" asked Saul Murmer
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"He wants to marry me."</p>

<p>"And he's a Gentile, is that it?" The Inspector thought he saw
light. "Of course&mdash;but then&mdash;" He hesitated and boldly
plunged, "Miss Westways is a Gentile, isn't
she&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>"You poor man!" Paddy returned to her seat on the arm of the
detective's chair, smoothing the spot where Saul Murmer had once
worn hair. "Of course you don't understand. Aunt Mattie is my
mother's sister. Mother married a Jew, and so I'm a Jewess.</p>

<p>"Oh!" The detective felt slightly bewildered. "Then it isn't a
case of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no case at all, and you know that, Uncle Saul, if
you're a real detective, instead of being a semi-satisfactory
uncle," declared the young lady with the wisdom possessed only by
those nearly twenty years. "No, uncle! Confess! Could you live
with a silent wife!"</p>

<p>"Many men might grasp at such a possibility." The Inspector
laughed, remembering certain incidents in his official
career.</p>

<p>"Well, no woman could live with a silent husband," announced
the girl positively. "That would be&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Torture," supplied the Englishman. "Well, that's settled,
m'dear. Theo's out of the running. Now, what of the other
boy?"</p>

<p>"What other boy?"</p>

<p>"The other boy." Saul Murmer spoke firmly.</p>

<p>Paddy bent forward, staring into the stout detective's face
for several seconds. "Uncle Saul," she said, at length. "You're
not as dumb as you&mdash;as you sometimes look."</p>

<p>The Inspector bowed his acknowledgements from his chair.</p>

<p>"I don't mean quite that," confessed Paddy. "But&mdash;but he
is rather nice."</p>

<p>"And possesses the youthful belief that it is the duty of all
humans to do their bit to make this world a better and far fitter
place for politicians and teachers," deduced the Inspector
venturesomely.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" asked Miss Burke much astonished. "I
never said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When am I to be introduced?" questioned Saul Murmer,
following up his momentary advantage.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night." Paddy flushed deeply. "The Green Lagoon at
nine-thirty. You'll be there?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be absent for a dozen Commissioners' jobs,"
announced the detective. He hesitated. "But&mdash;supposing
Theo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theo is off," The lady was emphatic.</p>

<p>"Absolutely?"</p>

<p>"Positively!" Paddy's black curls emphasised the assertion.
"Theo's a stick. He can't say 'Boo'; Now&mdash;Ted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted."</p>

<p>"He talks beautifully!" Paddy clasped her hands to her breast
ecstatically. "I can sit and listen to him for hours."</p>

<p>"Can he dance?" Saul Murmer remembered many eulogies on the
late, unlamented Theo, regarding his gyrations on the polished
floor.</p>

<p>"No." For the moment Paddy was downcast, then raised her eyes
hopefully. "I'm teaching him, though he doesn't seem to care for
it much. Just now, when I want to dance, I borrow Dizzy from
Addie and lend her Ted. Dizzy's a whiz on the floor!"</p>

<p>"Do you know Mr. Carrington Manning?" asked the detective,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning!" Paddy panted. "Uncle Saul, why do you talk of
the Mannings? I thought you didn't like Theo
and&mdash;and&mdash;Uncle Saul, I came to you&mdash;Uncle
dearest, I want to be a detective. I feel I shall be a great
success&mdash;and I really think it is the only thing I can
do."</p>

<p>"Detectives have to deduce quite a lot," the Inspector
explained. "They have to watch and tabulate the people
surrounding them."</p>

<p>"Then you've got me tabulated!" Paddy whirled across the
floor, excitedly. "Oh, Uncle Saul, do tell me! Tell me how I'm
tabulated!"</p>

<p>"No." The Inspector spoke firmly. Again he felt he was
treading on dangerous ground. He changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Now, Paddy, let me see what you can do in the way of
deduction. You know Mr. Manning? What do you think of him?"</p>

<p>Gravely and demurely, Paddy walked to her chair and sat down,
daintily shod feet side by side, hands clasped in her lap. For
the moment she remained the image of a reserved, old-fashioned
girl; then laughed gaily. Settling her skirts anew, she crossed
her legs, then quickly uncrossed them and sat up expectantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning? Oh, he's a funny old stick. Why, he kisses my
hand when we meet, and calls me 'My child!' I wouldn't like to be
one of his children&mdash;though he has only one. Why&mdash;" She
paused.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Saul Murmer, encouragingly.</p>

<p>"He doesn't behave like a man who has children," continued the
girl gravely. "He talks to them with&mdash;with something
missing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand." The Inspector nodded gravely. The same
thought had struck him when Carrington Manning had spoken of Theo
as his son. "Now, as to Theo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why. Theo and his father are more like friends&mdash;no, oh,
you know&mdash;more like business friends&mdash;or something like
that. Theo never calls his father 'dad' or 'sir,' or anything
like that. Oh, how can I explain it? He speaks&mdash;speaks just
like he would to you, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer nodded, understandingly. "How old is Theo?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite old. Twenty-something!" Paddy concentrated on the
question keenly. "He says he's twenty-one, but I think he must be
more&mdash;twenty-five, or even older."</p>

<p>"And he's still at the University! Rather old for education,
isn't he? I wonder Mr. Manning didn't finish his son's education
in England?"</p>

<p>"But Theo is American," corrected the girl. "He told me he had
only lived a couple of years in England, and didn't like it.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" suggested Saul Murmer, when the girl paused.</p>

<p>"And he works&mdash;really works," continued the girl. "I've
heard him and Mr. Manning talking about his work. It&mdash;it's
something to do with some machine&mdash;some sort of printing
machine that Theo's making, and he said&mdash;he said he wasn't
satisfied with it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, frowning, then continued as if picking her words:
"And Mr. Manning was quite cross with Theo. He didn't speak as if
he was talking to his son, who was being quite clever; but
as&mdash;as if he was talking to someone in his&mdash;his
office&mdash;Oh, bother! You must know what I mean!"</p>

<p>And again Saul Murmer nodded. The girl was confirming many
thoughts that had come into his mind. More, she was showing that
beneath her light insouciance lay a power of observation,
untrained, but which betokened a mind capable of thought; a brain
capable of receiving and analysing impressions.</p>

<p>"There is no Mrs. Manning?" the detective asked at length. He
tried to give his words an air of casualness, but felt he
failed.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Manning is dead," replied Paddy soberly.</p>

<p>"Has she been dead long?" asked the Inspector, not now
attempting to disguise his interest.</p>

<p>"I think so," Paddy considered gravely. "I have never heard
Mr. Manning or Theo speak of her. I think she must have died many
years ago."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer fell silent, gazing thoughtfully before him. Paddy
leaned back in her chair, watching him; rather puzzled and
excited at the examination to which the Inspector had subjected
her. She felt that she was facing realities&mdash;some instinct
telling her that the Inspector was not asking idle questions. She
fidgeted with the clasp of her handbag, then opened it and took
out her cigarette case, to replace it quickly. The Inspector
noticed the act, and, rising slowly, went to the sideboard and
brought the girl a box of cigarettes.</p>

<p>"You've visited at Carraway?" he asked, when the girl drew back
from the lighter he held.</p>

<p>"Quite a lot." The girl nodded. "Auntie and I have dined there
several times." She paused, then added: "Mr. Manning was quite
interested in 'Florabella.' He wanted to know such a lot about
how a <i>modiste's</i> establishment is run."</p>

<p>"Did he?" The detective missed the point of the girl's remark;
at the moment he was concentrating on the question of the missing
Mrs. Manning.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've seen a portrait of Mrs. Manning?"</p>

<p>"No," Paddy spoke with certainty. "There is not a portrait of
her in the house&mdash;and I've been all over it. I
suppose&mdash;" She added, rather sentimentally, "Mr. Manning
feels her loss so much that he cannot bear to have her portrait
on view in any of the rooms. I daresay he has one in some secret
place, amid his private papers."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer smiled quietly. He thought he could give a vastly
different reason for there being no portrait of Mrs. Manning
visible at Carraway. Suddenly Paddy, who had been grazing about
the room during Saul Murmer's long silence, noticed the time by
the desk clock on the sideboard.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she sprang to her feet. "Half-past ten! And auntie
asked me to be home early to-night!"</p>

<p>The Inspector struggled out of his chair immediately, and
reached for his coat and hat. Paddy protested. "You can put me in
a taxi," she ordered. "That's all, and get me a good-looking
one&mdash;I mean the taxi-driver&mdash;in case I want to flirt on
the way home. Now, Uncle Saul, do as you're told; or I won't join
your police force!"</p>

<p>Obediently, Saul Murmer escorted his guest through the
building to the street. On the pavement, he selected a taxi and
helped the girl into it.</p>

<p>"You're quite sure you wouldn't like me to come with you?" he
asked, with the Anglo-Saxon's unreasoned prejudice against
unattended females in public vehicles after dark.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Paddy laughed. "Why, I'll be home in ten
minutes." She waved gaily out of the window. "Go inside, Uncle
Saul, or you'll catch cold. Oh, and I'll come down and have a
word with your managing director&mdash;Oh, Commissioner, is it?
I'm sure he'll like to have me on his force."</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer stood on the pavement and watched the taxi
turn into Bayswater-road. The girl's last words amused him. He
wondered what would be Commissioner McFee's attitude if Paddy
walked into his office and applied for a position as detective.
The thought moved him to open laughter. In the opinions of
members of the Police Department the Commissioner was a gentleman
who required strong shocks at intervals. If Paddy gave effect to
her last words, Commissioner McFee would receive a shock the next
day&mdash;and not a small one. There would be those in the
Detective Branch, when the story got out who would state the
shock was well deserved.</p>

<p>In his flat with the door shut for the night, Saul Murmer
moved aimlessly about considering the information he had received
from the girl, fitting it into the facts he knew. A final
night-cap ended the day for him, and he went into his bedroom and
prepared for the night. The strident sounds of the telephone bell
broke on an exciting dream-scene wherein the stout Inspector was
chasing an elusive Mrs. Manning, nee Delevere, through Centennial
Park. Saul Murmer rolled over and said a few of the things
detective-inspectors say about crooks who work at hours disliked
by the best trades-union authorities. He groaned, as his warm
feet met the cold floor, and ambled into the sitting-room to the
instrument.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said sharply. "Who's there? Detective-Inspector
Saul Murmer speaking!"</p>

<p>"Miss Mathilde Westways here," said an agitated female voice
on the wire. "Oh, Mr. Murmer, have you seen anything of Paddy
this evening? I asked her to be home early&mdash;and it is now
after two o'clock!"</p>

<p>"Paddy?" The Inspector was now wide awake. "Yes. Why, she came
to see me this evening, and just after half-past ten I put her in
a taxi to drive home."</p>

<p>"She never arrived&mdash;she hasn't arrived." Miss Westways'
voice was almost a wail. "Oh, what has become of her?"</p>

<p>"Not arrived?" Saul Murmer rubbed the remaining sleep from his
eyes with his free hand. "Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then the official side of his nature asserted itself. "Now,
don't you worry. Miss Westways. Leave it to me; I'll look into it
at once. Just you leave it to me; I'm sure nothing very dreadful
can have happened. I'll ring you up in a few minutes&mdash;when
I've communicated with Police Headquarters."</p>

<p>Hanging up the receiver in the midst of Miss Westways' thanks,
he dialled Police Headquarters, asking for information of
accidents to taxis since ten-thirty that night. He switched the
inquiry on to the Darlinghurst Station then hung up and went to
his bedroom. In his mind was forming a series of
figures&mdash;the licence number of the taxi in which Paddy had
driven away; the number which his trained mind had automatically
noted.</p>

<p>He had barely shed his pyjamas and struggled into his trousers
when the telephone bell rang again. First, Police Headquarters
reported no accidents to taxis during the period mentioned.
Buttoning his collar, he was called to the telephone again.
Darlinghurst had been on to all hospitals. The officer in charge
reported no accidents to females or taxi-drivers. Saul Murmer was
puzzled. What had happened to the girl? Giving instructions that
Taxi 763 and its driver should be found and brought in for
questioning, he finished his dressing and went down to the
street.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="first">MISS PADDY BURKE was an essentially modern young
lady, with her generation's crave for adventure and the unusual.
True to her period, she boasted she feared nothing&mdash;with
mental reservations in favour of mice and cockroaches. Had she
been informed, when she arose on the morning of the day she paid
her visit to Inspector Murmer at his flat, that before she went
to bed she would be abducted by a white-faced, sloping-shouldered
taxi-driver, from under the very eyes of her adopted Uncle Saul,
she would have chortled with glee. Privately she would have
considered that taxi driver was attempting a job far above his
capabilities. She prided herself that she was more than a match
for any one man, and would prove a termagant handful for even a
couple of her own sex.</p>

<p>When Saul Murmer closed the taxi door and motioned to her
driver to proceed, Paddy leaned forward, watching the stout
figure of the Inspector, on the pavement. Really, she thought,
she had grown quite fond of the Englishman; privately, she
returned to the matrimonial schemes she had previously harboured,
for the linking up of the Inspector's, and her aunt's, lives. She
watched, until the car, swerving into Bayswater-road, the
intervening buildings cut Saul Murmer's waiting figure from her
sight.</p>

<p>Naturally, in the gloom of the taxi interior, her thoughts
roved amid her acquaintances, finally settling on the
well-remembered figure of Theo Manning. Paddy acknowledged that
at one time the tall, blonde youth had attracted her, not so much
by his personal physical attributes and his father's reputed
wealth, as by his strange gift of silence. His queer
possessiveness, his ability to remain in the company of others,
gaily chattering and laughing, without engendering restraint, was
intriguing.</p>

<p>Paddy, when she first came in contact with Theo Manning, and
noticed his strange manner, had promptly pre-empted him from her
girl friends. She was rather acquisitive of oddities. For long
she had realised that, while she chose to pose as madly in love
with the strange youth, she really cared little for him. He
possessed no sex attraction for her, and she was sufficiently
modern and modernly educated to realise that love, romance, and
marriage were based in the first instance on physical affinity.
Her few years in Sydney's social whirl had taught her
more&mdash;the absolute futility of the majority of the modern
youth.</p>

<p>She realised that if the modern girl's training had proceeded
a few steps further, few of the younger generation of males would
be successful in their mate-hunting&mdash;that to a girl's free
and trained intelligence the elder men proved far more
attractive.</p>

<p>Something of this she had once expressed to a girl friend who
was raving over the physical attractiveness of a suitor. Paddy
had interrupted the tattler with: "My dear, we modern girls have
long since abandoned S.A.&mdash;now we look for C.A.!"</p>

<p>"C.A.," queried the infatuated one, perplexed. "What is
C.A.?"</p>

<p>"Cash Appeal, darling!" retorted Paddy in superior tones.
"It's so much more satisfying when babies and bills come rolling
in."</p>

<p>Paddy was quite willing to admit that Theo Manning had C.A. in
large handfuls. Possibly he also possessed S.A. But she freely
admitted to herself that neither his C.A. nor his S.A. appealed
to her&mdash;all that had attracted her fancy was a certain
popularity he had obtained in her set. He had proved satisfactory
as an escort, a silent slave, willing to provide entertainment in
large measure. When he developed a certain small talkativeness
tending towards the possessive, she amended her views on him,
quickly and with the self-arrogance of the young. She expressed
her opinions freely, and was aghast when she found that her
decisions were not accepted with resignation.</p>

<p>She did the only thing she considered possible to do. Theo was
discarded as an escort, and another chosen. Occupied with her
thoughts, in which a new male figured largely, Paddy did not
notice that her taxi driver had turned from Bayswater-road into
the perplexing maze of streets that lay to the south of that
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>When a dim recollection of time reasserted itself, she
reasoned that she should long since have arrived at Elizabeth
Bay. She decided that something had happened, and rapped on the
window dividing her from the driver. The man did not turn his
head; his only acknowledgement of her action being an
acceleration of the vehicle's speed.</p>

<p>She tried to open the car door, to find it fastened in some
peculiar manner. She tested the division window, to find it
immovable. Again she tapped vigorously on the window-slide, and
the man turned his head, and grinned.</p>

<p>Paddy felt intrigued. She had read of abductions; was she
being abducted? The thought brought no sense of fear; she
believed she was quite capable of dealing with any situation
which arose. For the moment she was more concerned with the
personality behind the abduction. Who was he?</p>

<p>The taxi-driver she promptly discounted. The car sped on. At
intervals they passed solitary pedestrians, wending late ways
homeward. At infrequent intervals they passed shops, and twice
passed over tramlines. Paddy thought of shouting out of the
window, but the speed at which the car travelled precluded any
attempt at rescue by any passers-by on the road. Suddenly wide
Oxford-street came in view, and beyond it the massive gates of
Centennial Park. The taxi-driver cut recklessly across the
thoroughfare, narrowly missing a west-bound tram, and drove into
the gloom of the park.</p>

<p>Now the roadway was only lit by the glaring headlights of the
vehicle, with an occasional lamppost at long intervals. At rare
occasions they passed strolling couples, but they were entirely
concerned with their love-adventures, and gave little thought to
the speeding taxi and its involuntary occupant.</p>

<p>Sitting well back in the corner, to prevent being tossed about
the fast-driven car, Paddy gave herself up to her thoughts,
content to await developments. Did the taxi-driver mean robbery?
She had less than a couple of pounds in her bag; her jewellery
would not pawn for more than that. Besides, if the man meant to
rob, why had he not sought a fare who looked, and probably was,
more financial.</p>

<p>Abduction! Personal abduction! Her gay, modern spirit soared
at the thought. What fun! What a story she would have to recount
to her intimates the next day. She strove to remember what she
had read regarding the abduction of young girls. In cases she
remembered it had proved annoying and uncomfortable for the
victim&mdash;but always they had been rescued; usually by some
gallant unknown. That was satisfactory; but what did the
girl&mdash;the real heroine of the adventure&mdash;do?</p>

<p>In the old-time stories, Paddy remembered, they fainted, or
screamed, or performed in some similar idiotic fashion. Paddy
determined she would not scream; she doubted if she possessed the
requisite knowledge to faint convincingly. She thought. She
sighed. Surely her education up to date had not been conducted on
satisfactory lines, so far as abductors and their methods were
concerned. She giggled. Well, she would know better next
time!</p>

<p>About the time the car took to proceed half-way across the
park, Paddy had settled on her line of action. She would behave
normally and await the pleasure of the white-faced youth who had
assumed the duties of god at the wheel of her chariot. When the
car stopped, and she was face to face with the person whom she
believed had hired this totally inadequate youth for the
adventure, she would decide how to act. Face to face with the
real abductor&mdash;Well, she felt she could be distinctly sorry
for him!</p>

<p>The taxi stopped suddenly; the driver thrust open his door and
sprang out of the car. Paddy waited. It was not her policy to
take the initiative. Somewhat to her astonishment the door of her
section of the car was not opened. She peered out of the window,
but was unable to see anyone in sight. That was strange. A
moment's reflection and she tried the door. To her surprise, it
swung open easily. Picking up her handbag, the girl
alighted&mdash;to find herself on a lonely stretch of the park
road, entirely alone.</p>

<p>"Now what&mdash;" commenced Paddy, speaking to herself. She
turned on her high heels, scanning as much of her surroundings as
the deep gloom shrouding the park would permit. There was not a
soul in sight. She walked a few steps from the car, then returned
to it, as if to a known refuge. For a moment she reflected, then
went to the driver's seat and examined the mechanism. So far as
her knowledge extended, the car was in order. She looked at the
gauges; and found oil and petrol in plenty.</p>

<p>Again she took time to reflect. A thought came. She could
drive a car; then why not drive this car out of the park to some
main street and there abandon it; finding another car to take her
home. The police would find the car later. In the morning she
would ring up the police station and report her abduction. She
would tell Uncle Saul, and he would find the man&mdash;and she
would be very, very sorry for him! The idea appealed. She glanced
back over her shoulder at the long stretch of dark road over
which she had been carried by her irresponsible driver&mdash;and
giggled at the thought that the man had abandoned her without
even asking for his fare. Well, that was his responsibility; that
and the car. He, not she, would have the long tramp back to
civilisation. Acting on her new impulse, Paddy slipped into the
driver's seat and pressed the starter with her shoe.</p>

<p>The engine did not answer. For some seconds she fiddled with
the controls, then realised that the key was not in the lock.
That was awkward. She had heard that car thieves had some method
of short-circuiting the lock, but she did not feel inclined to
experiment at that time of night, in that lonely spot. Fuming
fretfully, she alighted from the car again.</p>

<p>Unthinkingly, she moved a few steps in the direction of the
park gates&mdash;and home. A derisive laugh and the quick pulsing
of the engine made her swing round suddenly. The car was on the
move, and she could see the form of the driver at the wheel. He
looked back, grinning idiotically, as she thought. She sprang
forward, to halt irresolutely. The car gathered speed and
disappeared into the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>What now? Only the long, solitary walk back to the park gates,
with the irritating possibility that she would not easily
discover an empty taxi at that time of night. Paddy murmured
naughty words under her breath&mdash;then tried them loudly on
the still night air, and felt very relieved. What a nuisance!
Paddy first thought of "nuisance," then substituted a male, far
more satisfying word. She breathed a prayer that luck would come
to her and that she would find an empty taxi at the Centennial
Park gates.</p>

<p>Then she commenced her solitary tramp. Exasperation and
expectancy have disastrous effects on glands and pores. Paddy
began to believe that her nose was shining. That had to be
immediately remedied, although it was improbable that she would
meet anyone on that lonely stretch of parklands. She
thought&mdash;Then she discovered that she had left her handbag
on the driver's seat of the inconsiderate taxi.</p>

<p>The abduction had not greatly disturbed her normal serenity.
She had considered it something in the nature of a joke.
Immediately she realised that she was being abducted, she had
studied her make-up in the little mirror of her bag, and had
rectified small omissions. No sensible girl would allow herself
to be abducted unless looking her best.</p>

<p>The abandonment of the car and herself, on a lonely stretch of
road, had only perplexed her: she had felt that she was not being
logically dealt with&mdash;on true abduction principles. The
theft of the car by its ostensible owner, had only irritated; but
the knowledge that she was left without a single grain of powder,
or one solitary touch of lip-stick, simply infuriated her.</p>

<p>Even in high-heeled shoes, Paddy was an athletic young lady,
and once the necessity for the long walk came to her, strode out
womanfully. Suddenly she stopped. On the still night air came the
throbbing of a motor. She wondered, had the taxi driver suffered
a change of heart and returned to her. That was improbable. Then
the nearing motor could only belong to some chance traveller
crossing the park.</p>

<p>She stepped into the centre of the road, where the motorist
would have her under the full glare of his lights. The sounds
grew louder. Presently, round a bend of the road shone bright
lights. Behind the lights the girl could see the dim outline of
the car. It rushed swiftly forward, towards her. The driver
sounded his horn; Paddy waved desperately. She heard the grind of
brakes, the slither of rubber on the damp asphalt. The car
swerved and came to a stop just beside her.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked a male voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Paddy; and truly she didn't know. "I
engaged a taxi at King's Cross to take me to Elizabeth Bay, and
the driver landed me here."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked the male voice. The rear door of the car
swung open.</p>

<p>"I don't know," repeated the girl. "He stopped the car and
left it. I got out to see what was the matter; then he again
jumped into the car and drove off."</p>

<p>"Humph." Disbelief was expressed strongly in the exclamation;
and Paddy grinned. She realised that her story sounded very weak.
What must the man think of her and her tale? She knew that if she
had heard it from another girl she would not have believed
it.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the man, after a pause.</p>

<p>"I want you to drive me to some place where I shall be among
bricks and mortar, with the chance of finding another taxi."
Paddy spoke boldly. To her that seemed the only logical course of
action.</p>

<p>"Got the money to pay the taxi driver, if we find one?" asked
the man, curiously.</p>

<p>"No," replied Paddy, honestly. "The taxi-driver has my
purse."</p>

<p>"Then it was robbery?" asked the voice from the dark car.</p>

<p>"Not exactly." Paddy was innately truthful.</p>

<p>"I got to the driver's seat to drive the car out of the park,
and when I found the car was locked I got out again, leaving my
bag on the driver's seat."</p>

<p>"Humph!" repeated the man in the car.</p>

<p>Paddy stepped closer to the car, trying to get a glimpse of
her questioner. His voice sounded incredulous, and the girl did
not blame him. She felt hot that she had been left to the
disbelief of a passing traveller.</p>

<p>"How are you going to pay the taxi-driver, if you have no
money?" continued the inquisitorial voice.</p>

<p>"I live with my aunt, Miss Westways, of 'Florabella,'" said
Paddy with dignity. "When I reach home she will pay the driver."
Then added rather plaintively. "I assure you he will be
paid."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" The man's voice sounded incredulous still.
"Well, you may as well hop in here. We'll take you to where you
can find a taxi."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Paddy moved to the open door, and hesitated. She
looked at the man at the wheel, his face dimly illuminated by the
light from the instrument board. "Why, you're Mr. Saxon! I met
you with Mr. Manning&mdash;Mr. Carrington Manning. I'm Paddy
Burke."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Of course&mdash;Miss Burke! I had an idea that I
knew your voice, but&mdash;but never thought to find you stranded
in Centennial Park at this time of night. Jump in, Miss Burke.
Let me introduce Mr. Dayton, in the back seat. Jump in."</p>

<p>Paddy waited for no second invitation, and stepped into the
car, rather wondering why Mr. Saxon, whom she had reason to
believe liked the society of pretty girls, had not asked her to
share the driver's seat. Still, she was safely out of her
difficulties and&mdash;</p>

<p>As Paddy stepped on to the running-board a hand came out of
the car to assist her. She found herself being drawn strongly
into the car. She murmured her thanks and sank, thankfully, on
the soft seat. The man beside her leaned forward, lifting a rug
from the rack. She murmured dissent, for the night was warm,
leaning forward to try and catch sight of her companion's face.
The rug fell open, and before Paddy could resist, its enveloping
folds fell over her head and shoulders, stifling the scream that
came from her lips. Firm hands held her arms to her side,
subduing her struggles. "All right, Jack! I've got her." she
heard indistinctly through the enveloping rug. Then the car sped
forward swiftly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">MRS. LIONEL LEYLAND lived at North Bondi. Her
residence stood on the side of a steep sand hill, overlooking a
road that wound irregularly between several sand hills, anathema
to tradesmen and the unhappy quadrupeds drawing their vehicles.
The house was of the "desirable residence" type. That is to say,
it was square, red-bricked, red-tiled, and detached. The bricks
and tiles were of that peculiar glaring red that is only supplied
by confiding manufacturers to builders who erect only suburban
houses of the "desirable residence" type.</p>

<p>The house was approached by a series of high, cement steps,
made of a large admixture of sand, and liberally powdered with
the same material. A little more than half the front of the house
was occupied by a partially enclosed brick veranda. The remaining
part of the section consisted of a bay-window giving light to
Mrs. Leyland's bedroom. A small, stained-glass window, heavily
shrouded by demure curtains, prevented even the reflection of
light passing from the connubial chamber to the veranda. Two wide
windows in the sitting room obtained for the room what light the
veranda did not absorb. These, also, were heavily draped, in true
suburban style, to shield the occupants of the sitting-room from
the vulgar gaze of tradesmen's employees, who would insist on
using the front entrance, instead of exploring through the rear
areas.</p>

<p>The interior of the house conformed exactly to the designs
adopted by The Suburban Builders' Desirable Residences
Association. That is to say, the rooms opened one from the other
in bewildering sequence, giving the effect that the architect had
obtained his ideas from the popular crossword puzzles. There were
no passages and few doors. Only the bedrooms were sheltered by
doors, and the kitchen lived on terms of intimacy with the
dining-room. Apparently the idea in the designer's mind had been
that the cook should not be debarred by her duties from taking
part in any interesting conversation, during meals.</p>

<p>At the rear of this "desirable residence" was an annexe,
consisting of a solitary room, apparently added to the design in
a moment of misguided generosity, and named "the guest
chamber."</p>

<p>In Mrs. Leyland's house, this room was allotted to the
exclusive use of Mr. Alfred Myson. Many homes in Sydney's suburbs
shelter "paying guests." In North Bondi the adjective "paying" is
slurred to oblivion, though well understood by both hostess and
guest. Mr. Alfred Myson became a "guest" to Mrs. Leyland, with
the privilege of one intimate conversation with his hostess each
Friday night, on lines similar to the following:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Leyland, I have&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speech is interrupted by a clumsy attempt to slip a small
package in the lady's hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Mr. Myson. It really didn't matter..."</p>

<p>But it would have, if the ritual had not been regularly and
faithfully performed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland was a social leader in Alterton-road, and had
recently acquired the afternoon-tea habit. Three afternoons out
of the weekly seven&mdash;the seventh was devoted by Sergeant and
Mrs Leyland to reposeful recuperation from the heavy Sunday
midday meal&mdash;were set apart for the entertainment of friends
and the exchange of smart gossip, liquidated by weak tea,
home-made cakes and 'store' biscuits.</p>

<p>At these gatherings, the procedure supposed to be adopted from
that used by the English aristocracy, the ladies present held
modernistic cups and saucers balanced on one upraised hand. On
the saucer, beside the cup, reposed the remains of a cake or
biscuit. Two cakes, or a cake and a biscuit, were the allowance
allotted to each guest; the remaining cakes and biscuits on the
stand were generally understood to typify the household
profusion. Any visitor trespassing beyond the allowed cake and
biscuit, or two cakes, or two biscuits, was not invited again, or
made welcome at future calls.</p>

<p>At the first afternoon tea party after Mr. Alfred Myson
entered into residence in the "guest-chamber," Mrs. Lionel
Leyland hinted broadly to her visiting friends that she was
temporarily sheltering a "distant cousin" from another State, who
was visiting Sydney on business. The "distant cousin" was a
convenience; it would explain his disappearance from
Alterton-road society should he prove an unsatisfactory "guest."
Temporarily, it obtained for him a certain standing in the small
community&mdash;and did not indicate any loss of social
leadership on Mrs. Leyland's part.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Myson won immediate approval from the participants
at the tri-weekly gatherings; yet Sergeant Leyland, with male
perversity, had not entirely welcomed the addition to his family
circle. Males of all species are of that nature. They are
solitary, suspicious animals, resenting the intrusion of other
males in the caves they call their homes&mdash;yet, in the
jungles of brick and mortar that compose our towns, where they
hunt their prey, they mingle freely with other males in friendly
intercourse. They are social only with females of the species, to
the usual annoyance of such females who consider they have
acquired rights to exclusive attention.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland was exclusively male. He felt that Mrs.
Leyland was not treating him in the manner he had a right to
expect. He considered it was "unkind," to say the least, to
expect a man when he returned from professional worries at the
end of the day to a particular private "cave" to find another
male-thing there; and particularly a male who indicated that he
considered he had a right to be entertained and considered, in
repayment of a certain weekly subsidy.</p>

<p>Not that Sergeant Leyland had, from the moment when in
half-hearted manner he had muttered "I will" to a certain
official question, ever dared to express personal consideration
in his own home. He recognised that he was only the bread-winner;
that his primitive duty was to win and hold the cave, his payment
the use of certain portions of the cave and such share of the
provender he won which his life-partner thought fit to hand him.
He fully recognised that in return for the many blessings
bestowed on him by that muttered acquiescence to feminine
correctness, he had to suffer the doubtful privilege of hearing
in amplitude, for the good of his soul in this world and the
next, a daily resume of his sins of omission and commission.</p>

<p>Whatever opinion Alfred Myson won in the Leyland household in
after days, certain things had to be counted to his credit. He
succeeded in effacing himself in a very satisfying manner. While
retaining his right, as "guest," to use reception rooms of the
desirable residence in which he found himself, he succeeded in
pacifying his host by a ready acquiescence to natural rights.
More, he found means to open to himself the aching heart of an
ambitious man, who had come to feel that he had not been fairly
dealt with by Providence, and his superiors: who had not found in
his soul-mate that loving and sympathetic understanding which
every man with a grievance has a right to expect.</p>

<p>Mr. Myson became a ready listener to police matters; a
sympathiser, with an intelligence peculiarly ready to suggest
lines of conduct approved by the complaint. Sergeant Leyland came
to approve of his guest: the mistress of the house preened
herself on acquiring him in view of his large and regular
contributions to the household expenses. Again Alfred Myson
proved very successful at afternoon and evening parties. He had a
fund of amusing anecdotes, some of them bringing little cries of
horror to the lips of fair hearers: he could, and did, perform
sleight-of-hand tricks that bewildered and amazed.</p>

<p>Those who innocently applauded his feats with cards and small
articles, little knew that their entertainer had a well-known
record as a "dip" among certain discerning gentlemen who daily
gazed on the broad bosom of the River Thames from the windows of
New Scotland Yard, when not on business engaged.</p>

<p>Without realising the fact, Sergeant Leyland soon began to
rely on Mrs. Leyland's guest in a marked degree. He spent hours
during the evening explaining to an admiring listener how a
police department should be run, and&mdash;little guessing that
he was addressing an expert&mdash;the methods and failures of
various criminals with whom he had come in contact. He formulated
theories of crime, thereafter exploding them in a manner
peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>In course of time, Mr. Myson also talked and his conversation
was not without purpose. Mr Myson was no man's fool. During the
period he had stayed under the Leyland roof he had plumbed the
depths of his hosts' mentality. The lady of the house was
amenable to flattery of a rather coarse nature; the gentleman of
the house could be handled through his extreme egotism.
Detective-Sergeants are not over-paid for the work and
responsibility expected from them. They have a sufficiency, but
not the rewards they come to believe should accompany their
undoubted worth.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland, in his ambitions, was sadly hampered by Mrs.
Leyland's social aspirations, which drew very heavily on his
pay-envelope. Mrs. Leyland, who had come to care only for
leadership in her "set," felt that she, too, had a
grievance&mdash;against those who framed regulations under which
detective-sergeants legally looted the public treasury.</p>

<p>Alfred Myson allowed both parties to understand that he felt
unbounded sympathy&mdash;so long as he was not expected publicly
to express it. He found that the lady was comforted by
sympathetic words, assured that the virtue of a social leader
could not expect more from a "guest" in her household. He found
that his host came to look for something more tangible.</p>

<p>Here, Myson, through his connections, was able to supply his
host with little scraps of information which led to welcome
additions to the Leyland exchequer. He went further, hinting that
he was acquainted with purely legitimate means whereby a
police-officer of standing could acquire welcome additions to
his banking account.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland was inquisitive, finally swallowing the
enticing bait. The little crook was far too wise to attempt to
undermine his host's ideas of loyalty&mdash;for in his
understanding, Sergeant Leyland was honest and loyal. Myson
assumed, and expressed the opinion, that police officers were, in
practice, "Caesar's wives"&mdash;that is to say, far above
suspicion. He hinted, very discreetly, that he had friends who
would appreciate and handsomely reward advice and information of
a purely speculative character. He showed vast and peculiar
knowledge, especially in regard to how rewards connected with the
return of stolen goods could be acquired. Working on these lines,
Mr. Alfred Myson soon became a person of importance in the
Leyland household.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland found only one cause of complaint against her
"guest." He was person of peculiarly irregular hours. True to the
many theories she had acquired since she had entered the wedded
state, Mrs. Leyland explained these irregularities by the fact
that her "guest" did not possess a wife. She was a firm believer
in matrimony for males; she had not the same belief in regard to
the advisability of marital bliss for females.</p>

<p>During her wedded years a theory had grown in her mind to
almost fact. She was prepared to consider that the Government
should compensate wives for the disabilities of having male
things about their houses. Why, she was wont to argue to certain
friends of like beliefs, why should the Government largely
subsidise unemployed male things? Why should not the Government
subsidise women&mdash;married women? They were much more worthy
to dip into the purse! A certain doubt also grew in the lady's
mind regarding her "guest," and familiarity bred the usual
feminine contempt for masculinity in bulk.</p>

<p>She disapproved greatly of the many private conferences to
which her husband and guest became addicted. She smelt disloyalty
to herself. In the privacy of the connubial chamber she often
ventilated this grievance, with others, disdaining and ignoring
the Sergeant's nebulous explanations, apologies, and the
evidences of an increasing revenue, with truly wifely
contempt.</p>

<p>Perhaps Alfred Myson might have had to search for a new
hostess had not the evidence of a comfortable fullness in the
ornate handbag Mrs. Leyland carried on her shopping expeditions
cautioned her to wisdom, or silence. She could not ignore the
fact that since she had acquired a paying guest, since he and her
husband had commenced those intriguing, low-voiced conferences in
the front room while she was engaged in the kitchen, she had
acquired a greater spending-power and the ability to dazzle her
intimates with new additions to her home and wardrobe. She
recognised that she had to link facts together, yet resented her
husband's very vague and manlike explanations of "business."</p>

<p>Business! She was well aware that any true woman could
completely outclass any number of men in any phase of vocation of
social life. Yet when the male members of her small household
took to spending evenings far from her watchful eye, and home,
she almost reconsidered her decision to wait and see. She could
not believe her husband could be far from her without being in
that occupation which a far-famed enemy of mankind is said to
foster.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, she went so far as to seat herself at the
near-period article of furniture she named her desk and inscribe
a formal note of dismissal to place on Mr. Alfred Myson's
dressing-table. Consideration came, and she went into her
bedchamber and counted up the increase of revenue she had wrung
from her reluctant husband: then deposited the dismissal in the
kitchen stove.</p>

<p>On his part Alfred Myson was well content with his new
quarters, and planned to make good use of them. He was
particularly content that, seeking a refuge in the suburbs from
police inquisition, he had chanced upon a gentleman of minor
abilities and major ambitions, and who was also in a position to
provide much exclusive official information of interest. As he
plumbed the depths of Sergeant Leyland's acquisitiveness he saw
before him larger and larger possibilities&mdash;and devoted
himself assiduously to the education of a very willing pupil.</p>

<p>That so great a proportion of the reward for information was
absorbed by the pupil irked, but the little crook had the ability
to look far ahead, and satisfied the streak of covetousness in
his nature by visions of a glorious and financial future, when
his fish was duly landed.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland was well satisfied with his advancing
prosperity. He found that he was becoming a person of note in
certain quarters in Central Lane. Up to the advent of Alfred
Myson his horizon had been bounded by police regulations, and a
frustrated desire for quick promotion. He had learned from his
"guest" that outside police regulations was a beautiful
world&mdash;a world of endeavour and unbounded wealth.</p>

<p>That certain ideas of his new friend did not quite coincide
with what he took to be the meaning of the police regulations
sometimes worried him. But, he reasoned with himself, knowledge
did not always deny regulations; he tried to believe it amplified
them. His funds of new knowledge engendered a contempt for his
comrades in the police department. He watched their growing
respect for his abilities to track down stolen goods with
arrogance; yet worried over their openly expressed surprise that
he was not more successful in tracking down the thieves.</p>

<p>He comforted himself for the latter with the reflection that
the average citizen had a passionate desire for the return of
feloniously appropriated goods, and a small regard for the police
view that the thief was of greater importance than the theft. He
came to believe the matter one of extreme simplicity. A robbery
was committed. Myson, in some mysterious manner, got in touch
with the robbed and conducted negotiations for the reward for the
return of the property. An agreement was reached, and information
conveyed to him of the location of the "swag." All he had to do
was to go and get it.</p>

<p>Only! In that word lay discontent. If only he could induce
Myson to hand over the thief with the loot! Perhaps, later, that
might be possible. He believed he had acquired a certain
influence with his "guest." If he acquired more
influence&mdash;gained some knowledge of the manner in which the
little man worked; then&mdash;</p>

<p>Full of such cogitations, he was seated one evening in the
sitting room, dimly conscious of Mrs. Leyland moving angrily
about the adjoining bedroom, preparing for a social with some
friends. Of a sudden he was startled by a voice: "Hey, Ley!
What's the big idea for to-night?"</p>

<p>If there was one thing Sergeant Leyland intensely disliked, it
was his "guest's" habit of abbreviating his patronymic to "Ley".
He had suffered and fought for the dislike when a boy; he had
scowled on the abbreviation since he had first signed himself
"Detective-Sergeant" He had believed he had squashed the hateful
thing&mdash;and Alfred Myson had resurrected it in a few weeks,
unmindful of frowns and scowls.</p>

<p>Also, he objected to the silent manner in which the little
crook moved about the house. He could not understand
that&mdash;unconscious of the fact that years of strenuous
practice had given the crook the ability to be neither seen nor
heard, unless such was desirable.</p>

<p>"What's on?" growled the Sergeant, frowning portentously.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the crook, seating himself opposite the
police-officer. "There's a few of the boys I'd like to introduce
you to. What about us two looking them up?"</p>

<p>"What's in it?" asked Leyland. He had learned that a cash
value could be placed on most of the little man's
suggestions.</p>

<p>"Not much, but a social visit might lead to&mdash;to something
in the future."</p>

<p>Myson strolled to the window, parting the curtains and looking
out on the lonely road below the house. Sergeant Leyland felt in
his pockets, then struggled from the armchair in which, manlike,
he had been reposing on the base of his neck. He jingled the few
pieces of silver that decorated his right-hand trouser pocket; he
remembered that his notecase was empty. Mrs. Leyland had seen to
that earlier in the evening. And pay day was still in the dim
future!</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, in slightly more amiable tones. He stretched
lazily; then: "Got any cash?"</p>

<p>"A bit." Myson did not show any signs of his usual
responsiveness to the question, and that seemed to the sergeant
ominous. Usually the little crooks was fertile in suggestion and
eager to respond to a cash hint. "Nothing on? Well, get your
hat."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" Leyland inquired curiously. The "guest"
was not usually so abrupt.</p>

<p>"That you'll find out when we get there." Myson smiled
crookedly. "Perhaps you'll find there other things you want."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland thought this sounded better; yet, for the
moment could not remember anything in the way of loot that was
being inquired for in Central-lane. He took his hands from his
pocket and wandered into the small hall of the house. As he
opened the coat-cupboard door, Mrs. Leyland opened her bedroom
door. The sergeant immediately had the suspicion that the lady
had overheard his conversation with their "guest." That was not
improbable in the desirable residences erected by suburban
builders.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Lionel?" asked Mrs. Leyland. There was
suspicion in her eyes, and in her tones.</p>

<p>"Out!" said the Sergeant, not too politely. He was of those
who held the belief that courting days and politeness merged
jointly into connubial hostility.</p>

<p>"I want you to stay at home this evening," stated Mrs. Leyland
firmly. She shared her husband's belief regarding marital
politeness&mdash;the only belief they had in common. "Mrs. and
Mr. Barracross may come over for a game of cards."</p>

<p>If there was a man the police officer disliked, with a
ferocity that amounted to almost hatred, it was Augustus
Barracross, a big, blunt, aggressive man, who lived supreme over
a meek little wife, just across the road. The suggestion that he
entertain this couple for a whole evening alone was
unbearable.</p>

<p>"Then you stay in and play cards with them," he suggested
truculently. "If you asked them here, you entertain them."</p>

<p>"I'm going to Mrs. Dittle's party." The lady's voice ascended
the musical scale shrilly. Mrs. Leyland always became shrill when
she felt her home authority was being defied. She believed the
only way to deal with a husband was by acting shrilly.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mrs. Leyland&mdash;" The lady retreated
hastily into her room, conscious that the public parts of her
attire were lacking. She held the door ajar, one watchful eye on
the menfolk. "Oh, Mr. Myson!" She giggled coyly. "&mdash;and you
nearly caught me."</p>

<p>"There's a little matter of business&mdash;er&mdash;" The
guest's smooth tones spread oil on a dawning domestic strife.</p>

<p>"Business?" queried Mrs. Leyland. Her thoughts sped to a new
and most desirable gown she had examined that day in
Framer-Brown's.</p>

<p>"Yes, business." Myson spoke softly, yet with a softness that
hinted at concealed firmness. "Sergeant Leyland and I will call
and apologise to Mrs. Barracross for being absent to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland's visible eye blinked; the thoughts behind the
eye wavered. She did not particularly care about the
Barracrosses, but she did care quite a lot what her menfolk might
do when far from her watchful eye.</p>

<p>"Business?" she repeated, and waited.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you please, Mrs. Leyland. Important business."</p>

<p>The lady was disappointed, but not for the first time in her
dealings with the little man whose smooth tongue she did not know
how to combat. The watching eye blinked again; then the door shut
with a snap. Through the door and the wall floated one
high-pitched word:</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!"</p>

<p>Myson, snatching his hat out of the cupboard, motioned the
Sergeant imperatively to the door. As the two men descended the
concrete steps to the roadway, the police officer exploded:</p>

<p>"Curse the Barracrosses!"</p>

<p>"Just as you like," agreed the accommodating "guest." He
peered into the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>"Ah, here's the car&mdash;down the road."</p>

<p>"The car?" Sergeant Leyland spoke bewilderedly.</p>

<p>Myson did not reply. He led the way rapidly down the road.
Just out of sight of the house, he paused and whistled. From out
of the deeper gloom of an alley-way a black car emerged, to halt
beside the two men. Feeling conspiratorially guilty, Sergeant
Leyland followed his friend into the car.</p>

<p>Almost before he had lowered himself on to a seat, the car
shot ahead. He leaned forward, trying to distinguish the features
of the man at the wheel. He could see nothing, for the driver was
closely capped and goggled. All he could decipher was a large,
flowing moustache, and beneath it an indeterminate chin.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" he asked in slightly exasperated
tones.</p>

<p>"You'll know presently." Myson leaned back in the far corner
apparently indifferent to his companion's curiosity, and possible
agitation. "Sit back, we don't want to be seen."</p>

<p>The car turned into an inland road, speeding swiftly through
the moonless night. Sergeant Leyland peered through the window at
his right elbow, trying to discover familiar landmarks. Once, at
a peak of a road, he thought he could distinguish the flash of
the South Head lighthouse. He watched for it to appear again, but
a dip in the road now bordered by houses restricted his
vision.</p>

<p>He sighed, stretched, and thrust his hands into his
trouser-pockets. The feel of the few bits of silver that alone
separated him from penury until pay-day lifted his courage again.
He tried to count up the meals that lay between him and pay-day.
The result was not encouraging. He felt he did not care where he
was taken, so long as cash lay over the horizon.</p>

<p>Then, beyond the driver's head, he caught a glimpse of the
harbour. Now he believed he knew where they were. He peered again
through the window beside him&mdash;and was rolled towards Myson
as the car turned quickly eastwards. Again the car turned to the
right, into a side street, and a few yards farther on slowed,
rolled through two tall iron gates, and with the crunch of gravel
under the tyres, turned again to the left, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>Myson thrust open the door and slid out of the car. Leyland
followed the crook, to find he was standing before a
solid-looking door, under a wide portico. Almost immediately the
door was opened, to reveal a wide hall, shrouded in darkness.
Someone pierced the darkness with the thin pencil-light from a
torch. Leyland felt Myson thrust him forward. He followed the
torch-bearer until the man halted; the light from the torch
illuminating a door.</p>

<p>"Mind your step," whispered the man who held the torch.
Leyland tried to get a glimpse of his face, but the man wore a
cap pulled well down over his eyes.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Leyland felt himself thrust forward, into
the room. He blinked, under the sudden rush of light to eyes long
accustomed to the night.</p>

<p>When he could see again easily, he found himself standing in a
well-furnished library; high, well-filled bookshelves bordering
the walls. Unconsciously surveying his surroundings, Leyland at
length caught sight of a short, slight man with well-sloped
shoulders, sitting behind a large, glass-topped desk. The man
nodded and smiled, and the police officer, not knowing what else
to do, smiled also.</p>

<p>"Come in." The man behind the desk spoke pleasantly. Then
addressing Myson in far sharper tones: "Shut that door! Do you
want the whole house to hear us?"</p>

<p>From Myson, standing behind the police-officer, the bright,
fierce-looking eyes went to the Sergeant; and again the man
smiled.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland&mdash;Detective Sergeant Leyland, isn't it?"
he asked. "Pleased to meet you. I've wanted to see you for some
days."</p>

<p>The man's evident mildness reassured the detective. Throughout
the night-drive his thoughts had wandered through certain
incidents recorded in the works of his favourite author. At
first, he thought he was being "taken for a ride" in truly
American fashion. Almost he had feared; he had entered the house
believing he would have to exercise much diplomacy to get out of
what seemed to promise to be an awkward situation. Now the very
friendly manner of the man he believed to be in some manner
superior to Myson and the other men, reassured him. He felt that
he had to reassert his dignity as a prominent member of the New
South Wales Police Department.</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;" he commenced loudly.</p>

<p>"I believe there is quite a lot you don't understand." The man
behind the desk smiled&mdash;but the smiling lips appeared
straightened for a threat. "It is possible that before you leave
me, Sergeant Leyland, you will be far wiser."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland could not but sense the threat behind the
words. For a moment he hesitated, then the animal courage he
possessed in marked degree asserted itself. He strode across the
room and seated himself in the chair before the desk.</p>

<p>"That's better," The little man nodded, his smile bright and
cheery. "I don't like people to be afraid of me."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" The police officer bridled. There was, he thought,
irony in the man's words. He added truculently: "I'm not
afraid!"</p>

<p>"Of course not." The smile on the little man's lips broadened.
"By the way, I should introduce myself. I suppose Mr. Myson did
not inform you where you were being brought?"</p>

<p>"He told me nothing; only that some friends of his wanted to
meet me."</p>

<p>"Quite right." The man nodded. "I like to do my own
introducing. I am Mr. Carrington Manning."</p>

<p>"The financier!" Leyland was impressed. He held the opinion
common in certain classes that the successful man is a special
object of reverence, whatever means were used to attain such
success.</p>

<p>"The financier, yes." Carrington Manning nodded genially. "And
you're in my home at Double Bay. 'Carraway,' is the name of it,
if you want to know." He paused. "You see, Sergeant, I am quite
frank with you. There have been no thoughts of abductions in my
mind. In fact, so free are you here that there is the telephone,
if you want to use it. This number is PP5593, if that is of
interest to you. In fact. I would like you to make a note, of it,
in view of later eventualities."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland stared blankly; he was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Make a note of the number," commanded the little man. "You
may require it later."</p>

<p>He waited. Laboriously, the police officer extracted from his
hip pocket a memorandum book of large size, and wrote down the
name, address, and telephone number of Carrington Manning, in
large, uneducated script. He wondered, as he wrote, why he should
be so complaisant to this man's wishes.</p>

<p>"That's right." Carrington Manning nodded, birdlike. "Now, I
would like you to memorise that number. In all probability you
will want it in a hurry one day, and it might be awkward if you
had to search for it."</p>

<p>The detective nodded, he did not know why. He wondered what
was to happen next.</p>

<p>"I think you and I can he very useful to each other," went on
the financier. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you lost anything?" questioned Sergeant Leyland, in his
official voice. Visions of rewards, to which he had become
accustomed of late, flashed through his mind. "If you will give
me the details, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will not interrupt me." Carrington Manning's voice
held a snap. "I intensely dislike people who interrupt me."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir." Leyland felt subdued.</p>

<p>"That's better." The little man nodded. "I have lost
nothing&mdash;at present. It is you I am thinking of, just
now."</p>

<p>"Me?" Astonishment was written largely on the Sergeant's round
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, you!" The snap still held in the financier's voice.
"I've had you under observation for some time, Sergeant Leyland.
You're an extravagant man."</p>

<p>The police officer made a little gesture of dissent, but did
not speak. In his heart he knew the accusation was true; yet he
felt there were extenuating circumstances the man before him
might have mentioned. He opened his mouth, then closed it,
somewhat in the manner of a fish out of water.</p>

<p>"You like your comforts," continued the financier in a voice
that held a strange cat-like purr. "So does Mrs. Lionel Leyland.
And&mdash;a sergeant's pay doesn't go far with people who
like&mdash;er&mdash;comforts." He paused, then added. "I believe
you agree with me, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Leyland nodded: he was beginning to wonder to where this
conversation would lead. "To provide those comforts you and your
wife have come to believe necessities, you have had to do quite a
bit of-er-financing&mdash;" The thin lips pursed. "We'll call it
that, anyway, Sergeant&mdash;and your financing took place with
my friend, Mr. Jonathan Poke. You remember him, eh?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="first">A DULL, red colour spread over Sergeant
Leyland's big, florid face, together with a strange stare of
wonderment. He had never looked upon his dealings with Jonathan
Poke as "financing." He had thought it to be just an everyday
friendly affair, to terminate in some distant era of the future.
Quite a few years before that evening an investigation he was
conducting had brought him in contact with Jonathan Poke, who
traded in the name of "Jonathan Poke and Sons, Financiers."</p>

<p>Jonathan Poke had a certain nervousness regarding the outcome
of the investigations and the prosecution that would certainly
follow. He had spoken of his apprehensions to the police officer
in a moment of confidence, and Sergeant Leyland, who reverenced
all those who controlled banking accounts, had gone out of his
way to find a means of privacy for the financier. Jonathan Poke
had proved grateful. Not only had he provided the Sergeant with
the assistance necessary for him to overcome a small
embarrassment hampering him at the moment, but he had taken large
pains to assure his benefactor that the present financial
offering was not to be taken, by any means, as the depth and
width of his gratitude.</p>

<p>Leyland had taken the financier's words at their face value,
and when debtors had again pressed had reminded his financial
friend of his promise. Jonathan Poke had shown himself
reasonable&mdash;so reasonable that the detective had come to
believe he had found the proverbial goose that laid the golden
eggs.</p>

<p>At Leyland's third call in search of assistance, Jonathan Poke
had spoken of auditors, Income Tax Commissioners, and other
persons of like disagreeable character. He had explained that he
had to show where every penny of his money went. He had suggested
that Leyland, a high official of the Police Department, would not
like these inquisitive people to believe that he was receiving
gifts from a mere member of the general public.</p>

<p>This led to the further suggestion that the name "Lionel
Leyland" inscribed at the foot of certain small documents would
alleviate such possibilities. As a gilded bait, in the form of
certain much-desired pieces of paper, lay at the moment beside
the promises to pay, the sergeant saw no reason why he should not
experiment with his usual signature.</p>

<p>"Just so." Carrington Manning's voice broke the little silence
that had come to the room. "I see you understand, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Now&mdash;magicians claim that the swiftness of the hand
deceives the eye. If that is true, then Carrington Manning was a
first-class magician.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland could not follow the quickness of the hand
which produced and spread on the desk before him certain slips of
paper, bearing his signature. His broad face showed the amazement
which momentarily overcame him.</p>

<p>"Rather many of them," Carrington Manning's smile was easy,
almost affectionate. "I fear you have been indiscreet, my dear
Sergeant!"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;" The police officer stuttered.</p>

<p>"Where did I get them from?" The slight, thin face behind the
desk beamed. "My dear Sergeant, most things can be obtained
at&mdash;er&mdash;at a price. You understand, I believe,
Sergeant."</p>

<p>"You bought them," accused the detective. "Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just that." The financier nodded. "I bought them. Very
regrettably, Mr. Jonathan Poke has met with serious reverses in
the course of his business. I heard of
his&mdash;umph!&mdash;collection and suggested&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You bought them!" Sergeant Leyland could not progress beyond
that very obvious fact. "You&mdash;but&mdash;" he stuttered
again. "They aren't worth anything&mdash;just a matter of
form&mdash;Poke asked me to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not quite a matter of form," suggested Carrington Manning,
still smiling. "I believe them to be quite legal and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you want with them?" Again Leyland became almost
truculent. The notes lay before him; automatically his fingers
closed on them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Poke lent me this money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you signed promissory notes for the money." Carrington
Manning smiled. "Why distress yourself, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>It was hardly worthwhile telling Sergeant Leyland not to
distress himself. He was distressed. Jonathan Poke had had no
business to part with these papers, valueless as they were. The
man had promised they should not leave his safe; that they would
be destroyed when they had served their purpose of convincing
certain officious Government officials that a noted police
officer was not in receipt of gifts.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of these things." Carrington Manning spoke in
soothing tones, the finger of one white hand pointing to the
promissory notes still clutched by the detective. "I am not going
to demand payment."</p>

<p>"No?" Leyland felt somewhat relieved. But if the man was not
going to demand immediate payment of the notes, why produce them;
why purchase them from Jonathan Poke? He could not believe that
this man was a universal philanthropist, and he had done him no
service, as he had served Jonathan Poke.</p>

<p>"No, I shall not demand payment of those notes&mdash;yet." The
strange, fierce eyes of the financier held the police officer's.
"I believe you were able to be of considerable assistance to Mr.
Jonathan Poke?"</p>

<p>"He didn't want to be mixed up in a certain case." Sergeant
Leyland gave the explanation sullenly. "I happened to be in
charge of the case and found that I could do without him."</p>

<p>"And you would do the same for me?" Carrington Manning's voice
was very mild.</p>

<p>"I might." The detective had the feeling that he had exchanged
a friend for a master. Yet his spirits, which had been hovering
about zero, rose. "That is, if I could," he added.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;if you could." The financier spoke easily. He
glanced towards a silver tray on the corner of the desk. "Talking
is dry work, Sergeant. Have a drink?"</p>

<p>Leyland's eyes had already marked the attractive tray. He felt
he could do with a drink, and nodded. Carrington Manning also
nodded, toward the tray, and the police officer interpreted the
nod as permission to help himself. A short, silent, interval, a
satisfied gasp, and a careful mopping of a large, military
moustache, and the detective felt himself again.</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Manning&mdash;" he started to explain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carrington Manning," corrected the man behind the
desk.</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Carrington Manning," the police officer
corrected himself. "There are circumstances in which I must do my
duty in accordance with the regulations. I can't go outside them,
but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gather you do not understand my words." The financier was
most amiable. "I am asking no official privileges. A good citizen
should, in my opinion, assist, not hinder, the police, on all
occasions. If my evidence, my assistance, is at any time
required, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then?" queried the Sergeant. If the man did not want police
favours, then, in the name of everything that mattered, what did
he want from him?</p>

<p>"I am considering you." The amiability had changed to a tone
of benevolence. "I have reason to believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>The phrase was familiar. Sergeant Leyland was fond of using it
on all possible occasions when he did not know.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said encouragingly. It is good to be able to grant
favours especially to those who are the financial gods of this
earth.</p>

<p>"I believe you are not properly appreciated in
your&mdash;er&mdash;chosen profession?"</p>

<p>The Sergeant's heart swelled. He believed that while he was
not properly appreciated within the walls of police headquarters,
his undoubted abilities had, in some manner penetrated to those
who had the power of knowing and appreciating. Could he use this
new ally offered him to force recognition from his departmental
heads? Carrington Manning was well known and wealthy, and
Sergeant Leyland was of those who believed that the moneyed men
of the nation dictated its policy and its Government.</p>

<p>He wondered. Could he ask this financier to approach the
Premier with some statement of his ability; some hint that the
most efficient and enterprising man in the Police Department was
being suppressed, and the efficient working of the Department
thereby hampered, by the jealousies of those in control? That was
a possibility.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair thoughtfully, trying to arrange
the opening sentences of his request. He believed he had to be
diplomatic; then he remembered that he held the upper hand.
Behind the words the financier had spoken lurked a hint that some
favour was to be asked of him. Manning had said that he could do
him a favour. In that case, he must be wary.</p>

<p>Leyland was of the breed that did not believe anyone would do
any person a favour unless there was ample <i>quid pro quo</i>.
Yet, was not this opportunity to be seized before the fickle
damsel fled?</p>

<p>"There are jealousies&mdash;" he commenced, feeling his way to
stating his request openly. "Of course, there are jealousies in
all Government Departments."</p>

<p>"Just so," assented Carrington Manning. "But jealousies can
be&mdash;er&mdash;circumvented."</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed the police officer. The conversation was
tending in the direction he desired.</p>

<p>"There are ways&mdash;" commenced the financier.</p>

<p>"The trouble is&mdash;" suggested the detective.</p>

<p>"&mdash;to interest the man who has the power, ability, and
knowledge to overcome and ignore these jealousies," amplified
Carrington Manning.</p>

<p>"That's the difficulty." Sergeant Leyland shifted himself to a
more comfortable position on his chair. He felt that he had
already surmounted vast difficulties. He had been brought to this
house virtually a prisoner. He had been faced
with&mdash;er&mdash;should he call them, past indiscretions. He
had met his difficulties bravely and with a manly, swelling
bosom, as was his wont, and some small atom of modesty crept into
what Sergeant Leyland named his mind, forbidding him from
stating, even to himself, that he had overcome them.</p>

<p>At the moment he was sitting facing a man of wealth and great
influence, talking with him on equal terms, dealing with equal
intelligence with a subject that held a particular appeal for
him. More to his purpose, and in his favour, the subject was not
his granting a favour, but the proper reward of diligence and
virtue to himself.</p>

<p>"But the difficulty is&mdash;er&mdash;twofold." Carrington
Manning leaned forward interestedly.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Leyland considered his new friend was
raising unnecessary difficulties.</p>

<p>"Two-manned, shall I say?" The financier laughed, rather
shrilly. "Yes, I am afraid we shall meet opposition to our plans
from two men. Don't you think so, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>The Sergeant did not think so, yet he felt he would not be
safe to contradict his host. In his opinion, there were
considerably more than two men in the Police Department who were
interested in suppressing acknowledgement of his undoubted
abilities.</p>

<p>"There are, of course, others." Carrington Manning had
correctly interpreted the thoughts passing through the police
officer's mind. "There are others, of course. You will forgive
me, my dear Sergeant, from suggesting
that&mdash;er&mdash;onlookers often see more of the game than
the&mdash;er&mdash;players."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland had heard that phrase before, and was willing
to admit it in evidence. Was that not the basic cause of his
suppression by the police authorities? Those with whom he had to
work were blinded to his undoubted abilities; yet this man before
him, one of the general public&mdash;of course, one of the
leaders of the general public because of his ability and
wealth&mdash;could recognise what those in the game&mdash;if one
could call the Police Department a game&mdash;were blind to.</p>

<p>"Two men." The financier's voice was very soft and persuasive.
"Do you require me to speak names?"</p>

<p>"It might be wise&mdash;" cautioned the detective,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I will mention their names." Carrington Manning spoke in the
tones of a Boy Scout announcing the completion of his daily good
deed. "I will mention Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer and
Detective-Inspector John Pater."</p>

<p>Incautiously, Lionel Leyland nodded. He was coming to believe
that the man behind the desk had not won his financial crown
unworthily. Yet&mdash;why had he omitted Commissioner McFee,
Superintendent Dixon, and quite a number of others from the list?
That was not fair to the two inspectors, though their behaviour
had been distinctly unfair, and the Sergeant prided himself on
his strict impartiality and fairness. Perhaps later, when he knew
his new friend better, he would be able to suggest to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Inspectors Murmer and Pater," repeated the financier with
emphasis. "There are others, of course, but Inspector Murmer and
Inspector Pater&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective nodded. He realised that the cunning financier
was not speaking all that was in his mind. Murmer and Pater! Of
course! Why had he been so blind that he had not noticed the
cloven hooves before?</p>

<p>"You must have noticed that Inspector Murmer holds many long
and secret conferences with Superintendent Dixon," suggested
Carrington Manning gently. The word "conferences" set Sergeant
Leyland's nerves tingling. Why had he not thought of this before?
That Inspector Murmer and the Superintendent were often in
conference for long hours, was open knowledge in the
department.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The financier paused. "Are you aware that your
name often comes under discussion in these long conferences?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland nodded vigorously. He did not know, but now
he strongly suspected the fact.</p>

<p>"Have I to tell you that had not Inspector Murmer, backed for
selfish reasons by Inspector Pater, strongly opposed the
suggestion, Superintendent Dixon would long since have asked the
Commissioner to submit your name to the Minister for an
Inspectorship?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater&mdash;" The Sergeant thought he should make
some protest, even if he was not quite sincere in doing so.</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater has the ambition to be sent to England. In
opposing your elevation to an Inspectorship, he is looking only
to his own advantage, not the welfare of the department."</p>

<p>The light, thin voice had fallen to an impressive undertone.
"To attain that ambition he must support Inspector Murmer who, as
you know, is one of the Big Three of New Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"The Big Three!" Sergeant Leyland gasped. Inspector Murmer one
of the "Big Three!" And he remembered how, when Inspector Murmer
had first come to New South Wales, he had approached him with
questions regarding the "Big Three," only to be laughed and
scoffed at!</p>

<p>He groaned in spirit. He had shown offence at Inspector
Murmer's banter and sarcastic remarks when he mentioned the "Big
Three." If only he had waited his time, played up to the
Englishman, he might have won his confidence, obtaining in time
some inside knowledge of the working of that remarkable body of
crime suppressors. But&mdash;The Big Three! Inspector
Murmer&mdash;that slow, silent, sarcastic fat, incompetent man, a
member of the greatest and highest police inquisition in the
British Empire! With an effort he sat silent, and merely
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes." Carrington Manning's voice still held the awesome
half-tones. "I have the best authority for stating that at one
time Superintendent Dixon had in mind not only the recommendation
of yourself for an Inspectorship to the Commissioner, but to
suggest that when Inspector Murmer returned to England you
accompanied him. Inspector Murmer, influenced by Inspector Pater,
persuaded him against that. Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland felt that now he understood only too well.
His heart was full of wrath and bitterness, mainly against the
Englishman. For the Australian Inspector, who for personal
ambitions had so far forgotten race and honour, he could only
feel contempt. Yet, mingled with the contempt was a burning
desire to hit back. "You must fight them; expose their ignorance
and fallibility. You must show yourself in your true light,"
continued the financier impressively. "You must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how?" The police officer was bewildered with this huge
volume of exclusive information. He felt that he wanted to get
away and assimilate these facts; yet a small doubt in his mind
insistently informed him that what the man behind the desk had
spoken had been long existing amid his secret doubts.</p>

<p>"I will tell you how." Carrington Manning spoke slowly,
allowing each word to sink into the receptive brain. "You must
watch these officers who are so grossly untrue to their sworn
oaths. You must watch and advise me&mdash;that is, if a mere
member of the general public can advise an expert like you on the
difficult matter of police procedure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Mr. Carrington Manning&mdash;" Sergeant Leyland
swelled out his manly chest. "I shall be pleased to do all in my
power&mdash;little as it may be. But&mdash;" A quick smile broke
on the solemnly-pressed lips. "But I must have knowledge. You
remember the old saying: 'Two heads&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Of course!" He nodded. "You understand, you have only to ask
me."</p>

<p>"I shall be most happy to follow your advice, sir." The
detective leaned forward across the desk, extending his hand.
"With your valuable assistance, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall defeat these men." Carrington Manning clasped the
sergeant's hand. With his free hand he quickly gathered up the
promissory notes that had, all this time, been lying before the
police officer, and put them in a drawer. Almost as quickly as it
came, he noted the frown on the Sergeant's forehead.</p>

<p>"You must not mind me taking care of those promissory notes."
Carrington Manning smiled apologetically. "Like Mr. Jonathan
Poke, I must protect my friend's interests. With these promissory
notes in my possession we can claim that any arrangement between
us is merely a matter of business, independent of anything I can
do to forward your professional interests. Later.
Sergeant&mdash;when I can say 'Inspector Leyland,' or even
'Superintendent Leyland'&mdash;then we shall be able to come to a
satisfactory arrangement that will protect your personal honour.
I believe you fully understand me. Sergeant Lionel Leyland cannot
accept gifts&mdash;there must be no suspicion that he accepts
gifts. But he has the ordinary citizen's right of entering into
any business contract he considers necessary."</p>

<p>The detective's face broke into a satisfied smile. He had not
thought of the matter in that aspect hitherto. No, nothing must
be done that would give his enemies any hold over him. He looked
up into the strangely fierce, yet kindly, eyes, beaming at him
across the wide desk&mdash;and to his whirling mind came some
poetic thoughts regarding this world being a safe and beautiful
place so long as the financial gods were in their heaven of
promissory notes and yellow gold.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Watch!" The financier's voice dropped to the old, imperative
half-tone. "Watch! Watch Inspector Murmer! Watch Inspector Pater!
There is no need to tell you that these men stand on the brink of
failure in their present investigation. But to make your
interests secure we must make certain of their failure. That is
why I tell you to watch. When you discover something, you must
act. You must immediately inform me. You must telephone
me&mdash;don't come here unless I send for you, and we will
defeat them."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland nodded emphatically. He would watch. Yet he
wondered what would follow his watching.</p>

<p>"Keep me fully informed. Let me know everything they discover
during their investigations. I have means of information unknown
to you&mdash;financial knowledge. Give me your information and I
will combine it with mine. When I have your knowledge I can use
these&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pulled open a drawer of his desk and flourished a file of
papers tied with impressive red tape.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland, you must swear that you will never reveal
the existence of these papers."</p>

<p>Carrington Manning dropped the file into the drawer and thrust
it shut. Sergeant Leyland took an oath under his breath not to
mention it, even in his dreams. He did not know what the file
contained&mdash;but it looked impressive!</p>

<p>"Those papers contain information regarding one of the State's
highest officials." Carrington Manning leaned forward, resting
his folded arms on his blotting pad. "With them I can approach
him at any moment. With them I can ask&mdash;Wait!" He added
quickly. "Don't understand for one moment that with these papers
I can force one of the highest officials of the State
to&mdash;No! All I will say is that with them I will
ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll report anything I can find out," promised the bewildered
but highly pleased police officer. His mind was whirling with
visions of the future. If he could get sent to England! There he
would undoubtedly impress the heads of New Scotland Yard with his
abilities. He might be asked to resign from the New South Wales
Police Department to stay in England, offered high rank in the
Metropolitan Police Force&mdash;become in time one of the "Big
Three."</p>

<p>"I'll report everything they do," he assured the little man on
the opposite side of the desk, watching him with bright, fierce
eyes. "They shan't move an inch without you knowing."</p>

<p>"Then we shall win! And you, my dear Sergeant&mdash;"
Carrington Manning rose from his desk impressively. "You, my dear
Sergeant&mdash;I soon hope to be able to say, my dear
Inspector&mdash;" The financier turned quickly at the sound of
the door being flung violently open. Into the room strode two
men, one middle-aged, the other, apparently, quite a youth. They
stopped quickly at sight of the Sergeant, his hand clasped in
both Carrington Manning's.</p>

<p>"What's this, Theo?" The financier wrenched his hands from the
police officer's clasp. "What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"We've got her!" It was the middle-aged man who spoke. "Lord,
it was easy! Fell for the taxi-trap, and then right into our
arms."</p>

<p>Carrington Manning did not speak; his face was set and the
fierce eyes blazed viciously. For a long moment he was silent,
and the men standing before him shifted uneasily on their
feet.</p>

<p>"May I have the pleasure of knowing what you two are talking
about?" The financier spoke with evident restraint of the anger
surging within him.</p>

<p>"Who have you got&mdash;and where?" As Theo Manning went to
speak, his father turned on him angrily. "Hold your tongue, Theo!
I'm talking to Saxon. What is this new trouble?"</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;Theo's girl!" Saxon spoke sullenly. "Theo
thought it would be good to get her&mdash;she's fallen out of
love with him, and that's dangerous. He thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought, too," interrupted the younger man.</p>

<p>"Well, we thought it would be a good thing to corral her.
She's likely to be dangerous now, so we went after her to-night.
We've got her. We've taken her to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" Carrington Manning strove to control his
rising anger. "Let me understand things. You and Theo, without
consulting me, or even advising me of your intentions, thought
fit to take possession of&mdash;" He glanced furtively and
quickly at the police officer, and hesitated. "You thought to
take possession of a person of weak intellect and place that
person in a safe place. You dared to act without my knowledge and
consent. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anger overcame him; he stuttered and fell silent. For seconds
no one in the room spoke, the two men just within the doorway
shuffling their feet uneasily.</p>

<p>"I say, dad&mdash;" Theo broke the silence apologetically.
"You don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand that I have to deal with a pack of fools."
Carrington Manning spoke smoothly, yet there was an undercurrent
of venom in his tones. "I understand you are pulling down all I
have striven to build up&mdash;" Again he glanced at the
interested detective. He paused, collected himself, then
addressed the police officer in his usual smooth tones.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland, I regret you have been a witness of a
breach of discipline in my organisation. But the faults of others
shall not affect your interests. I shall keep my promise to you,
and I shall expect you to keep your promise to me. In the matter
you have referred to, I shall take immediate steps to rectify my
employees' gross errors. There shall be no victimization&mdash;in
fact, I see a way to turn their errors to your professional
advantage. Yes&mdash;" he considered a moment.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do, Mr. Carrington Manning." The Sergeant
spoke briskly.</p>

<p>"You can do nothing at the moment. Later, you may be able to
do much. I think it best that for the present you and Mr. Myson
go home. You shall hear from me very shortly, Sergeant,
and&mdash;" He lowered his voice impressively. "I believe I see a
way. Yes, I see a way."</p>

<p>He linked his arm in the Sergeant's and passed out behind the
police officer, gently urging him through the hall. Carrington
Manning waved a short farewell to his late guest, then closed the
door quickly; yet not before the Sergeant overheard the first
words the financier addressed to the two men remaining in the
room:</p>

<p>"I have come across a few fools in my days, but never, Theo,
have I come across&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alfred Myson giggled involuntarily. He caught the Sergeant's
arm and drew him quickly to the front door. Under the portico the
powerful dark-coloured motor-car waited. The crook urged his
companion into the machine and immediately the driver set the
engine into gear.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="first">SYDNEY streets, with the pedestrians governed
with almost military precision, are almost impassable during
certain hours of the day. Factories open their doors and close
them with the same regularity as if keeping time with a military
band; offices are attended with the perfection of patented
robots. As individuals, everyone is trying to do the same thing
as his fellow, and failing miserably. They try to sit in trams
and trains, and succeed in travelling pendant from straps
suspended from the roofs. They try to progress along footpaths,
and find themselves interested listeners to conversations enjoyed
by those who consider that pavements should be reserved
exclusively for friendly meetings; they try to cross
intersections, and are arrested by police officers for
jay-walking. They try to take their meals at the same time and in
the same restaurant, guaranteed to hold not more than ten per
cent of insistent customers&mdash;and return to work suffering
the agonies of indigestion.</p>

<p>Swayne Court, in common with other areas of Sydney, suffers
from this zeal for orderliness. For half an hour every morning it
is a mass of jostling, suffering humanity. The tide recedes,
while the sufferers nurse their bruises&mdash;and work. Between
twelve and two the Court again resembles a riot. The afternoon is
given to quietness, and the city pigeons, and the day ends in a
terrific rush and scramble for "home."</p>

<p>When the last head-girl, or proprietor, has given a last look
around the establishment, seen to the security of doors and
windows, and off to "late" tram or train, peace descends upon the
battle-scarred areas.</p>

<p>Yet there are still people in Swayne Court&mdash;at least, one
inhabitant, and a couple of visitors. The visitors are the patrol
constable of the beat, and the watchman employed by the
Watchmen's Association. The inhabitant reposes within the four
walls of "Florabella" and is dignified by the name of
"night-watchman."</p>

<p>"Florabella" occupies two houses, one standing at an angle to
the other. The foremost house, if it can be called that, faces on
Swayne Court and gives official title to the establishment. The
rear house, partly devoted to showrooms and partly to warehouse
and store, fronts a narrow lane that passes from George Street to
Pitt Street, and which is just wide enough to take a lorry.
Clever interior decorators, with much paint, plaster and
ornamental work, have succeeded in concealing from customers the
fact that "Florabella" was originally two old houses and not the
one ornate building it appears to be from inside. The decorators
did not attempt to deal with the outsides of the buildings; they
have that habit.</p>

<p>When Miss Westways established her exclusive <i>modiste</i>
business in Swayne Court, she occupied the front house only.
Extensions becoming necessary, the rear building was
pre-empted. On the completion of the alteration then rendered
necessary, "Daddy" Thornton was installed as night-watchman.</p>

<p>"Daddy" is one of those strange individuals which cities, such
as London and Sydney, appear to evolve at will. He shows every
sign of being born in old age&mdash;and of having developed, with
time, to the innocence of childhood. In appearance, he is short,
squat and entirely commonplace. Invariably, his clothing is
nondescript, showing no signs of ever varying or ageing. He never
appears dirty, nor is he, in, appearance, strictly clean.</p>

<p>Shortly before eight each morning, with the exception of
Sundays and holidays, he disappears from Swayne Court, to
reappear when closing time approaches, smoking a foul-looking
pipe, to sit in the Court and wait for the ending of the labours
of various char-ladies. Then Daddy carefully knocks out his pipe
and enters "Florabella." An attentive passer-by in the Court
might then hear noises indicating that Daddy Thornton is engaged
in his first exploration of the night, shaking windows and doors
to be certain that they are carefully closed against
intruders.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Daddy appears at the front door of the
establishment, where he lounges, awaiting the pleasure of the
Misses Westways and Lancing, who have, to him, the irritating
habit of lingering about the premises long after the staff pass
out of the Court; then he closes the front door and bars it.
Until sun-up the next morning he resides in a privacy never known
to be disturbed, except by "Tabby," a noted member of the
night-watch in "Florabella."</p>

<p>"Tabby" arrived in Swayne Court in Daddy Thornton's pocket,
some few weeks after he had accepted, with dignity, the onerous
duties offered him by Miss Westways.</p>

<p>"Tabby," grown to enormous size, might have answered questions
re her master's activities, or inactivities, during the
watch-hours, but, like all sensible cats, she has never been
known to indulge in gossip with humans. Whatever Daddy's
shortcomings, "Tabby" did her duty to the utmost of her ability.
Miss Westways never had cause to complain that mouse or rat
profaned the sacred precincts of "Florabella."</p>

<p>It is a known fact in Sydney night-life that constables on
patrol duty have very small regard for private night-watchmen.
Constables generally assert that night-watchmen are the most
peaceful and most slumbersome, of city inhabitants during the
hours of darkness. They assert that after ten o'clock,
night-watchmen, having eaten a hearty and heavy supper, sleep
peacefully until disturbed by the early tramcars rumbling through
empty city streets in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Miss Westways scouted this legend, in regard to Daddy
Thornton. She declared that her watchman could not, at any period
during which her establishment was in his charge, close his eyes
for more than twenty of the proverbial forty winks. She points
proudly to the array of ornamental and accurate time clocks
decorating various parts of her extensive establishment,
asserting that should the watchman fail to insert the special key
provided in each lock at the appointed time, then bedlam would be
let loose over the city, to the detriment of the nerves of those
whose business or pleasure kept them within hearing.</p>

<p>But Miss Westways was unaware that an ingenious locksmith in a
near suburb of the city had given considerable time and thought
to time-clocks, and from a criminally-inclined mind had evolved a
master-key of intricate pattern, guaranteed to provide peace
where only noise was expected. Often Daddy reflected, almost
ruefully, on the many pints he had foregone when and while saving
much-regretted shillings for the purchase of a set of these
peace-providing keys.</p>

<p>During the evening of the week preceding the abduction of Miss
Paddy Burke, Daddy Thornton had been ill at ease. He considered
he had a grievance against the world at large. For more than a
dozen years he had been night-watchman at "Florabella," opening
the door to the staff each morning with the utmost regularity,
after stowing in his private bag the silent ticking alarm clock
and the time-lock keys that guarded his hours of repose. His
period of unease had commenced on the morning he had made a
leisurely survey of the premises, before opening the front door,
to find that during the night the establishment had been entered
and a packing case deliberately smashed to pieces.</p>

<p>In providing an explanation of this fact he had been forced to
expend much grey matter, and he was not sure that Miss Lancing,
for one, was entirely satisfied with the ingenious theory he had
evolved. His conscience also worried him for, during the
following days, he noticed that Miss Westways left the premises
without pausing to exchange her accustomed platitudes with
him.</p>

<p>Moodily, he considered, Bert Thornton might, in the near
future, have to seek work. The thought made him shudder with
horror. On this night Daddy received a new shock. Miss Lancing
had followed Miss Westways into the Court without delivering her
usual cautions regarding the safeguarding of "Florabella" during
the coming dark hours. Not that Daddy ever paid any attention to
these injunctions, except to interject an occasional "Yes, miss,"
at opportune periods. But the absence of the usual cautions
worried him. Now he remembered the incident of the broken packing
case, and&mdash;</p>

<p>The thought was decidedly inductive of melancholy. For long
moments he stood at the front door of the establishment gazing
vacantly in the direction in which the two ladies had
disappeared. He shrugged, resignedly, and slowly retired into the
building that was to be his castle for the next fourteen hours,
forgetting for the first time in history to stoop and rub
"Tabby's" back when she thrust her arched form against his leg.
He went up to the small room set apart for his use, and switched
on the electric kettle.</p>

<p>Possibly breakfast, for so he called the first meal his watch,
might induce more cheering thoughts.</p>

<p>"Tabby" accepted her shared meal without extravagant
expressions of gratitude, then went to a mat in the corner of the
room and, after considerable scratchings and turnings, lay down
for a short nap. Later, if dreams were kind, she might go a round
of the premises in search of the ever-dreamed-of but always
missing rat of fighting disposition and succulent flavour.
Failing in her dream-entertainment and hoped-for repast, she
would return to her mat until Daddy awoke her with his heavy
treads about the room while preparing supper. "Tabby" would then
arouse herself, stretch, yawn, and settle down to a comforting
wash-up and brush. Possibly, during the period of the toilet, she
might meditate on the theory that the life of a night-watchman's
cat is a sad and dreary business.</p>

<p>Daddy did not sleep early that night. For long hours he sat,
puzzling his problem. Yet, what could happen&mdash;but something
had happened. There was the matter of the smashed packing-case.
From the time of the discovery of the damage, and the necessity
of evolving a plausible explanation, until now, he had put
thoughts of the matter from him, resolutely. He believed that he
had lulled suspicions of his inactivity. Now he doubted that. His
mind wandered over the problem. Who had entered the premises? Why
had they done so?</p>

<p>He could not believe they had entered the premises merely to
smash up an inoffensive packing case. Yet nothing else had
happened in any part of the building; nothing was missing.</p>

<p>Daddy's mouth set grimly. If only he could discover the
intruder. He knew how to deal with the villain who sought to take
the bread out of the mouth of a honest working man.</p>

<p>Midnight chimed on the city clocks. Daddy knew that from then
on no chimes from those clocks would disturb the night-air, until
early morning. Wearily, unaccustomed to late hours, he rose from
his chair and ambled through the building. In his thoughts he
almost congratulated himself on his rectitude. Twice that night
he had made the rounds. Now, pausing before the first time-clock,
he felt in his pocket and brought out one of the unofficial
master-keys. He inserted it in the lock and gave it the required
half-turn. The key remained fixed. If he left the key in that
position, he would not be troubled by that clock until he
released the key on his last round of the establishment, in the
early morning.</p>

<p>Almost-reluctantly, he went from clock to clock, making
matters safe for a night of repose. Back in his cubby-hole, he
sat down on a chair, looking longingly at the couch against the
wall. He drew his pipe from his pocket and stuffed it with black,
rank-looking tobacco&mdash;then hesitated. It was against the
rules to smoke, but&mdash;half-past twelve! One pipe, then the
odour would disappear before he opened the doors in the morning.
One pipe&mdash;and then he would turn in for the usual
"half-hour" that might extend until his alarm-clock awoke him at
six o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Daddy opened his eyes to the first beams of a new day. He had
the feeling that something out of the ordinary was happening. For
a moment he lay still, trying to collect his thoughts. One fact
struck him with force&mdash;and that was that the city had become
the scene of a riot; every clock within the square mile appeared
to be engaged in a deafening clangour.</p>

<p>His next impression was that someone was attempting to beat
down the door. "Tabby" was prowling the room restlessly: going to
the door and scratching the panel, returning to the couch, and
clawing his clothing. Daddy knocked the cat back and rolled from
the couch to his feet. Curse those bells! What was happening? His
memory told him that he had neutralised the time clock before he
lay down for his "forty winks." Then&mdash;</p>

<p>He went out of the room, to the nearest showrooms. The clock
was ringing madly, and there was no illegal master-key in the
look. He felt in his pockets. There were no keys there, except
the legitimate master. The infernal hammering continued on the
warehouse door. Striving to think clearly, Daddy made his way to
the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" he asked, his voice shaking in spite of his
efforts to make it sound casual.</p>

<p>"Open this door," came in sharp, official tones through the
wood. "Make it snappy, or I'll break it in."</p>

<p>Mechanically Daddy withdrew the bolts and turned the key in
the lock. As he released the catch the door was suddenly thrust
back on him. A constable stood on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here?" asked the constable.</p>

<p>"Nuthin'," stated Daddy, optimistically.</p>

<p>"Then why are all those bells ringing fit to wake the dead?"
asked the constable logically. Daddy did not answer. He could
find no reasonable explanation of the bells ringing, except that
the clocks had not received the attention they had been
constructed to expect. He looked at the constable blankly, then
down at Tabby, who was rubbing herself against his leg. Neither
man nor cat appeared helpful. Then came a thought.</p>

<p>"Thieves!" he yelled, and dashed towards the interior of the
building. He ran into the first showroom, pulling the master-key
from his pocket and thrust it into the time lock.</p>

<p>"What's going on at the front door?" asked the constable,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>Daddy did not want to reply; he wanted time to think. It was
unreasonable to expect a man who had been suddenly aroused from
sound slumber to give a lucid explanation of anything at a
moment's notice. Daddy was certain that, given time, he could
evolve a reasonable explanation. He had been evolving reasonable
explanations for more than a dozen years, all of which had been
accepted, though some with slight doubts.</p>

<p>"Come on," said the constable, moving in the direction of the
front of the building. Daddy followed the constable closely. He
did not know who might be at the front door. In point of fact, at
that moment he did not care who might be anywhere in the
building. If he feared anything, except the loss of a night's
repose or the loss of his job, it was thieves. The front door
opened, revealing a tall form in a quaint semi-uniform of peaked
cap above ordinary clothing.</p>

<p>Daddy groaned. He recognised a competitor who served the
Watchman's Association. He knew that now there would be quite a
number of wigs on the green. The Association had long desired
Miss Westways business. For the first time they had a reasonable
hope of success.</p>

<p>"Thought as much!" The tall man the court spoke
contemptuously. "Went to sleep and left your clocks on the blink!
Wonder why Miss Westways doesn't get a watchman." He glanced past
Daddy and saw the constable. "Hullo! What's up here?"</p>

<p>"Thieves!" said the constable, in imitation of the tones Daddy
had spoken the word in. "You'd better come through the place with
me."</p>

<p>Followed by two reluctant and fearing watchmen, glaring at
each other like two night-roaming tom-cats, the constable turned
back into the building. A few steps, and he turned to Daddy:
"Here! Stop those infernal bells&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Daddy gaped. He felt in his pocket for the master-key,
reluctantly. Left to himself he would quickly have put an end to
the horrible din; but were all the clocks ringing? If the thieves
had missed one, and the strangely shaped key that neutralised the
action of the mechanism was still in the lock, there would
certainly be trouble.</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" The constable spoke nastily. He was irritated and
worried; entirely unaccustomed to the ringing of numerous bells
during the quiet hours of the morning. Daddy did not move.
Visions of Daddy Thornton lining up for the dole; pictures of
Daddy Thornton sleeping in the Domain, instead of on the
comfortable couch in the private room at "Florabella"; thoughts
of Daddy Thornton cadging his night-doss from the few remaining
charitably inclined of Sydney, swept over him.</p>

<p>He groaned.</p>

<p>"Here, give me your key." The Association watchman pulled
Daddy's clinging hand, holding the master key, from his pocket.
"This it? Right! Come on, constable. He's still asleep!"</p>

<p>Daddy followed the two men, feeling utterly miserable. He
glanced at the face of the first clock at which they stopped. It
was barely five o'clock. In a little more than three hours Miss
Lancing would enter the establishment. There would be
explanations and excuses to make&mdash;to he repeated when Miss
Westways arrived; and he had not a single thought on which to
build his story.</p>

<p>"You've been asleep," accused the constable, when normality
had been restored through the building. "That's what
happened."</p>

<p>"I don't fancy your job," sneered the Association watchman.
"Well, well! One knows what one has to expect it one doesn't take
proper precautions."</p>

<p>"That's enough of that," said the constable majestically. "You
didn't take two days of the Easter holidays to discover that
Cantley's forgot to leave their watch light burning, and then
ring them up at three o'clock in the morning to tell them to come
down and switch it on, did you, smarty?"</p>

<p>The Association watchman felt aggrieved. People with long
memories shouldn't be allowed to interfere when business was
under discussion. There was a nice commission in the offing, if
he could get to Miss Westways and obtain her business. Why
couldn't people let sleeping dogs&mdash;Why couldn't they be
charitable and let the past bury its dead? He hadn't forgotten
the episode to which the man in uniform referred. He wasn't
likely to forget it, either. Mr. Cantley never forgot to remind
him of the&mdash;er&mdash;mistake&mdash;whenever they
met&mdash;but Mr. Cantley was nastily minded and seemed glad to
save a few shillings out of a hard-working man's pocket.</p>

<p>"We'll have a look through the shop," decided the constable,
after some hard work with a pencil and a notebook, during which
he asked quite a list of unnecessarily intimate questions of
Daddy.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Again the procession re-formed, now of four, for
Tabby had joined the party, possibly in the hope that the
constable might turn out that rat of gastronomic
possibilities.</p>

<p>Slowly, uneasily, the little party marched from room to room,
scanning any possible hiding place for signs of an unlawful
intruder.</p>

<p>"What's up here?" The constable pointed to a pile of
shimmering materials piled on the floor of a showroom. "Miss
Westways don't leave her goods at night like that, does she?"</p>

<p>Daddy groaned again, openly this time. He surveyed the litter
of silks and laces with apprehensive eyes. Someone had been in
the building; someone had been in the room; someone had stripped
from the dummies the frocks with which they had been adorned; and
that since he had passed through that room at midnight! Now fled
were the excuses which had been forming in his mind&mdash;the
excuse that the clocks had suddenly departed from their orderly
line of conduct and burst into clamour after he had attended to
them at the appointed hour.</p>

<p>He might have found means of discounting the evidences of the
constable and the night-watchman. Vaguely, he had planned to tell
of his courageous and vigorous search for an intruder while the
two men had been hammering, on the doors, too intent on his work
of safeguarding his mistress's valuables to take time to admit
them. He had planned to state that he had left the bells ringing
while be had searched for the thieves, in the hope that they
would bring him help in his search, and the capture of the
burglars. That difficulty passed, he would claim that the two men
were grossly exaggerating in stating that they had been at the
doors for more than a few seconds before he went and admitted
them. If he could put over that story he would cover himself with
glory&mdash;and possibly obtain from Miss Westways a gratuity for
his noble defence of her property. Again he groaned, closing his
eyes.</p>

<p>Daddy had served long enough at Florabella to understand that
something approaching sacrilege had taken place in that showroom
during the preceding night. The thieves had done far worse than
breaking and entering a church! To enter Florabella, to tear from
the dress-dummies the creations with which they had been draped
by gentle and reverent hands!</p>

<p>Again he groaned, closing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" he groaned. "There's thousands gone!"</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded the constable, who was but a single,
ignorant man.</p>

<p>"There!" Daddy pointed to the piles of dresses.</p>

<p>"They're all right." The constable, young, efficient and free,
strode to one of the piles of materials and ignorantly lifted one
of the frocks by the edge that came most conveniently to hand.
"Bit crushed, that's all! That won't hurt a frock, so far as I
know."</p>

<p>Again Daddy groaned; this time at the sheer stupidity of the
man.</p>

<p>"You don't know," he stated firmly. "They're worth
millions!"</p>

<p>"I don't think you know, either." The constable looked
incredulous. "Where's the telephone? I'll ring up Central and
report."</p>

<p>"I've got to get on with my job," announced the Association
watchman, in superior tones. He had surmounted the Cantley
episode for the umpteenth time, and again felt safe. "I can't
sleep on my job." He looked Daddy up and down, with superior
disdain. "You'd better come and let me out."</p>

<p>Wearily Daddy went again through the rooms to the front door;
he unlocked the door and stepped aside for the Association
watchman to pass into the Court. Just as Daddy was preparing to
close the door again the night-watchman turned, to deliver his
carefully thought-out parting gibe.</p>

<p>"Your job's putty," he stated emphatically and very clearly,
in the hope that some early-riser would overhear him. "Miss
Lancing will give you all you want&mdash;and more, I
know&mdash;and&mdash;" he paused impressively, "&mdash;you
needn't come smelling me to put in a word for you with my
people&mdash;for I won't."</p>

<p>Full of conscious rectitude he watched for Daddy to wither
under the blight of his sarcasm. But Daddy, smiled, and for the
moment the Association watchman wondered.</p>

<p>"I won't," promised Daddy, with apparent humility. "I won't,
Mr. Watson. I'll ask Mr. Cantley for the job of seeing that the
Association's watchman sees that his night-light is burning."</p>

<p>The front door of "Florabella" closed with a slam. Charlie
Watson heard the lock click as the key was turned, the heavy
treads of Daddy and the constable going in the direction of Miss
Lancing's office, in search of a telephone.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE inquiries regarding the whereabouts of Miss
Paddy Burke during the early hours were disappointing. Nothing
was heard of the lady or the taxi. True to his promise, Inspector
Murmer telephoned Miss Westways immediately the result of his
inquiries among the hospitals and police stations of metropolitan
districts were to hand. He had nothing to report. So far as
official knowledge went, the girl and the motor car had
completely disappeared.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer came down to police headquarters the morning
following Paddy's strange disappearance (the same morning on
which the burglary at "Florabella" was discovered) weary-eyed and
worried. He had not left the search for the girl to official
routine, but had personally visited each point where there was
hope of news. He was perplexed, for he could not rid his mind of
the thought that the girl's abduction was in some way connected
with the queer events preceding it and surrounding Miss Westways
and her establishment.</p>

<p>Immediately he reached his office the detective was informed
that the missing taxi driver had been brought to headquarters.
The reporting officer stated that the man had been found asleep
inside his car, drugged, and decorated with a substantial lump on
the back of his head. Paul Murmer gave instructions that the man
was to be brought to his office immediately.</p>

<p>As he had expected to find, the man did not prove to be the
driver he had seen on the taxi he had engaged for Paddy the
previous evening. The man who nervously confronted him was short,
stout, red-faced and elderly. The man he had seen in the car was
young, sloping-shouldered, thin and white-faced. Saul Murmer had
expected something like this.</p>

<p>The taxi-driver told a straight story and one that might be
expected. He had been hailed by a fare about nine o'clock the
previous evening and directed to drive to an address in Surry
Hills. When his fare alighted, he invited the driver into the
house for a drink. The man went unsuspectingly, to be knocked out
by a blow on the head. He had recovered his senses to find a
constable shaking him, and himself and his car in Moore Park. His
clothing was drenched with the night-dew.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer nodded and dismissed the man with a caution that
it was not wise to enter strange houses. He was furious with
himself, that he had been gulled by the simple trick preceding
the abduction. He had selected the car for Paddy, and he had not
taken the first car that offered. The only consolation he could
find was that he had never thought of an abduction in regard to
the girl, and that abduction in crowded Darlinghurst at that
early hour of the night was unbelievable.</p>

<p>Drafting a very careful description of the man he had seen in
the taxi, Saul Murmer ordered it to be broadcast throughout the
State. He was not very hopeful that this means would result in
locating the man who had driven the taxi. But he had now reason
to believe that the wanted man was a crook, or an associate of
crooks. The circular might come under the eyes of some police
officer who had previous dealings with the man, could identify
him, and possibly give clues where best to locate him.</p>

<p>Inspector John Pater was astonished to find Saul Murmer at his
desk when he arrived at Police Headquarters. A few words put him
in possession of the details of the case. Pater frowned, thought
a moment, then remarked: "Looks like Slinky Cadby," he said.</p>

<p>"Slinky Cadby?" queried the stout man, "That's a new one on
me. Who is the lad?"</p>

<p>"Not in your line, old man." John Pater grinned. "Slinky runs
more with the minor members of the department. Petty thefts,
pick-pockets, and that sort of thing. You've got too big a
reputation to deal with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll deal with him." The baby blue eyes steeled
astonishingly.</p>

<p>"We'll have him brought in," The Inspector drew the telephone
to him and rang up the broadcasting officer, requesting that all
stations be notified that Slinky Cadby was required at police
headquarters for questioning. He had hardly replaced the receiver
on the hook when an exclamation from John Pater caused him to
look up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Seen this morning's broadcast, Saul?"</p>

<p>"No." Saul Murmer picked up the newly-printed sheet lying on
his desk, and which he had thrust aside in the urgency of the
moment. "What's fresh?"</p>

<p>"Only that 'Florabella' was burgled at an early hour this
morning." John Pater looked up inquisitively. "Miss Westways is a
friend of yours, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Its her niece I've got an 'all-stations' out for," replied
Saul Murmer, scanning the scanty details on the printed sheet
hastily. "Now, I wonder&mdash;" He paused, tailing into
meditation.</p>

<p>"Wonder if there is any connection?" queried the
Australian.</p>

<p>"There might be." The Englishman spoke thoughtfully. "There's
been funny things going on about 'Florabella' and Miss Westways
lately."</p>

<p>Again Saul Murmer became thoughtful. A long pause, during
which Inspector Pater waited hopefully. At length the stout
detective started to speak, recounting the story of the strange
sketches, the so-called practical jokes that always followed the
sketches, and the abnormal and apparently senseless smashing of
the wooden case in which the strange dress-dummy had arrived from
England.</p>

<p>John Pater was interested.</p>

<p>"You mean," he asked, "Miss Westways received a sketch on a
certain day, and the following night someone entered 'Florabella'
and smashed up a wooden case that had recently arrived from
England?"</p>

<p>"Just about that."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer rose from his desk-chair and ambled to his
favourite seat at the window. John Pater nodded his satisfaction.
Saul Murmer at his desk was a detective much worried; in his
favourite chair at the window he was a detective marshalling
facts, scenting clues, and formulating theories that brought him
ever closer to the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>"Who discovered the burglary?" asked the Englishman, at
length.</p>

<p>"The night-watchman, I suppose. I know Miss Westways employs
one."</p>

<p>"I heard downstairs that Sam Dotty, the patrolman, reports
that he heard the alarms ringing inside the establishment, and
knocked. He states that the night-watchman admits being asleep,
and added that the man took a lot of waking."</p>

<p>"Doped." Saul Murmer nodded. "Just what they would do! What
did they take?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, so far as our men know at present. Did a bit of
damage in the search for what they were after."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" The stout man fished in the side pocket of
his jacket and extracted a crumpled paper of cigarettes. He lit
one. When it was glowing freely he looked up, grinning: "By the
way, John, I've discovered something. I've had no breakfast this
morning."</p>

<p>John Pater laughed. "We'll count this one of your slimming
days," he said. "Must have been interesting in Swayne Court with
Dotty performing on the back door and the Association's man
tattooing on the front door. Enough to wake the dead!"</p>

<p>"Awake the doped, you mean." Saul Murmer opened sleepy eyes.
"Who's got the case?"</p>

<p>"Our friend, Leyland. He happened to come down early, and was
sent down to 'Florabella' because there was no one else, I
suspect."</p>

<p>"Leyland!" Saul Murmer sighed, "Like the poor, we always have
Leyland with us!"</p>

<p>"Suits me." John Pater bit off the end of the long, black
cheroot he affected. "It'll keep him busy and safe&mdash;and he's
off the Salom case. I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>"Poor Salom Club," The Englishman sighed. "Do you think you
can solve that problem alone?"</p>

<p>John Pater glanced over the articles on his desk, in search of
a missile of substantial weight. When he looked up again, Saul
Murmer, to his surprise, was ambling to the door. "Where to,
Saul?"</p>

<p>"Dixon. Coming?" The stout man did not wait for a reply. He
passed through the door before the Australian could get from
behind his desk.</p>

<p>Throughout the short journey to Superintendent Dixon's office,
the stout Englishman refused to answer questions. He thrust the
door of the clerk's room open, and spoke before the man had time
to look up.</p>

<p>"Super in, Tom? Quick!"</p>

<p>The portly form barred the room to Inspector Pater. The
Englishman's manner was so strange, so different from his usual
air of assumed indifference, that the man behind the desk sat and
stared. At a reiterated "Quick!" he sprang to his feet and, went
to a door, knocking gently on the panel. For a moment he
disappeared into the room, then returned and held the door
open.</p>

<p>"Superintendent will see you at once, sir," he said, his eyes
wide with astonishment. Then he sought shelter behind his
typewriter.</p>

<p>Superintendent Dixon, big, burly, with a round face decorated
sixteen hours out of the twenty-four with a well-chewed
cigar&mdash;Inspector Murmer's secret ideal of a
detective&mdash;stared wide-eyed as the stout man came
purposefully into the room.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Saul? You've frightened Tom out of half a
years growth," he said, holding out a large hand across the desk.
"I hear you've put out a hue and cry for a missing young lady.
Hmph! That comes of frequenting night-clubs, I
suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer grinned. "Its worse than that, Super," the stout
man replied. Without waiting for an invitation he sat down
heavily in a chair before the desk. "Got time to listen to an
interesting story?"</p>

<p>"Not if it's one of your bawdy English ones." Superintendent
Dixon grinned. "I know most of 'em, and you might have forgotten
you'd already told it to me. Just at the moment I'm busy; it
seems to be sales-time in crimeland."</p>

<p>"Then our criminals are following in the footsteps of our
weather prophets," growled John Pater. "They get our weather in
job lots."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer ignored the pleasantries of his companion. When
John Pater was seated, he plunged into an account of the strange
surroundings of Miss Westways and her business. He concluded with
a summary of his private investigations, concluding with his call
on Carrington Manning and the abduction of Paddy Burke. Then,
taking another line of argument, he proceeded to link his own
tale with the investigations of the Salom Club murder.</p>

<p>John Pater's eyes opened wide as the Englishman, with careful
logic, linked up seemingly unconnected events. Superintendent
Dixon lay back in his chair, champing strongly on the unlit
cigar, his keen eyes fixed on the Inspectors. When Saul Murmer
concluded his rather long narrative he asked:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring all this to me before, Saul?"</p>

<p>"Thought there was only some nasty practical joke being played
on Miss Westways," stated the Englishman, shortly. "It wasn't
until this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This morning you connected the events through the burglary
and Miss Burke's abduction?"</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer nodded shortly.</p>

<p>"That means, you link Carrington Manning and his son, Pontifex
and his wife, Catlow, Buller, Myson, and the missing taxi-driver
with a criminal gang, all working towards some purpose of which
you have no knowledge at present."</p>

<p>"Looks extremely like it." John Pater nodded assent to the
suggestion.</p>

<p>Superintendent Dixon pondered for some moments.</p>

<p>"You want to make this official, Saul?"</p>

<p>"Must, now. Miss Burke's abduction is official."</p>

<p>The Superintendent and John Pater nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"So is the Salom Club murder and the burglary at
'Florabella,'" continued Saul Murmer reflectively.</p>

<p>"Then what remains, if any, can be thrown in," Superintendent
Dixon nodded.</p>

<p>"Can't make it out." Inspector Pater broke the small silence.
"There doesn't seem to be any sense in the matter; yet it all
links up."</p>

<p>"You haven't found any sense in the Salom Club matter yet,
John." stated the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Can't find a clue to the reason of Catlow's knocking-off."
The tall Australian spoke bitterly, "I've got Buller watched.
Myson has disappeared, so it is possible he is the man who fired
the shot. But when I find him, I've got nothing to pin that on
with. There's no sense in the yarn. Buller tells that they
quarrelled over the financing of a South Sea pearling
expedition."</p>

<p>The Superintendent nodded again. "There might be some sense in
shooting the lot of them."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer was dropping back into his old time sleepy,
apparently lazy, manner. Again silence fell on the men in the
room.</p>

<p>"You believe Carrington Manning to be the head of the gang?"
asked Dixon at length of Inspector Murmer. Then, before anyone
could speak, he added: "Who's on the 'Florabella' burglary
case?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland," answered Saul Murmer, rather too quickly
for a person settling into a favourite chair for a morning
nap.</p>

<p>"He's with you on the Salom Club affair?" asked the
Superintendent of Inspector Pater. "Can you spare him?"</p>

<p>"Easily." The Australian spoke with so much apparent relief
that his companions laughed. Inspector Murmer interposed.</p>

<p>"I want the 'Florabella' case," he said. "It links up with the
other matters."</p>

<p>"And apparently with the Salom Club murder," added the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Inspector Pater is handling that."</p>

<p>"I'll hand it over," suggested the Australian detective.
"Looks to me Saul's right. There's a connection somewhere."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Dixon showed perplexity.</p>

<p>"John and I have worked together before." Inspector Murmer was
well settled down in his chair, looking comfortably sleepy. Dixon
and Pater stared at him suspiciously; they knew the signs.</p>

<p>"You want Inspector Pater in with you?" asked the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"John leads; I assist." The full, red lips, with their perfect
cupid's bow pursed in a soundless whistle. "That's always been
the arrangement."</p>

<p>Superintendent Dixon considered. He had witnessed the
team-work of the two men before, and found it good; though he had
not quite believed the fiction that Inspector Pater was entirely
in command. Still, the partnership had always brought results,
sometimes of a surprising character. Why should they not work
together again? At the moment all work in the branch was of a
minor character, and this new problem appeared likely to loom
large before the solution was found. He could spare the two men,
at least for a time.</p>

<p>"There's a routine matter I could put Sergeant Leyland on," he
suggested at length.</p>

<p>"Keep him where he is." Inspector Murmer's baby-blue eyes
opened slightly, and a crinkly smile came round them. "We'll know
he's safe, then."</p>

<p>There Inspector Saul Murmer made one of his few mistakes.
Safety and Sergeant Leyland were not compatible in the work of
the Criminal Investigation Branch, at that moment.</p>

<p>"All right." Superintendent Dixon came to a decision. "Clear
it up quick. I can't spare the two of you all the time."</p>

<p>Inspectors Murmer and Pater rose to their feet. Half-way to
the door Saul Murmer stopped and swung round on his
companion.</p>

<p>"By the bye, John, what was found on Catlow?"</p>

<p>Inspector Pater showed astonishment in his face.
Superintendent Dixon, who found cause for study in the strange
mentality of the Englishman, smiled. He swung his chair round to
the large safe behind him.</p>

<p>"Just the usual tripe," answered Pater. Dixon was untying a
parcel on his blotting pad. Saul Murmer returned to the desk and
bent over the collection of small articles that had been the dead
man's property. For a moment he scanned the strange miscellany
carefully, then picked out a roll of banknotes.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" he asked, examining the rubber band
surrounding the notes.</p>

<p>"Catlow, I suppose." John Pater showed his mystification.
"That's how they were when I took them from his pocket."</p>

<p>"Then Catlow came from the United States of America." The
Englishman nodded, as if the rubber banded notes held a
significance he could read. "Australians don't roll their notes;
they either fold them, or keep them flat in a case. Nor do
Englishman roll their paper money. No, this man was sometimes in
the United States and acquired their natural habit with
money&mdash;as I thought."</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Saul?" asked Inspector Pater curiously.</p>

<p>The stout detective did not answer. He had slipped the rubber
band from the notes and was examining them carefully, one by one;
holding some of them to the light, testing others between his
finger and thumb. As he finished with each note he placed it on
the desk, forming three separate piles; one very large, the next
smaller, and the third containing only a couple of notes.</p>

<p>"Anything interesting about those banknotes, Saul?" asked the
Superintendent, when all the notes had been passed through Saul
Murmer's curious fingers.</p>

<p>"Only what you and John must have noticed when examining
them." A wide smile came on the full, perfectly formed lips, and
a twinkle in the strangely blue eyes. "Only what you two must
have immediately recognised when you handled these notes."</p>

<p>"And that's&mdash;" John Pater, in his impatience, caught the
stout Englishman by the shoulder and shook him slightly.</p>

<p>Slowly Saul Murmer came out of the reverie that had come over
him after perusing the banknotes. He shook the Australians hand
from his shoulder, and ambled to the door. There he
turned:&mdash;"And that"&mdash;he repeated. "Only what you two
must surely have noticed. There's quite a collection of Bank of
England notes in that collection and, with their face value at
about twenty-five shillings to the pound, Australian people don't
usually carry them about, as legal tender."</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, then added reflectively.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I'm wondering why Buller and Myson didn't relieve
him of them. Our crooks are not usually considerate enough to
leave the funeral expenses with the bodies of
their&mdash;er&mdash;victims."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Inspector Pater stuttered. "But Buller and Myson
left Catlow some time before he was shot."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Saul Murmer smiled reflectively. "That's what they
say!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="first">THE early beams of morning were flecking the sky
over Bondi when Sergeant Leyland and his accommodating friend,
Myson, returned to Mrs. Leyland's house. They found, to their
exceeding regret, that the lady had not been able to enjoy her
evening with her friends, the Dittles, owing to the intrusion of
an absurd headache. The headache engendered the feeling that she
was not at her best and brightest, and shortly before midnight,
exasperated at the undoubted success Mrs. Dittle was enjoying,
Mrs. Leyland escorted herself home. Her headache and exasperation
were not allayed by the discovery that her husband and her guest
were still absent from home, presumably on pleasure bent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leyland retired to bed, but not to sleep. For a time she
afterwards referred to as "hours" she lay awake, frightened to
let sleep overcome her before she had expressed her opinion of
things in general, and that evening in particular, to the partner
of her joys and sorrows.</p>

<p>She heard the men enter the house, or rather the uproar
occasioned by the Sergeant's attempt to enter the house without
awakening her. Unfortunately, he had not the ability acquired by
Mr. Myson, through long practice, of occupying a residence
without disturbing the legal inmates.</p>

<p>Repressing her curiosity until the Sergeant was partially
disrobed, and therefore at her mercy, Mrs. Leyland opened her
inquisition. Her husband was not informative: to the lady, he
appeared unduly elated and not at all mindful of the seriousness
of a Bondi householder, and the husband of a prominent Bondi
lady, wandering through the streets at early hours of the
morning, in a condition ascribed to bachelors in the literature
favoured by the inquisitor.</p>

<p>In fact, Sergeant Leyland took remarkably little notice, for
the first time in his marital life, of what his spouse had to
say. He was elated with the thoughts of the new friend he had
found&mdash;a friend who possessed not only the importance of
high financial standing, but of large and influential political
affiliations.</p>

<p>It was after Sergeant Leyland had stretched his manly form on
the feather bed Mrs. Leyland favoured for the connubial couch
that he forgot to remain elated. He became annoyed. He conceived
that Mrs. Leyland was forgetting the ancient curse: "That men
must labour, or they shall not eat!"</p>

<p>Labour, to the Sergeant, began at nine in the
morning&mdash;and it was now after five. A short quarter of an
hour of entirely personal argument convinced him that even if he
made confession in full, with all the evidences of contrition
expected from Bondi repentant sinners, he would get no sleep that
morning.</p>

<p>Exasperation grew. Flinging back the bedclothes in a manner
that evoked protests of modesty from Mrs Leyland, he sought
refuge with his trousers&mdash;in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Cold water, applied in abundance, over his head, gave a
fictitious wakefulness and, outwardly, calm, but inwardly fuming,
he returned to the bedroom and completed his dressing, to an
<i>obligato-recitative</i> by Mrs. Leyland on the woes of married
women. A very early morning tram carried him into the city. A
short search, and he found a barber who had the gift of early
rising; then breakfast, and the police officer was at a loose
end. A little reflection, and the thought came that he could use
the present circumstances to add to his reputation as a zealous
and painstaking officer of the Criminal Investigation
Branch&mdash;and he went down to Central Lane.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland's advent was hailed with enthusiasm by the
officer on duty. Only a few minutes before, Patrolman Dotty had
telephoned the news of the burglary at "Florabella", and the
desk-sergeant was at his wits' end. Diverse happenings during the
small hours of the morning had depleted the stock of detectives
on hand. Sergeant Leyland on being advised of the position,
immediately offered his services; he felt that at last the fates
had made up their minds to recompense him for what he had
suffered at the hands of his wife. He considered that here was an
opportunity to act in accordance with the advice he had received
from his new friend, but a few hours before&mdash;for was not
Miss Westways, the owner of "Florabella", a friend of
Detective-Inspector Saul Murmer?</p>

<p>Gathering from the plain-clothes constables in waiting, and
from the uniformed staff, what he considered to be an adequate
posse for the important investigation he was about to undertake,
he marched his party down to Swayne Court and established his
headquarters in Miss Lancing's office; then opened his inquiry. A
short and sharp questioning of Daddy Thornton, Miss Westways'
private watchman, and he placed his men at what he considered the
strategic points of the premises. Then, telephoning the
Watchmen's Association for Charlie Watson to be immediately
forwarded to him, asleep or awake, he commenced a careful and
conscientious hazing of Constable Dutty.</p>

<p>An hour later Miss Lancing, arriving for her daily labours at
"Florabella", was astounded to find a large-sized uniformed
constable on duty before her door. She was considerably
astonished when, having surmounted certain objections to her
presence in a building where, up to then, she had held autocratic
sway, she found Sergeant Leyland in her particular and very
private office. Not by any means a nervous woman, and though
unmarried, she proceeded to deal with the situation in her finest
"Mrs. Leyland" manner, and commenced to take the enquiry into her
own very capable hands.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland was annoyed; he particularly objected to her
examination of Daddy Thornton, and her strictures on private
watchman's partiality for sleep at 'normal hours,' although but a
few minutes before he had addressed similar remarks to the
offender. Further dissension arose when Miss Lancing showed very
plainly that she considered she had an undoubted right to take
part in any proceedings conducted in her office.</p>

<p>In his heart of hearts Sergeant Leyland began to bewail the
fact that Nature had ordained that he be born in this Age of
Women. Women and women's attributes were all around him.
Whichever way he looked strange things in silks and laces,
patterned in weird combinations he had been taught by Mrs.
Leyland to consider shocking and immodest, surrounded him. Woman,
in all stages and ages of life, floated about him as workers and
assistants came to what they had believed to be their daily
labour&mdash;and found to be a refreshing and novel excitement
apparently staged for their benefit, with a large and not
unhandsome police officer playing the clown on a very feminine
stage.</p>

<p>Before nine o'clock Sergeant Leyland was considerably
bewildered and thoroughly annoyed. Serious thoughts of putting
everyone in the building under arrest and conveying them to
police headquarters, where he could question them amid familiar
surroundings, came to his mind. He doubted the wisdom of the
thought. Superintendent Dixon, he reflected, was but a man; the
sudden influx of femininity might disturb him&mdash;and the
Superintendent, when disturbed, had a bitter tongue.</p>

<p>Night-watchman Watson arrived in Swayne Court shortly after
nine-thirty. In him Sergeant Leyland found an unexpected ally.
Watson had been justly annoyed by his day's sleep being broken
into by so trivial a matter as a police inquisition. But when he
found that the officer in charge of the proceedings was almost
convinced of Daddy Thornton's criminal interests in the supposed
burglary, he gave evidence with zeal and relish.</p>

<p>At the end of the first interview he convinced Sergeant
Leyland that what Daddy Thornton did not know about the affair
was certainly not worth knowing. Daddy Thornton was undergoing
his third and most severe cross-examination of the morning when
Miss Westways arrived at "Florabella". Already worried over
Paddy's inexplicable disappearance and Inspector Murmer's neglect
to telephone her more than eight times in six hours, her first
knowledge of happenings at her business premises was obtained
when a massive policeman, the admired of the assistants of her
neighbours and passers-by, demanded to know what reasons she
could give for attempting to enter premises of which she held a
cast-iron lease.</p>

<p>Miss Westways became annoyed; she was still further incensed
to find her showrooms, hitherto devoted exclusively to the solace
and seduction of womanhood, profaned by the presence of men,
large and small, uniformed and otherwise. She saw her assistants
gathered in corners, watching mere males parade where hitherto
men had seldom trod; she reasoned that the work she paid for was
not being accomplished. Too infuriated to speak, she went to her
private office and telephoned police headquarters, demanding
instant speech with Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>A man&mdash;and for the moment Miss Westways believed that by
some irony of Fate men were now alone in control of an otherwise
well-ordered and beautiful world&mdash;answered that at the
moment Inspector Murmer was in conference with Superintendent
Dixon and Inspector Pater, and that on no account could that
conference be disturbed.</p>

<p>Miss Westways felt helpless before this barrage of
masculinity, and could only feebly suggest that when Inspector
Murmer was available he should be informed that Miss Westways
would be glad to speak with him. Then the lady's thoughts turned
to Theo Manning.</p>

<p>She telephoned the University, to be informed that Mr. Manning
was attending a lecture, but that he would be available within a
quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. That was better. Miss
Westways gave instructions that the young gentleman should
immediately report to her at "Florabella" in person. Not that
Miss Westways had a great opinion of the University student's
mentality, but he was a male&mdash;and in her belief only male
could deal intelligently with male in moments of sex
rebellion.</p>

<p>Miss Westways' thoughts next turned to Miss Lancing. In past
days&mdash;now appearing as oases of orderliness in the chaotic
present&mdash;Miss Lancing had shown as a sun of organisation and
fertile suggestion. In this direction Miss Westways was
immediately successful. Miss Lancing sped to her employer's side;
but alas, she was no longer an aid.</p>

<p>The manageress had her own absorbing problems, chief of which
appeared to be one Sergeant Lionel Leyland, a male of the most
disagreeable and hateful type; one of whom nothing good could be
recorded. Yet Miss Lancing, though furious, was exultant. She had
come from a bitter battle with the police officer, wherein she
had won Daddy Thornton from immediate arrest. Miss Lancing had to
be soothed and pacified&mdash;and Miss Westways, in dire need of
consolation herself, did not enjoy the task. Between spasms of
exasperation at the imbecility of male creatures, Miss Lancing,
talking as woman to woman, was sure that Daddy Thornton had slept
through the night. Her reasoning was that Daddy Thornton had
slept through every night watch, and was always asleep, even when
he walked out of "Florabella" into the day's masculine world. She
lapsed into incoherence when describing the influx of masculine
creatures into the sacred precincts of "Florabella".</p>

<p>Miss Westways, almost amused amid her anxiety regarding Paddy
and her desire to straighten out matters in preparation for the
work of the day, came to the conclusion that Miss Lancing
believed that nothing less than an immediate shifting of the
<i>modiste's</i> establishment to other, and pure, premises could
overcome the taint of masculine invasion.</p>

<p>Miss Westways sent for Daddy Thornton. Daddy was inclined to
be self-assertive&mdash;probably due to the proximity of so many
of his sex. More, he had tested his theory of what had happened
at "Florabella" with some success on Sergeant Leyland until the
advent of his age-long adversary, Night-watchman Watson. Against
Watson's prejudice he counted Miss Lancing's late support. In
former days he had not been impressed by the lady, but her
valiant and strenuous advocacy before the imposing-looking police
officer had shaken his prejudices. Now Daddy Thornton found the
affirmations and suggestions she had, in the Sergeant's presence,
taken as facts, were doubted.</p>

<p>Daddy mourned the inconsistency of women. Miss Westways'
judgment, suspending him from duty, was almost a relief. He
desired to retire for self-communion and meditation to his
favourite bar, but the presence of the stalwart minion of the law
at the doors of the establishment forbade withdrawal from the
scene of his trials. Full of righteous wrath that Miss Westways'
commands should be disregarded by these men, Daddy sought
Sergeant Leyland.</p>

<p>"So Miss Westways says you're to go home!" The Sergeant's fine
military trained moustache bristled. "Did she? Well, I say you're
to stop here! Get out!"</p>

<p>Daddy Thornton got out&mdash;quickly. He went to Miss
Westways' office to lodge his complaint. He found Miss Lancing
there, anticipating him in complaint, and using language he could
only listen to and admire.</p>

<p>"The man's impossible!" declared Miss Westways. "I'll talk to
him!"</p>

<p>Miss Westways left her office filled with the determination to
beard this unaccommodating police officer in no uncertain manner.
She did not proceed far on her errand before she came face to
face with Theo Manning, under escort of two hefty constables. The
sight of the university youth brought Paddy's predicament to the
front of her mind. A wave of her hand dismissed the constables,
who had not the Sergeant's hardihood. She dragged the youth into
her office.</p>

<p>"Theo?" she exclaimed. "Where's Paddy?"</p>

<p>"Paddy?" The slow-witted youth spoke cautiously. "I haven't
seen her for two or three days."</p>

<p>"You weren't with her last night?"</p>

<p>Theo shook his head. He was not given to words where actions
could he made to take their place.</p>

<p>"She's missing." Miss Westways stared at the youth. She could
not think of anything else to say. "Paddy went to see Inspector
Murmer last night, and he put her in a taxi to come
home&mdash;but she didn't come home!"</p>

<p>"No?" replied the youth. "Have you asked Inspector
Murmer?"</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous!" requested the lady. "Of course I have.
He tells me he placed her in a taxi."</p>

<p>"Then she should have been driven home," complemented the
youth.</p>

<p>Miss Westways shrugged. She had not expected much from Theo
Manning, and had obtained far less than she had expected. Her
reasons for sending for him had been obscure, even to herself.
For some moments she gazed at his expressionless features,
puzzled. How had Paddy stood the society of this youth so long?
She could only conclude that the ways of the modern girl were
incomprehensible, even to feminine percipience.</p>

<p>"Do you know&mdash;" she commenced, feeling that at all costs
she must probe this matter further.</p>

<p>"Who's this?" The door swung open and Sergeant Leyland,
authoritative and conscious of unlimited power, stood on the
threshold. Miss Westways turned to face the intruder. She was
irritated that anyone should enter her room without knocking.
Instinct told her who the man was, but faced with so much
concentrated authority, she hesitated to speak.</p>

<p>"Who is this man?" demanded Sergeant Leyland again, in his
best official manner. He curled the left wing of his moustache to
a more acute angle.</p>

<p>"Theo&mdash;Mr. Theo Manning," introduced Miss Westways, in
almost a meek voice.</p>

<p>"What do you know?" The official voice addressed the youth
very severely. Then memory gained sway. Manning! Sergeant Leyland
remembered the scene in the house at Double Bay the previous
evening&mdash;the sudden advent of two men towards the end of his
interview with Carrington Manning. The financier had spoken of
one of the men as his son!</p>

<p>"You're Mr. Carrington Manning's son, aren't you?" the police
officer asked in slightly modified tones.</p>

<p>Theo nodded. He did not think even this time an occasion for
speech.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you." The Sergeant held out a big hand. "Saw
you&mdash;" he hesitated. He had been going to speak of the
previous evening and suddenly remembered that the subject was
forbidden.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"A few days ago."</p>

<p>Theo saw the Sergeant's predicament and guessed the
reason.</p>

<p>"We met at the house of a mutual friend."</p>

<p>"That's so." The police officer nodded. So far he had not
given the youth much attention&mdash;now he looked upon him as an
ally in a fearsome world of women. "I'd like a word with you, Mr.
Manning. Will you come to my office?"</p>

<p>Miss Lancing, who had been an enforced and silent spectator of
the little scene, gasped. His office! She would have
expostulated in no uncertain tones, but for Miss Westways'
restraining hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Let him alone," whispered the proprietress of "Florabella".
"Inspector Murmer will be here soon, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>The slowly checked words told volumes of what was expected of
the Englishman.</p>

<p>In Miss Lancing's office, now devoted to the labours of
Sergeant Leyland, the police officer closed the door and motioned
his visitor to a seat. He went round the desk and took Miss
Lancing's chair, bringing out and lighting one of his favourite
cigars.</p>

<p>"You know what's happened here?" he asked, when he had the
fumigator in full blast.</p>

<p>"I know there's been a burglary," announced Theo
cautiously.</p>

<p>"And I'm investigating it." Sergeant Leyland swelled out his
manly chest. "I'm in charge." He paused. "I saw you at your
father's house last night, didn't I?"</p>

<p>The youth nodded.</p>

<p>"You know your father and I have&mdash;er&mdash;an
arrangement?" The Sergeant lowered his voice to what he mistook
for a whisper. "You know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer." Theo grinned vacantly.</p>

<p>"That's he." Sergeant Leyland seated himself comfortably in
Miss Lancing's chair. "Inspector Murmer."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Theo.</p>

<p>"Dunno." The police officer looked mysterious. "You know he
and Miss Westways are friends."</p>

<p>"Then I'd ring up dad." The youth spoke after immense
reflection, "Yes, I'd ring up dad."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland thought the suggestion sound. Things, as he
named the investigation to himself, were not proceeding in the
manner to which he was accustomed. Miss Lancing had
proved&mdash;well, difficult, and exceedingly rude. Miss Westways
showed indications that in the near future she would be still
more&mdash;er&mdash;difficult than her manageress. Some advice
from a person he knew and could trust&mdash;of course, he would
only take it if it agreed with his own convictions and greater
knowledge of police proceedings and regulations&mdash;might be
useful.</p>

<p>"I'll do just that," he decided at the end of a moment given
to reflection, "Sit down!" The advice was unnecessary because
Theo was already seated, but it sounded official, and therefore
good.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland drew the telephone toward him, then
hesitated. Carrington Manning had told him to memorise the
telephone number, and he had intended to do so. But Mrs. Leyland
had proved an obstacle to concentration that morning, and the
latter hours had been full of happenings. The number was recorded
in his pocket-book, but to consult that authority might be taken
as a weakness by this son of a successful and wealthy man.</p>

<p>"PP5593," said Theo softly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" retorted Sergeant Leyland. "PP5593," and fingered the
dial of the Instrument.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" shouted Sergeant Leyland, surprised. He habitually
spoke into a telephone as if he had trouble in reaching to the
end of the connection.</p>

<p>"Is that 'Florabella?'" asked a voice. "I want Sergeant
Leyland."</p>

<p>"Speaking!" roared the detective. He wondered how many more
years it would take him to teach the switch-attendants at police
headquarters to address him as "Detective-Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Hold the line. Superintendent Dixon wishes to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland stared at the mouthpiece of the machine
questioningly. What was the matter now? Of late he had come to
connect messages from, and communications with, Superintendent
Dixon with trouble&mdash;often spelt with very large capital
letters.</p>

<p>A buzz sounded on the receiver he held pressed to his ear. He
called: "Hullo!" and there was no answer. Again he "Hullo-ed"
very loudly, and a voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Stop that shouting; do you think I'm deaf?" A pause, then:
"Is that Detective-Sergeant Leyland? Yes. Right. Superintendent
Dixon speaking. Inspector Pater is taking charge of the
'Florabella' case, assisted by Inspector Murmer. You will remain
and give them the assistance they require."</p>

<p>A clack sounded on the receiver, and the hum on the wire
ceased. Sergeant Leyland, still holding the receiver to his ear,
stared at the youth on the opposite side of the desk. His voice
was sepulchral when he spoke:</p>

<p>"Of all the&mdash;" explosively.</p>

<p>"What?" asked the monosyllabic youth.</p>

<p>"I'm superseded!" The police officer spoke bitterly. "Dixon's
put Pater and Murmer on the case. I'm to act under them."</p>

<p>Almost he groaned. Another chance for distinction was passing
him. But a short half-hour, a few more inquiries to swell out the
mass of notes on the papers before him, and he would arrest the
thief. Daddy Thornton, of course! Who else could it be with
Constable Duffy at one door of the establishment and
Night-watchman Watson at the other door, while the bells were
ringing. Now to have the fruits of his labours wrested from
him.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" Admiration and enthusiasm shone in Theo's eyes.
"Now you can act as dad wants you to!"</p>

<p>The youth paused, as if the effort of framing so long a
sentence had exhausted him, and added after a long pause: "The
telephone number is PP5593&mdash;don't forget!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR Saul Murmer disliked walking:
Inspector John Pater was a convinced and hardened hiker; more, he
was convinced that if his friend used nature's means of
locomotion more frequently his figure might emerge again from a
rotundity that was likely to become uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Great therefore was the Australian's surprise when, leaving
headquarters after their interview with Superintendent Dixon,
Saul Murmer turned towards Pitt-street and plodded manfully
Quaywards. For some minutes he kept pace with his partner in
silence, glancing concernedly down at the usually placid features
of the Englishman, now set in determined, firm lines.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Saul?" he asked, at length.</p>

<p>"Nothing." The word was spoken absently, then the stout
detective grinned, as the meaning of the question penetrated his
mind. "Just giving Lionel time to mess things up proper."</p>

<p>Very regrettably, John Pater would not accept this explanation
as fact. Yet, he remained silent. Long since, he had learned that
the quickest way to obtain an explanation from the Scotland Yard
man lay in silence. Saul Murmer liked to be among people who
talked, while himself listening and watching those around
him.</p>

<p>They came to Swayne Court. A few quick steps by Inspector
Murmer placed him in the lead. John Pater held back; the
Englishman would not push himself forward without due reason.</p>

<p>Outside "Florabella" a small crowd had gathered, staring
open-eyed at the tall, imposing patrolman, standing attentively
before the closed door. He looked at ease in spite of the hundred
eyes levelled at him. In Sydney, the police and other Public
servant are quite accustomed to performing their duties under the
gaze of innumerable self-appointed gangers. Rumour, false, lying
jade, mentions in certain quarters that a road gang once
threatened a strike, because nearby fire withdrew from them their
usual audience.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer pushed gently through the group of patient
onlookers, followed by Inspector Pater. He came to a stop
directly before the constable, surveying his impressive form with
well-assumed awe.</p>

<p>"He's real, John!" Saul Murmer looked over his shoulder at his
companion. "I'll swear he's real." He stepped back a pace and
surveyed the man carefully from head to feet; then looked up at
the constable's face and asked, in a tone reminiscent of a little
boy seeking information in unfavourable circumstances: "Say,
mister, what's on?"</p>

<p>The constable grinned, and shifted uncomfortably on his feet.
Saul Murmer nodded, understanding.</p>

<p>"Thought so, Taffy. Conscience pricking? Who organised this
peep-show, and why didn't they place you in the window?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland, Inspector." The man grew red under an
already ruddy skin. "He placed me on guard at the door."</p>

<p>"Did he!" The placid round face of the Englishman took on an
expression of innocent wonder. "Where's the corpse, Taffy?"</p>

<p>"There isn't a corpse, Inspector." Now the grin that had been
struggling against official repression burst bounds. "There's
been a burglary here."</p>

<p>"And I thought it was part of the annual Lord Mayor's show."
Saul Murmer turned to his companion. "There's an idea, John. Why
don't they have a Lord Mayor's show in Sydney? I'm sure it'd be
popular."</p>

<p>Very thoughtfully the detective again scanned the now
thoroughly embarrassed constable, shaking his head slowly.</p>

<p>"So Detective-sergeant Lionel Leyland placed you on show at
the front door. Sort of opposition to the lady in female dress in
the window to your right. Sorry, Taffy, but I'm relieving you of
your pleasant time. Miss Westways might want to do some business
to-day, and her lady customers might stay outside trying to flirt
with you instead of going inside and buying frocks, to hasten the
depression of their husbands' bank-accounts. How many of you are
there here?"</p>

<p>"Four, Inspector. And there's three plain-clothes men here
also."</p>

<p>"The Lord save us!" Saul Murmer lifted pious hands. "Well,
Taffy, just to oblige me, find your four comrades and march them
back to Central Lane."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland said, sir&mdash;" commenced the
constable.</p>

<p>"If only Sergeant Leyland would say his prayers!" Inspector
Murmer studied the grinning face of his brother Inspector. "You
may laugh, John, but I mean it! He wouldn't have much time for
anything else, if his prayers were in direct ratio to his sins.
There! I knew you'd tempt me to say something detrimental to
discipline&mdash;so forget it, Taffy; or if you want to tell your
pals, just remember that Mister Saul Murmer said it, not
Inspector Murmer. Now, be a good chap, and do as you're
told."</p>

<p>The constable saluted, turned on his heels, and entered the
building. Saul Murmer watched him disappear, then stepped to one
side and motioned to his companion to enter the premises.</p>

<p>"Go ahead yourself, Saul." John Pater spoke casually.</p>

<p>"I daren't, John!" Saul Murmer pushed his hat to the back of
his head and mopped his brow with his handkerchief. "I just
daren't!"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" John Pater laughed. "Afraid of Miss
Westways? Well, I guess she'll be a bit riled at having her
business premises turned into a guard-house."</p>

<p>"It isn't Miss Westways, John. You've met her, and you know
she isn't one to place blame unduly. But you haven't met Miss
Lancing yet."</p>

<p>Again the handkerchief made play. "John, that woman's a block
of ice, frigid and cold, even when she's pleased. When she's
angry&mdash;well, I'd like to crawl under the Super's desk."</p>

<p>He winked slowly and pushed open the door. In the
reception-room he again paused, surveying the little group of
assistants crowded in a corner, the general disorganisation of an
other-day immaculate business.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock, ladies." The Englishman spoke with his best
assumption of a shop-walker. "Miss Westways will be
angry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is." One of the girls spoke, then giggled. "And Miss
Lancing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" Inspector Murmer held up a guarding hand. "I quite
agree, ladies. The present influx of masculinity into this
otherwise perfect retreat for the feminine sex must&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to John Pater. "John, help a fellow out; I'm getting
mixed."</p>

<p>"Miss Westways is in her office." Another of the assistants
spoke. For a moment she stared at the Englishman, then asked:
"You're Inspector Murmer, aren't you? I think Miss Westways is
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" Inspector Murmer stopped and stood aside to
allow a file of constables to march solemnly across the room and
disappear into the court. He sighed. "At length we can breathe
again, John. No, here comes friend Detective-sergeant Lionel
Leyland!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland made what he believed to be an impressive
entry into the reception-room. Just within the door he drew
himself erect and saluted the two inspectors. That was all the
recognition he gave to Inspector Murmer. Deliberately ignoring
him thereafter, he spoke only to Inspector Pater.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were here, Inspector, or I would have come
to you sooner. I've been questioning&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer groaned softly. The baby-blue eyes he lifted to
Inspector Pater's twinkled maliciously.</p>

<p>"Two guesses as to what would have happened to me if you
hadn't been here, John," he observed in a semi-whisper. Then he
turned to Sergeant Leyland: "What's the trouble, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Trouble, sir?" Sergeant Leyland turned cold eyes on the man
he took to be an intruder. "There's been a burglary here,
sir."</p>

<p>"A burglary? Is that all?" Saul Murmer faced the sergeant
squarely. "Superintendent Dixon told me that; but when I came
here I thought he must have been wrong. With half the uniformed
division on guard it could be nothing less than a
revolution."</p>

<p>"Miss Westways has quite a number of employees," The sergeant
answered the question to Inspector Pater again ignoring the
Englishman. "I thought it wise to keep a guard in the
establishment until I had had time to question them."</p>

<p>"Big Three methods!" Inspector Murmer nodded. "What's been
taken, Sergeant?" He appeared in no ways disturbed by the man's
evident intention to ignore him as far as possible.</p>

<p>"So far Miss lancing has not discovered that anything has been
taken." Again Sergeant Leyland directed his answer to the
Australian detective.</p>

<p>"So, to prevent any of the young ladies
being&mdash;er&mdash;appropriated, you put them under arrest?"
Saul Murmer ironically approved. "Quite right, Sergeant! Do you
consider the uniformed division entirely unsusceptible?"</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland blushed. Frigidly he turned to Inspector
Pater. "You're taking charge, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are." John Pater stressed the pronoun. "I understand you
are to act with us, Sergeant," He paused, then added: "I may
inform you that our inquiry will cover not only the happenings
here, but the Salom Club affair, and the abduction of Miss Paddy
Burke."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland's eyes lighted. Here was gift from the gods,
for which he could be duly thankful. Carrington Manning had asked
him to watch the two inspectors and report to him on their
activities. What better opportunities could he have than to work
with them? Almost he felt kindly toward Inspector Murmer.</p>

<p>For a moment he wondered. Had Carrington Manning known
anything on the previous evening when he had offered the
suggestion? Had he known&mdash;No, that was not possible, for the
"Florabella" burglary had not then taken place. Still, by some
mysterious means known only to those in control of great wealth,
the financier might have pulled political strings to have the two
inspectors detailed to some assignment on which he could work
with them&mdash;and watch! He strove to cloak his features to an
impenetrable mask&mdash;and only succeeded in looking more wooden
than usual.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." He saluted still more formally. "Shall I
give you my report now?"</p>

<p>"If you please, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." Again the Sergeant saluted, feeling sorry
that he was not wearing uniform, when the salutes would be still
more formal and impressive. "If you will kindly come to my
office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your office?" Saul Murmer opened innocent eyes. "Have you an
office here, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"I am using Miss Lancing's office, sir." The Sergeant spoke
with dignity, "I could not be expected to conduct my examinations
in the public rooms."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Miss Lancing?" There was deep interest in Saul
voice.</p>

<p>"Miss Lancing has been&mdash;if I may say so, without any
disrespect to the lady&mdash;very rude." Almost pathos lay under
the sternly official tones. "She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rude, sarcastic and annoyed!" The stout detective mused.
"Why, Sergeant, the atmosphere of this establishment must be
almost&mdash;er&mdash;homelike, to you."</p>

<p>The Sergeant's big, florid face flushed; he glanced at the
placid Englishman with venomous hatred in his eyes. For a moment
he could not control his voice. He swung on his heels,
muttering:</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Will you please follow me?"</p>

<p>Stiffly erect, armoured with a dignity he believed would turn
from him, harmlessly, Inspector Murmer's little shafts of
malicious wit, Sergeant Leyland strode from the reception room,
through two show-rooms, to Miss Lancing's office. It was only as
he went to push open the door that he remembered that he had left
Theo Manning in that room. He swung open the door and allowed
Inspector Murmer to enter; then barred, for a moment, Inspector
Pater's way, speaking, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Theo Manning is in is in my office, sir," he said. "I was
questioning him when you arrived."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer caught the low remark and turned quickly. For the
moment he believed he had underrated the Sergeant's
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Theo Manning?" he asked, turning in the doorway and speaking
softly "You suspect him, Sergeant?".</p>

<p>"I was consulting with Mr. Theo Manning, sir." Sergeant
Leyland's voice held reproof. "Mr. Theo Manning is Mr. Carrington
Manning's son, and therefore above suspicion."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shrugged and turned to the room. As he entered,
the tall, gangling youth rose quickly to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Theo!" Saul Murmer spoke easily. His doubts regarding
Sergeant Leyland had disappeared. "Doing a bit of detective work,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Inspector," Theo Manning answered vacantly. He looked
more impressively vacant than Saul Murmer had ever seen him
before.</p>

<p>"Just as talkative as ever!" The Englishman's keen eyes shaded
under the veneer of innocent wonder, scanned the room. He turned
to Sergeant Leyland. "I'll say you're clever if you're getting
suggestions from Master Theo. I never knew him to utter more than
three consecutive words at one time&mdash;except once."</p>

<p>Theo Manning grinned vacantly. He picked up his hat from the
desk and moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Theo." The Englishman's voice was very soft. "Your
presence is so soothing. Stay awhile and consult with us."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;There's a lecture&mdash;" The youth started to
explain.</p>

<p>"On detecting?" asked the Inspector. "No, you told me they
didn't have them at the University. You stay with us, and we'll
give you a real demonstration of how we do it. You asked me for
that once, you know. Now, don't be boyish and shy. I'm not going
to let you off. Besides, Inspector Pater has quite a yearn for an
audience when he's at work."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland thought it was time to intervene. He disliked
seeing the son of an important and wealthy man hazed&mdash;and he
had more than a suspicion that Inspector Murmer was hazing Theo
Manning.</p>

<p>He turned to the tall Inspector: "Shall I report now,
sir?"</p>

<p>Stepping round the desk he pulled out and held Miss Lancing's
particular private chair for the Australian to seat himself, then
went round to the front of the desk.</p>

<p>"That's right, Leyland." The Sergeant missed the quick glance
the Inspectors exchanged, "You report to Inspector Pater. I'll
just have a stroll about the place." He glanced keenly at the
youth, standing awkwardly, fidgeting with his hat, in the centre
of the room.</p>

<p>"You stay here, Theo, and listen to the Sergeant. You'll learn
quite a lot from him."</p>

<p>The door swung shut behind the portly figure of the
Englishman, and Sergeant Leyland, breathing an almost audible
sigh of relief, turned again to the desk.</p>

<p>Outside the room, Inspector Murmer thrust his hands deep into
his pockets, staring about him inquisitively. Already the
presence of the two Inspectors had worked a change in the
establishment. Instead of crowding into corners, whispering and
giggling, the assistants were working to catch up the time
already wasted that morning. Saul Murmer nodded. He ambled slowly
through the room and into another show-room. Here he found things
in disorder. Many of the fashion figures were disrobed, the
dresses they had been wearing the previous evening piled in
disorder on the floor. Two or three girls, working to restore
order, glanced inquisitively at the Englishman as he entered. A
plain-clothes constable paced the floor leisurely.</p>

<p>"And yet another of you!" Inspector Murmer surveyed the man
sadly. "You're Harry Peck, aren't you? Thought so. Well, where's
the rest of the boys?"</p>

<p>"Constable Symonds is out in the warehouse, Inspector, and
Constable Burt's gone on a message for the Sergeant. That's all
Inspector. I'm told you got rid of the uniformed men."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer nodded. He turned leisurely on his heels,
surveying the welter of disorder about him.</p>

<p>"So here's where the horrid happening occurred," he sighed.
For a moment longer he scanned the room; then turned to the
plain-clothes man; "What <i>did</i> happen, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, so far as I can see, Inspector." The man grinned.
"It's evident burglars got in, but they didn't do anything except
to strip those dummies of their clothes. What for, I can't
guess."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" A simulated shudder shook the Englishman's portly
form. "Amused themselves undressing fashion figures! What's the
new generation coming to?" He paused, then inquired: "That all,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"We cant find anything missing, Inspector."</p>

<p>"And because a few of Sydney's burglars wanted a little
exercise in ladies' attire, the whole of Headquarters division
has to be brought on the scene&mdash;" His hands thrust deep into
his pockets, the Inspector wandered over to the pile of drapery.
He surveyed it lugubriously, then turned again to the
plain-clothes constable.</p>

<p>"Married man, Harry?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And Sergeant Leyland, much-married police officer, subjected
your innocence to the sight of this!" The broad shoulders lifted
in astonishment. "He must really be more careful in the future.
Still, as you are here, as for long minutes you have surveyed
this mass of&mdash;er&mdash;femininity--" He went to one of the
fashion figures. "Give me a hand here, Harry."</p>

<p>The stout Englishman lifted the fashion figure, subjecting it
to a close scrutiny. A moment, and Harry Peck, gathering what was
in his superior officer's mind, joined in the search. In a
quarter of an hour they had carefully scrutinised every fashion
figure in the room, the assistants, at the Inspector's request,
disrobing those not attended to by the burglars.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't find it." Regretfully, Saul Murmer stood back
from the fashion figure he had been examining. "Now, I
wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't find what, Inspector?" Harry Peck was interested.</p>

<p>"The fashion figure they were looking for." Saul Murmer spoke
reflectively. "No, they didn't find it, because it wasn't
here."</p>

<p>"What did they want a dress dummy for, Inspector?" Harry Peck
was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Answer your own question, and you'll have the answer to the
question buzzing in my mind for quite a time," Saul Murmer thrust
his hands again into his trousers pockets. "All we have to go on
is that burglars of some new and hitherto-unheard of breed came
here last night&mdash;and we'll guess were searching for a
special fashion figure. That's all. They started to unclothe the
figures and something happened! Now, what?"</p>

<p>The constable answered with an incredulous stare. He watched
the Inspector wander about the room.</p>

<p>"Time clocks." The Englishman strolled over to the clock on
the wall in the corner. "Humph! Key brand! Has to be attended to
every hour&mdash;and Daddy Thornton was asleep! He won't confess
to that, and I don't blame him. All night-watchmen sleep; they
have other things to do during the day-time! The burglars stalled
the clocks&mdash;no, not that! Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>For seconds Inspector Murmer stood staring at the clock; then
swung round to face the plain-clothes man.</p>

<p>"Know Joe Armeter, Harry?" he asked. "Jeweller, Darlinghurst.
Know him?"</p>

<p>The plain-clothes man nodded.</p>

<p>"Joe's an expert in time-clocks, especially those of the
key-brand." Saul Murmer spoke reflectively. "Someone told me that
he had invented a key that was a bad dose of medicine for a
time-clock. Wonder if Daddy Thornton knew him&mdash;sure to
have."</p>

<p>The keen, yet innocent eyes never left the plain-clothes man's
face. "Daddy's a watchman, and he would know Joe&mdash;" The lazy
voice droned, on. "Daddy slept, therefore he must have known
Joe&mdash;and if Daddy slept he had Joe's special brand of poison
for time-clocks. That's so far!"</p>

<p>Again the Inspector paused; then continued.</p>

<p>"Daddy knew Joe, but the burglars didn't. Queer sort of
burglars, them! Burglars use Joe's brand of keys, of course! They
stop time clocks with them. But these burglars didn't know of the
keys&mdash;and they found Daddy's in the locks&mdash;and felt
curious.</p>

<p>"That's all they took, Harry." Saul Murmer continued more
briskly. "Just the keys Joe sold to Daddy. And when they
appropriated the keys, the clocks started to function again. And
just as the burglars were satisfying their curiosity regarding
ladies' attire, the clocks burst into full song&mdash;and they
bolted. They were nervous. They couldn't stand noises." Saul
Murmer turned on his heel and faced the time-clocks, and a little
chuckle came from his lips.</p>

<p>"Now, who'd have thought that! Alarmed themselves! Well, well!
Now, I wonder how long they were here? Some part of an hour, of
course. Let me see&mdash;" He turned to survey the fashion
figures scattered about the room. "Not more than quarter of an
hour, and then&mdash;Lord! There must have been a devil of a row
when all these clocks burst into song together."</p>

<p>He looked at the bewildered expression on the plain-clothes
man's face, and chuckled. "You're slow, Harry, not to have worked
that out. The burglars came here about a quarter to four. Pinched
the time-clock keys and then started to undress the fashion
figures. The clocks exploded, and woke up Dutty and the
Association's man&mdash;and they woke up Daddy. Well, well! There
must have been a row."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer ambled across the room to where the assistants
were sorting out the crushed dresses. "I wonder, ladies&mdash;"
The lazy voice held the tone of indifference that marked the
Inspector's more intense moments. "I wonder if one of you ladies
could find the missing fashion figure for me. There should be a
record of what figures&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"There is not a figure missing from this room," one of the
girls answered. "I&mdash;shall I&mdash;" She looked at the stout
detective inquiringly.</p>

<p>"If you would be so kind!" Saul Murmer's frontal convex became
concave for a brief moment. The girl left the room. Saul Murmer,
hands again thrust deep in his pockets, watched the assistants'
work of renovating, absorbingly.</p>

<p>Some yards away from the scene of activity Constable Harry
Peck stood, watching the Inspector, a worried frown on his face.
He could not understand what clues the Englishman was following.
He started, as the door swung open, and the assistant who had
gone in search of the missing fashion figure entered the room.
She went direct to the Inspector. "Miss Lancing says there is no
fashion figure missing&mdash;and she wants to know how much
longer Sergeant Leyland is going to keep her from her own
office."</p>

<p>"And she, a woman, asks that question of a mere man!" Saul
Murmer's light eyebrows formed interrogation points. "Young lady,
I would suggest that Miss Lancing asks Sergeant Leyland that
question. At the moment the whole of my energies are concentrated
on the mystery of the Missing Fashion Figure."</p>

<p>"But there isn't one missing," insisted the girl.</p>

<p>"Then there should be one missing," replied the Inspector,
with equal emphasis.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" interjected Harry Peck, who had followed the girl
towards the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Listen, both of you!" The Inspector was staring unseeingly
into the eyes of the pretty girl before him. "Once upon a time,
there was a burglary at 'Florabella.' At that burglary&mdash;like
this burglary&mdash;the burglars took nothing. This time, they
wreaked their vengeance on ladies' attire; last time they smashed
up a packing case. Yes." The Inspector's voice became more
serious, "Here we have now a Missing Fashion Figure, once
contained in a packing case that was smashed to matchwood on a
previous visit of the burglars."</p>

<p>"Oh, that one," exclaimed the girl. "Why&mdash;" She ran
across to one of the group of girls, whispering eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Inspector!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer, turned quickly to face Miss Westways, who had
just entered the show room.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Westways&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you any news of Paddy?" Mathilde Westways face was drawn
with anxiety. "Can't you&mdash;can't you find her&mdash;find out
what has become of her?"</p>

<p>"Paddy's safe." The Englishman took both of the lady's hands
in his, squeezing them comfortingly. "Don't worry, Miss Westways;
we'll have her back soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so!" Miss Westways sighed, then quickly withdrew
her hands from the Inspectors grasp, as the door opened and an
assistant ushered in a lady and gentleman. Saul Murmer turned
quickly at the interruption. When he saw who it was, broad smiles
creased his face. He went to greet the newcomers with
outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"Well, well. Who'd have thought it!" he exclaimed genially.
"Captain Artemus Pontifex and&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Pontifex! How
well you are looking. Why, it's ages since we met&mdash;and you
were then Thelma Delevere&mdash;or shall I go back further to the
time when I knew you as Mrs. Carrington Manning?"</p>

<p>Captain Pontifex, on seeing Inspector Murmer, had half-turned,
as if thoughts of flight had come to his mind. Thelma Delevere,
quicker-witted, if with no clearer conscience than her companion,
smiled sweetly in truly Hollywood fashion, swaying alluringly
towards the detective. "Why&mdash;" A little bit of perplexity
was merged with the stereotyped smile. "Yes, it is! Artemus, come
here and meet my old friend, Sergeant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Inspector, please." Saul Murmer beamed genially on the
couple. "Inspector Murmer now. Quite an undeserved step in rank,
but I couldn't resist the Chief Commissioner's entreaties, after
that little affair in Tottenham Court road. You remember that
incident; it was when I first met you."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;" The woman hesitated; her face hardened slightly.
Inspector Murmer had referred to an incident in her past she
badly wanted to forget. She flushed heavily under her platinum
blonde make-up.</p>

<p>"Ah, you haven't forgotten, any more than I have." Saul
Murmer's smile was astonishing in its innocence; "Well, my dear,
you gave me a surprise on that occasion&mdash;perhaps I can give
you one now. A pleasant one, I know! Come along, m'dear!"</p>

<p>The detective placed his hand on the woman's arm, urging her
forward. For a moment she held back, then allowed herself to be
led forward passively.</p>

<p>"Say," Captain Pontifex's full tones rang through the room. He
advanced threateningly on the Inspector, his stick held in his
clenched fist. "What's this? A pinch?"</p>

<p>"A pinch?" The guileless innocence in the baby-blue eyes of
the Inspector almost made Captain Pontifex recall all his sins.
"Why, no, my gallant captain! I am only escorting a mother to a
reunion with her long-lost son."</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="first">SERGEANT Lionel Leyland was perplexed and
annoyed; he could not explain, even to himself, which emotion was
the greater. The information that he was to be superseded on the
inquiry by Inspectors Pater and Murmer had displeased him; yet
there appeared to be some hint of a sun shining for his benefit.
He had taken occasion to get to the telephone and ring up his
friend, Carrington Manning, but the financier had not sounded
very assured when he was informed of the position at
"Florabella." For a time, to Sergeant Leyland's fevered
imagination, the financier had appeared to dally with the
problem. Finally, he had suggested that the Sergeant ring him
later&mdash;there he became more definitely promising that he
would have certain good news.</p>

<p>Leaving the telephone, Sergeant Leyland had sought advice from
the son of his friend. For once the youth had proved informative.
He had suggested that the Sergeant keep strictly in the company
of his superior officers. To the perplexed officer, that advice
did not sound too original, but already he had learned not to
expect originality of suggestion from the young man. As he parted
from the youth, to follow the advice solicited and given, the
thought came to him that had Theo Manning been the son of a less
wealthy man, he would not have sought advice from him at all.</p>

<p>Theo Manning, left to his own devices, considered that, in his
opinion, his presence was entirely unnecessary at "Florabella."
He left Miss Lancing's office and wandered out in the showrooms,
determined to keep at least one eye open for an opportunity to
leave Swayne Court unobserved. Chance ordered that he was a
witness of the meeting between Inspector Murmer and the
Pontifexes&mdash;and he decided that retreat would be good
strategy. As plain-clothes Constable Peck was barring the logical
exit from the premises, Theo took refuge in Miss Westways'
office.</p>

<p>From what he had overheard he believed that the Inspector
would conduct his enforced guests to Miss Lancing's office; then
he would again attempt to leave the premises. The spectacle of
Inspector Murmer, with Thelma Delevere, entering Miss Westways'
office a few seconds after his retirement there, almost overcame
him. He braced himself to meet the situation he saw
developing.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought!" Saul Murmer's voice held a dangerously
gentle purr when he saw the youth in company with Miss Westways.
"I thought I would find you here, Theo. Miss Westways, you know
Miss Delevere, I believe, the famous Hollywood star, and a valued
customer of yours. Now you shall witness my grand surprise, and
see Miss Delevere in a role that will develop her abilities to
the utmost."</p>

<p>He paused impressively. "Mrs. Pontifex, permit me to present
to you Mr. Theo Manning, the son of the illustrious and wealthy
financier, Mr. Carrington Manning. You surely must have heard of
him, if you have resided in Sydney for any time. He is Sydney, in
a financial sense, I assure you."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer's voice literally dripped honey over everyone in
the room. Theo, recovering himself with an effort, bowed in his
best society manner. Miss Westways smiled, and looked curious.
She had learned that when Saul Murmer was verbose and
particularly sweet in speech something startling and original was
bound to happen.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Pontifex, my surprise." The Englishman had
assumed the airs and graces of a ringmaster of the Barnum period.
"I trust the shock will not be too great for you." He glanced
from the woman to the youth, and the unusually straight-set lips
parted in a slight smile.</p>

<p>"Allow me to present Mr. Theo Manning in a new role&mdash;in
the role of your long-lost and lamented son. Theo, behold your
mother!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer bowed and stepped back, leaving the woman and the
youth facing each other. Unfortunately, in stepping back, he
stepped on Inspector Pater's toe.</p>

<p>The muttered objurgations of the Australian tended to spoil
the dramatic climax to which the Englishman had worked. For a
moment Theo Manning glared at the woman, desperation in his eyes.
Thelma hesitated, her face showing her conflicting emotions.
Slowly she advanced a step&mdash;and broke the spell of silence
that had settled on those in the room. Theo backed away
hastily.</p>

<p>"That's a lie&mdash;" The youth turned on the detective
angrily. "My mother's dead."</p>

<p>"Only divorced, my dear fellow!" Saul Murmer's smile was
almost paternal. "Miss Thelma Delevere&mdash;Hollywood actresses
never part with their maiden names&mdash;is now Mrs. Artemus
Pontifex, and was once Mrs Carrington Manning. Before
that&mdash;but why tread back on history's footsteps. Sufficient
unto the day is the&mdash;Well, well, you know the rest of that
saying. No, Theo, you can take my word that all I have said is
the truth. You should be pleased at finding so beautiful and
gracious a mother. You still doubt? Then perhaps Mrs. Pontifex
will confirm my statements."</p>

<p>Age seemed to have crept suddenly on the woman, now standing
facing her son in the middle of the room. For a brief second her
hand moved up and outwards. Lines showed under the heavy make-up
on her face. Suddenly she covered her face with her hands, and a
shudder shook her body. Tense, she turned to face, the watching
Inspector.</p>

<p>"You beast!" Her hard eyes glared at the man, hate showing in
every line of her face and body. She stepped forward quickly and
struck him heavily in the face with her open hand.</p>

<p>"My dear Thelma&mdash;" Captain Pontifex stepped forward
quickly, catching at his wife's hands, expostulating. "You
mustn't&mdash;You really mustn't."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;" The woman struggled against the
restraint. She turned furiously on her husband. "And
you&mdash;you call yourself a man and stand there and let me be
insulted like that."</p>

<p>With a sudden wrench she freed herself, tears streaming down
her face. For a moment she glared round the little group of
curious faces watching her, then rushed to the door and flung it
open.</p>

<p>"Eh, what&mdash;" Sergeant Leyland staggered back on receiving
on his ample bosom a buxom and beautiful lady. "I beg your
pardon, madam."</p>

<p>"You needn't!" Thelma glared at the Sergeant, then thrust him
to one side. Again she made for the door, to confront Inspector
Pater, who had moved quietly, to cover her exit.</p>

<p>"Nicely played, John!" Saul Murmer, in no way disturbed by the
woman's display of temper, yet stroking carefully a smarting
cheek, nodded approval. He glanced at Sergeant Leyland, staring
goggle-eyed and bewildered.</p>

<p>"Glad you came then, Sergeant. Will you please escort Mrs. and
Captain Pontifex to the showroom, where Constable Peck is on
guard? They are to be held for the present."</p>

<p>"Then we are under arrest?" Captain Pontifex's manly bosom
swelled with righteous anger. "I demand&mdash;yes, I demand to be
informed of the charge against me at once."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Saul Murmer was again all smiles, yet his hand
tenderly caressed his smarting cheek. "I thought I said
detained&mdash;not arrested."</p>

<p>"Confound your platitudes!" The Captain twirled his military
cane vigorously. "I demand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be taken to the show room at once." The Englishman was
insistent. "If you will lead the way, Sergeant, I am sure Mrs.
and Captain Pontifex will be glad to follow you."</p>

<p>Sullenly the two adventurers followed the Sergeant from the
room. With a little nod and a quiet smile to Miss Westways,
Inspector Murmer urged John Pater to the door.</p>

<p>As they followed the trio in front, the stout detective
whispered a few brief sentences to his companion. Inspector Pater
nodded and grinned. In the showroom they found Miss Lancing
urging her assistants to greater efforts to restore the room to
normal. Hearing the party enter, she turned and glared at
them.</p>

<p>"So sorry, Miss Lancing." Saul Murmer was all apologies and
smiles. "I have every reason to believe that we shall very
shortly clear up this&mdash;er&mdash;little unpleasantness. In
the meantime, I am sure I may rely on your forbearance with
my&mdash;er&mdash;manlike abruptness and&mdash;er&mdash;want of
tact."</p>

<p>For the moment Inspector Pater feared he would be a witness to
a second feminine attack on his stout companion. Miss Lancing's
svelte figure straightened, and her eyes flashed fire. With an
effort she controlled herself, nodded and turned again to her
work. But Inspector Murmer was not yet finished with the
lady.</p>

<p>"There is, I believe&mdash;" he continued, and there was
subtle sweetness in his soft voice. "You will understand, my dear
Miss Lancing, that I have a supreme faith in a woman's
intuition&mdash;"</p>

<p>Over her shoulder Miss Lancing again glared at the Englishman;
then turned and laughed. "What is it, Inspector?" she asked. "I
quite understand you are trying to placate me, but&mdash;" The
manageress hesitated, then pointed at Sergeant Leyland, who
immediately strove to render himself as inconspicuous as
possible&mdash;"but that man has been a little too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me apologise for him&mdash;and try to explain." Saul
Murmer exuded geniality. "Sergeant Leyland is one of our best
officers, and a very fine fellow, as well as a married man. Of
course, you are aware that police training does not at present
extend to courses of etiquette in <i>modistes'</i>
establishments."</p>

<p>Again Miss Lancing laughed; for the time her well-trained
aloofness disappeared. "You are trying to inform me,
Inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To request you to use your feminine intuition, which all men
respect and admire." Inspector Murmer bowed profoundly. "You will
remember, a short while ago, a certain patented fashion figure
was sent from England to Miss Westways. I think you will remember
remarking to me on the peculiarity that a
recent&mdash;er&mdash;forcible entry of this establishment only
resulted in the destruction of the&mdash;er&mdash;packing case in
which the figure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want the fashion figure that came to us in that case."
Miss Lancing interrupted with business-like brevity. She turned
to one of the assistants. "Ethel&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl stepped forward. "Yes, Miss Lancing?"</p>

<p>"The English fashion figure&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the display window, Miss Lancing. You will
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you." Saul Murmer stared at the girl for a moment, then
laughed.</p>

<p>"What's the joke, Saul?" John Pater looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"The joke is on the burglars, John." The Englishman was
doubled with laughter, tears streaming down his face. "Just
think, John! Those burglars broke in here last night, disturbed
Miss Westways' beautifully arranged rooms, disturbed the peaceful
repose of three noted wanderers of the night, and if they'd gone
round to Swayne Court, the figure they were after was staring at
them through the shop window. What a joke! They only had to break
the window and collar the figure, and Daddy Thornton could have
finished his night's repose in comfort!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" stuttered the tall Australian.</p>

<p>"May we have the fashion figure, Miss Lancing?"</p>

<p>Stifling his merriment, Saul Murmer turned again to the
manageress. "Awfully sorry to disturb your window display, but
with that figure I believe we shall clear up all the mystery in
very-quick time."</p>

<p>"Clear up the mystery?" John Pater shrugged. "Why,
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, John." The Englishman dug his companion hard
in the ribs. John Pater made a remark, purposely inaudible, as
there were ladies present.</p>

<p>Miss Lancing had turned to two of her assistants, giving a few
brief orders. The girls lifted one of the fashion figures in the
room and went to the window. In a few minutes they returned
bearing in their arms the fashion figure that, throughout the
previous day and night had adorned "Florabella's" show
window.</p>

<p>"This is the stand you mean, I believe, Inspector?" Miss
Lancing looked at the fashion figure with curiosity and interest.
"Do you wish me to disrobe it?"</p>

<p>"If you have no objection, Miss Lancing." Inspector Murmer
hesitated; then came a glint of irony into his very innocent
eyes. "If you wish, we men will&mdash;or&mdash;turn our backs
during the process."</p>

<p>"I do not see any necessity for that," Miss Lancing's icy
demeanour returned suddenly. She did not approve of English
humour. In a few seconds the dress draping the figure was
removed, and Miss Lancing stepped book, waving her hand towards
the nude wax dummy.</p>

<p>"Is that all, Inspector?" The lady's eyes were gleaming with
curiosity.</p>

<p>"For the present, yes."</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer advanced and scanned the figure closely. He
turned and nodded to Inspector Pater, who went quickly to his
side.</p>

<p>"We've got it, John!" Saul Murmer's voice held excitement.
"See here!" His levelled finger wavered a moment, then traced on
the abdomen of the figure a circle some inches in diameter.</p>

<p>John Pater bent to look closer, then shook his head.</p>

<p>"No? Can't see it?" Deliberately Saul Murmer toppled the
figure to the ground and knelt beside it. "Well, watch!"</p>

<p>Again his forefinger traced the circle, this time the nail
bearing hard on the wax. Twice his finger traced the circle, each
time a small curl of wax preceding it. At the second circling a
line appeared on the figure. For long minutes the two Inspectors
worked to discover how the lid to the cavity in the figure was
fastened. At length the Englishman looked up.</p>

<p>"Screwed in, or something like that," he observed. "And I
don't want to smash the thing up, if possible. We'll see it we
can prise it out; I've got to have what's underneath."</p>

<p>"What is underneath?" asked John Pater, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Sure. The contents of that cavity. Not guessed yet, John?
Well, what I want is what the burglars were after. Under this
lid, we'll find the answers to those strange letters to Miss
Westways, the practical jokes that were not jokes at
all&mdash;and I believe the solution of the Salom Club murder.
Ah, thanks, constable!"</p>

<p>He reached up and took the heavy clasp knife Constable Peck
was holding out to him. For some minutes he worked with the knife
on the edge of the circle. Slowly the lid moved in a circular
motion. The Englishman increased the pressure on the knife and,
very slowly, the lid turned off.</p>

<p>John Pater, now kneeling beside his police comrade, peered
into the revealed cavity. The space was packed with oblong
white-papered parcels, secured with wax seals. Saul Murmer took
out one of the packets.</p>

<p>"Guessed yet, John?" He looked quizzically at the
Australian.</p>

<p>"Dope," hazarded John Pater.</p>

<p>"Lord, there's a lot of it, if it's dope." He tore the white
paper aside eagerly, and lifted from its fragments thick bundles
of white oblong slips of crinkly-sounding paper. With a queer
little gesture of satisfaction he waved the papers at the
Australian.</p>

<p>"Banknotes!" Inspector Pater's eyes-almost started out of his
head.</p>

<p>"Banknotes, and quite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite a lot of them." The Englishman was searching the
interior of the figure. One after another he brought out bundles,
similar to the first, bound in white paper and secured with wax
seals. Then, groping in the far interior of the figure, he drew
out smaller packets at sight of which his face became very
grave.</p>

<p>"That's dope, I believe, John," he whispered. "Lord, what's
here? Pounds of dope and reams of banknotes!" He took up the
packet of banknotes he had unwrapped, and flicked them through
his fingers. "See, John! All kinds of denominations here, and
some of them have been in circulation for quite a while. We've
made a haul, boy."</p>

<p>John Pater stared at the Bank of England notes with an
expression that was a strange mixture of awe and amazement.
Almost tearfully, he stretched out a hand and fingered the edges
of the notes.</p>

<p>"Forged, Saul?" he said. "Jove, what a haul."</p>

<p>"Forged?" Saul Murmer grinned up at his friend. "I don't think
so! If they are, I shall be very disappointed."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="first">A STRANGE, tensed atmosphere pervaded the
showroom. By the prone fashion figure knelt the Englishman,
delving into the interior of the fashion figure with inquisitive
fingers. Beside him stood Inspector Pater, gazing down in
perplexity on the pile of banknotes lying between him and Saul
Murmer. In his hand he held a packet of the banknotes, partly
revealed by the torn wrappings, and at intervals he absently ran
his fingers along an edge, producing a strangely satisfying
rustle of stiff paper. Behind the Inspector stood Sergeant
Leyland, his mouth partly open, his eyes staring fishlike at the
exposed banknotes in the Inspector's hand, and those on the
floor. Close to the head of the prone fashion figure was Miss
Lancing, her eyes passing from the English police officer to the
Australian. Further back from the little group stood Constable
Peck, and almost surrounding him were the girl-assistants,
whispering and giggling.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland slowly recovered from the amazement that had
swept over him when Inspector Murmer had opened the cache in the
fashion figure. He tugged mournfully at his moustaches, and
occasionally bit his lips in vexation. Just his luck!</p>

<p>If the Inspectors had not persuaded Superintendent to place
them in charge of the case he himself, would have uncovered this
vast haul&mdash;and he, Sergeant Leyland, would have been the
lauded and acclaimed police officer of the State. Yes. A few
minutes reflection, after the cache was opened, and he had
recovered from his initial astonishment, convinced Sergeant
Leyland that Fate had dealt him another dirty trick. He glared
venomously at the bending back of the stout Englishman.</p>

<p>For a single moment he wondered exactly what was the meaning
of the find; then shrugged. That would have to be discovered
before it could be revealed. He was not at all disconcerted by
Inspector Murmer's assumption of full knowledge, and of being
"led" to the find by some clues that were obscure to himself and
others. That was the Englishman's habitual manner. He always
looked as if he knew everything in the world&mdash;while in fact
he was only guessing! Well, others could guess as well as any
undersized, tubby, waddling duck of a Cockney!</p>

<p>The Sergeant's heart swelled with wrath! Carrington Manning
had told him to wait and watch. He had told him to report to him
anything that the Inspectors discovered. Should he report this
find of Bank of England notes? It hardly seemed worth while. Even
a rich and influential man could not take the credit of the
discovery from Inspector Murmer and allot it to a more worthy
recipient. The Sergeant shrugged; then doubt came. Perhaps he had
better report the find to the financier. Brains that could make
money in large quantities might have the ability to do other
things. Yet he was beginning to doubt. Beset by indecisions,
Sergeant Leyland glanced round the circle of faces, all absorbed
in the actions of the stout Englishman. His eyes rested for a
moment on Miss Lancing's face&mdash;and a thought came to his
mind. Miss Lancing's office would be vacant&mdash;and there was a
telephone in it.</p>

<p>Again he looked round the circle; they were all intent on the
two Inspectors and the pile of Bank of England notes on the thick
pile of the showroom carpet. No one would notice him if he
slipped from the room for a few minutes. His eyes wandered to
where Theo Manning stood, an absorbed, but perplexed, witness of
the discovery of the banknotes. The youth looked up, caught
Sergeant Leyland's eyes, and nodded.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland boasted that he was always able to take a
hint. In fact, the taking of hints was one of his chief failings.
He originated little, preferring to wait for some indication of
action from others, and then try and assume their knowledge. Now
he assumed Theo Manning's hint, indicated in that brief nod.</p>

<p>He backed furtively from the little circle towards the door,
although there was no possible reason why he should not turn and
walk out of the room boldly. Once outside the door, he literally
ran to the manageress's office. He dialled the Double Bay number,
and waited feverishly watching the door of the room, one ear
stretched for the sounds of footsteps coming in his direction. He
cursed under his breath at the small delay in getting the
connection and, when the bright, crisp voice of the financier
came on the wire almost sighed his relief.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Carrington Manning? Detective-Sergeant Lionel Leyland
speaking, Mr. Carrington Manning."</p>

<p>In spite of his haste and worry he could not refrain from
repeating his full name and title. "There's been a development
here, sir. Inspectors Pater and Murmer have made a find."</p>

<p>"A find? Well, what is it, man? Hurry up! I know you're at
'Florabella,' so there's no need to go into any rigmarole. What's
happened? Can't you speak? What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer has discovered a quantity of Bank of England
notes hidden in one of the dress dummies, sir. There's thousands
of 'em&mdash;he's still pulling 'em out!'</p>

<p>"Well?" The question came after a long pause.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?"</p>

<p>There was almost pathos in the Sergeant's tones. He glanced
anxiously at the door. If anyone came while he was talking to the
financier there would be questions asked and&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, sir, this is a big score for the Englishman."</p>

<p>"Where's the money?" asked Carrington Manning, and Sergeant
Leyland thought there was anxiety in the crisp voice.</p>

<p>"Piled on the floor of the showroom, with Inspector Pater
standing guard over it. And there's other things, too. Inspector
Pater said something about dope. Say, what can I do? They'll get
a lot of credit for this! What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Who's there?" The voice at the other end of the telephone
wire sounded more assured.</p>

<p>"All of them&mdash;the staff and everyone else, including
Constable Peck. Oh, Miss Westways is not there. I think she's in
her office."</p>

<p>Again the Sergeant glanced anxiously towards the door. He had
forgotten Miss Westways up to that moment. If she wanted Miss
Lancing and came to that room&mdash;to find him talking to
someone on the Inspector's business. She would certainly tell
Inspector Murmer, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bad!" The one word was followed by a long silence. Sergeant
Leyland waited, the receiver held rigidly to his ear. Twice he
"hullo-ed" into the receiver, to receive no reply. He was tempted
to replace the receiver on the hook, believing that the financier
had abandoned him in his troubles; yet held on, in desperate
hope. Almost as his fears and impatience had crystallised to a
climax of abandon, Carrington Manning's voice came through the
instrument.</p>

<p>"We've got to have time, Sergeant. We've got to find some
means to gain time," The financier's voice held its old arrogance
and assurance. "Yes, time!" The man was silent for a few moments.
Then: "Listen, Sergeant, and listen carefully. You must make no
mistake or alterations in the course of action I am about to
outline to you. Now, listen! You know there is another matter
which is causing Inspector Murmer some anxiety."</p>

<p>"That girl!" replied the Sergeant brightly. He prided himself
on his accurate guess.</p>

<p>"That's it! Now, listen!" For long minutes Carrington Manning
spoke in certain plain sentences. Occasionally Sergeant Leyland
nodded. When the financier concluded his instructions the police
officer was beaming with delight.</p>

<p>"I've got you, sir. The girl's in a house in Surry Hills. Yes,
I've got the address correct. She's held there a prisoner. Good!
I'll tell Inspector Murmer at once&mdash;tell him I got it from
one of my stool-pigeons. Sure! He'll leave everything here and
go after that girl. I know that. Why, he thinks she's the one and
only, anyone can see that! Yes, sir, I understand. While he's
rescuing the girl, you'll act. That'll put a spoke in his
wheel."</p>

<p>Triumph gleamed in the Sergeant's eyes. "Sure, sir! You'll let
me hear from you later."</p>

<p>"Of course." Carrington Manning's voice oozed assurance and
confidence. "Get to it, Sergeant. When you've got the girl ring
me again, and&mdash;" There came a quick pause; then crisper:
"Tell Theo he must get in touch with me at once."</p>

<p>Over the line came a slight click, token that the financier
had replaced the receiver on its stand. Sergeant Leyland turned
from his telephone, a smile of gloating triumph on his full lips.
He didn't understand the reason for what he had been instructed
to do&mdash;but he knew he was quite competent and alert to take
a hint. Later, perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Strange about that girl, Paddy Burke. How had Carrington
Manning got to know that she was missing? Stranger still that he
should have been able to trace her where the Police Department
had failed. Sergeant Leyland shook his big head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Of course, the man was a financier&mdash;one of the money
kings of the world&mdash;and money could do anything! Men like
him had avenues of information open that were closed to others,
even to Police Departments.</p>

<p>The girl! Yes, Inspector Murmer would be pleased to know that
she had been located. Yet, what tale had he to tell the Inspector
to explain how he had come by the Information in a logical
manner&mdash;in a way that would not cause curiosity as to the
source of his information? In spite of his boast of
stool-pigeons, that was the problem. He could not give Carrington
Manning as his informant. The financier would be angry, and
Inspector Murmer would certainly question him. He would say that
he had received his information from one of the stool pigeons he
had established in the underworld. Everyone at the Police
Department had lately wondered at the reliability of the
information he received; information that Myson had given
him.</p>

<p>Yes, that would do! Now he had to state how he had got in
touch with his stool, pigeon. If he could get down to Police
Headquarters he could telephone Inspector Murmer from there. But
in the case the Inspector would act by himself&mdash;and Sergeant
Leyland had every possible objection to being left out of any
prominent picture. He could&mdash;Sergeant Leyland stood in the
centre of Miss Lancing's office, his brows creased in deep
thought. He could&mdash;Yes, that was it! He could say that he
had left the showroom for a moment and had heard the telephone
ringing in Miss Lancing's office. He could say that he had
answered the telephone and one of his informants had spoken to
him&mdash;for he had given his stool pigeons that address for the
morning, if they had any news to communicate to him.</p>

<p>Bright idea! He could do just that! The Sergeant hurried out
of the room, through the intervening showrooms, to where the
group still clustered about the prone fashion figure. He smiled
when he saw everyone engrossed with the problem of the banknotes.
Well, he would give at least one of them something else to think
about: Pushing roughly through the little crowd, he bent and
caught Inspector Murmer by the arm.</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer, if you please, a moment!" Sergeant Leyland
simulated a man who conveyed important news. "I must have a word
with you, at once."</p>

<p>He dragged the stout Inspector to his feet, through the little
crowd, to a quite corner of the room. He spoke in a low
whisper.</p>

<p>"About that girl, Inspector, The one that was abducted last
night."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Saul Murmer turned doubting eyes on the burly Sergeant.
"The girl who was abducted last night? You mean Miss Paddy Burke,
Sergeant. Now, how did you learn of that case? I understand you
came here early this morning: soon after you arrived at
headquarters."</p>

<p>"The news was through then, Inspector." For once the Sergeant
departed from fiction to truth. "I heard it directly I arrived at
the offices. Thought I'd make a few inquiries on my own, and
telephoned some friends&mdash;you know the sort of friends I
mean? You've used them yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Saul Murmer spoke drowsily. Under his half-closed lids
his eyes were wary and alert.</p>

<p>"Well, sir." Sergeant Leyland drew himself up, swelling out
his manly chest. "One of 'em's just telephoned through to me.
Says the girl is being held by white slavers in a house in Surry
Hills. I've got the address, sir."</p>

<p>"That's interesting." The detective's voice was indifferent.
"And you think your friend was telling the truth?"</p>

<p>"He'd better!" Again the burly chest assumed prominence. "I've
got it on him, sir, and if he sends me off on any wild-goose
chase, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Not a line of Saul Murmer's face or body showed the tensed
emotions which held him. He stood before the large sergeant to
all outward aspects utterly indifferent to the news he had
received. He distrusted the man&mdash;and his news. He did not
believe him&mdash;yet he could not&mdash;dared not&mdash;neglect
this clue to Paddy's whereabouts. If the girl was in the hands
of white slavers&mdash;</p>

<p>What option in the matter had he? Whether the news was true or
false, he had to accept it at face value. He had to go to Surry
Hills, to this house; but Sergeant Leyland would accompany him.
He could not get away from the first thoughts that had come to
him when Sergeant Leyland had come to him with his news; that the
man wanted to get him away from 'Florabella' and the loot that
had been discovered.</p>

<p>Why, he could not guess; but the thought remained.</p>

<p>"And what does Detective-Sergeant Lionel Leyland suggest?"</p>

<p>The innocent blue eyes opened disconcertingly wide: the lazy
voice held a slight sarcastic drawl.</p>

<p>"Why, sir&mdash;" The police officer looked down on the rotund
Englishman with amazement. "I thought, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You thought!" Saul Murmer's smile was disarming. "Awfully
good of you to think, Sergeant. Well, now what did you
think?"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd decide to raid the place, sir." The Sergeant
lost some of his assurance. He hesitated. "Of course, my&mdash;my
informant can't guarantee that the girl's there now, but he's
certain she was there last night."</p>

<p>"But may have moved during the early hours of this morning?"
The Englishman nodded; he stiffened slightly. "Yes, we'll raid
this place, you and I, and it we find the girl there, Sergeant,
I'll not forget you."</p>

<p>He swung on his heels and went to the group surrounding
Inspector Pater and the fashion figure. At the edge of the group
he turned again to Sergeant Leyland: "Telephone headquarters for
men to surround that house, Sergeant. Ask Superintendent Dixon to
send a man to meet us at the house with a search warrant, and say
that you and are going direct there from here. Say we'll be there
in a quarter of an hour, and to have everything ready for a quick
raid. You'll have to speak in my name, Sergeant, of course."</p>

<p>The Englishman pushed through the little group to the side of
Inspector Pater. A few words brought the gist of Sergeant
Leyland's information.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Saul?" asked the tall
Australian.</p>

<p>"Phony, maybe&mdash;but we mustn't forget that Leyland seems
to have acquired mysterious sources of information of late. We
can't risk it, John&mdash;though I suspect he's just trying to
draw us from our kill."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer pondered an instant. "Yes, he did look pleased
when I said I'd go and leave you alone here. Now, why? I'd have
thought he would want you and I to go and to leave him in charge
here."</p>

<p>"So?" John Pater pursed his lips in a soundless whistle. "Yes,
you and he had better go, Saul. What about the mess here?"</p>

<p>"You're here, John." Saul Murmer grinned. "You know how to
handle things in Australia better than I do. Go on with it;
you've done well, so far."</p>

<p>John Pater shrugged. What had to be "gone on with" at
"Florabella?" They had found what the burglars had sought,
although they had not discovered one clue to the identity of the
burglars. They had certainly discovered something&mdash;but what
that "something" was he could not at present decide.</p>

<p>Standing guard over the piles of banknotes, John Pater watched
Saul Murmer whisper instructions to Sergeant Leyland. He noticed
the pleased expression that came on the police officer's stolid
face. He grinned as he watched the duped man nod eagerly and
hurry from the room; he laughed openly when he saw Inspector
Murmer lever himself laboriously into his overcoat and look round
for his hat. "Shan't be long, John." Inspector Murmer waved
farewell over the heads of the whispering girls.</p>

<p>"I'm taking Sergeant Leyland with me. Constable Peck will help
you guard your new-found wealth. S'long!"</p>

<p>In the general offices Saul Murmer found the Sergeant busy at
the telephone. He waited until the man had finished, then
beckoned him to follow into Swayne Court. There the stout
Englishman waited for the Sergeant to catch up to him, and
slipped his hand into the crook of the suddenly gratified man's
elbow.</p>

<p>"You're good at getting information, Lionel," Saul Murmer
flattered. "Especially of late. How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"I've got me lines out, sir." The Sergeant was beaming at
these signs of his superior officer's favour. "A man has to have
'em to succeed in 'our work."</p>

<p>"Naturally," The Englishman urged his companion in the
direction of Pitt Street. "You've got your lines, as you say, and
you don't seem inclined to explain them." The baby-stare became
more innocent, if possible. "Well, I don't blame you. The
successful detective has his own methods and they differ, more or
less, from the routine lines laid down by the Department. If we
didn't develop our own special abilities we'd all work on routine
lines and there'd be steals everywhere. There's a taxi! Give the
man the address and hop in!"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer scrambled into the vehicle and waited until he was
joined by the Sergeant. "Now, when you get to England,
Lionel&mdash;" Very genially, the stout Inspector rambled on
while Lionel Leyland listened, his breast swelling with pride and
ambition. Gradually his opinion, of the Englishman underwent a
startling reversal. The man was not so bad after all! Not clever,
of course, or even cunning, but with a certain routine aptitude,
that had, no doubt, served him&mdash;with some luck. One thing,
he could recognise ability when he saw it, and be was not at all
adverse to acknowledging a mistake. Now&mdash;</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland lay back on the semi-soft cushions and
pondered, if there were no guile in the man beside him, then he
had won Inspector Murmer as a friend and backer. And, with
Inspector Murmer freely acknowledging his former errors, there
was a possibility that he would Influence the
Superintendent&mdash;sweep away all Dixon's former prejudices.
Then, what lay before him&mdash;Sergeant Leyland? He almost
shouted his triumph aloud. An Inspectorship, of course. Inspector
Murmer would see to that. A journey, to England. Well, why not?
And then&mdash;at New Scotland Yard, London, with Inspector
Murmer his very good friend and backer. Maybe Chief Inspector
Murmer, for rumour in the New South Wales Police Department
freely told that when the Inspector's term of Australian duty
expired he would receive the coveted step in rank. Then, with
Chief Inspector Saul Murmer, one of the Big Three&mdash;</p>

<p>The gentle voice of the stout police officer droned on,
filling the taxi with a hypnotic dream of conquest and success.
Inspector Leyland! Asked by the Chief Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police, London, to resign from his present service
and accept high rank and at the centre of the
Empire&mdash;impressing the English authorities with his gifts of
deduction, his accuracy, his swift and certain swoops on the
myrmidon gangs of malefactors infesting the queen city of the
British Empire.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland snapped out of his day-dream as the taxi came
to a stop before a mean-looking house in a by-street of Surry
Hills. He thrust open the door and stepped out, turning to give a
helping hand to the stout man struggling through the narrow
door.</p>

<p>"That's right, Lionel." Inspector Murmer gratefully accepted
the preferred help. "Fat's troublesome if you don't know that
now, you may some day. Ah! At one time I set my heart on a
Superintendency&mdash;sometimes the gold leaves decorating the
Commissioner's cap danced before my eyes in my dreams. But they
don't make fat men Commissioners of Police. They wouldn't look
well, when dressed up for functions, and that sort of thing.
You've got to have military looking men for the show work, y'
know. So I'm only an Inspector&mdash;a lucky one&mdash;good at
guessing, as no doubt you've discovered, eh? Now, don't blush,
man. I know, my luck, and I'm not ashamed of it."</p>

<p>The Englishman ceased speaking as a uniformed sergeant
strolled up the street to meet them. "Ah, here's Sergeant
Walton!" he continued, in the same rambling manner. "Got the
place sewed up, Sergeant? Good! Then Sergeant Leyland and I will
go inside. Keep 'em in, Sergeant. I'll whistle if I want
help&mdash;but with Leyland with me, that's not possible."</p>

<p>It was only the stern sense of discipline suppressing natural
inclinations that prevented Sergeant Leyland from leading the way
to the front door of the house; he held back, humbly following in
the short, ambling steps of his superior officer, yet his heart
swelled. Behind that door lay his last step to success and
recognition. The discovery of the girl in the house would be his
vindication. Pah! He was already vindicated in the opinion of the
fat fool walking before him. Well, well! He would know how to use
him further. Yes, he would use him, but he would not forget! The
memories of those months of sarcastic pin-pricks and innuendos
still rankled. Yes, he would use this man. Then when he got the
step in rank he deserved and expected&mdash;when he was Inspector
Leyland&mdash;when he was at New Scotland Yard! There he would
gain higher honours&mdash;to him, the perfect detective in form
and ability, there were no ambitions beyond reach&mdash;then
Inspector Murmer should know what it was to work under a keen,
efficient and highly-trained superior.</p>

<p>A woman answered the door of the house in answer to Inspector
Murmer's gentle knock. For a moment she stared, open-eyed, at the
rotund Englishman on the steps, then backed quickly and strove to
shut the door.</p>

<p>Inspector Murmer's boot blocked the action, and he laughed
gently.</p>

<p>"Come along, Lionel!" Eighteen stone of solid flesh and bone
leaned heavily against the door, bearing back on the woman. "Come
along in, Lionel. I want to introduce you to an old friend, Miss
Nellie Trask!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's little Nellie." Saul Murmer stood in the narrow
passage, within the door, his broad face beaming glad recognition
on the scowling woman. "Quite an old friend, Lionel. Now, who'd
have thought of seeing you here, Nellie? Last time we
met&mdash;No, you wouldn't like me to mention that last time,
would you, Nellie? Bygones should be bygones, shouldn't they,
Nellie?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" The woman, thin, narrow-chested, round
shouldered and anaemic, her platinum blonde hair in startling
contrast to her skin on which dark make-up showed heavily,
huddled against the wall, her sullen eyes defiant. "Say, you've
got nothing on me."</p>

<p>"Never had, Nellie." Saul Murmer's smile was bland and genial.
"I didn't put you in Bentonville, so why blame me. I only came to
see you out of pure friendship&mdash;and because I thought you
had some little information I lacked&mdash;and you had; you gave
it to me, quite friendly and all that. So we're friends, aren't
we? Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Inspector edged slowly down the hall.</p>

<p>"You can't come in here!" The woman suddenly shouted at the
top of her voice. "I say, you dicks can't come in here."</p>

<p>"But we are in, dearie." Saul Murmer chuckled. "You wouldn't
turn us out in the cold, dirty streets again, would you? That's
not the way you treated me when I called on you while you were
living in one of King George's palaces&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you&mdash;" The woman's shrill tones rang through, the
empty passages of the house. "You can't come in! You've got to
have a warrant to come in here."</p>

<p>The Inspector stared blankly. "Now, Lionel, what does a nice,
pure, innocent, lady-like little girl like Nellie Trask know of
warrants? Tut, tut, dearie; we don't talk of such things between
friends&mdash;do we, Nellie dear?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not!" The woman almost snarled. "You've gotta get
out. There's me lodgers in here, and you'll disturb them and I
wouldn't&mdash;" She backed down the passage before the advancing
detectives. "Thank 'eaven they're here! I wouldn't be alone with
a nasty oily snake like you for all the gold in China!"</p>

<p>"Tea, Nellie, tea!" Saul Murmer continued to edge forward, his
eyes on a closed door behind the woman. "Only Governments have
gold, nowadays. We common people have to feel we're well treated
if we get a cup of tea, now and again."</p>

<p>"Where's yer warrant?" reiterated the woman. She had come to a
stop before the closed door and showed no signs of further
retreat.</p>

<p>"Have a look at him, Nellie." Inspector Murmer nodded back at
Sergeant Leyland, now close behind him. "Won't he do for nice
warrant, Nellie? He should! Fine man, Nellie; handsome and
clever&mdash;but he's married. Sad, Nellie; isn't it?"</p>

<p>For the moment the girl was off her guard. Saul Murmer turned
softly, not to the door the woman was guarding, but to the one
opposite her, flinging it open and striding into the room. As he
entered two men, seated at a round table in the centre of the
room, sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>"Tony Matelli and Samuel Smithy&mdash;Senor Smith it was last
time, wasn't it, Sam? Oh, come, in, Lionel. Here are some more
old friends! Strange, I can find English friends wherever I go in
Australia."</p>

<p>"Where's your warrant?" Nellie Trask thrust her way into the
room, confronting the Inspector. "You look out, Murmer, I'll
report you for forcibly entering my house without a warrant."</p>

<p>"Then you won't take Sergeant Leyland, Nellie?" Saul Murmer
shook his head dejectedly. "Then I suppose he'll have to take
you&mdash;and your two friends here&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've got nothing&mdash;" commenced Tony Matelli, backing to
a corner of the room, his right hand fumbling at the top button
of his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Stick 'em up!" Two swift steps, and Saul Murmer was before
the man; a sudden movement threw the man's hands above his head.
The Inspector's hand fumbled for a moment under the man's left
armpit. "Ah, a gun, Tony. Naughty, naughty! You saw him, Lionel?
Thought so. And I don't believe Tony has a licence." The
detective's smooth tones suddenly hardened. "Watch
Smithy&mdash;he usually prefers a knife. Ah, good man! Another
concealed weapon! And Nellie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't hold me!" Mad with anger, the girl swung round on
the Sergeant, struggling with the second crook. "I say you can't,
you&mdash;" She swung round, round-armed at the Sergeant,
striking him across the face.</p>

<p>"Gently, Lionel!" The Englishman's cool tones stayed Leyland's
sudden anger. "Yes, we can hold you, Nellie. Assaulting and
hindering a police officer in the execution of his duty. Will
that do, Nellie? Or would you like something a little more
modern?"</p>

<p>The men lined quietly against the wall, while Sergeant Leyland
searched them. From Tony he took another gun; Smithy was armed
with two dangerous-looking knives. At sight of this armament Saul
Murmer nodded his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Any more friends here, Nellie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Find out,"</p>

<p>"I'm going to." Saul Murmer smiled gently. "Just what I intend
to do, Nellie&mdash;and I shan't ask you to accompany me" He
turned to the Sergeant: "Can you handle them, Lionel? I don't
want to bring in Sergeant Walton just yet. You've got their guns
and knives."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland grinned largely. He looked expertly at the
three crooks lined against the wall, the woman between the two
men, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Inspector. They're safe. But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll be all right; but good of you to think of me, Lionel.
Won't be long." Saul Murmer closed the door of the room where
Sergeant Leyland stood ward over his prisoners, and looked about
the narrow, dirty passage. He shook his head as his eyes wandered
over the various doors in the passage, then made his way to the
stairs.</p>

<p>Panting wheezily, he ignored the rooms on the first floor and
mounted to the floor under the roof. He glanced into two rooms
before he found the door of the third room was looked. Nodding as
it satisfied, he bent and carefully examined the lock; then went
to one of the other doors and extracted the key. As he had
expected, the key turned easily in the lock.</p>

<p>"Builders' locks!" Saul Murmer chuckled. "One key fits half a
million&mdash;and they call them locks!"</p>

<p>Catching hold of the door-knob, warily, he thrust the door
opened a bare inch and listened. There was no sound within the
room, and the Inspector thrust the door right back and entered.
There was no carpet on the floor. Opposite the door was a
ramshackle iron cot and almost at the foot of it, under the
sloping window, a packing-case covered with a piece of chintz,
camouflaged as a dressing table. The walls were dirty and bare,
and the ceiling full of holes, through which the slates of
the roof showed dimly. The cot was covered with a nondescript
collection of rags that had once been bedclothes, and discarded
wearing apparel. On this mass of junk lay the form of a young
girl.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer smiled as he stood for a moment and watched;
then ambled over to the bed and looked down on the girl.</p>

<p>"Getting adventurous, Paddy, aren't you?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"You?" Paddy Burke opened wide eyes. "Why, Uncle
Saul&mdash;I&mdash;I knew you'd come." She gasped a moment; then
turned her face to the wall, crying silently.</p>

<p>"There, there, old dear."</p>

<p>The bedstead creaked as Saul Murmer's weight tested its
strength. He patted her shoulder comfortingly. "There, there,
Paddy! They haven't hurt you, have they?"</p>

<p>"Only threatened to." Paddy smiled through her tears. "I bit
one of the men, you know."</p>

<p>"I know." Saul Murmer smiled. "When we got into the house and
I saw Tony Matelli's left hand bound up in a particularly
doubtful and entirely unhygienic handkerchief, I guessed you were
here."</p>

<p>Paddy laughed, rather hysterically. "I bit him," she repeated,
and choked on the words. "And Uncle Saul, do you know, I think
Theo was one of the men who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get up and put yourself straight, Paddy." Inspector Murmer
spoke surely, manlike afraid of an attack of hysteria. "We're
going walks."</p>

<p>As the girl rolled over on the bed he noticed for the first
time that a thin, strong, steel chain bound her to the bedstead.
For a moment his eyes blazed angrily. "Where's the key to this?"
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"On the wall, Uncle Saul." Paddy spoke meekly; she did not
feel at her best, chained to the dirty bed. "The woman hung it
there when&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer had already located the key. In a few seconds he
had the padlock unfastened and threw the chain aside; then he
almost lifted the girl to her feet. For a moment she swayed
dizzily. The Inspector caught her round the waist and
half-carried her to a chair before the cracked mirror on the
makeshift dressing table.</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Saul&mdash;" protested the girl.</p>

<p>"To a man of my years!" Saul Murmer patted the girl's
shoulder, affectionately. "Even an old bachelor like myself knows
that no women ever left a bed without making a beeline for the
mirror&mdash;especially after being rescued from an abduction. My
child, you wouldn't be seen on the streets&mdash;or by Sergeant
Leyland, one of the handsomest ornaments of our
Department&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

<p>Paddy laughed, shaking from her dress the many, creases it had
gathered during the hours of her adventure. She shook a reproving
finger at the Inspector.</p>

<p>"You know too much, Uncle Saul."</p>

<p>"Pooh, m'dear! A man, who doesn't know that a mirror is the
first requisite in a woman's life isn't fit to get married!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Saul!" Paddy swung quickly round on her chair, her
fingers pressing bedraggled waves into some semblance of form.
"Is it a proposal?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer was seated on the bed. He looked up from the note
he was writing on a sheet of paper torn from his notebook.</p>

<p>"Paddy, there's a lady downstairs entertaining Sergeant
Leyland with a careful and vivid description of his personal
charms. If you don't hurry up, so that we get downstairs and save
him, she may propose&mdash;and he's a very much married man!"</p>

<p>"Will he mind, dear?" Paddy's eyes were very innocent; yet she
gave more attention to her renovations. Inspector Murmer finished
his note as Paddy turned from the mirror and announced that she
was again ready for public inspection.</p>

<p>Downstairs in the sitting room they found Sergeant Leyland and
his three prisoners. The Sergeant beamed pridefully when the girl
entered the room.</p>

<p>"Good work, Lionel." Saul Murmer nodded approval to the proud
Sergeant. "I found Miss Burke chained to a bed in one of the
upstairs rooms; Now, if you will be so good as to call Sergeant
Walton and his merry men we'll get these friends of crime to
headquarters."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland saluted impressively and left the room.
Immediately Saul Murmer drew the girl to one side and pressed
into her palm a tightly-folded wad of paper.</p>

<p>"Paddy, when you get to 'Florabella,' give this note to
Inspector Pater. Not a word of it to anyone, and don't let
Sergeant Leyland know you have it."</p>

<p>The girl nodded understandingly. She was about to speak, but
at that moment the two Sergeants and a couple of constables
entered the room. Saul Murmer held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>"Met again, Walton." The Inspector nodded as the uniformed
Sergeant entered. "Well, here's a net full for you. Take them
down to Central, Sergeant, and just hold them for questioning;
I'll see what charges we can make when I get there. That's for
you, Walton; for you, Lionel&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stout Inspector paused, reflectively stroking a very
smooth chin. He glanced at Paddy, speculatively, before
continuing. "For you, Lionel&mdash;I think the car we came here
in is waiting down the road. It will serve nicely; and as you
were Miss Burke's real rescuer, I suggest that it is only fitting
you should deliver her to the waiting arms of her aunt, Miss
Westways." A self-satisfied purr came in the smooth voice; "What
can be more appropriate? The rescued damsel and her rescuer!
Quite a paragraph for the newsboys, if they haven't already smelt
out the story&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly his voice changed. "Now, Paddy, run along and relieve
your aunt's anxiety. She's been terribly worried over your
disappearance."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Uncle Saul?" asked the girl. "Won't
you come with us?"</p>

<p>"I'll be along soon, m'dear." Saul Murmer's hand pressed on
the girl's hand holding the folded note, meaningly. "It happens,
I have a speck of work that has to be done at once&mdash;and you
know, I just hate work!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="first">THE spectacle of Tony Martelli, "Senor" Smithy,
and Miss Nellie Trask in discreet procession and under proper
escort, walking from the door of No. 51 Likers Street to their
waiting taxis, held almost a veneer of aristocratic seclusion
that might have provoked the ire of a Communist. To the Surry
Hill crowds it gave only interest that might have been expressed
in subdued cheers but for the innate modesty of the witnesses in
the presence of their police protectors. They watched, whispering
eagerly among themselves, telling of gory deeds that might have
been, of fabulous sentences that might be imposed. They lingered
long after the principals in their little mystery drama had
driven from sight in almost regal state; they lingered in the
hope that "something" still might happen&mdash;then speculated
whether Miss Paddy Burke was not a noted baby-farmer, or the
adventuress of one of Mr. Phillip Oppenheim's novels&mdash;for
she was certainly guarded by the most important, impressive and
overwhelming of specimens from Central Lane in the cast. And
still they lingered.</p>

<p>Instinct dictated that when Inspector Saul Murmer ambled
gently out of the door of "Fifty-one," hopes grew high, for did
not always the best come last. They had learned that wisdom from
forefathers who, in some mysterious place and past known as
"Home", had watched and thrilled to true drama in strange houses
known as "The Elephant and Castle" and the "Shoreditch."</p>

<p>They viewed the rotund figure, the smiling, innocent-looking
face, the baby-blue-eyed stare, and the well-curved red lips,
with shivers of apprehension. They knew they were viewing the
villain, for ever they had been taught to seek for crime under
the guise of excessive innocence and benevolence.</p>

<p>Saul Murmer was accustomed to being stared at. He hesitated as
he faced the batteries of eyes, like serried ranks of tommy-guns,
directed at him directly he opened the door of "Fifty-one." His
hesitation was only momentary, then he walked down the few steps
to the pavement, the gaping crowd withdrawing from his slow
advance in stolid awe and inquisitiveness, not willing to forgo
by any hasty movement the slightest of the sensations they had
come to believe were justly theirs by reason of the previous
police and prisoners' processions.</p>

<p>They stared as Inspector Murmer glanced up and down the
street, reading in his questing glances meaning that would have
stirred a hot-gospeller's hell. They backed discreetly before
him, eager to miss nothing, yet not willing to cramp their
elected villain in the just portrayal of his part in their drama.
Saul Murmer turned in the direction of Oxford street, his
attendant audience following awesomely.</p>

<p>Once he turned suddenly and looked over the crowd's head, and
the little gasp of apprehension was almost audible. They gaped,
open-mouthed, closing up their ranks tightly, when a taxi drew up
against the kerb and the Inspector entered it. They watched the
car drive citywards, escaping out of the boundaries of the
district they considered their own, then returned to the narrow,
mean streets they had come to look upon as their logical
abiding-places, whispering, shuddering, their imaginations
supplying, as it had always had to do through their colourless
lives, the nerve-essences their God-made bodies craved, and which
man-made environment denied.</p>

<p>In the taxi, driven swiftly and smoothly citywards, Saul
Murmer sat in meditation. His problems were becoming clearer;
already he saw the end of the trail in sight. Yet there were many
details to fill in. Almost he thrilled as he visioned what would
be when his curtain was drawn aside and his drama
revealed&mdash;a drama that linked across many thousands of miles
of land and seas. He came out of his reverie with a start when
the taxi turned sharply into the very narrow Central Lane.</p>

<p>Paying off the driver, he went direct to Superintendent
Dixon's offices. His arched brows lifted inquiringly as he caught
the eyes of the clerk.</p>

<p>"Yes, Inspector." The man behind the desk answered the
unspoken question on the detective's face. "It's come. I'm
decoding it now."</p>

<p>"Ah!" A slight sigh escaping Saul Murmer's lips alone betrayed
how greatly he had relied on the answers to questions he had
cabled to London. "Any of it ready, constable?"</p>

<p>"The Superintendent has some, sir." Constable Bert Wimble
smiled slightly at the Inspector's evident eagerness. "He asked
me to bring the flimsies to him as I decoded them."</p>

<p>The Englishman turned quickly toward the door of the inner
room, then hesitated; "Anyone with the Super?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." The man hesitated. "I know he expects you
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He should." A whimsical smile came on the cupid-bow lips. "He
just should!"</p>

<p>Knocking quietly on the panel, Saul Murmer gently opened the
door and entered the room. He had the door closed behind him
before the burly man at the big desk in the centre of the room
looked up, and nodded.</p>

<p>"Thought you'd be along soon, Saul."</p>

<p>A motion of the grey head indicated a chair on the opposite
side of the desk.</p>

<p>"Sit down! Got what you were after?"</p>

<p>"Part of it, sir." The Englishman sank wearily into the
comfortable chair and reached into a side pocket for the
inevitable packet of cheap cigarettes. "You've got the other
part, I hear."</p>

<p>"This?" Superintendent Dixon placed a heavy hand on the pile
of flimsies he had been studying when Saul Murmer entered the
room. "Yes, there's quite a lot of it."</p>

<p>"And I found quite a lot, sir." The detective exhaled an
almost perfect circle of blue smoke. "Anything good?"</p>

<p>"Look for yourself."</p>

<p>Superintendent Dixon attached a clip to the flimsies and
tossed them across the desk. He swung round on his chair to the
door of the massive safe behind him and took from it a parcel
marked "Frederick Catlow."</p>

<p>"I haven't tried to locate any of them yet." He passed the
parcel across to the Englishman, then sat back and watched from
under heavy brows. Saul Murmer unfastened the parcel and took out
the roll of banknotes found in the pockets of the murdered man.
Presently he pushed the notes aside and drew from his pocket an
envelope on which was scribbled a series of numbers.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the Superintendent curiously.</p>

<p>"We've got it, sir." There was more weariness than triumph in
the detective's voice. "We've got it&mdash;the leak that has
puzzled the Yard for quite a time."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" Superintendent Dixon commenced to speak eagerly,
then hesitated. "Carrington Manning, Theo Manning, a man named
Saxon, Pontifex, and possibly Thelma Delevere, the woman who
poses as his wife, Buller and Myson. Of course, there are others,
the minor members of the gang, we don't know much of yet."</p>

<p>The Englishman's hand went to the telephone, then came back
sharply. "May I, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead." Superintendent Dixon nodded. Saul Murmer drew the
instrument toward him and dialled a number, For the next quarter
of an hour the Police Department's switchboard was extremely busy
as details and instructions sped over the wires to police
stations in metropolitan and country districts. At length, with
the sigh of a man well satisfied with his endeavours, the
Englishman pushed the instrument from him, and leaned back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Putting out a wide net, aren't you, Saul?" Superintendent
Dixon smiled quizzically. "Suspect a leak?"</p>

<p>"Sure of it, sir, and I'm giving it all the pressure to show."
The Englishman frowned thoughtfully. "That man Manning is
nobody's fool. He has his lines out on all we're doing, and I
shouldn't be surprised if he didn't know by now exactly what we
have discovered."</p>

<p>"Lines out?" The Superintendent looked up quickly, frowning.
"Whom do you suspect?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer did not reply immediately; he was staring
reflectively out of the window. "We couldn't keep the affair
altogether covered," he said slowly, after a few seconds. "We
found the dummy&mdash;they call them fashion figures&mdash;down
at 'Florabella'&mdash;and it was packed full of the junk. More,
with what we expected, we found other packets. I didn't open any
of them, but suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the Inspector paused, and the Superintendent filled in
the missing word: "Drugs?"</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shrugged his shoulders. He struggled to his feet,
pointing to the cable-flimsies he had replaced on the
Superintendent's blotting pad.</p>

<p>"You'll go through those, sir&mdash;or get someone to do
that?" he asked. "I'm curious to know if the Catlow roll is
recorded there."</p>

<p>"I'll do it myself." The Superintendent's eyes were blazing
with the lust of the man-hunt. Times had been when the lure of
the chase had beckoned, and he had fretted at being confined to
an office while other, and younger, men went out to the attack.
He caught eagerly at anything that in any form resembled action.
This affair was a big thing; from it he would gain much kudos; he
would be complimented and his record would be richly endowed.
Letters would travel to England&mdash;the Mecca of every British
detective's ambitions; letters would come back to his chief.
Compliments would be showered on him by men who held high
positions in State and Commonwealth. He would receive great
credits; yet&mdash;</p>

<p>He grinned, as he looked at the stout Englishman standing on
the other side of the desk. Did this apparently lethargic,
placid individual with the outward appearance of a city
alderman, the pose of a society dilettante, guess that he deeply
envied him&mdash;that he would willingly stake his high position
in the department for just one more opportunity to go out on the
road and feel again the impulses that overwhelm the true
man-hunter&mdash;to feel the zest of a firm hand on a "wanted's"
shoulder? He wondered; he wished he could gain even one small
clue to what lay in full security behind those seemingly innocent
eyes.</p>

<p>"Good, sir!" Saul Murmer turned towards the door. "I'll have
our find sent straight to you."</p>

<p>In the corridor outside the Superintendent's suite of offices,
Saul Murmer hesitated, conning his problems, seeking to discover
if he had left any weak links in the chain he was striving to
twist round the keenest and most audacious crook he had
encountered in his career. He found his work good&mdash;and
nodded. From what weak evidence; from what inconsequential facts
had he built up his theory testing it to known facts? Almost he
felt elation&mdash;and for Saul Murmer to discover emotion in his
own work was strange&mdash;very strange!</p>

<p>Quietly he ambled through the corridors and down the stairways
of police headquarters, exchanging greetings and inconsequences
with friends he met, until he came to the great court of the
house and passed through the ever-open gates into Central Lane.
He walked up to Pitt street and hailed a taxi, and was whirled
through Liverpool, Castlereagh and Market streets to gain the
entrance to Swayne Court. Dismissing the car, the detective went
through the court to the door of "Florabella." He found the place
apparently normal. Customers were entering and leaving; there
were no signs of guarding police about the establishment.</p>

<p>In the waiting-room at "Florabella" he found Constable Peck,
ensconced in a chair in the corner of the room and trying to look
as if his sole object that day was attendance on a stuffed pocket
book. Saul Murmer nodded briefly to the man and proceeded on his
way. He had known that Inspector Pater would soon bring order out
of chaos. He went on to the large showroom where they had found
the loot in the fashion figure. Inspector Pater rose from a chair
almost under the time-clock which had betrayed Daddy Thornton,
and came to meet his comrade.</p>

<p>As the two men met, Inspector Murmer was conscious that Miss
Lancing was watching them keenly. He bowed to her profoundly, and
the usually staid manageress laughed. The Englishman was fully
satisfied; Miss Lancing would not even have smiled had not her
well-ordered mind, patterned to the dictates of feminine
decoration, been entirely at ease.</p>

<p>"All right, John?" The Englishman glanced inquisitively about
the room.</p>

<p>"Just there." Inspector Pater nodded to a corner of the room
occupied by a fashion figure clothed in a daring evening gown,
and showing no signs of the severe handling to which it had been
subjected.</p>

<p>"Good! And the loot?" Saul Murmer smiled.</p>

<p>"Sent Leyland down to headquarters with it. Miss Lancing lent
me a&mdash;a dress container, to hold it."</p>

<p>"Leyland?"</p>

<p>"Had to get the fool out of the way. He's far too much of the
flat-footed patrolman to have about an establishment like this."
Inspector Pater shrugged. "He got on Miss Westways' nerves
until&mdash;" He paused and shrugged again. "You ask Miss
Lancing." Another pause. "Fine woman that, Saul."</p>

<p>"And lead us not into temptation." The Englishman softly
muttered the petition. "Lord, John, I never thought you'd
fall."</p>

<p>"I'll punch your fat, bald head!" John Pater flushed heavily.
"Of all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leyland?" Saul Murmer's ever-working brain had found another
avenue to explore. "I didn't hear of him at Central Lane."</p>

<p>"He's been gone quite a while," replied John Pater.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" Inspector Murmer glanced about the room. "We'll
wait until closing time to get that imitation lady in the corner
down to Central Lane.</p>

<p>"Of course, we'll have to keep her, but that won't worry Miss
Westways&mdash;nor Miss Lancing," he added with a sly glance at
his companion. "Miss Burke arrived yet? Of course. She came here
with Sergeant Leyland. She's with Miss Westways, I
suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to the door leading to the offices. "By the way,
John, if you wish to get away from feminine influences, Harry
Peck can stand guard over our young friend in the corner."</p>

<p>Again John Pater flushed, and Inspector Murmer left the
room.</p>

<p>The Englishman was grinning widely as he ambled on in the
direction of Miss Westways' private offices. Had the lanky
Australian at last fallen to feminine wiles? That he considered a
distinct possibility, if viewed in conjunction with Miss
Lancing's sudden meek acquiescence to male invasions in purely
feminine realms.</p>

<p>Paddy jumped up from beside Miss Westways when she saw
Inspector Murmer enter the room, and ran to him. He backed into a
corner, warding her off mockingly.</p>

<p>"Remember police regulations, Paddy," he warned. "Detectives
are not allowed to be kissed more than once a day. It's bad for
the morale of the department, and for discipline."</p>

<p>"If I can't kiss you, I'll go and kiss that handsome Inspector
you brought here to trifle with auntie's young and tenderer
affections," Paddy declared. "I'm certain he won't mind."</p>

<p>"But someone else may," laughed the Englishman, ambiguously.
For a moment the girl stared at him uncomprehendingly; then
suddenly went and whispered to Miss Westways. The elder lady
shook her head reprovingly; but they both laughed.</p>

<p>"Where's Theo?" asked Saul Murmer, casually.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why?" Paddy turned to the detective challengingly; then spoke
with assumed carelessness. "He went down to police headquarters
to meet you. So did Sergeant Leyland."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The Englishman stared for a moment, then frowned.</p>

<p>"He did, did he? I didn't know he was so eager for my society
as all that."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Saul&mdash;" Paddy hesitated. "I didn't make any
difference to him; truly I didn't. You told me not to, and I was
so careful&mdash;I just acted ordinarily."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer patted the girl's soft cheek caressingly. "That's
all right, m'dear," he chuckled. "Miss Westways, may I use your
telephone?"</p>

<p>Miss Westways smiled, and nodded to the instrument on the
desk. The detective lifted the receiver and dialled police
headquarters.</p>

<p>"See if Sergeant Leyland is in the building," he commanded,
when he obtained connection. "And put me through to
Superintendent Dixon, at once. Send Sergeant Leyland to
Superintendent Dixon's offices, to there await my
arrival&mdash;if you find him."</p>

<p>He waited for a reply to his instructions and connection, but
turned as the office door opened suddenly. When he saw the
newcomer was Inspector Pater, he nodded.</p>

<p>"Good, John. We've come to the end of the hunt, I
fancy&mdash;" He ceased speaking suddenly and gave his whole
attention to the instrument, For some seconds he listened, then
spoke:</p>

<p>"Superintendent Dixon? Inspector Murmer speaking, now at
'Florabella.' Has Sergeant Leyland arrived at your office with
the&mdash;er&mdash;loot we recovered here this morning, sir?"
Again he listened, a little satisfied smile growing on his
well-curved lips; then:</p>

<p>"I thought that, sir. Carrington Manning's no fool, and he
seems to know, or to guess, all our moves. Yes, sir; I'll wait
here for a time and keep you advised of anything that happens.
Yes, sir. Captain Pontifex and Miss Delevere are not here.
Inspector Pater thought it wise not to formally detain them at
present. They're being trailed, and we can pick them up with the
others when we're ready. Very good, sir."</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and turned to face the little group
watching him.</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland has not arrived at police headquarters," he
said slowly. "As he has left here some considerable time for five
minutes' walk to Central Lane, that means something has happened
to him." He paused, and added reflectively, "I thought as
much."</p>

<p>"Abducted?" asked Paddy quickly. "Someone's abducted a police
officer&mdash;and a big one like Sergeant Leyland! How
thrilling!" She laughed gleefully, then acted mock-soberly. "I
think if I were an abductor, I'd rather have a nice girl.
Sergeant Leyland's rather&mdash;rather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lady killer," suggested John Peter, a twinkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"He told me all about his sorrowful, misunderstood life," said
Paddy, forcing glistening tears to her eyes. "I was so sorry for
him; I even let him squeeze my hand." She turned quickly to the
Englishman: "Uncle Saul, why do all these big, masterful,
impressive men so utterly misread women? And&mdash;" She turned
to Miss Westways. "Oh, auntie, you couldn't imagine him as
anything else than one of those big, gay-coloured English
roosters, dodging about a farmyard trying to make up his mind
which hen he will elect to be the favourite of his present
harem."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer glanced at Inspector Pater, and winked. "And we
call them the weaker sex, John. Surely that's only because we are
so supremely jealous of their undoubted superior mental
abilities."</p>

<p>The shrill of the telephone bell interrupted any reply John
Pater had opened his mouth to make. With an apologetic glance at
Miss Westways, Saul Murmer went to the desk and lifted the
receiver.</p>

<p>"'Florabella' speaking," he said softly, then his tone changed
subtly. "All right, Bert; I'm here." He glanced round at the
group watching him, and his lips framed the word:
"Superintendent."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Inspector Murmer. Good. I thought they'd do that.
Got them? Fine work; I'll get Inspector Pater to mention them in
his report of the case&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll write your own report and do your own recommending,"
growled the Australian. "I've never met such a lazy fellow," he
added, turning to Miss Westways. "Always getting someone to do
his work for him. His chief aim seems to be to avoid
responsibility&mdash;for even picking up a pin."</p>

<p>Miss Westways smiled at the tall Inspector, but she did not
speak. All her attention was centred on Inspection Murmer at he
telephone.</p>

<p>"Got 'em at Goridge's River Bridge! I thought they'd make that
line, sir. Who? Manning, his son&mdash;who by the way is not his
son, but the son of Thelma Delevere&mdash;and Saxon, acting as
chauffeur. Good! Yes, sir. Oh, Mrs. Leyland and Myson, on a tram.
I thought he was out in that direction. Brought Buller
in&mdash;good. Thanks for ringing me, sir."</p>

<p>Replacing the receiver, Saul Murmer turned to face the little
group watching him, expectancy glowing on their faces.</p>

<p>"That's the end of the trail," he said quietly; yet he could
not keep a note of satisfaction out of his voice. "No more
trouble for you and Paddy, Miss Westways. John and I have read
the riddle, and now Superintendent Dixon has gathered together
our solutions."</p>

<p>"But what is the solution?" demanded Paddy, stamping her
little foot. "Uncle Saul, you talk a lot of ambiguous rot into a
telephone&mdash;and I don't know that there's anyone listening to
you at the other end&mdash;and then you tell us, blandly: 'It's
all right!' It isn't! Unless you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ask you to supper at the Green Lagoon, to-morrow night." Saul
Murmer made gestures of surrender. "That do? All right; we'll
make a party for the explanations, and all that. You shall bring
that new boy you've told me so much about; and get Dizzy and Eva
along. I'll ask Inspector Pater&mdash;and he can ask Miss
Lancing&mdash;Eh, John?" He dodged a threatening gesture.
"So&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Inspector Murmer&mdash;" commenced Miss Westways, whose
eyes revealed the curiosity she was too shy to express in
words.</p>

<p>"My dear lady." Saul Murmer bent over the lady's hand, "Don't
you know, a man likes to keep a little secret&mdash;just for a
little while; but a woman likes to tell a little
secret&mdash;until it ceases to be a secret, even to herself." He
grinned, and taking Inspector Pater's arm turned him in the
direction of the door.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," he called back over his shoulder. "The Green
Lagoon, to-morrow night. Paddy can dance to her heart's content
with her new boy and Dizzy Laine, while I recount the Strange
History of a Fashion Figure and a Financier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dance!" said Paddy scornfully. She glanced from one man to
the other with full meaning in her fine I eyes. "It looks as if
I'm going to have quite a spell of wedding-dancing during the
next few months." She sighed. "Heigh-ho! A modern girl never gets
any really decent time to devote to her private affairs. She has
to do so much for her far-too-shy elders."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="first">WORKING in the purlieus of Surry Hills, even
with Inspector Murmer, a man he envied, hated and despised,
Sergeant Lionel Leyland showed at his best; yet his malice became
almost rabid as he listened to the Englishman's strange handling
of the crooks.</p>

<p>Leyland belonged to the old-fashioned police type&mdash;a type
that has almost disappeared from among the law forces of the
world of men who believed that only by the excessive use of the
powers with which they were invested, and an over-awing brutality
of demeanour, could results be obtained. Yet in spite of his
contempt of the English officer's methods, he secretly wondered
at the amount of information he had obtained through his easy,
apparently indifferent and inconsequent questions.</p>

<p>When Inspector Murmer detailed Sergeant Leyland to escort Miss
Paddy Burke to "Florabella," the Sergeant believed he had been
given a task for which he was eminently fitted. He had a great
belief in his robust and animal-handsome physique; he looked
daily on his broad, ruddy face, split almost into two divisions
by the well-cultivated military moustache he affected. He
admired, whenever he shaved&mdash;which he had to do twice a day
if he wished to spend the evening hours in public&mdash;the
formidable chin with which Dame Nature had endowed him at birth.
He conceived that his hazel eyes held a challenge to every woman
a challenge no woman could resist. To escort Miss Paddy Burke, a
beautiful and prominent member of Sydney's Younger Set, to the
arms of her aunt was a pleasure and a duty Sergeant Leyland
considered he, alone, of all members of the Police Department,
could adequately perform.</p>

<p>He knew Miss Westways to be a very wealthy woman, and from her
distracted manner that morning over the abduction of her niece,
he anticipated not only an overwhelming adulation of thanks, but
rewards of a more substantial and lasting character.</p>

<p>In the taxi, he posed for Paddy's benefit, preening himself as
a masterful and fascinating lady-killer. He talked largely and
continuously on Lionel Leyland, pulling all the time on his
luxurious lip decoration, which he believed set him above
less-favoured brethren, who perforce, had to live in
clean-skinned faces.</p>

<p>For him, the journey from Likers street to Swayne Court was
all too short. He greatly admired Paddy's serene dark beauty and
vivacious manners yet he feared she was slightly on the skinny
side. For Sergeant Leyland, true beauty lay in well-developed
curves.</p>

<p>Paddy's volatile spirits caused her to pass the time of the
short journey in pleasant speculations on her recent adventures
and the fun and excitement she anticipated in recounting them to
her friends.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland's monologue conversation, pleasant to
himself, lent but a slightly irritating accompaniment to her
thoughts&mdash;somewhat on the lines that an obtrusive orchestra
obligato to an important recitative irritates a slightly deaf
man, who is eager to catch what the actor has to say.</p>

<p>She thought it was not for every girl in Sydney to have the
luck to be abducted, confined in a dirty house in Surry Hills
(shudders), and rescued by half the detective department of the
State, headed by dear old Uncle Saul. She thrilled and thrilled
again. Certainly, she had now a subject of conversation that
should remain fresh with a freshness equal to the length of her
not by any means short visiting list.</p>

<p>Paddy had to admit to herself that her abductors had not
treated her badly. She had been provided with a sufficiency of
food, sufficient to keep her spirits up to their normally high
level. True, she had been chained to a bed that in regard to
cleanliness still made her shudder. She had not admired the
appurtenances of the room in which the bed stood; and, worst of
all, she had been deprived of her bag in which reposed those
essentials without which the modern girl dared not face even her
own maid.</p>

<p>At "Florabella", Miss Westways welcomed her niece with open
arms and many questions. Sergeant Leyland stood apart for the
moment, watching the little scene with large benevolence and
patronage. In time, when he thought sufficient attention had been
paid to the rescued, and some notice should be taken of the
rescuer, he attempted to intervene.</p>

<p>To his disgust and amazement, his efforts to recount the story
of the rescue, as he visioned it, met with slight encouragement.
He became annoyed and disgusted. Women! They thought only of
themselves! He should know, for was he not married? Women! Pah!
Entirely self-centred and male-unappreciative.</p>

<p>Finding that his efforts to share in the home-coming of the
prodigal niece were not meeting with the success they deserved,
Sergeant Leyland sought a more appreciative atmosphere. He
wandered into the showroom where, some hours before, the fashion
figure had been forced to disgorge great wealth before his eyes.
There he found Inspector Pater, kneeling on the carpet, packing
into a large suitcase the white-wrapped packets.</p>

<p>He licked his lips. If only that wealth belonged to him; what
good use he could make of it! Almost without conscious volition
he moved toward the kneeling Inspector.</p>

<p>"Can I help, sir?" The itch to finger so much wealth made the
Sergeant rub his hands mechanically.</p>

<p>"Ah, Leyland! Back again; successful, I hope?" Inspector Pater
looked up from his task, a gleam of interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir!" Sergeant Leyland drew himself up in his
masterful warrior pose. "I&mdash;we&mdash;found Miss Burke, and
we&mdash;I brought her back here. She is quite well." Here the
police officer paused, searching his none too fruitful mind for
the appropriate ending of the phrase. Paddy, in his opinion, had
not seemed at all properly distressed, and had not behaved in a
manner, in his opinion, appropriate to a rescued damsel.</p>

<p>"No?" John Pater laughed gently. "I don't think Miss Paddy is
one of the worrying sort." He wedged the last packet into the
well-filled suitcase and closed the lid.</p>

<p>"There! That's finished! Where's Inspector Murmer,
Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer went to headquarters, sir." The Sergeant
answered with admirable official rectitude. "At least, we left
him in Surry Hills, and he said he was going to
Headquarters."</p>

<p>"Not coming back here?" Inspector Pater looked up quickly. He
rose to his feet and dusted the knees of his trousers.
"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want to get that case down to him quickly, sir?" Sergeant
Leyland stared covetously at the leather hiding so much
wealth.</p>

<p>"He may want it," the Inspector mused.</p>

<p>"Then, sir&mdash;" hinted the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes." Inspector Pater made up his mind. "We've finished
here&mdash;for the time, at least, though I'll wait a little
longer in case Inspector Murmer does come back. You may take this
case to police headquarters, Sergeant. Take it direct to
Superintendent Dixon and tell him what's inside&mdash;banknotes
and dope."</p>

<p>Almost eagerly Sergeant Leyland lifted the bag. It was great
to have so much riches within his grasp, even if only
temporarily. Involuntarily, the thought came: what could he not
do if that bag and its contents belonged to him? The world would
be his; he could rise to great heights in his chosen profession;
or he could retire and live the life of a man of wealth; or he
could&mdash;he could&mdash;oh, a man with all that money
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take a taxi," interrupted the Inspector, prosaically. "That
bag's heavy. Get it down to headquarters and give it to
Superintendent Dixon; then find Inspector Murmer and ask him to
telephone me here. Tell him I'll wait here until I hear from
him."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." Sergeant Leyland lifted the bag and strode
to the door. "I'll be in headquarters in ten minutes, sir."</p>

<p>The suitcase was heavy and Sergeant Leyland was tired, for he
had not had his accustomed eight hours' sleep the previous night;
in fact, he had not slept at all; yet the sense that he carried
vicarious wealth braced him to walk with truly official steps out
of "Florabella".</p>

<p>In Pitt Street he dropped the bag to the pavement and glared
up and down the street, in search of a taxi. "Well,
Insp&mdash;Beg pardon, I mean, Sergeant."</p>

<p>A bright, brisk, light voice at his elbow made the police
officer look round, and down. He stretched out a massive right
hand, eagerly. "Mr. Carrington Manning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On duty, I see, Sergeant." The financier smiled genially as
he glanced down at the suitcase at the police officer's feet. "I
didn't know they expected&mdash;er&mdash;high officers of the
Police Department to carry heavy parcels through the
streets?"</p>

<p>"Too valuable to trust to a constable, sir." Sergeant
Leyland's big whisper rang above the noise in the street. He bent
slightly, to his friend's ear. "I'd like to bet you couldn't
guess what's in that case, sir. No, never!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Carrington Manning backed slightly from the
Sergeant's heavy breath. "Indeed!" He glanced back into Swayne
Court, and slight apprehension showed in his eyes. He said:
"Indeed!" a third time.</p>

<p>"That case's full of banknotes&mdash;real Bank of England
notes, sir, an' most of 'em with high figures in the corners."
Sergeant Leyland swelled with importance. "Thousands of 'em, sir;
there's a million or more in that bag. I&mdash;Inspector Murmer
and I found 'em, sir, and I'm taking 'em to Police Headquarters,
to Superintendent Dixon. He'll be glad to see me, I bet!" A
portentous wink closed the sentence.</p>

<p>"A million!" The little financier appeared to gasp at the
figures. "I'm sure Superintendent Dixon will be glad to see you,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Carrington Manning glanced back into Swayne Court.
"&mdash;and is Inspector Murmer about?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Murmer is at Police Headquarters, awaiting me, sir.
Sergeant&mdash;" Leyland's broad, chest assumed the curve of a
long bow. "I have conferred with him and Superintendent Dixon in
regard to&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you propose to get this heavy and valuable suitcase to
police headquarters. Sergeant?" interrupted the financier.</p>

<p>"I'm taking a taxi, sir." The atmosphere of importance
surrounding the police officer grew thick. "The department
doesn't stint us when we're on duty, sir."</p>

<p>"A taxi?" Carrington Manning's thin lips straightened. "And
that bag full of money! Surely the department should have sent
one of the police cars, and an escort for you&mdash;Not that
you're incapable of looking after that enormous amount of wealth,
Sergeant," continued the little man, noting the doubting look
that had come into Leyland's eyes. "But there are thieves in this
city&mdash;desperate characters."</p>

<p>"And well I know that, sir." Sergeant Leyland tapped his empty
hip pocket, significantly. "Well I know that&mdash;and I'm
prepared."</p>

<p>"Ah!" A dazzling idea appeared to flash into Carrington
Manning's mind; he bent and lifted the suitcase with one hand,
while he slipped his other hand into the crook of the Sergeant's
elbow. "I have it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, sir!" Sergeant Leyland grabbed the suitcase. "Excuse
me, sir; that's too heavy for you&mdash;and besides, it's
official property now, and we're not allowed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Prime Minister wouldn't say that to me," sighed
Carrington Manning, yet he surrendered the suitcase with a smile.
"You carry it, Sergeant, and come with me. You're walking in
luck! I have my car here&mdash;just made a business
call&mdash;and I'll drive you to Police Headquarters."</p>

<p>A few steps down Pitt Street, Carrington Manning ushered
Sergeant Leyland into a handsome private car, drawn to the curb.
The Sergeant was nothing loth. He would arrive at Police
Headquarters in Company with one of the richest men in the city
of Sydney, and his comrades would witness that arrival. He would
be able to talk of Carrington Manning after this, and his
companions would envy him! Only one matter irked&mdash;he would
not be able to book a taxi on his expenses account; but then, he
thought, if he had taken a taxi he would have had to pay for it,
even if he did add a few pence to the fare, for profit&mdash;on
account of the taxi-war price.</p>

<p>It was only when the car swung to the left at Bathurst Street
intersection that Sergeant Leyland felt a momentary discomfort.
He leaned forward and tapped the chauffeur on the shoulder:</p>

<p>"That's not the way, my man," he said sternly. "Don't you know
where Police Headquarters is? You should have kept down
Pitt-street. Central Lane is halfway to Liverpool street, on the
right-hand side."</p>

<p>The chauffeur took no notice of the instructions, and Sergeant
Leyland started to rise from his seat. He found a stiff arm
thrusting him back into the corner of the car, and something hard
and round dug him in a place he had long since learned to
recognise belonged to his lunch, at that hour of the day.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" The police officer booked down at the increased
pressure or his middle region, then looked up into the hard eyes
of Carrington Manning. "That's a revolver, if you don't know, and
it may go off. Sit back and hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>Waiting a moment to understand if the Sergeant fully
recognised his predicament, the financier, without abating the
pressure of the revolver in the police officer's anatomy, reached
forward and pulled down the window blind; then he fumbled behind
him, eventually finding the cord of the blind on his side, and
lowered that.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carrington Manning!" At length Sergeant Leyland found his
voice. He felt as if his known world was tumbling about his head
in individual bricks. "What's the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you to hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>Carrington Manning's voice held a nasty-sounding note, and the
pressure of the revolver was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you recognise&mdash;and if you don't I'm telling
you&mdash;this revolver has a silencer, and a shot in this car
would not be heard amid the din of Sydney's streets&mdash;the
greatest traffic noise in the world. Sit back and I behave
yourself and you won't get hurt."</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland sat back. He could not have spoken if he had
tried; but he could think, and his slowly returning thoughts were
not pleasant.</p>

<p>"That's right!" The pressure of the revolver on the empty
stomach relaxed as Carrington Manning leaned back in his corner
of the car. "Keep your tongue still and your hands in your lap
and we won't quarrel, and&mdash;" Sergeant Leyland noted that the
man had the audacity to wink at him, "&mdash;and you'll find you
won't be forgotten. I'll look after you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" stuttered the police officer. He had not
even yet grasped the full enormity of what was happening to him.
"Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, I'm taking charge of you and that bag of money."
Carrington Manning spoke easily, the revolver pointed ominously
at the Sergeant's middle region. "Yes&mdash;" The man laughed
quietly, "I'm looking after that bag of money now. Jove, the
trouble I've had to get it!"</p>

<p>"Where was it, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"The fashion figure."</p>

<p>"At 'Florabella's,' sir."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts at 'Florabella?' Confound you? Can't you speak?
Where was it hidden?"</p>

<p>"In the window, sir." Sergeant Leyland was answering the
questions automatically. He hardly heard what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" The little man exploded viciously. "And the
fools searched the premises before those damned clocks&mdash;" He
stopped speaking, leaned forward and tapped the chauffeur on the
shoulder. "Don't forget Theo, Saxon. He should be somewhere
hereabouts."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the car slowed and stopped. The door on
the Sergeant's aide was pulled open. Theo Manning thrust his head
into the car, and grinned when he saw the police officer.</p>

<p>"Come in Theo," Carrington Manning snapped the command. "You
shift over this way and be careful how you do it. Now, Theo," he
added as the youth seated himself in the car, "get your gun out
and keep this cop in order; we don't know what tricks he might
think to play, and we can't afford added trouble now. All right,
Saxon; buzz along!"</p>

<p>The car moved forward, gathering speed. Sergeant Leyland sat
between the two men, still trying to co-ordinate his thoughts. If
only he could understand. Carrington Manning and his son. A
wealthy man staging a holdup! And&mdash;what was to become of
him? He wondered fearfully. The financier&mdash;no, the man
couldn't be a financier and do the things he was doing.
Why&mdash;the man must be a crook! Then it was his duty as a
police officer to arrest him. But&mdash;Leyland looked down on
the gun in the little man's hand, then turned as something dug
him hard in his ribs on the other side. He glanced at Theo
Manning, and then caught sight of a nasty looking little
automatic in the youth's hand.</p>

<p>Theo grinned. "If you're thinking of your wife&mdash;"
commenced Carrington Manning. Sergeant Leyland was not thinking
of his wife. That day he had thought as little as he could of the
lady. He had acquired the belief that he had been slightly too
abrupt with the wife of his bosom. He had been abrupt with Mrs.
Leyland on other occasions&mdash;very few occasions&mdash;and the
aftermath had not been in any way comfortable. Mrs. Leyland had a
tongue, and was expert in its use. She liked to use it, and was a
lady who never denied herself anything she liked, especially when
she considered she had just cause for complaint against her
handsome husband.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland had the belief that Mrs. Leyland would think
the events of the previous evening and the early morning "just
causes of complaint." He had arrived home during the still, small
hours of the morning and, according to the canons of marital
relationship, had been exceedingly rude. No, he was not thinking
of his wife. He preferred to forget her for quite a while
yet.</p>

<p>"I can inform you that Mrs. Leyland is all right and is being
well cared for," continued the little man. "Before I met
you&mdash;and I may inform you, my dear Sergeant, that our
meeting was not luck, but very carefully planned&mdash;I had a
telephone message conveyed to Mr. Myson, requesting him to escort
Mrs. Leyland to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the Sergeant quickly. After all, Mrs. Leyland
was his wife, and it is the duty of every husband to inquire into
the happenings when single men escort their wives.</p>

<p>"That you will find out in time. Sufficient for you to know
that I've got our getaway all set. You'll see her presently."</p>

<p>Presently was an ambiguous word; it might mean, any time; it
might mean another world, thought Sergeant Leyland, glancing down
on either side of his bulky frame and noting the guns held firmly
against him. Mrs. Leyland could not help him in his present
position. His thoughts passed to Alfred Myson. Mrs. Leyland had
been displeased with Mr. Myson the previous evening. He wondered
idly just what sort of time the little crook was having with the
lady.</p>

<p>He felt sorry for friend Myson. Escorting Mrs. Leyland to an
unknown destination, when she was not in the best of tempers
would be wearing work.</p>

<p>Seated in the centre of the rear seat of the car, Sergeant
Leyland had a certain view, through the windscreen, of the
country through which they were travelling. By the time he had so
far recovered that he could take an interest in matters
surrounding him, he found the car had travelled through the outer
suburbs and was now speeding through fairly open country. There
were houses in sight, but no thoughts of rescue from them came to
the gallant Sergeant.</p>

<p>Once thoughts of possible methods of turning the tables on his
captors occurred, but a glance at the formidable weapons flanking
him was intensely dampening in effect. Again he turned his
attention to the brief views of the country he could obtain over
the chauffeur's wide shoulders. Suddenly he wriggled on his seat;
he had recognised certain landmarks as they sped by. A few
minutes' watching and his suspicions became certainties. He knew
that within a few minutes he would see before the car the
George's River bridge. Yes, he was right. There was the
bridge!</p>

<p>Carrington Manning leaned forward and whispered in the
chauffeur's ear. The man nodded, and the car slowed. It came to a
halt some 50 yards behind the last car lined up for the passage
of the bridge. For seconds they waited; then Carrington Manning
shifted round on his seat and, lifting the flap covering the rear
window, he peered out.</p>

<p>"Two cars behind us and a bunch in front," whispered the
ex-financier. "Confound it, Saxon! Why did you come this
way?"</p>

<p>Still they waited. Carrington Manning shifted impatiently on
his seat. He turned and stared at the police officer
malevolently. "I don't quite know what to do with you, Sergeant."
The little man's voice was brisk and hard. "I don't want to shoot
you, for I can't afford to have a corpse in the car, in case of
accidents. I could crown you. That would be painful for you and
might irritate your wife&mdash;and that would discommode Myson.
She might demand a new husband and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Theo Manning guffawed. "Poor Alf!" he said.</p>

<p>Sergeant Leyland looked stolidly before him. So his life was
threatened. He squared his broad shoulders. Well, he could but
die in this execution of his duty! He wondered what sort of
funeral he would get? Surely the Commissioner would recognise
that he had died in defence of property entrusted to him. He
should have a proper police funeral&mdash;almost he was sorry
that the regulations forbade the military to attend. They would
add an impressiveness to the scene&mdash;especially when the
coffin was lowered into the open grave, the buglers sounding "The
Last Post" and the soldiers firing the "Last Salute." The
grave&mdash;He shuddered. Almost he could hear the clods falling
on the hollow coffin. Hollow! But he would be in it!</p>

<p>He wondered if the people in the cars surrounding him would
hear him if he shouted. But, if they heard, would they take any
notice, or take time to&mdash;He glanced down at the guns levelly
flanking him, and decided that bullets were quicker than
shouts.</p>

<p>"You're wise." Carrington Manning grinned. He glanced forward
and noted a movement on the bridge. "Get along, Saxon; you can
close up now. Sergeant Leyland has found reason."</p>

<p>The car rolled slowly forward, decreasing the distance between
it and the other car in line before them. Again the line of cars
halted, and Saxon trod on his brake. The waits seemed
interminable to the Sergeant; almost he wished the cars on the
bridge would make haste and clear the road. A car bumped
violently into the back of the Manning car, throwing Sergeant
Leyland violently forward. He was thrown just as violently back
on the seat as the buffers of the Manning car struck the car in
front. Again came the bump from the rear.</p>

<p>"What the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carrington Manning gathered himself up from the disorder in
the car, lowered the window and thrust out his head. "Say, what
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle broke the murmur of voices about them.
Sergeant Leyland started. He had heard whistles like that before.
He craned his neck to see over the chauffeur's shoulder at the
car ahead. Then, for a second, he glanced at Theo Manning. The
youth was on his feet, his face glowering with anger, his
automatic pointed over Saxon's shoulder, as if he intended to
fire through it at the men jumping from the car in line ahead of
them.</p>

<p>Immediately Sergeant Leyland's dormant courage awoke. He
realised that for the moment both the crooks had forgotten him.
His hand went up&mdash;then some instinct caused him to glance at
Carrington Manning. The little man was starting at him, the
elongated revolver thrust forward.</p>

<p>"Sit down!"</p>

<p>Berserker rage suddenly overwhelmed the Sergeant. His massive
fists swung out, not at the revolver but at the bright gleaming
eyes beyond it. The eyes disappeared and the gun pointed suddenly
at the roof of the car. A faint "plop" sounded, and the car
interior stank of burnt cordite. Sergeant Leyland ignored the
"plop" and the smell. He swung suddenly on Theo Manning. Again
the big fist connected and a loud crash of glass indicated that
Mr. Theodore Manning had found an uncomfortable seat in the still
raised window.</p>

<p>"You would!" Sergeant Leyland received the rebounding youth in
his arms. With hardly an effort he raised him in the air and
thrust him down with all his strength on the head and shoulders
of the chauffeur, in the front seat.</p>

<p>"Take that," he shouted viciously; then turned and hit to
where he believed the financier to be. Carrington Manning was not
there. The door of the car was open and a burly constable was
dragging the man out on to the road. Sergeant Leyland
overbalanced, with his fist thrust straight before him. He
connected on the jaw of the constable, and police officer and
prisoner rolled in the dust. Bending down. Sergeant Leyland
snatched up the suitcase of money and jumped out of the car. On
the road he found himself surrounded by constables and
detectives.</p>

<p>"Snakes alive!" ejaculated Sergeant Vernon, running up to the
group from the car immediately behind the Manning car. "What's
the matter, Leyland?"</p>

<p>"Matter?" growled the burly police officer, justly incensed.
"Have I got to do all the work in the police department, while
you fellows just warm chairs? Think the Commissioner keeps you on
the pay roll as ornaments? Here, take this&mdash;"</p>

<p>He thrust the suitcase of money into the Sergeant's hands.</p>

<p>"Look after it&mdash;there's a couple of millions or more in
it&mdash;while I collect my prisoners. And don't forget, you
chaps&mdash;" His bold, roving eyes swept the grinning circle of
faces. "They are my prisoners."</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="first">"THAT isn't fair, Paddy," exclaimed Eva Laine.
"It's your turn to dance with Dizzy now. I'll take Mel."</p>

<p>"The married woman speaks with experience," observed Dizzy
Laine, always journalist. "It may be that in a few years I shall
witness Paddy turning a beloved husband over to some single
girl."</p>

<p>"Why a single girl?" asked Paddy Burke, with apparent
innocence.</p>

<p>"Because married women are too wise to trifle with married
men, darling."</p>

<p>"And married men?"</p>

<p>"The brutes." Dizzy caught the girl round the waist and swung
her into the stream of dancers on Sydney's best night club's
floor. "The brutes! They take every advantage of single
girls&mdash;then get elected to parliament! and propose bachelor
taxes."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer, seated at his accustomed table in the Green
Lagoon, watched the young couple merge into the throng of
dancers. He turned to the handsome middle-aged lady seated beside
him, idly stirring the hot, lazy air with a feathered fan.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the dance, dear lady?" he inquired, making as if to
rise from his seat.</p>

<p>"I think not," Miss Westways shook her head, perhaps a little
regretfully. "To dance there must be a certain spirit a&mdash;How
can I explain it? There is something that leaves us
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For me, perhaps." Saul Murmer looked regretfully at the
elaborate curve decorating his waistcoat. "Yes, for me."</p>

<p>Miss Westways shook her head reprovingly. "I am not paying
compliments to-night," she laughed, "If I were, I might state
that having danced with Inspector Murmer I am persuaded that
he&mdash;in the words of our <i>mâitre d'hôtel</i> Henri&mdash;performs admirably."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer made a little bow, then lifted the glass against
the synthetic evening glow that pervaded the hall. He watched the
lazy bubbles rise through the liquid as he idly twirled the stem
of the glass.</p>

<p>"Then there is left&mdash;" he almost whispered, and his voice
held a tinge of regret. "Then there is only left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of quoting Omar?" Miss Westways shook her
head. "I am afraid Paddy would object. She is expecting a story
from you to-night, and so far this evening has exhibited a
restraint that can only be termed admirable&mdash;and slightly
foreign to her nature."</p>

<p>"A story?" The Englishman replaced his glass on the table
carefully. "A story?"</p>

<p>"You believed there was a&mdash;a counter-irritant, to-night?"
Miss Westways' eyes followed the slight form of her niece, at
that moment passing the table in Dizzy Laine's arms. "Well, Mel
Cheriton is a dear boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have not met him before," said Saul Murmer. An appraising
look came in his eyes as he turned in his chair and searched the
dancing throng for Eva Laine and her partner.</p>

<p>"No?" Miss Westways laughed gently. "Paddy does surprise one,
doesn't she? I used to wonder, at first. Of course she is very
young and one day&mdash;one day romance will come her way. At
present she plays&mdash;as the young always play with the serious
things of life; taking their pleasures as if they were ordained
for their amusement, instead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That pleasures professed are but Nature's decrees in Life's
ruthless cycle" amended the Englishman. He lowered his voice. "I
am afraid that I, too, fear the Wheel of Life."</p>

<p>"The wheel&mdash;" The idly moving fan flickered to a faster
stroke. "You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My term of duty in Australia is quickly drawing to a close."
The Englishman spoke slowly. "In a couple of months I shall
return to London."</p>

<p>"You will leave Australia with regrets?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether." The Inspector pondered. "Australia is a
strange country and one to which the normal Englishman cannot
take too kindly. In Australia you have very little home
life&mdash;and in the old country we are heart sore on the
comforts and privacies of the home. In Australia there is a
crudeness, a lack of restfulness and security that those who have
passed the majority of their days in England cannot understand.
Englishmen feel that, welcome as Australia may make them, they
are still strangers in a strange land&mdash;and life is always
far too short for the middle aged to remake themselves." He
paused considering. "Yet that very unrest I have spoken of, that
lack of intimate home life, appears to be natural&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You miss the great roaring fires, the roast beef and
Yorkshire puddings of life, the bitter, cold evenings without the
walls of the home and the gay, intimate, comfortable existence
within&mdash;" Miss Westways nodded. "I came from England when I
was a child. I may return&mdash;some day."</p>

<p>"And Paddy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps." The lady glanced quickly at the stout man on the
opposite side of the table. "You are very fond of Paddy?"</p>

<p>"I am." For the moment the Englishman was silent. "In some
strange way&mdash;some way I cannot explain&mdash;she is
'natural' to me. Perhaps&mdash;" He paused again. "I am a
solitary, middle aged man, having neither kith nor kin. In the
days of my youth and vigour I gave all that I had to my
work&mdash;to win success&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you find that work alone has not satisfied?" asked the
lady.</p>

<p>"For many years it did. For a long time the struggle&mdash;the
wresting of rewards for endeavour&mdash;were everything." Saul
Murmer spoke musingly. "That is man. We fight on with the daily
task and think we are heading to a natural goal&mdash;and all the
time we are leaving everything that really matters behind us.
Only when the shadows gather on our days&mdash;when we have
grasped that success we coveted and found it crumble to dust in
our hands&mdash;do we gather the true perspective of real things,
and sigh for what we have so carelessly missed."</p>

<p>"The things we have missed!" Miss Westways sighed. "The things
we can never recall."</p>

<p>The Englishman's voice became more firm. "Through life we pass
many cycles, and each cycle is complete and irrevocable. We
cannot turn back the pages of the book of life. We must always
write on, and with the completion of each cycle learn the regrets
for what might have been, but which never can be now. Regrets
grow with life."</p>

<p>"Yet there are compensations."</p>

<p>"Compensations are but the anaesthetising of our past desires.
Age teaches us to avoid memories and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wailing saxophones hesitated and slowed to a stop. The
shuffles of the dancers' feet became more pronounced; over the
falling rhythm rose a babble of excited voices. Miss Westways
looked up, smiling.</p>

<p>"So you will go back to England, shortly. We will miss you,
Inspector."</p>

<p>"My dear lady," Saul Murmer put his hand gently on hers. "I
trust not for long. I should like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Holding handies!" Paddy, appearing suddenly beside the table,
placed her firm young palms on her elders' hands. "I am surprised
at you, auntie. No, Uncle Saul, I am not surprised at you.
You're&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the woman did tempt me!" quoted Dizzy lugubriously. "I'll
answer for Inspector Murmer, Paddy&mdash;it's the same old
excuse. I've made it to my wife ever so often."</p>

<p>"Uncle Saul must answer for his own sins. Give me a chair,
Dizzy, and call your wife. Eva has had my boy long enough. I
don't know what mischief she's done already&mdash;and I'm trying
to bring him up in the way he should go."</p>

<p>Paddy edged her chair determinedly to the table. "Now, Uncle
Saul!"</p>

<p>"Is Uncle Saul under ban, Paddy?" Eva Laine came to the table,
followed by her partner. "Find a chair, Mel; you look quite
exhausted. No, not there. Turn my hubby out of that seat and take
it. He's not used to sitting next to young and fascinating
damsels."</p>

<p>"The fascinating male&mdash;" commenced the journalist, and
was immediately interrupted.</p>

<p>"The fascinating story&mdash;" amended Paddy. "Uncle Saul, you
took possession of 'Florabella' until Miss Lancing showed grey
hairs; you made promises you appear to have no intention of
keeping; you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the way, where is Muriel Lancing?" asked Miss Westways. "I
have not seen her and Inspector Pater since the last dance but
one."</p>

<p>"Spoil sport," laughed Eva Laine. "I may guess, but I'm not
telling." She paused. "What about this story, Paddy? I love
stories&mdash;except from husbands."</p>

<p>"Uncle Saul is to recount 'The Mystery of the Fashion Figure
and the Financier,' Eva." Paddy jerked her chair still closer to
the table. "Is there anything nice in that bottle, Mel? Dizzy
dances with a girl as if she were a sack of wheat."</p>

<p>"Nothing so precious, considering the price our baker charges
for bread," denied the newspaper man. "Now, this story as I know
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't," declared his wife. "Paddy, you're not to listen
to him. I've had two tries to get this story from him, and got a
different version each time. He doesn't know, and when he starts
to make up his memory is so short&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dizzy's squashed," declared the girl. "Now, Uncle Saul."</p>

<p>Saul Murmer shifted uneasily in his chair. He reached out his
hand for his wine glass, but Paddy removed it out of his
reach.</p>

<p>"Not another drop until our curiosity is satisfied," she
declared. "Dizzy, take that glass and fill it carefully&mdash;and
keep it close to you, and away from auntie&mdash;who spoils Uncle
Saul deliberately. Now&mdash;" she turned large and brilliant,
inquiring eyes on the detective. "Once upon a time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" enquired the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Everything!" announced Paddy. "Why was I abducted?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" Saul Murmer opened his very innocent baby-blue
eyes. "A particularly poor quality set of crooks deliberately
framed by Carrington Manning for us to rescue you from."</p>

<p>"I am disappointed," expostulated the girl. "Why, then, was I
abducted?"</p>

<p>"Theo Manning abducted you without his father's consent and
knowledge and with some idea of trading you to Miss Westways for
the Fashion Figure. To get out of the mess his nitwit son had
created, Carrington Manning had you conveyed to Surrey Hills and
then telephoned Sergeant Leyland where to find you. The poor
devils we found in the house were deliberately framed to save the
Mannings' faces."</p>

<p>"Then those strange drawings&mdash;and the practical
jokes&mdash;" commenced Miss Westways.</p>

<p>"Let me try to get the facts straight," interposed the
Englishman quietly. We should start with Carrington Manning. When
I first knew him he was a superior class fence&mdash;or receiver
of stolen goods&mdash;in London. We could never catch or convict
him, but we, of New Scotland Yard, believed he specialised in
stolen bank notes.</p>

<p>"You must know that stolen Bank of England notes are usually
disposed on the European continent, in out of the way places.
Eventually, they drift back to London and are then, of course,
identified. But by that time the source through which they have
been put back into circulation has been well covered."</p>

<p>Deliberately, Saul Murmer reached across the table and took
possession of the glass of wine standing beside Dizzy Laine. He
lifted the glass in salutation to Paddy.</p>

<p>"Stolen banknotes give very poor returns to the thieves. In
fact, those who handle them receive but a very small proportion
of their face value&mdash;and the people who get them back into
circulation&mdash;and accept great risks in doing so, get the
bulk of their value. Now, Carrington Manning devised a plan he
believed would secure to him the bulk of the proceeds on stolen
banknotes.</p>

<p>"For this purpose he went to the United States of America,
taking with him Thelma Delevere's son. Thelma had proceeded him,
going to Hollywood, and there obtaining some small success. But
Carrington Manning found that the U.S.A. was far too close to
England&mdash;he had not sufficient time to operate with the
stolen notes and cover his tracks. Therefore he looked about for
another country, and decided on Australia.</p>

<p>"Australia offered many possibilities. It was several weeks'
journey from England and, through some neglect on the part of the
banks, the London offices of Australian banks were not fully
advised of the numbers of stolen notes. In addition there was
little or no co-ordination between the London and Australian
Police on the matter." Saul Murmer paused, then added; "That was
reasonable for, up to lately, London receivers had not considered
Australia a fertile ground disposing of their ill-gotten
gains."</p>

<p>"Then Carrington Manning was breaking fresh ground in crime?"
asked Dizzy Laine.</p>

<p>"He came to Australia attracted by possibilities he visioned,"
answered the Englishman. "Not only did he consider Australia a
suitable place for the putting of stolen bank notes back into
circulation, but in Australia Bank of England notes have a far
higher value than in other countries in which he could
successfully and largely work. You must remember the bank
exchange. In fact, the difference in exchange would almost cover
all the expenses of his business.</p>

<p>"Carrington Manning brought with him from the States quite a
considerable amount of money&mdash;and a large number of stolen
and forged Bank of England notes&mdash;and also his gang. He set
himself up in Sydney, promoted certain companies of little value,
and by various boostings gained quite a reputation in the
Australian financial world. But&mdash;" Saul Murmer's voice
became more impressive, "&mdash;he brought with him one matter
which caused his subsequent discomfort.</p>

<p>"The London Bankers' Association had for some time had agents
trying to trace down the heads of the ring operating in stolen
bank notes. One of the agents was named Frederick Catlow."</p>

<p>"The man who was murdered at the Salom Club?" exclaimed Dizzy
Laine, quickly.</p>

<p>"That is so. Catlow had stumbled on Carrington Manning's trail
in the States, and had followed him to Australia. Catlow got in
touch with Duller and Myson, and arranged to meet them one
morning at the Salom Club, in a private room. I do not know how
far he was successful, but we have reason to believe he had
persuaded Duller to split on the gang. Duller gave him certain
stolen notes he had been given by Carrington Manning to put into
circulation. Why Duller and Catlow brought Myson into the
business I do not know. We believe Myson listened to what Duller
and Catlow had to say, then turned on his companions and shot
Catlow, threatening to inform Manning that Duller had turned
traitor, unless he acted under his instructions."</p>

<p>"So that is the story of the Salom Club murder," said Dizzy
quietly, "I wondered why the police were keeping the matter so
much under cover."</p>

<p>"We knew of Catlow and suspected his murderer directly I had
traced Catlow's lodgings. It was there I found his credentials.
The rest wasn't difficult to piece together through the usual
channels."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't explain the Fashion Figure, Uncle Saul?"
exclaimed Paddy impatiently.</p>

<p>"The fashion figure!" Saul Murmer smiled quietly. "That had me
puzzled for quite a time. It was only when you told me that
Theo's father was the famous financier, Carrington Manning, that
I could get a connection. I knew of the man's activities in
London, and suspected he was up to the same game here. The
drawings that so puzzled you led me to the style of the fashion
figure Miss Westways received, but did not order from her agent.
I was waiting for cable information regarding the stolen notes
when the 'Florabella' robbery took place. When things seemed to
happen all at once."</p>

<p>"I don't think much of that for detection," said Paddy in
injured tones. "Why, they walked right into your hands, Uncle
Saul."</p>

<p>"Crooks always do, m'dear." Saul Murmer shoved his empty glass
suggestively near the newspaper man. "There's still lots to be
proved, and many threads of evidence to collect, but I think I
have given you a fair outline of the story.</p>

<p>"Carrington Manning had realised while in the States that the
stolen notes game could not be played indefinitely from any one
centre. He planned to make one big scoop in Australia and then
move on&mdash;or retire permanently from the game; perhaps go in
for some other branch of illegal work, for I don't think the man
could run a straight business. For his 'scoop' he instructed his
agents in England to collect a very large number of stolen and
forged notes, and then set to work to form a scheme by which he
could get them out to Australia safely.</p>

<p>"Then Theo came forward with a suggestion that helped. He had
obtained an introduction to Paddy and had been introduced to
'Florabella.' He conceived the idea of the fashion figure as a
container for the loot. Carrington Manning approved the
idea."</p>

<p>"But surely they never thought I would he a party to any such
scheme?" interjected Miss Westways, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Of course not, my dear lady" soothed the stout detective. "So
far as I understand, the idea was to have the figure consigned to
you, but the necessary Customs papers went to Carrington Manning,
although they were made out in your name. Carrington Manning
intended that when the ship discharged cargo, including the case
containing the fashion figure, one of the gang, posing as a
carrier, would collect the fashion figure, pay the customs
dues&mdash;and disappear with it. You would not have any
knowledge of the matter, as you had no knowledge of the
shipment.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for the scheme and the schemers, your customs
agent went to the wharf very promptly after the arrival of the
ship and collected all goods consigned to you. Through some
accident it was not discovered at the moment that he took away an
extra package, beyond those on the customs papers&mdash;and thus
the fashion figure was brought here.</p>

<p>"When Carrington Manning was informed that the fashion figure
had been delivered to you, he had no option but to send to the
wharf and pay the dues on the figure in your name, to prevent any
inquiry. This did not worry the man. He considered that within a
very few days he would be able to stage a robbery at 'Florabella'
and steal the fashion figure. After the failure of the first
robbery at 'Florabella,' Carrington Manning was perplexed. He
realised that you had discovered that you had in your possession
a fashion figure you had not ordered from London, and was worried
what you would do. That you retained possession of the figure,
rather worried him."</p>

<p>Miss Westways laughed. "I rather liked the figure," she said.
"Then, I thought it had been sent to me by my agent, and that the
letter of advice had been delayed. I had been waiting to hear
from London on the matter."</p>

<p>"So that is why the burglaries were staged!" Dizzy Laine
shouted with laughter. "Gee! What a joke! Carrington Manning, his
son, and his gang, stalking about 'Florabella,' unable to get at
their hidden wealth!"</p>

<p>"In some sense it was amusing." Saul Murmer glanced longingly
at his empty glass. "Er&mdash;Dizzy, I don't, mind you taking
charge of the bottles, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Saul!" Dizzy filled the glass generously.</p>

<p>"Well, Paddy, satisfied? Your Uncle Saul has told a jolly good
story&mdash;one that will publish well, especially that part
about your abduction."</p>

<p>"If you publish that&mdash;" exclaimed Paddy Burke wrathfully.
"I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll tell detective-sergeant Leyland," laughed the
newspaper-man. "I won't, Paddy, Your burly friend, with the big
moustaches, is far too lucky. He might pinch me and
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope he will," said the girl vindictively. "I'd like to see
him put his luck up against you&mdash;for once."</p>

<p>"What of Detective-Sergeant Lionel Leyland?" asked a voice
behind Saul Murmer's chair.</p>

<p>"Hello, John!"</p>

<p>The Englishman looked up to see the tall Australian and Muriel
Lancing behind his chair. "Why bring up disagreeable subjects at
meetings of friends?"</p>

<p>John Pater pulled out a chair for his partner, then seated
himself.</p>

<p>"Is Lionel Leyland a disagreeable subject, Saul? He appears to
be quite the hero of the hour at police headquarters. You must
remember that at George's River Bridge he arrested,
single-handed, the whole gang of crooks."</p>

<p>"Oh, lor!" sighed Dizzy, disgustedly, "And I had to write it
up that way&mdash;with a photograph of the handsome Sergeant
spread over a double column. The&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wicked old fraud!" supplied Paddy. "That's the strongest term
you're allowed to use, Dizzy. Remember, Detective-Sergeant Lionel
Leyland is my heroic rescuer."</p>

<p>"He'll get his step through this," remarked John Pater
reflectively. "The Commissioner can't keep it from him now. Of
all the luck!"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Leyland is certainly lucky," observed Miss Westways.
"I can't say that I like the man."</p>

<p>"No one loves him&mdash;not even his wife!" quoted Dizzy with
a grin. "Wasn't there a row! Mrs. Leyland came down to the
newspaper office to protest that we were insinuating that she was
eloping with the lodger."</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't she?" inquired Eva Laine, cattishly. "She should
be happy that she had a lodger to elope with."</p>

<p>"She complained that what we had published had ruined her
social status in Bondi," added Dizzy.</p>

<p>"It's ruined her standing with her husband," laughed John
Pater. "She visited headquarters to insist that Dizzy and his
confreres at the <i>Post-Advertiser</i> be immediately arrested
for criminal libel and a few other odd things. Inspector Leyland
interviewed her."</p>

<p>"Inspector Leyland?" exclaimed Saul Murmer, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I only anticipate the Commissioner recognising the
inevitable&mdash;and sincerely hope he will post the gallant
officer to the uniformed division," explained Inspector Pater
carefully. "Our Super isn't quite a fool, and he knew that the
publicity Leyland had acquired had to be recognised&mdash;but
with a step in rank outside the Criminal Investigation Branch.
Anyway, Inspector Leyland sent Mrs. Leyland home with a flea in
her ear. I overheard what our prospective Inspector had to say
about landladies and lodgers&mdash;and most of it would interest
any divorce judge. Mrs. Leyland thought so, too, judging by her
expression when she left the building."</p>

<p>"Say, you two!" Dizzy turned cold eyes on Miss Lancing and
Inspector Pater. "Where have you been hiding for the past three
dances? Miss Lancing, you may not remember it, but you promised
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Paddy stared banefully at the tall Inspector. "And I
certainly remember that Inspector Pater beseeched a dance from
me, which he hasn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I may have the honour now, Miss Burke." John Pater pushed
back his chair hastily, rising with scarlet cheeks.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Paddy doubtfully. Then more hopefully. "Yes,
I'll give you this dance. Auntie," she then turned to Miss
Westways, "I believe Miss Lancing is thinking of retiring from
business. May I have her job as manageress of 'Florabella?' You
know&mdash;" She swung to face Saul Murmer, "You know, Uncle
Saul, I am going to settle down and become a business woman. Mel
is studying accountancy and is going to give me
lessons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Accountancy is based on facts, Paddy," warned the
journalist.</p>

<p>"I don't want facts," declared Paddy loftily. "I can guess
right every time. Facts are for men; women rely on their
intuitions."</p>

<p>"You go and dance," laughed Saul Murmer. "You'll be able to
give your intuition plenty of work steering your partner through
that crowd."</p>

<p>"All right!" Paddy jumped to her feet. "Come along, Inspector
Pater. We'll leave our old relations to discuss their wine and
friends." She paused a few steps from the table, looking back
wistfully: "Are you not going to dance to-night, auntie?"</p>

<p>"We've got affairs to discuss, Paddy." Saul Murmer smiled up
at the girl. There was an undercurrent of seriousness in his
voice. "I'm going back to England very soon."</p>

<p>"Can Englishmen dance?" challenged the girl, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Englishmen invented dancing," stated the detective solemnly.
"I promise you shall have excellent partners in London."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl's eyes wandered from one to the other of the
two middle-aged people remaining at the table.
"I&mdash;see&mdash;You want me to dance at a wedding in London"
The girl bent swiftly and kissed Saul Murmer on the one spot on
top of his head that was giving him some anxiety at the moment.
"Contracts, Uncle Saul. And let it be soon, please."</p>

<p>"Paddy!" exclaimed Miss Westways, reprovingly. As the girl
moved away, laughing, she turned to the Englishman&mdash;and
somehow their hands met and held. "Really&mdash;Saul, I seem to
be always saying 'Paddy' in reproving tones."</p>

<p>"A bad habit, m'dear." The Englishman's clasp on the lady's
hands tightened. "You'll have to be careful or, perhaps one day
you'll be saying 'Saul' in reproving tones."</p>

<p>The lights in the hall suddenly dimmed. Swift moving coloured
lights played over the circling couples on the dance floor.
Behind one of the pillars, Luke Lenoire, famous
<i>mâitre-d'hôtel</i> of the Green Lagoon, who was approaching to
see that his esteemed customer, Inspector Saul Murmer, lacked
nothing, turned quickly away, his hand discreetly shielding an
involuntary smile. He glanced back once, and murmured to himself.
"M'sieu surely performs admirably."</p>
