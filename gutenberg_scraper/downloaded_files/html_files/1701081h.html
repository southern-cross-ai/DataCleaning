<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; A RICH MAN
LEAVES NOTHING</h2>

<p class="first">"...AND to my dear god-daughter Ivy Breton, I
give and bequeath the buhl box standing on my library table with
all that it contains, to be delivered to her unopened within 24
hours of the reading of this my last will and testament."</p>

<p>Mark Kithner, senior partner of the firm of Kithner, Wales and
Kithner, solicitors, paused abruptly and looked around the group
gathered about the dining-room table. Then, lowering his eyes, he
continued the reading of the last will and testament of Basil
Sixsmith, deceased.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" Mrs. Martha Western, florid and stout; a
half-sister of the deceased, gasped. "But&mdash;but there's
nothing about the residue of his estate. Basil was a wealthy
man&mdash;if he was&mdash;" The good lady paused. She had been
about to declare her half-brother eccentric, but thought that
statement would not be conventional at the moment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is no residue to the estate." Mark Kithner
smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"Rot!" William Patterson, a small, thin, peaky-looking man
with a big, booming voice interjected. "What about this house?"</p>

<p>"That goes to Mrs. Western&mdash;with the proviso that Miss
Breton is to occupy it for the three months from the date of the
reading of the will."</p>

<p>"&mdash;and pay rent?" A hard light came in Mrs. Western's
small eyes.</p>

<p>"No." The lawyer spoke quickly. "Your claim to inherit is
deferred until the end of Miss Breton's tenancy."</p>

<p>"But, the buhl box&mdash;." Charlie Western turned to his
mother. "That's part of the furniture, isn't it? You're to have
the house and furniture."</p>

<p>"Basil was always unjust." Martha Western wore the air of a
martyr.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is, where's his money?" Patterson's voice
dominated the room. "I don't mind Martha having the house&mdash;I
was only Basil's cousin. I don't mind Ivy&mdash;Miss
Breton&mdash;getting the buhl box. What I want to know is,
where's his cash. He had a lot of it&mdash;or, at least, we
thought so."</p>

<p>"I think the provisions of the will cover all the property the
deceased had to dispose of." There was finality in the lawyer's
voice.</p>

<p>"What?" The little man was on his feet.
"But&mdash;but&mdash;there's not been a penny disposed of. Only
this house and furniture and the buhl box&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and a few legacies to servants. I think you forgot
those," Kithner interposed.</p>

<p>"You say, there's no money?"</p>

<p>"You have heard the will read, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, what are the legacies to be paid from?" An air of
triumph pervaded the little man.</p>

<p>"There is a sum of two hundred and three pounds in the bank."
The solicitor referred to a memorandum before him. "From
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, the legacies amount to more than five hundred pounds!"
Charlie Western, sleek and furtive, interjected.</p>

<p>"The balance will be provided by Mrs. Western from her
legacy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;which is valued, house and furniture, at over five
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The lady wailed. "There's the buhl box and the
legacies! I'll have nothing left!"</p>

<p>"And the testator's debts." Patterson appeared to have
satisfaction in the lady dilemma. "I hold his note of hand for
five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds!" Charlie protested. "Why, that's
absurd."</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I get that coffin?" A black-bordered handkerchief
did excellent duty in hiding Martha Western's angry eyes. "Why, I
spent over a hundred pounds to put him away decently."</p>

<p>"And we don't know what else he owed." Her son added,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"I believe there are quite a few accounts outstanding."
Kithner appeared to take great enjoyment from the scene.</p>

<p>"There you are!" The lady glared angrily. "I think that under
the circumstances Miss Breton should give up the buhl box. It's
quite valuable. I believe, and-"</p>

<p>"I am afraid Miss Breton has no say in the matter." The lawyer
rose to his feet, as if to terminate the meeting. "If you will
give me instructions, Mrs. Western, to sell the house and
contents&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sell the house and furniture!" That was the last straw to the
agitated lady. "I won't!"</p>

<p>"Then I will send you a list of the outstanding debts."</p>

<p>"Oh, let him sell, mother." Charlie spoke. "What's the use of
keeping that old barn?"</p>

<p>"In three months' time," continued the solicitor. "In the
meantime will you please instruct me as to certain outstanding
accounts which will have to be settled without delay.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that I've got to pay them?"</p>

<p>"The creditors will certainly claim against the estate of the
deceased&mdash;and that estate appears to be only this house and
its contents-"</p>

<p>"And the money in the bank," observed Charlie, sagely.</p>

<p>"In the circumstances, the legacies will constitute a debt on
the house and contents." Mark Kithner spoke wearily.</p>

<p>"And that child can live here, rent-free, for three months,
keeping me out of my own!" Mrs. Western rose majestically from
the lounge on which she had been seated. "All I can say is, it's
a scandal; that's what it is! What's she got to keep this house
up and live on?"</p>

<p>"I have a sum of money, in trust, to provide for Miss Breton's
expenses for the period mentioned."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" The woman glared at the lawyer for some seconds. "So
that's that! Quite a nice little sum, I suppose! Put aside to
provide for her. And I'm to pay his debts and burial and what he
likes to give others who were well paid for what they did for
him. Come, Charlie. I'm going to see my solicitors."</p>

<p>Martha Western sailed, majestically from the room, followed by
her son. For a few moments there was an awkward silence, then
Patterson rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for me, Mr. Kithner?" he said, almost
pathetically, "Basil left me nothing&mdash;and I've got to wait
three months for that five hundred pounds I lent him?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, Mr. Patterson."</p>

<p>For a moment the little man looked at the solicitor; then he
glanced at the girl seated in a low chair in a dark corner of the
room. He turned and went to where the girl sat.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Ivy." He spoke hesitatingly. "Martha shouldn't have
talked as she did&mdash;but you know her." His voice was subdued.
"How's it going to be with you? What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"For the present, nothing." Ivy Breton looked up quickly, a
little smile on her well-curved lips. "I'm sorry. Mr. Patterson,
about your money. God-dad seems&mdash;seems to have left things
rather&mdash;muddled."</p>

<p>"Looks like it." The man grinned, wryly. "And I thought he was
quite rich."</p>

<p>"So did I. If I had known that he was so&mdash;so poor I would
have found work, long ago, but he wouldn't let me. He always said
that he would leave me something when&mdash;when he went-"</p>

<p>"He did." Patterson's mouth twisted in a grin. "He left you
the buhl box."</p>

<p>"The buhl box!" The girl laughed. "The buhl box that he was so
fond of. Do you know, Mr. Patterson, I don't think he ever went
into the library without fondling that box."</p>

<p>"And now it's yours." The little man shook his head. "Well,
well! I've got to look to cousin Martha for my money, I
suppose&mdash;and that means trouble a-plenty. Well! If you get
stuck, Ivy, come and see me. I ain't as rich as cousin Basil was
supposed to be, but I've got a few shillings
and&mdash;and&mdash;Well, well! You're not a bad kid, after
all."</p>

<p>With a brief nod to the lawyer the man turned and ambled from
the room. Again fell the silence. Ivy was thinking of the man who
had been more than father to her&mdash;the only father she had
known.</p>

<p>The will had puzzled her. All her life she had been taught to
consider Basil Sixsmith a rich man. The house had been run in
careless, almost spendthrift fashion. There had been money for
her and the household expenses. The old man had denied himself
little; his adopted daughter nothing.</p>

<p>And now that he was dead he had left only the house and the
few pounds in the bank. But&mdash;the money in the bank was
borrowed money. It had to be repaid.</p>

<p>She glanced around the handsomely furnished room, remembering
when some twelve months before her godfather had refurnished it,
against her counsel. He had declared the old furniture to be
rubbish, and sent it away, to be sold by auction. To her
surprise, it had fetched quite a large sum of money. He had
handed her the cheque, telling her to spend it on clothes.</p>

<p>Had he been mad then? Ivy could not repress the
thought&mdash;and felt herself disloyal. But&mdash;she looked up
as a shadow fell before her, at Mark Kithner.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner, you said you had money in trust for me?" She
spoke quickly. "How much is it?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty pounds, my dear." The old lawyer looked
down on the girl. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I shan't need that much to keep this house up&mdash;if it is
necessary for me to do so."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sixsmith wanted you to live here for three months. He
left that money with me, for that purpose."</p>

<p>"But his debts?"</p>

<p>"They are charged on this house and contents."</p>

<p>"This house and its contents? But if I am to live in it you
will not be able to sell it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western is consulting her solicitor on the subject." The
old lawyer spoke dryly.</p>

<p>"But, why should I keep her out of her money all that
time?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western is not a poor woman."</p>

<p>"But it seems unjust." The girl rose and paced the room. "You
said that she would have to pay the legacies&mdash;and the other
expenses."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But she cannot get the money from this house and furniture to
do it with."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Martha Western is a wealthy woman."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it is unjust to her."</p>

<p>"Was it?" Kithner smiled quietly. For some minutes he was
silent. Then: "Ivy, is it unjust to receive money through a
legacy?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. That's&mdash;Well, one receives a legacy
because the giver likes one."</p>

<p>"Do you think Basil Sixsmith liked Martha Western?"</p>

<p>"They always quarrelled when they met."</p>

<p>"Yet he left her this house and the contents&mdash;and she is
a wealthy woman&mdash;while you have nothing. He brought you up
to believe that you would be his heiress&mdash;and he left you
the buhl box."</p>

<p>"I love the buhl box&mdash;I shall keep it because he left it
to me. Mr. Kithner, god-dad had to leave me nothing."</p>

<p>"Everyone expected that he would leave you everything." The
lawyer spoke drily. "And now you want to part with the few pounds
that Basil Sixsmith placed in my hands to provide for you while
you obtained work?"</p>

<p>"I think it should go to pay his debts."</p>

<p>"But Martha Western can pay them out of the estate left to
her."</p>

<p>"She can't sell it."</p>

<p>"For three months." Kithner paused. "She will have to find
something like fifteen hundred pounds to pay the debts and
expenses. At the end of the three months she will come into
property at between five and six thousand pounds. That is rather
good interest, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"You said your godfather and Martha Western were always
quarrelling?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a reason can be found in that." A thin smile came on
the legal-looking lips. "Basil Sixsmith was a strange man. He had
a queer strain of rather sardonic humour. He knew that he could
not entirely ignore his half-sister&mdash;his only close
relation&mdash;without causing comment, yet he did not love her."
The lawyer paused a moment "Can we find a reason there? Did he
leave her this house&mdash;and a problem?"</p>

<p>"And to me&mdash;the buhl box."</p>

<p>"You don't offer to hand that over to the estate?"</p>

<p>"I want to keep it." Ivy turned to face the solicitor. "It's
the one thing that god-dad always wanted to have near him.
It&mdash;it will be like having him about the place when I see
it."</p>

<p>"The buhl box." The smile grew on the lawyer's face. "Come,
Ivy. You have inherited the buhl box and its contents. As your
legal counsellor, it is only right that I should obtain your
inheritance for you. As the legal representative of the deceased,
and co-executor with Mrs. Western, of the will," He made a
grimace at the words, "I shall now hand the box over to you and
obtain your receipt for it."</p>

<p>He went to the table and scrawled a receipt on a piece of
paper.</p>

<p>"Sign here, Ivy." He held the pen towards her. When she had
signed the receipt he folded it and placed it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Now come and take possession of your buhl box."</p>

<p>With old-fashioned courtesy he held the door for her to pass
through. Again in the gloomy hall, he smiled quietly as he viewed
the trim, little figure, walking before him. Ivy Breton was a
pretty girl and although below the average height of woman,
carried herself with an almost regal air.</p>

<p>At the library door she waited until the lawyer came to her.
He opened the door and she passed into the big room.</p>

<p>On the big desk, occupying the centre of the room, stood a
box&mdash;the buhl box. Immediately the eyes of man and girl
turned to it. Kithner picked it up and weighed it in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Not heavy." He laughed gently and tried to raise the lid, but
could not. "Locked!"</p>

<p>"There is no key to the box." Ivy took it in her hands. "See!
It opens to a concealed spring. So!"</p>

<p>The lid flew back under the pressure of the girl's fingers.
They bent to peer into the inferior. In the box lay only a letter
and underneath it a photograph. Kithner slit the envelope and
handed it to the girl. She withdrew the enclosure, a single sheet
of paper and, almost without thinking, read the few lines on it,
aloud:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Ivy</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">You have been a good daughter to me. This last
charge I lay on you. Carry out the instructions contained in
this&mdash;the buhl box.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Basil Sixsmith</span>.</p>

<p><br> As the girl concluded reading the few lines. Kithner look
from the box a photograph of a young man. In silence, he handed
it to the girl. She stared at it amazedly. In the place where the
autograph is usually written were three words, in her godfather's
writing:</p> <br>


<p class="cp">"FIND THIS MAN."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; ADDED
DEBTS</h2>

<p class="first">"ABSURD!" The girl gurgled, delightedly. "Do
you, or did dear old god-dad, think I'm going to chase about the
world looking for a man to marry me? No, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He will have to do the chasing." Kithner's smile broadened
into a chuckle. "Quite right, m'dear. Now to find him and set him
on the right track."</p>

<p>"What track?"</p>

<p>"The chasing." The solicitor's eyes twinkled. "No, dear, that
was only my joke. Still&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him, inquisitively.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Kithner asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know." Ivy had picked up her godfather's letter
again and was reading the few lines, attentively. "God-dad wants
me to find him."</p>

<p>"That's not going to be easy." The lawyer walked around the
desk and sank into Basil Sixsmith's arm-chair. "There's not a
single clue. The photograph's mounted on plain card, not an
imprint, not a mark on it. He may be in the heart of Australia,
for all we know."</p>

<p>"And I am supposed to go and fetch him out? That's
comforting!" Ivy perched herself on the corner or the desk, a
twinkle of mischief in her green-grey eyes. "Still, he's got to
be found."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because god-dad wants him found." Ivy spoke as if she had
given the final reason. Now, Mr Kithner, how do I go about
it?'</p>

<p>"Advertise?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" The girl was sarcastic. "Will this do? 'Wanted&mdash;a young man: photograph in the possession of a young lady who is looking for a job.'"</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if you've taken on quite a 'job' in this
search."</p>

<p>"And with only two hundred and fifty pounds to finance
it."</p>

<p>"Then you have relinquished the idea of handing over that
money to Mrs. Western?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Now, be sensible. How am I to go about this
task?"</p>

<p>For some time there was silence. Ivy tried to consider the
matter from all points of view. It was rather emharassing. She
was to find an unknown young man&mdash;and that without the
slightest clue to where he was likely to be.</p>

<p>Where had Basil Sixsmith found that photograph? Had he known
the young man whose picture it was? What had been the relations
between the young and the old man And above all, what was to
happen when she found him&mdash;if she succeeded in her
search?</p>

<p>The girl had not much doubt in the matter. She would find the
man, only that the finding of him was the last injunction placed
on her by the godfather she had loved so dearly She would find
him&mdash;and then?</p>

<p>Had the old man thought to provide for her future by a
marriage between her and this man? The rich colour flooded her
face at the thought. This would be just like a man! To provide
for her future! As if she was incapable of working?</p>

<p>No, her godfather would not have acted like that. Ivy knew him
too well to allow that thought to linger. Her godfather had been
too wise try so palpable a trick. There was&mdash;there must
be&mdash;a reason behind the somewhat peremptory instruction that
accompanied the photograph.</p>

<p>Could she couple the instruction regarding this man with the
disappearance of the wealth her god-dad had been credited with
possessing? But, in that case, what relation could this man be to
him? Or&mdash;?</p>

<p>Ivy jumped from the desk and took to pacing the room. Had this
unknown man she had been instructed to find anything to do with
herself or her history?</p>

<p>Who was she? Where had she come from? Ivy shrugged. She knew
so little of herself. Her godfather had carefully avoided any
mention of her birth and parentage. She had ask some questions,
but he had always been evasive in his replies. Once she had
pressed for an answer&mdash;to be asked if she was not entirely
happy with him? What could she answer to that? She had known that
she was happy; that had she not possessed a native spirit of
independence she would have been thoroughly spoilt by the old
man.</p>

<p>Something of herself and her parents she had gathered; partly
from what her godfather had told her, partly from the answers to
the few questions she had asked and he had answered, from time to
time. She had learned that she was the daughter of an old, close
friend. He had told her that he had travelled to Queensland, when
she was a baby, to receive her as a trust from her dying father.
Her father? She remembered him so slightly. A tall grave man who
hardly ever smiled; a man whose furrowed brow told of a world
pressing hard on him.</p>

<p>She could not remember her mother. Once she had questioned the
old man regarding her mother, and he had told her to go and look
in the glass. She had stood on tip-toe before the old-fashioned
mirror, trying to picture herself twenty years older, a mother
with a daughter of her own age.</p>

<p>And that was all she knew&mdash;except that she was entirely
dependent on the man who had taken her and given her a home; at
first for the sake of the friend he had loved, then for own self.
Had her father and mother had other children?</p>

<p>Was this man, whose photograph she had found in the buhl box,
her brother? That might be. She always wanted a brother, someone
to look up to&mdash;a nice, strong, elder brother who would bully
her a bit. She knew that she could not love a brother who gave
way to her; the woman in her revolted at the thought. She might
love a husband who lived in a state of passionate adoration and
acquiescence to her demands; but a brother&mdash;he had always to
be superior, masterful, to call out the best in the adolescent
woman that she instinctively known was in her. She laughed,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well?" Kithner looked up, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if that was a photograph of my brother."</p>

<p>"And I was wondering how you were going to find this man."</p>

<p>"You suggested advertising."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! You never took that seriously?" The lawyer threw
up his hands. "Why, every man in the Commonwealth would think
that his photograph, especially if he thought that he would be a
gainer if he claimed resemblance to it. Why, girl, your money
would melt in a staff of secretaries to deal with the
correspondence; you would have to get police protection to
prevent the doors of this house being thrown down in the rush.
No, advertising is no good!"</p>

<p>"Then, what do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't suggest&mdash;anything." A little smile
lurked around the straight lips. "Remember, young lady, I'm only
your adviser, that means, I have to carry out the instructions
you give me after I have advised you whether, in my opinion, they
are good or bad. The onus is entirely on you."</p>

<p>Ivy looked at him, suspiciously. A sudden thought was born in
her mind.</p>

<p>"Exactly, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"My meaning is carried in my exact words, m'dear." Kithner
laughed, slightly. "The chase is to you. All I will promise is,
that I will carry out your instructions faithfully."</p>

<p>Ivy went and sat on the arm of the lawyer's chair.</p>

<p>"That means you know something."</p>

<p>"I know nothing, at the moment."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;if you learn anything in the future?"</p>

<p>"Anything I shall learn will be through carrying out the
instructions you honour me with. That information will, of
course, be always at your service. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering what god-dad did with his money?"</p>

<p>"You think he had money&mdash;more money that there was in the
bank when he died?"</p>

<p>"I think so." Ivy spoke doubtfully.</p>

<p>"How could he have kept up this house, this establishment, if
he had not had money?"</p>

<p>"He borrowed five hundred pounds from Mr. Patterson,
lately."</p>

<p>Kithner laughed. "I know the time when Basil Sixsmith laid on
my desk share certificates and bonds worth over a hundred
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"One hundred thousand pounds?" The girl gasped. "What did he
do with it? Why, he must have speculated to have lost all
that."</p>

<p>"If Basil Sixsmith speculated, then it was the other man who
lost." The lawyer laughed, broadly. "Well, my dear, the problem
is yours. Let me know what you think&mdash;what you intend to
do."</p>

<p>"I can tell you now." Ivy spoke as Kithner rose to his feet.
"I am going to find that man."</p>

<p>"The man of the photograph?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;then?"</p>

<p>"I am going to ask him why god-dad set me so ridiculous a
quest."</p>

<p>The solicitor went to the door, shaking his head. Laughingly,
Ivy accompanied him. As he passed out of the house he was
smiling, secretly. Some yards down, the road he turned and looked
back, shaking his head again.</p>

<p>IVY closed the door on the solicitor and went back into the
house. It seemed very lonely and deserted now that her godfather
had been carried out of it to his last long rest. Almost she
thought she could hear the "thud-thud" of his heavy stick, as he
passed from room to room. She looked in at the library, now
filled with the long evening shadows, picturing him in his
arm-chair before the great desk. She visioned the quick upward
motion of his head with which he had always greeted her entry
into the room, tinged with a hint of inquiry regarding her errand
there.</p>

<p>He had loved her and she had loved him. Now he had gone and
behind him had left a puzzle&mdash;a mystery. Ivy laughed, as
remembrance came to her. Her god-dad had always reacted to
mysteries. Together they had puzzled over many problems. Now he
had set her a problem&mdash;and he was not there to help her
solve it.</p>

<p>A problem, a mystery. Were the two things related? Was the
problem the mystery and the mystery but part of the problem? The
lawyer had spoken of her godfather's wealth&mdash;about a hundred
thousand pounds and he had died with but the house and a few
pounds in the bank; died in debt leaving a dispute to the
relatives who flocked to his funeral as vultures to a feast on
the dead.</p>

<p>She would solve that problem, probe that mystery. She knew now
that the problem and mystery were one. She turned to face the big
armchair, drawn before the empty grate. There the old man had sat
evening after evening, conning some mystery story, perhaps to put
the book down and discuss with her the solution. They had laughed
together when they had found that the author had baffled,
deceived them. In spite of that they had tackled the next mystery
in a new spirit of optimism.</p>

<p>The old man had declared that the mystery-mongers were all
wrong. They had dealt with crime&mdash;murder, abduction and
theft He had claimed, that there were still more baffling
mysteries in the honest light of the world. Had he framed one for
her benefit; trusting to her native wit to search out the
solution?</p>

<p>Again she read the note she had taken from the buhl box. Was
there some secret to be read in that? She looked down at the
photograph, lying on the desk. He looked nice&mdash;he would he a
nice brother to some girl; a nice&mdash;.</p>

<p>The lawyer had suggested that, more by his manner than through
his words. Ivy threw back her head. It that was the solution of
the problem, then she had a word to say in the matter.</p>

<p>She would solve the mystery, and without help. Help? What had
the solicitor meant by his words? He would take her instructions,
only. That meant that he would take no active part in the search
from the man of the photograph. Well, she needed no
assistance&mdash;no help from him!</p>

<p>But where, and how, was she to start her quest. Again she
turned to the letter and the photograph. She could discover no
help there. She turned from the room and in the hall switched on
the lights.</p>

<p>Something lay on the hall-mat. She went to it. An envelope!
She picked it up, starting down at the superscription. It was
addressed to her. She tore the envelope and pulled out a card. On
it were the words: "At the telephone&mdash;seven to-night."</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. It wanted five minutes to the hour.
Hastily, she turned and went to the library, seating herself in
the arm-chair before the desk, the telephone before her.</p>

<p>A tinge of excitement swept over her as the minute hand slowly
came to the hour. Who had dropped the envelope, containing the
card, through the letter box? Who was to speak to her on the
telephone at the hour named? Had that person anything to do with
the mystery that was surrounding her?</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece ticked gaily on. Ivy turned and
watched I the hands. She knew that the clock was exactly
right&mdash;that it had been foibles of her godfather. Every
clock in the house had to keep time to the minute.</p>

<p>Then, on the first stroke of the hour the telephone bell rang
shrilly, compellingly.</p>

<p>"Miss Breton?" A man's voice came across the wire. "Is that
Miss Ivy speaking?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl was surprised how faint her voice sounded. "I
am Miss Breton&mdash;Ivy Breton."</p>

<p>"There is no one with you in the room?" The voice was
hard.</p>

<p>"I am alone in the room." The girl answered with some
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Good!" For a moment the voice paused. "Let me say how sorry I
was to read of the death of my old friend, Basil Sixsmith."</p>

<p>"Why are you?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I?" The man at the other end of the wire laughed. "I am one
of your godfather's creditors. He owes me five thousand
pounds."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; A THIEF IN
THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some seconds Ivy could not speak. Her
godfather had died, owing money on every hand. Yet, the lawyer
had said that his debts had amounted to only about fifteen
hundred pounds, Then, when he had made that statement he had not
known of this debt.</p>

<p>Five thousand pounds&mdash;and the knowledge of it had come
to her over the telephone, from some unknown man. The girl sat
holding on to the edge of the desk, bemused. What was she to
answer? How was she to deal with this new development?</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" She hesitated. "Why come to me&mdash;Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"Does that matter?" The man at, the other end of the wire
laughed! shortly. "I'll put in my claim soon I enough. There's
five thousand golden boys owing to me and I'll collect&mdash;you
bet! Now, what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>The man's coarseness irritated the girl, For a minute she
did not answer.</p>

<p>"Nothing to say, eh? Oh, well, you'll talk fast enough when we
get down to tin-tacks. I thought I'd ring you up and let you
know. That's all."</p>

<p>"But, why me?" Ivy was amazed. "I have nothing to do with the
estate. No&mdash;Mr. Sixsmith only left me a memento. His estate
goes to Mrs. Western, his half-sister."</p>

<p>"So!" The man laughed shortly. "What did the old man leave
you, then?"</p>

<p>"The buhl box." Almost without thinking, Ivy spoke. She was
sorry immediately afterwards. Why should she give this man
information?</p>

<p>"The buhl box?" There was a meditative note in the male voice.
"Now&mdash;I wonder!"</p>

<p>Ivy replaced the receiver, in sudden indignation. She was
angry with herself that she had told the man anything. If, as he
claimed, he was a creditor of the estate it was his duty to go to
Mr. Kithner, the solicitor and executor for the estate; not to
ring her up, asking absurd, coarse questions.</p>

<p>Then, again came the thought. Why had her godfather done this
thing?</p>

<p>He had borrowed money from Mr. Patterson&mdash;and no doubt
from this | man who refused to give his name.</p>

<p>What had come over her godfather? Ostensibly a rich man he
had, for months, been living on borrowed money&mdash;borrowing in
large sums.</p>

<p>Ivy tried to remember if, during the past year&mdash;the last
year of the old man's life&mdash;her godfather had ever hinted at
financial losses. Immediately to her had come casual remarks,
small boastings, showing that Basil Sixsmith had gained, not
lost, in his speculations. What did that mean? Had he become
childish, losing his memory during those last days; pretending
that his life-long success had remained with him; forgetting the
material losses in a fantasy of dream winnings.</p>

<p>No, that would not answer her questions. Her godfather had
been hale and hearty up to the commencement of his last
illness&mdash;that had only lasted three short days. His memory
had been phenomenal; his judgment accurate. Then, why these
debts?</p>

<p>The girl had remained seated before the desk, the telephone
under her hand, as her mind raced through the past, in wild
speculation. Suddenly the bell rang. She stiffened, raising the
receiver to her ear. She spoke her name, mechanically.</p>

<p>"So you're still there." The coarse voice, slightly mocking
came over the wire. "Thought you might have rung off&mdash;while
I was thinking. S'pose the line got disconnected, somehow. These
automatic things do play tricks&mdash;Well, what have you to
say?"</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to say?"</p>

<p>"Not 'thank you' for the information that the estate you
thought to inherit is five thou, short?" The grating, laugh
sounded again. "Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you, I have not inherited Mr. Sixsmith's estate. If
you want information regarding that you must apply to Mr.
Kithner, or to Mrs. Martha Western&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S'pose I prefer to deal with you?"</p>

<p>"The matter does not interest me."</p>

<p>"Yet, the old man left you the buhl box. Willing to sell it,
eh?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be so short on the subject. Block of bonds
in it?"</p>

<p>"A letter and a photograph." Ivy bit her lips, angry with
herself for speaking to the man; giving him information.</p>

<p>"A letter and a photograph." There was silence for some
seconds. "Well, think of that! Much of a letter?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're very informative. Say, Basil got vain in his old age
and leave you his photograph? You won't get fat on that."</p>

<p>"It was not his photograph."</p>

<p>"Not his photograph?". Again silence, the man at the other end
of the wire evidently digesting the information. "Male or
female?"</p>

<p>"What interest have you in that?"</p>

<p>"All grist to the mill, old dear. So it was a male, eh?
Good-looking fellow like me?"</p>

<p>The girl did not reply; yet she did not put down the
telephone. In spite of her repulsion against the voice she
thought she might perhaps gather information.</p>

<p>"Photograph of good-looking fellow and a short letter." A hint
of laughter crept in the coarse voice. "So that's it? Find the
man?"</p>

<p>"What do you know?" Ivy gasped. The man had been too accurate
in his guess for her to conceal her surprise. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Must know who you're speaking to, eh? Well, curiosity's bad
for little girls. I'd come up and have a look at the photograph.
If I thought you'd show it to me. S'pose you won't? Oh well,
good-night."</p>

<p>She heard the click of the receiver being replaced on the
hook. For a moment she waited, then turned to the door. There she
hesitated.</p>

<p>She had betrayed her secret. Some instinct told her that the
contents of the buhl box should be kept a strict secret. But,
what could this man who had spoken to her over the telephone do?
It was ridiculous to believe, that he would break into the house
during the night to steal the contents of the buhl box.</p>

<p>She was alone in the house, except for the two servants. What
protection were they to her, and the box? They slept on the top
storey&mdash;two middle-aged women who slept soundly and were
often late for work in the morning. She slept on the lower floor.
There was no one near her, to help if&mdash;</p>

<p>She laughed. She was imagining things. Yet she returned to the
desk and picked up the buhl box, tucking it under her arm. Again
at the door, she hesitated. If she took the box with her to her
room! Would the man, if he came to the house in search of it,
come to her room, guessing that she had carried it there?</p>

<p>No. She would leave the box in the library. But there was a
way to protect its secret? She looked around the room. Was there
nothing there that could help her? Yes. She went to a cabinet and
pulled out a drawer. A brief search and she found a photograph of
a young man. She placed this photograph in the buhl box, taking
from the room the photograph of the man she was instructed to
find.</p>

<p>In her room, the door locked, she laughed again. Why should
she imagine that anyone was interested in her search? Yet, she
hid the photograph away amid layers of lingerie. It would be safe
there&mdash;with the other photograph in the buhl box.</p>

<p>THE moonlight was streaming through the open windows when Ivy
awoke suddenly. She lay still, listening, but could hear nothing.
Restless; annoyed at being awakened at that hour, she turned on
her side and snuggled under the covers again&mdash;to spring to
sudden wakefulness.</p>

<p>There was movement in the house. Cautiously raising her head
from the pillows, she listened. Yes, there was the sound again.
She slid out of' bed and went to the door, opening it but a
crack.</p>

<p>Someone was on the ground floor of the house. She opened the
door wider. Now she could distinctly hear the slow movements of
someone feeling a way cautiously around the hall. She went to the
head of the stairs and peered down. She thought she could see a
dark shadow move slowly' within the lighter shadows.</p>

<p>Running silently back to her room, she found a robe and threw
it around her. Then she returned to the head of the
stairs&mdash;and waited. She could not see anyone, now. Where had
the shadow gone? Instinctively, she answered her own question.
The man, if there was a man in the house&mdash;if she had not
been mistaken&mdash;had gone into the library.</p>

<p>She stole silently down the stairs until she stood in the
hall, peering into the shadows, listening intently.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a slight sound again: Where did it come
from? She thought, the library.</p>

<p>Careful to make no sound, she went to the library door and
waited, her hand on the handle. She thought she could hear
someone moving within the room. Still she waited.</p>

<p>For a brief moment she thought of going upstairs and awakening
the servants, but would that help her? Would not their terrors at
finding the house invaded by a burglar but add to her
perplexities? No, she decided that she would deal with the matter
herself. She could not telephone for help, for the only
instrument in the house was in the library. Perhaps, if she could
spring a surprise on the man she could baffle him, put him to
flight.</p>

<p>Bracing herself, she flung open the door and marched into the
room. Immediately she was blinded by a sudden flare of intense
light. She staggered back, her hands clasped to her eyes.
Something brushed past her, throwing her against the wall. She
heard a hard laugh and then the slamming of the street door.</p>

<p>For some moments Ivy stood just within the library, dazed and
almost blinded. What had happened? She knew now that there had
been some one in the house. She believed that she recognised the
laugh. What had the man wanted? What had he taken?</p>

<p>It was some minutes before she felt herself normal, and could
grope for the light-switch. She found it and pressed, to stand
blinking in the sudden glare. Instinctively, her eyes turned to
the desk, to the buhl box.</p>

<p>It was there, safe. She lifted it and pressed the spring.
The lid flew up, and she looked down on the photograph and the
letter.</p>

<p>But, had she left, them like that? Some instinct told her that
someone had touched them since she had left the library. She was
certain that she had placed the letter in the box first and then
dropped the photograph on it. Now the letter lay on the
photograph. Cautiously she turned the box upside-down on the
desk. With a paper-knife she turned over the photograph.</p>

<p>It was the photograph she had placed in the box&mdash;the one
that she had taken from the cabinet. The girl turned to the
desk-lamp and switched it on. She moved the photograph under the
light, careful not to touch it with her fingers. Immediately she
saw the imprint of a thumb on the glazed surface.</p>

<p>Someone had been in the house; someone had found the secret
spring that opened the lid of the buhl box. But, why was the
thumb mark almost exactly in the centre of the photograph?</p>

<p>Here was mystery. For a moment Ivy stood and considered; then
pulled out a drawer of the desk. From the drawer she took a
powerful magnifying glass and again scrutinised the photograph.
Now she came on further mystery. Against two corners of the card
on which the photograph was mounted were semi-circles, about the
size of half a threepenny piece.</p>

<p>For seconds she was puzzled; glancing about the room for help
to solve this new problem. Her eyes lit on something that
glistened bright in the lamp-light, close to the wall. She went
to it and picked it up. It was a drawing-pin. Now she
understood.</p>

<p>Someone had pinned the print to the wall while they
photographed it.</p>

<p>That was the reason for the sudden blaze of light as she
entered the library. Her hesitation and sudden blindness had been
all that the intruder had required for to make his escape. He had
wrenched the photograph from the wall and dropped it and the
letter in the buhl box, snapping down the lid; then he had swept
past her, carrying with him the camera he had used.</p>

<p>For minutes Ivy stood; leaning against the desk, laughing at
her thoughts. Her nocturnal visitor had been the man who had
telephoned her during the evening. She had been right in guessing
that he would come to the house in search of the photograph. If
she had not changed the photographs; if she had not awakened and
come down stairs; he would have copied the letter and the
photograph of the young man and escaped, undetected. And he had
copied the photograph of the wrong man!</p>

<p>What did he want a copy of the photograph for? What secret lay
behind the photograph of the man now lying amid her intimate
things in one of her drawers.</p>

<p>What did this man, who claimed that her godfather owed him
five thousand pounds, know of the mystery that was fast enclosing
her&mdash;the mystery she was coming to believe was partly of her
godfather's own making? He must know something&mdash;as she
believed Mark Kithner did&mdash;or he would not have ventured so
much for so little ostensible purpose. Who was this man pictured
in the photograph? What was the mystery surrounding him and her
godfather? Why was she instructed to find him&mdash;and for what
purpose?</p>

<p>Breathless with the thoughts that crowded her brain. Ivy
dropped into the chair before the desk, propping her chin with
her hands. She had to solve this problem. She had to safeguard
that photograph. A grim smile came on her lips. There were other
people who could take photographs. Godfather Sixsmith had been a
keen snap shooter. Somewhere in the library was a camera&mdash;a
fine powerful instrument.</p>

<p>She went to her room and carried the photograph of the young
man to the library, propping it upright on the desk against some
books. In one of the drawers of the cabinet she found the camera.
She had no magnesium flash, but she could give long time
exposures. Three times she replaced the film in the camera and
pressed the bulb, giving varying exposures. One of them must
prove right. Then, before she replaced the camera in the drawer
she photographed the fake photograph she had left in the buhl
box. The thumbprint might be valuable. The man had left it on the
print when he was pinning it against the wall. The next day she
would try and discover whose fingerprint it was. Something told
her that it would be useless to apply to the police. The man was
not an ordinary burglar; the police would only have imprints from
men who had passed through their hands. She would have to make
her own inquiry.</p>

<p>Then, she replaced the photograph and the letter in the buhl
box.</p>

<p>Again she hesitated. Should she take the buhl box to her room?
No, there was no necessity for that. The intruder had obtained
what he came to get. He had copies of the photograph, and perhaps
the letter. Again Ivy laughed. Who was the man whose photograph
the burglar had risked so much to obtain? Would the burglar
discover the original&mdash;and what would he do then?</p>

<p>Some instinct told Ivy that she had stored up trouble for the
unknown man whose photograph she had substituted in the buhl box.
The burglar, if he was the man who had telephoned her, would
strive to get on the unknown's track. He would want to find the
man&mdash;as she wanted to find man. But they would not be the
same man.</p>

<p>She turned to the door, switching out the lights and taking
with her the original photograph that had been in the buhl box.
As she opened the door it was swung suddenly back. Something soft
was pressed over her face; something overpowering filled her
lungs. She felt herself lifted and carried back into the library.
Then unconsciousness came.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; MRS. WESTERN'S
GUILE</h2>

<p class="first">IVY lay back on the couch, inert and helpless;
yet her period of unconsciousness was brief. She saw the electric
light come on, dispelling the darkness and a shadow move between
it and her eyes. She closed her eyes, hopelessly. She had no
strength to resist, no will to think or plan.</p>

<p>What was to happen to her? She hardly cared. All she wanted to
do now was to sleep, and sleep would not come&mdash;only existed
that dreadful lethargy in which she seemed to hover between the
living world and a world of dreams. She thought she was
dropping&mdash;and she did not care. Then something caught at
her, holding her suspended over space. A bright star gleamed
through her eyelids, burning into the nerves of' her eyes. It
hurt, and she flinched from, it. Gradually it drew further and
further, away, until it disappeared in inimitable
space&mdash;drawing with it her remaining powers of
consciousness.</p>

<p>How long she slept she did not know. She opened her eyes to
see the morning sun pouring in at the library windows. She
looked around her, vaguely. How did she come to be in the library
at that hour of the morning? She shivered in the cold morning
air, then looked down at herself, covered only by the thin silk
pyjamas from which the flimsy bed robe had fallen away.</p>

<p>Then she remembered, and sat up. She glanced around her,
fearfully, and sighed with relief to find herself alone. Where
had he gone to&mdash;the man who had met her at the door,
suffocating her with the drugged cloth and carrying her back into
the room? She lifted her hands to her head, then looked at them
curiously.</p>

<p>When she had gone to the door to leave the library, on the
previous evening, she had been carrying the photograph of the
"unknown." Where was it now? She stood up and shook her robe. It
was not on the lounge with her. She searched the floor. The
photograph was not in the room.</p>

<p>Then, the man had taken it! For the moment she was dazed. In
some way she must recover it. But, where was it likely to be? Who
had taken it?</p>

<p>Not the man who had rung her up on the telephone the previous
evening. Yet, he had been the burglar who had stolen into the
house and copied the fake photograph she had placed in the buhl
box. Ivy knew that he had not suspected the exchange of
photographs. He had copied the photograph and the letter and had
carried his camera from the house when she had surprised him in
the library. She had heard the front door clang as he raced into
the street.</p>

<p>That man had not lingered about the house to observe her
movements. It would have been impossible for him to have guessed
her objectives, if he had. She had brought the photograph to the
library and had copied it and the fake photograph with the door
shut.</p>

<p>Then, someone else was interested in the photograph of the
"unknown." Who could that be? She had a dim remembrance that the
man who had caught her in his arms and chloroformed her when she
opened the door, was tall and well-built. She thought she
remembered a head, covered with a mop of rebellious curly brown
hair, bending over her. But&mdash;</p>

<p>The man of the photograph&mdash;the "unknown"&mdash;had brown
curly hair so Mark Kithner had deduced: But&mdash;Ivy gasped. Was
her assailant of the previous night the very man she had been
instructed to discover? Then, he had taken away with been his own
photograph!</p>

<p>Ivy laughed, until she lay back on the couch exhausted to
broken giggles. How absurd the thought was. Her godfather had
ordered her to discover a man who did not want to be discovered;
a man who was prepared to break the law to prevent her tracing
him! What could be the reason behind his conduct? More, for what
reason had Basil Sixsmith laid his commands on her to track down
a man who preferred to remain unknown?</p>

<p>Again the girl laughed. The man had obtained the photograph
her godfather had placed in the box; but he did not know that,
but a few minutes before she had copied it. Ivy rose to her feet
and glanced around the room, searchingly. Where was the camera?
She remembered, she had placed it in the cabinet. Was it there
still? She moved to cross the room, swaying dizzily and holding
on to the furniture.</p>

<p>At length, she recovered her sense of balance. She reached the
cabinet and found the camera where she had left it. She carried
it back to the couch and removed the spool of films. Later in the
morning she would take it into town and have it developed and the
photographs printed. Then she would have again the pictured
features of the man she had been ordered to find&mdash;the
"unknown."</p>

<p>She glanced at the clock. It wanted a few minutes to half-past
seven. Then, she had been unconscious for many hours. She stood
up and commenced a careful search of the room. Had either of the
intruders taken anything but the photograph?' So far as she could
see nothing else was missing. But, she had not looked in the buhl
box! She went to the box and touched the spring. The lid fell
back. Neither photograph nor letter was in it!</p>

<p>For many seconds Ivy stood and gazed at the empty box. Why had
the man taken the photograph she had placed there? Why had he
taken the letter? The lawyer had told her and she believed that
the letter held nothing of consequence&mdash;that Basil Sixsmith
had not included in the few lines an anagram or cipher.</p>

<p>A movement outside the library door brought the girl to a
sense of time. She went to the door and listened. A heavy, stolid
tread passed along the hall. Ivy knew that was Alice, the cook,
going to her kitchen She opened the door and peered out. Faith,
the housemaid, was not in sight. Probably she was in the
kitchens, joining Alice in an early morning cup of tea.</p>

<p>She crept through the hall and fled up the stairs to her own
room. Only when she closed the door did she realise that she had
brought the buhl box with her. What did that matter, now? The box
was empty. She placed it on the bedside table and crept under the
covers. Before she could take any action she must wait for Faith
to call her, when she brought the morning tea-tray. If the woman
found her up and dressed she would be suspicious&mdash;and for
the present Ivy could not afford to have suspicions around
her.</p>

<p>The intervening twenty minutes passed slowly. At length, the
maid came. Ivy wriggled impatiently while the woman fussed around
the room. At last she was alone. She seized the few letters lying
on the tray and tore them open; to fling them to the ground.
There was nothing of consequence in them.</p>

<p>What was she to do? True, she had the roll of films and on
one of the negatives appeared the thumbprint of the man who had
invaded the house the previous evening. But what could she do
with that? Could she plan to take the fingerprints of all the men
she came across? That would he an impossible task.</p>

<p>Again she was back at the point where she had been stopped the
previous day. No; she was in a worse position. Then she had the
photograph of the "unknown" and her godfather's letter. Now both
letters and photograph were missing&mdash;but; she had the roll
of films containing a copy of the photographs. How and where was she to start her quest for these men?</p>

<p>She slipped from the bed and went into the bathroom, still
conning her problem. As she slipped on her bathrobe again, Faith
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western on the telephone, Miss Ivy." Faith spoke from
the passage.</p>

<p>Martha Western! Ivy gasped. What did she want? Fastening her
gown the girl ran down the stairs to the library&mdash;to the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Ivy Breton speaking, Mrs. Western." She spoke into the
instrument curtly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ivy, dear." The voice was gushing; "How are you, this
morning, and after your very terrible strain, yesterday? You
don't know how I felt for you. It was all so sad and solemn, I
know how fond you were of dear Basil&mdash;and to lose him like
that! After so short an illness, too! Charlie spoke of coming
round to see you this morning, but I would not let him. I said
you must rest, have a good long rest before you saw anyone; Faith
will look after you well. I'm sure, she thinks there is no one in
the world like you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want, Mrs. Western?" The girl spoke
impatiently. "I am just out of my bath and would like to get some
clothes on before I indulge in gossip."</p>

<p>"Oh, how inconsiderate of me." The widow giggled. "But you
will forgive me, I'm sure. I rang you up to tell you of a most
beautiful plan I have thought of. I'm sure you will like it. It's
too delightful&mdash;for me, that is, of course&mdash;but I'm
sure you will approve. It must be awful for you to think of
living alone in that dreary place all these&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Ivy had a premonition of what the lady had in mind.</p>

<p>"Yes. I told Charlie of my plan when I woke this morning. I
sent for him to come to my room. My dear, you should have seen
him, with his tousled head and unshaven chin&mdash;and he looked
such a boy&mdash;such a charming, dear boy. I really wanted to
cuddle him like I used to when he was a baby."</p>

<p>"And your plan, Mrs. Western?" Ivy suppressed a desire to yawn
loudly.</p>

<p>"It's so simple, my dear. Just that you should pack up and
come and stay with us." Mrs. Western made a pause, as if from the
effort of speaking so directly; then continued vivaciously. "It
will be lovely to have you&mdash;just you and I to
ourselves&mdash;all day long. Of course, Charlie will only be at
home in the evenings, you know. The poor boy has to work. I
always say it does young men good to work."</p>

<p>"But what of this house, Mrs. Western?" The girl asked
innocently. "God-dad wanted me to live in it for three months.
You remember his will?"</p>

<p>"Such a silly will, wasn't it, dear? Of course, one shouldn't
speak ill of the dead, but it was silly. To think of a dear child
like you being left in those gloomy barracks tor three months! If Basil had only spoken to me! Of course, I would have offered you
a home&mdash;not for three months, dear child, but for ever and
ever."</p>

<p>"But I must carry out god-dad's last wishes." The girl was
laughing at Martha Western's assumption of ingenuousness. "He
particularly wished me to stay here for three months."</p>

<p>"How thrilling!" There was a little trill of anger in the
laughter that came over the wire. "But, dear, you can do what he
wished you to do from here. We are quite close to the
house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And this house, Mrs. Western?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that&mdash;of course that can be sold." The lady spoke as
if the thought had only just dawned on her mind. "Charlie will
look to that. He is such a good business man! I don't know what I
should do without him&mdash;and he says that house-property is
booming now; of course you will be much more comfortable
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And with this house sold you can pay god-dad's debts!" The
girl spoke ironically.</p>

<p>"How clever of you!" Now the anger was showing in the widow's
voice. "I shall be glad to do that! My solicitor told me that I
could defer payment until I took possession and sold the place,
but I don't like to do that. It would be such a slur on my dear
brother's name. Of course, I shall pay at once&mdash;I would do
that in any case. It's only a matter of a few
pounds&mdash;fifteen hundred, I believe, that dear Mr. Kithner
said."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find that the debts amount to more than
that, Mrs. Western." The girl interrupted. "I had a telephone
message from a man last night who claimed that god-dad owed him
five thousand."</p>

<p>"What?" There was almost agony in the exclamation. "What do
you mean, girl? The house and contents are not worth more than
three thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner valued them at between five and six thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;five thousand pounds! Oh, that's impossible!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find it very possible. But I really know
nothing about the matter. When the&mdash;gentleman spoke to me I
advised him to communicate with you or Mr. Kithner."</p>

<p>Ivy listened for some seconds, but there was no reply. She
laughed. Her news had greatly disturbed her godfather's
half-sister. At the thought of the offer of a home, she laughed
again. What sort of a home would Mrs. Western: provide for her,
once she got her out of the house?</p>

<p>In the hall Faith met her, carrying a flat parcel.</p>

<p>"A man left this at the door just now, Miss Ivy."</p>

<p>Some instinct told Ivy what she would find under the wrapping
paper. In her room she undid the parcel, and found in her hand
two photographs&mdash;one the "unknown," and the other the print
containing the thumb-mark.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; "LORNE,
FLORISTS"</h2>

<p class="first">WHO had sent the photographs back to her? She
scanned them eagerly, and searched the wrappings. There was not a
mark to identity the sender. Yet she carefully folded the brown
paper, and stowed it away.</p>

<p>She placed the two photographs on the dressing-table, scanning
them closely. Really, the two men were not very dissimilar; yet
she had picked the second photograph at hazard. One of the
photographs pictured curly hair&mdash;that was the "unknown;" the
other&mdash;well, his hair could not be called absolutely
straight. He looked "nice"&mdash;his hair looked nice&mdash;hair
that a nice girl would care to crumple and pull. She glanced from
one to the other of the photographs. A pair of nice boys, she
decided.</p>

<p>Two brothers! No, they were not enough alike for that. Then
she glanced at the clock. How she was dawdling this morning! She
turned the photograph face downwards, firmly. She would not look
at them again until&mdash;</p>

<p>Something had been marked on the back of one of the
photographs. She bent to examine it more closely. Yes, there was
a series of figures indented there, made with a fine,
round-pointed instrument. For a minute she puzzled to decipher
them; then read: "Ring B42675."</p>

<p>Who had placed that number on the back of the photograph?
Ivy stood before her dressing-table, staring down at the card,
very much perplexed. What did those figures mean?</p>

<p>Did they represent a telephone number? That was probable.
B42675. Somehow the number seemed familiar to her. In what
connection? Finishing her dressing in haste, she went down to the
library and opened the telephone book. Silly! It was useless to
search there for the number. The numbers in the telephone book
were attached to an alphabetical list of subscribers.</p>

<p>She rang "Information," to be told they could not help her.
Why could they not tell her? Ivy was angry. She dialled
"Information" again, and a supercilious female voice advised her
to ring up the number and ask who rented the instrument.</p>

<p>Somehow the suggestion did not appeal to the girl. She glanced
at the clock. 'B' was a city exchange, and the time was a little
after half past eight in the morning. Presently she heard the
connecting click as the receiver at the other end of the line was
lifted from the hook.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Breton."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you know?" Ivy muttered in surprise.</p>

<p>"Of course. I expected you to ring me immediately you found
the telephone number on the back of the photograph."</p>

<p>"Then you are the man who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who assaulted you last night? Now, why accuse me of that?
Should I leave clues behind me if I were a burglar?"</p>

<p>"The authorities appear reluctant to connect telephone numbers
with persons." The girl spoke crossly.</p>

<p>"They object to giving information to private persons. The
information you asked from the exchange a few minutes ago would
have been furnished to the police immediately."</p>

<p>"Yet my question was an innocent one. But how do you
know?"</p>

<p>"I suspected. Now you confirm my suspicions." The man laughed
intriguingly. "You might as well ask me if I have curly brown
hair."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I only thought that! You can't read my thoughts!"
The girl was deeply puzzled. "Why&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must forgive me, Miss Breton." A hint of mockery lay in
the pleasant voice. "I am only trying to impress you with a sense
of my ability as an investigator."</p>

<p>"A detective?"</p>

<p>"Some people very wrongly call them that." The man spoke
sadly. "It is quite a mistake. Investigators investigate, but
rarely detect; detectives try to detect, but invariably
investigate wrongly."</p>

<p>"Then you are only an investigator?" The girl gurgled
deliciously.</p>

<p>"As you say, only an investigator."</p>

<p>"And you propose to investigate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I, say you will you be offended? More, will
you think me conceited&mdash;to imagine that I believe I can
investigate that most unfathomable mystery, woman?
Yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You suggest investigating me?" Ivy spoke when the man paused,
apparently in some confusion.</p>

<p>"Would you object?" His voice was now more confident.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I do not like strangers interfering in my
affairs."</p>

<p>"Am I a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Well, at present you are only a telephone number,
B42675."</p>

<p>"And in the telephone directory you will find, that number
attached to a name&mdash;a common name&mdash;Jack Lorne."</p>

<p>"John Lorne, investigator?"</p>

<p>"Not even that. The 'investigator' is a secret&mdash;not for
the knowledge of all and sundry who use the telephone directory.
The 'John' has long since been absorbed in the more plebeian
'Jack' by my friends."</p>

<p>"Then, John Lorne, secret investigator&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me again. Investigator of secrets."</p>

<p>"&mdash;will you please tell me who came to my house last
night and copied the photograph of the young man contained in the
buhl box? Will you also inform me who chloroformed me and carried
me to the couch in the library."</p>

<p>"Two separate people, please. My sins alone overwhelm me."</p>

<p>"&mdash;and then took the letter and the photograph from the
buhl box, and the photograph I was carrying."</p>

<p>"Is that a commission, Miss Breton?"</p>

<p>"I shall require to know your charges, first."</p>

<p>"Certainly. You will find them most reasonable. I will call on
you in the course of the morning."</p>

<p>"Is that necessary?"</p>

<p>"An investigator&mdash;like a detective&mdash;prefers to get
his information first hand."</p>

<p>"Even a secret investigator?"</p>

<p>"More so." The man paused, and then continued: "There is the
matter of the identity of the man whose photograph was in the
buhl box. I think I should be instructed to investigate
that."</p>

<p>Ivy thought quickly. Was that the reason for the telephone
conversation. The man who had telephoned her the previous evening
had been most curious regarding the original of the photograph.
The burglar copied the photograph. Someone had taken the
photograph from the house. Now this man&mdash;</p>

<p>Dare she miss this chance of obtaining the information her
godfather had charged her to secure? She was to find the young
man whose photograph he had left for her in the buhl box. For
what reason, she asked herself again? To ask him what her
godfather had done with the money his relations and friends
credited him with possessing? That might be right. Certainly, it
was the only thing she could suggest for the moment. Every hour
plunged her deeper into the mystery that had commenced with the
reading of her godfather's will.</p>

<p>His loss had been her first sorrow. Life with him had been
happy and serene, until his illness. Then had come his death. He
had passed from her peacefully, conscious to the last. He had not
feared death, nor had she while she sat with his hand in hers
waiting for the inevitable end.</p>

<p>Immediately had followed sordid greed and intrigue. She had
listened to the rapacious avarice of his relatives, who cared not
even to make a pretence of grief&mdash;who appeared to care only
to learn what he had left, and to whom he had left it. Greed had
been followed by trickery, and even violence. Had her godfather
known what would follow when he drafted his last will; a will
that hid from everyone the knowledge of what he had to leave
behind; secured, she believed now by the mystery surrounding the
buhl box?</p>

<p>She had to believe that. He had created a mystery and a
trust&mdash;a trust concealed behind the mystery, believing that
she loved him and honoured his wishes sufficiently well to work
on until she had read his meaning.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Breton?" The cool, pleasant voice spoke across the
wire.</p>

<p>"I am sorry!" The girl was contrite. "I was thinking."</p>

<p>"I stand reproved."</p>

<p>"You may investigate, if you like&mdash;and if Mr. Kithner
approves. You must ask him first. If you want to see me, I will
see you, but there is so little that I can tell; explain so
little. All I know is that I am instructed to find the original
of the photograph."</p>

<p>"The photograph of the young man you found in the buhl
box?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know." The girl shrugged. "Just that! I'm to be
allowed to live in this house for three months, rent-free. Mr.
Kithner has a sum of money to pay me and the house expenses
during that time. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless you find this young man?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, even if I do." The girl laughed slightly.
"Oh, it is all so impossible! Even it I find him I have no
instructions to act on."</p>

<p>"&mdash;but to inform him of your godfather's death, and to
tell him of the legacy left to you?"</p>

<p>"What if I <i>do</i> find him, and tell him what you suggest?
He may answer, 'I'm sorry; but what has that to do with me?' What
am I to say, then?"</p>

<p>"You will have fulfilled your charge." For a second he paused.
"Then I am to act for you?"</p>

<p>"No, for yourself, if you choose to act." Ivy spoke
impulsively. "Mr. Lorne, I am sorry. I don't know you. I am
surrounded by people who think&mdash;who seem to have no other
idea than to fight for the little money god-dad left behind him.
There is nothing but greed, selfishness. Oh, I cannot call it
anything else but evil about me. I can't trust anyone. I&mdash;I
must act alone."</p>

<p>She replaced the receiver on its hook suddenly, and went out
of the room. Yes, she must act&mdash;act quickly&mdash;and
alone.</p>

<p>Some new power stiffened her. Her lethargy, partly induced by
the drugging of the previous night, left her. Fires of resolution
ran in her veins. She must act&mdash;and decisively.</p>

<p>First, she must search out this man who had spoken to her this
morning. She liked his voice. It was pleasant, even, containing
a spice of humour that appealed to her. She guessed him to be
honourable, if somewhat careless.</p>

<p>An investigator! She smiled quietly. A detective? No, he had
disclaimed that title. In that he had been wise. Ivy had learned
through her godfather's reading to picture detectives as men who
wore hard hats, cocked on one side; men with full, fleshy faces
and ruddy complexions; carrying always large, evil-smelling
cigars that swished continually from corner to corner of their
full-lipped mouths; believing evil of everybody, continually
striving to entrap the young and innocent; looking for sin
everywhere.</p>

<p>She went to her room and dressed quickly for the street. With
the roll of films in her bag she went down to the city arranged
to have them developed and printed at once. She had the original
photograph again, but it was large and awkward to carry with her.
The film pictures would be small, easily carried and
concealed.</p>

<p>She had now to discover where John Lorne lived. With a little
laugh she went to the post office. Why had she not consulted the
telephone directory at home? A moment's search, and she found the
name and address: "John Lorne, 37 Masters Street."</p>

<p>That was not far from the post office. Masters Street led from
Macquarie Street, In one of the best quarters of the city. A
narrow street, very quiet, lined with tall buildings, mostly
offices and flats. The street contained a few shops, very
high-class and exclusive. Ivy knew of a milliner in Masters
Street; of a modiste, a beauty parlour; and a florist. Lorne, the
florist! Now she remembered why the telephone number had been so
familiar to her. John Lorne, florist! She laughed, delightedly.
John Lorne, investigator!</p>

<p>"Lorne, florists," had a history. The business had been
founded by two brothers, university students. Their parents had
died suddenly, leaving them almost entirely unprovided-for; their
education half-completed. Jack Lorne, the elder brother, had
settled his parents' estates, and found himself with but a few
hundred pounds in hand. Determined to, at least, complete his
younger brother's education, he had invested the whole of their
capital in a florist's shop, choosing the exclusive Masters
Street for his venture.</p>

<p>The newspapers, as well as his friends, had laughed at "John
Lorne, florists." The writers had derisively asked what a
university student knew about flowers, especially when that
university student had been chosen to represent his State&mdash;a
potential All-Australia player. John Lorne had ignored the
laughter, and proceeded serenely on his way. His brother had
joined him in the intervals between his studies. The boys had
proved themselves good business men. The newspapers had given
them a good deal of free advertisement, and they soon built up a
good <i>clientèle</i>. Paul Lorne had continued at the
University, and within a very short time John Lorne had found
means to divide his time between the shop and his interrupted
studies.</p>

<p>Ivy had much to think over while she walked from the
post office to the corner of Masters Street. So "Lorne, florists"
had, for her benefit, named himself "investigator?"</p>

<p>Well, she also could investigate; she would investigate
"Lorne, florists." She had often been in the shop, but she could
not remember having left her name there. True, she had sometimes
ordered flowers to be sent to her home, but the order had always
been given in the name of her godfather, Basil Sixsmith. She
remembered that one of the attendants had once called her "Miss
Sixsmith." Had she met "Lorne, florists" on one of her visits to
the shop? She had an idea that she had seen him.</p>

<p>In the shop were several girl attendants. A girl had always
served her. Yet, she had a dim recollection of a tall young man,
broad of shoulder, with a clean-cut, "nice" face, crowned with a
mop of wavy, brown hair, somewhere in the background.</p>

<p>Ivy walked slowly past "Lorne, florists," glancing idly into
the shop, The place was a mass of gorgeous blossoms, showing a
bewildering mass of colours. A few customers were lounging in the
wide, comfortable chairs that made the shop so popular with
society people. A few girls, dainty and well-dressed, moved about
the place, arranging, re-arranging, attending to the leisurely
customers. There was no hurry and bustle. The place had the air
of utter peace, yet the girl could see that behind the indolent,
careless air was a keen, business brain&mdash;making indolence
pay.</p>

<p>Next to "Lorne, florists" was a teashop, very exclusive and
hidden behind well-draped windows and doors. Ivy paused,
irresolutely, then entered. She found a vacant table and sat down
to consider her next step. She had found the man of the
telephone. Now she wanted time to consider how she was to deal
with him. She knew that it was to gain time that she had entered
the tea-shop. She laughed quietly. She had found her Investigator
in a bower of flowers! How was she to treat him? How could she
question him to make him reveal what knowledge he had of the
mystery surrounding her?</p>

<p>It would be useless to ask him direct questions. If she went
to him, in more probability, he would question her. He would draw
from her what she knew. No, it was useless to expect to make
him speak by direct questioning. She must find some way to
surprise his secret. She must trap him; get him at some
disadvantage.</p>

<p>Already she had one advantage over him. She knew him for
"Lorne, florists," not "Lorne, investigator." The girl mused
quietly as she sipped her tea. So "Lorne, florists" had
challenged a woman to a duel of wits.</p>

<p>Slowly a plan formed in her mind. Could she carry it through?
Could she put it into execution immediately? She looked down at
her clothes. They would do. She finished her tea, and went to the
door. In the street again she made direct for "Lorne, florists."
One of the attendants came to her. "If you please, Madame?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Lorne in, please?" Ivy tried to speak casually.</p>

<p>"In the office." The girl pointed to the rear of the shop.
Through a glass partition, Ivy could see a shock of wavy brown
hair, crowning a head bent over a desk. She went to the glass
door and knocked.</p>

<p>The man looked up. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorne?" In answer to his quick nod, she continued: "Mr.
Lorne, have you a position I can fill. I know and love
flowers!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash;
RECOGNITION</h2>

<p class="first">IVY had not spoken as she had planned to speak
before she entered the shop. The words had come impulsively, and,
somehow, she knew that they had awakened a response in the man
before her. She looked at the man&mdash;John Lorne, investigator,
now revealed as "John Lorne, florists." The mop of wavy, brown
hair overhung a broad low forehead, from under which looked up at
her a pair of deep, brown, twinkling eyes. His chin was firm and
well-moulded; his cheeks thin, but his skin sparkled with health,
and was well-tanned.</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>She believed his answer to be as involuntary as her own
speech. He hesitated a moment. "Sit down, Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;France" Ivy answered, after a short pause, "Surely
'France' was true&mdash;by name she was a 'Breton'."</p>

<p>"Good, Miss France." Lorne swung his chair to face the girl.
"Any experience in florists' work."</p>

<p>"None." Ivy's hopes sank.</p>

<p>"Better still." A wide smile came on the "nice" lips. "You
know, I have a horror of 'experienced' people. Not one of my
staff is 'experienced'. I suppose if one of them applied for a
job elsewhere she might claim to be 'experienced' now&mdash;but
I'd disown her if I heard she had."</p>

<p>Ivy laughed. "I will bear that in mind, Mr. Lorne." For the
moment the man sat and looked at her. Ivy thought that the brown
eyes that had appeared so engaging, humorous and careless when
she entered the office were searching down into her soul. She
tried to bear the inspection without showing that she was aware
of it, but stiffened slightly.</p>

<p>"Miss France, will you please go to the window, and bring me
three tea-rose buds. They must match well. Don't wire them. I
want them to be natural."</p>

<p>Without a word&mdash;without showing surprise&mdash;Ivy
obeyed. The attendants looked at her curiously as she crossed the
shop. Striving to appear entirely unconcerned, she returned to
the office and handed the bulbs to the man she hoped would prove
to be her employer within the next few minutes.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Miss France." Lorne took the buds, glanced at them
carelessly, before placing them on his desk. He waited a few
seconds, then rose and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Miss France, you are engaged. To-morrow morning at nine,
sharp. The usual salary and conditions of the trade. I hope you
will be comfortable with us." He turned again to his desk, as if
about to seat himself, then picked up the three buds. "By the
way, Miss France&mdash;may I ask your acceptance of these three
roses."</p>

<p>Ivy took the flowers with a little graceful nod, and pinned
them on her dress. She went to the door, and hesitated, Lorne
looked up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lorne, why did you send me for these flowers?"</p>

<p>The man laughed quietly. "I wanted to see how you would behave
in the shop&mdash;in unexpected circumstances. It was the best
test I could devise at the moment. You were natural&mdash;that
was the great thing. I want my people to be natural, whoever is
in the shop&mdash;and, really, we have some very overpowering
people here at times. Keep natural. Don't be subservient to
anyone. You will be employed here, but you are a woman, and, I
think, a lady. I think it is in you to be nice to everyone, even
to some of the 'ladies' who come here and treat my people as it
they were something too low to deserve consideration. Then,
again&mdash;" He paused, "You didn't want to chop and torture
those flowers when I gave them to you. Oh, don't think I'm too
proud not to change my mind, if I think fit," he added, noting
her expression of surprise. "To me, flowers are almost human.
Anyway, they have a right to be treated decently. If you had
wired them, or twisted their stems, I'd probably have
reconsidered your engagement. Good-bye, Miss France. Nine, sharp,
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>His nod was a dismissal. In the street again, Ivy tried to
collect her thoughts. She laughed to herself. She was a shop-girl
now; engaged at "Lorne, florists."</p>

<p>What made her apply for the position? What hidden sense had
made her take it when she stood in the glass-framed office, and
heard the man speak her appointment? Had she acted rightly?</p>

<p>She realised that she had considerably curtailed her personal
liberty&mdash;her ability to follow up any clue that promised to
lead to the discovery of the unknown man. Now she would have to
attend at "Lorne, florists," or she might find awkward questions
asked. If she did not go to work the next morning, she would
never dare enter "Lorne, florists" again. She would not even dare
to walk down Masters Street. And Jack Lorne, investigator, wanted
to come to her house to question her, to investigate the mystery
that enveloped her and the buhl box.</p>

<p>Jack Lorne, investigator! How was she to reconcile "Lorne,
investigator" with "Lorne, florists?" Here was a question she
could only answer when she had been an employee of "Lorne,
florists" for some days, if even then. As his employee, she would
be able to study the man; discover whether his telephone
conversation with her that morning had been only idle curiosity,
or carried some hidden meaning, unfathomable at the moment.</p>

<p>Now Ivy knew that she must plan and act quickly, the
investigator would go to her home&mdash;to be told that she was
not "at home." But she could not be "not at home" every time he
called&mdash;and she had promised to see him. In some way she had
to meet the contingency. If she could have a double&mdash;someone
to sit quietly at home and interview callers, while she sought to
probe "Lorne, investigator's" secrets as an employee of "Lorne,
florists."</p>

<p>A double would free her from much embarrassment. In Macquarie
Street she hailed a cruising taxi, and ordered the man to carry
her to the lawyer's office. In the car she debated her movements.
Should she tell Mark Kithner what she had so impulsively
done?</p>

<p>Should she tell him of "Lorne, investigator's" telephone
conversation that morning? She had rather more than a suspicion
that Mark Kithner knew more of the mystery surrounding her and
the buhl box than he was willing for her to suspect. Was he, too,
pulling some strings in this problem that was a mystery; perhaps
at the dictates of her godfather? That was possible; she believed
very probable. In that case, if she allowed him to know her moves
towards a solution of the problem, would he aid or hinder
her?</p>

<p>The taxi drew up at the curb before the building in which
Kithner, Wales &amp; Kithner had their offices. Ivy went up in
the elevator. In the outer office she suddenly decided her course
of action.</p>

<p>She would tell Mark Kithner "everything"&mdash;up to her
discovery that "Lorne, investigator" was "Lorne, florists," and
her engagement as shop-girl by the latter. That she would keep
secret until she knew exactly where her inquiries were leading
her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner will see you now, Miss Breton." A girl stood at
the door of the waiting room.</p>

<p>"Will you come this way, please?"</p>

<p>"Well, m'dear?" The old lawyer met Ivy at the door of his
office. "What's the news? Brought the original of the photograph
to introduce to me?"</p>

<p>"I thought I might find him here, Mr. Kithner." Ivy had the
ability to appear very guileless.</p>

<p>"Here?" Kithner shrugged. "I'm afraid we don't keep mysteries
in stock."</p>

<p>"Not the solution of mysteries?"</p>

<p>"This is a legal firm, m'dear." The solicitor raised his brows
slightly, "We lawyers don't solve mysteries."</p>

<p>"Create mysteries from problems?" The girl smiled. "For that
there are judges, juries, and lawyers."</p>

<p>Again Kithner shrugged. "Without the courts the world would
contain very few unexplainable problems, or mysteries. Now,
m'dear, what's your particular problem, to-day?"</p>

<p>"A development of the buhl box mystery," said Ivy.</p>

<p>In a few terse words she told the lawyer of the happenings of
the past night, including the return of the photographs and the
discovery of the telephone number on the back of the photograph
that she had found, originally in the buhl box.</p>

<p>"Humph!" The lawyer frowned. "That number wasn't on the
photograph when I left your home last night, I scrutinised that
photograph, back and front. There wasn't a mark on, it. Who owns
that telephone number?"</p>

<p>"Lorne, florists." Ivy replied quietly.</p>

<p>"Lorne? Jack Lorne?"</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"His father was a client of this firm. I settled his estate
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;advised his son to establish an exclusive florist's
shop?"</p>

<p>"No." Kithner laughed. He appeared somewhat embarrassed.
"Opposed the idea. Told him he would lose what remained of his
inheritance."</p>

<p>"And he didn't?"</p>

<p>The solicitor shrugged. "He's making a couple of thousand a
year, at least, out of it."</p>

<p>"And you told me to come to you for advice!" Ivy could not
resist the thrust.</p>

<p>"<i>Touché</i>!" Kithner laughed. "So it was Jack Lorne who
telephoned you this morning?"</p>

<p>"I telephoned him, please," Ivy corrected.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do now?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know." The girl hesitated. "I know that Mr. Lorne is
interested in the mystery my godfather left me to solve. I know
also that you are interested, Mr. Kithner, more than you wish me
to see." The girl spoke daringly. "How and why, in both cases, I
have yet to discover."</p>

<p>"Yet?" The solicitor elevated his heavy eyebrows. "Then, for
the time I am under suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Yet you come to me for advice?"</p>

<p>"Advice I may not take. For help&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And that help is&mdash;"</p>

<p>A knock came at the door, and the girl who had shown Ivy into
the lawyer's private office entered. She handed the old man a
card.</p>

<p>"Tell him to wait, Miss Varney, please."</p>

<p>When the door had closed on the girl, Ivy spoke quickly. "Who
is Miss Varney, Mr. Kithner?"</p>

<p>"My secretary."</p>

<p>"She does not look very well. She looks
drawn&mdash;nervous."</p>

<p>"That's what I tell her." The lawyer moved uneasily. "I've
tried to make her take a holiday, but she won't."</p>

<p>"Is she interested in her work?"</p>

<p>"Interested? I've never had a girl to work with me like her
before. She's as good a lawyer as there is in the city. Knows
everything that is going on. I can walk away any time, and when I
come back my work is all in apple-pie order, and
progressing."</p>

<p>"Clever! Interested in her work!" Ivy was watching the lawyer
covertly. "Like you, Mr. Kithner, interested in the
demystification of problems legal?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" A twinkle came in the old, keen eyes. "You can put it
like that if you please, m'dear."</p>

<p>"Lend her to me, Mr. Kithner, please."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>The girl touched the bell on the desk. When Miss Varney
entered she stood up. "You rang, Mr. Kithner?"</p>

<p>"No, I rang, Miss Varney." Ivy went to the girl, and, by her
side, turned to face the lawyer. "Mr. Kithner!" The girl was
almost excited. "Look at us both. Tell me; how much are we
alike?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" The old lawyer considered the girls gravely. "Same
height, within a fraction of an inch. Same build&mdash;about.
Same colouring&mdash;yes. Features different, though."</p>

<p>"Much different?"</p>

<p>"Enough to destroy any likeness?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Yet a general description would apply to you both," Kithner
concluded. "I think so, too." Ivy turned to the girl by her side.
"Miss Varney, I am in trouble. Oh, how silly of me! You don't
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner was explaining your problems to me this morning,
Miss Breton," Mary Varney answered quietly.</p>

<p>"Then you know! Good!" Ivy laughed delightedly. "I'm sure
you're intrigued."</p>

<p>Mary nodded. "Now I want to borrow you from Mr. Kithner for a
few weeks. Will you come to me?" For almost a minute Mary Varney
considered the girl beside her. A sudden light came in her rather
dull eyes, and she smiled.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Kithner can spare me," she replied slowly. "But there
is so much work on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare you!" The old lawyer spoke emphatically, leaning
forward on his desk, glaring at the girl. "Haven't I tried to
spare you almost daily for the past three months? Haven't I
almost gone down on my knees to you, imploring you to take a
holiday?"</p>

<p>"But this is work, Mr. Kithner&mdash;not a holiday."</p>

<p>"Work or holiday," the old man shouted, "you go out of that
door with Ivy Breton, and if I see you enter it again until she
says you may I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, where's&mdash;" Mary started to protest, yet there was
almost a lightening of her manner. "Perhaps in a fortnight
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Kithner." Ivy slipped her arm around Mary's
waist, turning her to the door. "I'll keep you advised of Miss
Varney's health."</p>

<p>The solicitor nodded.</p>

<p>In the outer office Mary turned to Ivy.</p>

<p>"But, Miss Breton, I can't leave Mr. Kithner's papers in
confusion. I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should hate to oppose Mr. Kithner," Ivy spoke demurely. "If
he got really cross&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary laughed. "He's a dear old man. His bark is far worse than
his bite."</p>

<p>"And my bite is far worse than my bark." Ivy laughed. "How
long before you can leave here?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Ivy." The girl laughed embarrassedly. "You don't
know the work there is on my desk."</p>

<p>"Come and show me." Ivy followed her companion to her room, to
stare down on a desk piled with papers and files.</p>

<p>"What junk!" She spoke with the contempt of the untrained
business woman. "Put it all away in a drawer, and forget it!"</p>

<p>"Forget it!" Mary stared at the girl in horror. "Why, there's
those affidavits of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Varney."</p>

<p>The girl turned quickly. In the doorway stood a young
man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner sent me to you. He tells me you are going on
holiday and that I am to take over your work."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Mitchell. When Miss Breton leaves I will go
through a few matters with you."</p>

<p>The young man hesitated, at a quick glance from Ivy.</p>

<p>"Your hat's here, Mary," Ivy's quick eyes found what she
sought, "Put it on, please."</p>

<p>"Your gloves and bag? Suppose they're in one of those drawers
of your desk. Make haste, dear. We've got piles to do before the
shops shut."</p>

<p>Ivy's impetuosity swept the girl off her feet. A nod at the
clerk, and he took possession of the secretary's chair; a little
deft manipulation, and she had Mary at the door, hatted and
gloved, with her few personal belongings in her bag.</p>

<p>"GOOD-BYE, Mr. Mitchell." Ivy spoke airily. "I'll give you
ample warning when Miss Varney proposes to return&mdash;or I let
her do so."</p>

<p>She took the ex-secretary's arm and swept her through the
general offices. She stopped abruptly, staring at a man who had
just entered through the corridor door. A moment, and she
recovered: to pull her companion into the corridor.</p>

<p>"Mary," she exclaimed, when the door was shut behind them.
"Who was the man who came in as we were out?"</p>

<p>"Why?" The girl looked astonished. "That was only Mr. Richard
Kithner&mdash;Mr. Kithner's son."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; RICHARD
KITHNER INTERVENES</h2>

<p class="first">FOR the first time in her life attending any
organised appointment, Ivy found work as a shop-girl in "Lorne,
florists" strange and wearisome. She had arrived at the shop
punctually at nine o'clock, to find Jack Lorne there, very busy.
The morning hours were full of work, though customers were
few.</p>

<p>Then came the mid-day interval. As Ivy walked down Masters
Street, towards the centre of the city, she thought ruefully that
the time in the shop had been wasted. She had found very few
opportunities to come in contact with her employer, and when
chance or business brought them together, he had been brusque and
impersonal.</p>

<p>The previous afternoon, after they had left the solicitor's
offices, Ivy had swept her companion in a bewildering rush
through the city and its shops. For two delirious hours they had
shopped and bought&mdash;in the feminine mind two very distinct
processes.</p>

<p>Then, as the taxi carried them swiftly to the Sixsmith house
the younger girl had glanced covertly at her companion. Already
Mary was showing relief from the strain of her work. Her eyes
were brighter, and a tinge of colour had mounted under the skin
of her cheeks. Her bearing had altered: now she stepped more
carefree and independent.</p>

<p>They had stayed up late the previous night&mdash;Ivy
recounting the various happenings in that house since Mark
Kithner had read her godfather's will. Mary was keenly
Interested, asking innumerable questions; Particularly she was
interested in the identity of the burglar of the previous night.
She expressed herself certain that Jack Lorne had not been the
man who had assailed and chloroformed Ivy; yet she could not even
guess at his very evident interest in Basil Sixsmith's will, and
the buhl box.</p>

<p>"Hullo, dear!" Mary came on Ivy unexpectedly, as she waited at
the corner of Lancing Court. "Sorry I'm late, but my visitor
detained me longer than I expected."</p>

<p>"Who? Jack Lorne?" The younger girl was intrigued. "I saw him
leave the shop&mdash;and he was so late. Did he suspect you?"</p>

<p>"Of not being you?" Mary laughed. "No. I don't think he did.
Yet he looked at me very strangely several times."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but then he must have suspected you?"</p>

<p>"He might." Mary frowned. "There is that danger. You see his
father and brother were clients of Kithner, Wales &amp;
Kithner&mdash;or rather of Mr. Wales. It was not until Mr. Wales
died that Mr. Kithner took over their affairs. Just about that
time Jack Lorne opened the florists' shop, and I went to Mr.
Kithner as his secretary. I may have seen Jack Lorne half a dozen
times in all not more&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't think he recognised you from then?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, but he may have. Anyway, he can't do more
than suspect. After you left this morning I made a few changes in
my appearance: did my hair in a different way, and those things
we bought yesterday helped." The girl coloured slightly.</p>

<p>"They have improved you temporarily," Ivy laughed approvingly.
The slight tinge of rouge, the line of lipstick, the film of
expensive powder, had made an enormous difference in the girl,
changing her completely from the wan, worn creature Ivy had
rescued from the solicitor's offices the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>"Anyway, we had a great talk. He was quite the professional
investigator." The older girl laughed. "He was very much
interested in the buhl box I don't think I acted your part badly.
I am certain that my account of the discovery of the burglar and
the drugging were absolutely thrilling and lifelike."</p>

<p>"But what did he really want?" Ivy was puzzled. "He seems too
nice to have thrust himself on you like that, out of
curiosity?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to see the photograph and the letter." Mary was
positive. "In fact, he almost acknowledged that he took the two
photographs away with him. But the two things don't coincide. If
he took the photographs away with him, then he had an opportunity
to examine them at his leisure, without coming to the house this
morning and asking to see them. I tried to hint that, and all he
would say was that he took them from the man he found holding you
in his arms."</p>

<p>"The adventures of a maid in pyjamas!" Ivy coloured while she
laughed. "What a night! First I go burglar hunting in a costume
that would not be approved by staid society matrons. Then a man
catches hold of me and chloroforms me, and I fall insensible into
his arms. Another man takes me and bears me to a couch in the
library. Mary, beware of burglars, even if they keep exclusive
florists' shops. They appear to care nothing tor the
proprieties."</p>

<p>"I promise to be fully dressed when I chase burglars," the
elder girl replied with mock gravity.</p>

<p>"But even that doesn't explain what he was after." Ivy
reverted to her original question. "What is his interest in the
matter?"</p>

<p>The elder girl shrugged. "I think Jack Lorne, in spite of his
careless manner, is somewhat difficult to probe."</p>

<p>The next minutes were devoted by both girls to their lunches.
Every now and again Ivy glanced at her watch. She had a strange
feeling that she was bound by time&mdash;she who had nothing in
her life before than that of amusingly passing the hours. Now she
was confined to an hour for her lunch&mdash;then back to the
shop, to work. She grimaced, feeling that she was paying rather
heavily for what, after all, might prove to be a whim.</p>

<p>"Ivy," spoke Mary suddenly. "Do you remember when we were
coming out of Mr. Kithner's offices yesterday afternoon you
seemed greatly interested in Mr. Richard Kithner&mdash;the man
we passed at the door?"</p>

<p>The younger girl nodded. "What of him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I thought I recognised him, that's all."</p>

<p>"Where and when?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You should know, if you have met him."</p>

<p>Ivy stared at her companion in some surprise for a few
seconds, "There is something behind that, Mary," she said
quietly. "You are not likely to make any loose statement, Now,
out with it!"</p>

<p>The elder girl shook her head. "It is not as easy as that,"
she replied. "You are sure you cannot remember anything about
Richard Kithner. Try&mdash;think hard! Remember, I have a reason
for asking the question. I have worked in the same office as that
gentleman."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;it is that?" Ivy glanced significantly across the
table.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;and other things, Ivy. He's a thoroughly bad lot.
Isn't it strange that so fine a gentleman as Mark Kithner should
have such a son? Have you ever met Richard Kithner socially?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Do you remember having seen him; spoken to him, when you have
called at his father's offices?"</p>

<p>"I have only been there three times in my life." The younger
girl spoke promptly. "The first time was with god-dad on my
twenty-first birthday when he settled a small income on
me&mdash;what he called permanent, irrevocable dress allowance.
The second time was the day after god-dad died&mdash;and Mr.
Kithner telephoned, suggesting that I went to him, as he was
unable to come to the house. The third time was yesterday. I
think that was the first time I have ever seen Richard
Kithner."</p>

<p>"You have never had any trouble with him?"</p>

<p>"Trouble with him?" Ivy's eyebrows went up. "What on earth do
you mean, Mary?"</p>

<p>"I mean, when you have been dining out, at the theatre, or at
a dance. He has a nasty reputation that way; speaking to girls he
doesn't know, and insulting their escorts, if they interfere.
He's terribly strong, in spite of his sleek appearance and
lackadaisical manner."</p>

<p>"No-o." Ivy paused for a few seconds, then: "Come, Mary,
what's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"He is very interested in you."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;after the character you have just tacked on
to him."</p>

<p>"He has been very interested in you and your affairs tor the
past six months."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The younger girl started. "Why, the first time I
ever went to Mr. Kithner's office&mdash;and that was with
god-dad&mdash;was only about six months ago."</p>

<p>"Had Mr. Sixsmith much business with Mr. Kithner about that
time?"</p>

<p>Ivy frowned, then nodded. "I think he was with Mr. Kithner
very often six months ago. You know, god-dad speculated quite a
lot, buying and selling things he thought he could make money out
of. I thought yesterday that he had lost all his money in
speculations, but Mr. Kithner would not have that. He said that
if anyone lost in a deal in which god-dad was interested, it was
the other man."</p>

<p>Mary laughed. "That fits in with the little knowledge I have
of Mr. Sixsmith. I know that Mr. Kithner did quite a large amount
of work for your god-dad during the last three months of his
life. No, I must not tell you what it was, or anything about it;
that's office secrets," she interjected, noting Ivy's look of
inquiry. "But I do know that Richard Kithner took quite an
interest in your godfather's business, and, after a time, in you.
He was continually asking his father questions about Mr.
Sixsmith's business, and twice I caught him searching his
father's desk. On one of those occasions I had reason to believe
that he had been at his father's private safe."</p>

<p>"Nice young gentleman!" commented the younger girl. "Goodness!
I've only ten minutes to get back to the shop! Come on, dear!
Anything more to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Only that Mr. Richard Kithner has proposed to call on me this
evening. He telephoned the glad news some minutes before I
left!"</p>

<p>"Richard Kithner coming to see me!" gasped Ivy.</p>

<p>"No, me." Mary laughed. "At least, he says so. Am I to be
jealous?"</p>

<p>Ivy shook her head as she turned to the door.</p>

<p>In the court, the girls parted, Mary to wander through the
city, the young lady of leisure, and then back to the Sixsmith
house; and Ivy to her work.</p>

<p>The afternoon hours in the florist's shop were more
interesting than the morning hours. Customers were many, and the
girl obtained amusement from them. Once or twice ladies entered
the shop whom she had met socially; but she managed to avoid
them.</p>

<p>Once she thought she was caught. A very grand dame pounced
upon her with a request for immediate service. One glance, and
Ivy recognised her. But a bare month before she had danced at the
woman's house, receiving much attention and petting. Now the cold
eyes swept the girl unrecognisingly. Yet Ivy was doubtful. Had
Mrs. Traynon recognised her? She could not be certain.</p>

<p>One thing was in her favour. The lady recognised a very big
social distinction between a flower-shop girl and the girl who
had been Basil Sixsmith's adored god-daughter and reputed
heiress.</p>

<p>Jack Lorne spent most of his time in the shop that afternoon.
Ivy thought he watched her rather closely, yet he never spoke to
her except on business. Towards four o'clock trade slackened, and
the girls were able to obtain a little needed rest. One of the
girls appeared willing to talk, and Ivy encouraged her.</p>

<p>While she was listening to the girl's somewhat inconsequent
chatter, a young man entered the shop. Ivy made to go to him, but
the other girl held her back.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble, Miss France," she whispered. "That's Mr. Paul
Lorne."</p>

<p>Paul Lorne! Ivy looked at him with some interest. He was
tall&mdash;as tall as his brother, but not so well-built: fair,
and with a thin line moustache that the girl thought disfigured
rather well-shaped lips. He went directly to the office&mdash;to
his brother. For some time they sat talking earnestly, and then
Paul came into the shop, wandering idly about, talking to one and
then another of the girls. He did not approach her, but Ivy
imagined that he kept rather close watch on her movements.</p>

<p>Had the brothers been discussing her&mdash;not Muriel France,
but Ivy Breton&mdash;during their conversation in the office? She
believed they had. For what reason? Why should the Lorne brothers
take an interest in a girl they had never met. Why should Jack
Lorne take a peculiar and close interest in the will of a man she
believed he had not known? And why was he interesting his
younger brother in the matter?</p>

<p>She waited until Paul Lorne came close to where she was
resting, determined to give him food for thought.</p>

<p>"Did you hear of that rather peculiar will Mr. Basil Sixsmith
left?" she asked the girl she was chatting with. "Do you know he
didn't leave a cent to his god-daughter, Ivy Breton, although he
professed to think so much of her, and everyone believed that she
would inherit all his millions? In fact, he doesn't seem to have
had much to leave. We all thought Ivy would be quite an heiress.
Mr. Sixsmith was reputed to be very rich."</p>

<p>"No." The girl spoke incuriously. "Ivy Breton? I don't think I
have ever heard of her."</p>

<p>"Oh. I used to go to school with her." Ivy spoke plainly,
watching Paul Lorne closely but furtively. He had come closer
while she had been speaking. "An awfully nice girl. I'm sorry for
her, I suppose she will have to go out to work now."</p>

<p>A customer entered at that moment, and Ivy went to serve her.
Paul Lorne waited a few minutes, then went into the office. Again
the two brothers held a long consultation, then left the shop
together.</p>

<p>Again came a lull in the stream of customers. As Ivy was
passing to the rear of the shop she saw a piece of paper lying
Just within the office door. Some impulse made her pick it
up.</p>

<p>She gasped, staring down at the writing on the paper in
astonishment, Again she held in her hand the short note Basil
Sixsmith had left with the photograph in the buhl box.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; MORE OF
RICHARD KITHNER</h2>

<p class="first">HOW came the letter Basil Sixsmith had written
to place with the photograph in the buhl box, in "Lorne,
florists" shop?</p>

<p>Jack Lorne had admitted to Ivy the previous morning over the
telephone, and to Mary Varney during the interview that day, when
he supposed that he was speaking to Basil Sixsmith's
god-daughter, that he had been in the house on the night of the
burglary. He had admitted taking the two photographs from the
burglar, and returning them to her. Why had he not returned the
letter also? What was there in those few lines written by the
dead man that could Interest the Lorne brothers?</p>

<p>Yet, from what she had seen, Ivy was certain that both
brothers were keenly interested in her. They were acting very
mysteriously. Jack Lorne had tempted her to telephone him by
scratching his telephone number on the back of one of the
photographs. Why had he not initiated the call himself? Why had
his younger brother, Paul, shown so much interest in her
conversation with one of the girls, when she had mentioned Ivy
Breton? How many people were interested in the strange will that
her godfather had made? First, there was the man who had claimed
that he was a creditor on the estate for five thousand pounds.
Who was he? Ivy believed that he was the same man who had broken
into her home and copied the photograph. But she could not even
guess at his identity.</p>

<p>Another man, also, had chosen to burgle her home. He had come
to the library while she had been there. He had waited in the
darkness of the hall until she had opened the door. Then he had
sprung on her, stifling her cries with the chloroformed pad. Jack
Lorne had come to the house, entering immediately after the
second burglar, and had rescued here from the man, carrying her
into the library and placing her on the couch.</p>

<p>But there had been many inconsistencies in "Lorne, florists"
story. Why had he been in the house? He had carefully evaded that
question to her and to Mary. Yet he might have been there for
some honest purpose&mdash;he might have seen the burglar enter,
and followed him. From there on his story was inconsistent. She
had carried the photograph of the "unknown" from the
library&mdash;she remembered having it in her hand when the
burglar assailed her.</p>

<p>Then, why had Jack Lorne taken the photograph away with him?
Why had he opened the buhl box and extracted the photograph that
lay in it? Then, crowning inconsistency, he had returned the two
photographs, and the same day had sought an interview with
her&mdash;for the purpose of seeing the photograph of the
"unknown!"</p>

<p>A photograph that he had in his possession for some hours! In
the semi-privacy of the back-shop Ivy again examined the short
note her godfather had left for her in the buhl box. She could
see nothing unusual in the few lines; yet it had proved so
attractive to Jack Lorne that he had not returned it with the
photographs.</p>

<p>Ivy wondered. The burglars, if there had been more than one,
had concentrated on the photograph of the "unknown." Jack Lorne
had found the letter the more interesting.</p>

<p>The girl tucked the letter in her bag, and went back to the
shop. She would tell no one that they had recovered the letter,
except perhaps Mary. She would warn the girl to discover if Jack
Lorne or his brother showed signs of distress when they found the
note missing. She laughed silently. Jack Lorne, investigator,
should have something to investigate.</p>

<p>A short twenty minutes, and the shop cleared for the day.
About five minutes before the head girl nodded to the man
attendant to close the main doors, the brothers returned to the
shop. Ivy watched them curiously. Certainly they showed no signs
of worry; yet Paul had a little pucker between his brows, and
Jack was smiling somewhat too intently. Neither were, she
thought, entirely at ease.</p>

<p>They went direct to the office. Through the glass, Ivy watched
them. The girls had gathered in the back chattering animatedly
while they changed into their outdoor things. Ivy lingered, dying
to be the last to leave the premises. That was not difficult. At
last only one of the girls remained. Ivy went into the back room
and changed quickly. As she returned to the shop she glanced into
the office. Paul was searching the floor.</p>

<p>She smiled grimly. No doubt there, were corners in that office
that could well do with a clearing out. She hoped the two men
would be black from face to heel before they gave up the search.
They would be that, and more, if they continued until they found
the note.</p>

<p>In Masters Street she turned and waved ironically to the shop.
"Lorne, florists" were in for a long sitting. She opened her bag
and peeped at the note; then sped up to Macquarie-street where
Mary was waiting with the car.</p>

<p>"All right, dear?" Mary called as she flung open the door and
jumped in. The engine was running the elder girl threw in the
gears and sped up the street. Then noticing Ivy's smile she
turned sharply to her. "What's the joke?"</p>

<p>"This!" The girl opened her bag and showed Basil Sixsmith's
note. "I found this in the office. 'Lorne, florists,' are turning
out their shop in a frantic search for it."</p>

<p>"Spiteful!" Mary laughed. "Are we going home?"</p>

<p>"Unless you want to stay in town?"</p>

<p>"Richard Kithner is calling to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary!" Ivy laughed, mischievously at the girl's very set
face.</p>

<p>"He is calling to see you, not me."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Am I so fascinating!"</p>

<p>The girl narrowly missed running down a taxi in trying to
glimpse herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"You will be, if you drive like that!" Ivy caught at the
wheel. "Still, Mary, you have improved quite a lot! If you go on
improving like you have, I shall be quite jealous."</p>

<p>"Of Richard Kithner?" Then both girls laughed.</p>

<p>"What is he after?" exclaimed Ivy.</p>

<p>"You!" Mary was very emphatic. "No, dear. I don't think he's
fallen in love with you. You're not quite his type. The 'you'
refers to your connection with godfather Sixsmith."</p>

<p>"You think Richard Kithner knows something?"</p>

<p>"I am sure he does." The elder girl paused. "Ivy, a girl can't
be in the same office with a man, day after day, and not learn
things. Richard Kithner is a 'snooper.' He's continually snooping
among things with which he has no business. I used to
think&mdash;I hoped&mdash;that some day someone would take him by
the nape of neck and sling him out of the window. But he's
terribly strong. I think all the other men were afraid of him;
although they hate him."</p>

<p>"And the girls, also?"</p>

<p>"All except the silly ones. They're taken in by his
patent-leather hair, continual smirk, the dinky moustache, and
the fine, white, even teeth. Ugh! They always, make me think of
Red Riding Hood!"</p>

<p>"Pleasant little playfellow."</p>

<p>Ivy swung open the door the car drew up before the Sixsmith
garage. "There, run her in, Mary."</p>

<p>They went into the house, their arms intertwined. Ivy was
watching and wondering at her companion. Only that morning she
had found out that Mary could drive a car and had insisted that
she went for long drives while she was at work. The result had
been to take years off the girl's worn, weary looks. Her eyes had
lost their dull, leaden colour. The roses that had promised the
previous evening were beginning to show on her cheeks. Ivy
confessed to herself that if she could induce Mary to abandon the
severe straight hairdressing and to clothe herself more
becomingly, she would prove a very attractive girl.</p>

<p>They were late for dinner. Faith was in the hall, gong-stick
in hand, when they entered. The maid smiled dourly as they
scampered up the stairs, calling back that they would not be more
than five minutes. They returned downstairs to time. The meal was
a hurried one, for Richard Kithner had set his call for an early
hour.</p>

<p>Ivy insisted that Mary received the young man alone. She
wanted to be free; to be able to take advantage of anything that
might crop up. In a few words, over the coffee, they set their
plans. Mary was to receive her visitor in the library; Ivy was to
be in the "den"&mdash;a small room opening out of the library.
There she would be close to Mary, and unobserved and, if she
wished, could overhear all that passed. The "den" held another
advantage. From it a door opened on to the driveway from the road
to the garage.</p>

<p>The girls had hardly passed into the library when the maid
announced Richard Kithner. Ivy went to the den, and Mary picked
up a book, sitting down in one of the comfortable lounge chairs
before the open fire. When Richard. Kithner entered she looked up
casually.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kithner. You wanted to see me?"</p>

<p>For a moment the man hesitated, smoothing down his sleek,
black hair.</p>

<p>"You look comfortable, Mary. Seem to have fallen on your feet
eh? Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Only the 'Mary'."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't fuss. We're not at the office now." He came across
the room and stood before the fire, looking down on her, his arm
spread along the mantelpiece. "Where's the heiress?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western?" Mary showed surprise. "I don't remember her
address. You can get it at the office in the morning."</p>

<p>"I suppose I should have said the supposed heiress." The
small, even teeth gleamed in a cold smile. "What a
disappointment, eh? She thought she was the old man's
darling&mdash;and got put out in the cold."</p>

<p>"Are you referring to Miss Breton?"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it, dearie." Richard Kithner tried to smile,
ingratiatingly. "You know I mean Ivy Breton&mdash;so don't try
and make me believe you misunderstand." He paused and as Mary did
not reply, continued; "I've come here on business&mdash;strictly
business."</p>

<p>"I am on holidays, Mr. Kithner."</p>

<p>"And they're doing you a world of good." He spoke rather
impulsively, his head on one side. "D'you know, Mary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Varney, please."</p>

<p>"Well; go on as you're going and you won't be 'miss' very
long." He laughed at what he thought to be a joke, "Say, girlie,
what's the heiress doing? Why, she's waved a magic wand over you.
Oh, I see, it's your hair. Dressed in a new style, eh? And that
frock&mdash;it's a whale. Sure. Mary, if I'd known what you were
hiding I'd have rushed you strong, long before this."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner!"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it!" Mary thought he had been drinking. He went
closer to the girl, sitting on the edge of the desk. The buhl box
caught his eyes. He picked it up and turned it in his hands.
"The buhl box! How does it open, Mary?"</p>

<p>"By a spring, I believe." The girl answered, indifferently, "I
have not tried to open it. It is not my property."</p>

<p>"No." Richard Kithner was exploring for the spring, but could
not find it.</p>

<p>"Say, Mary, where's the heiress? I've asked you that before,
but you didn't answer."</p>

<p>"I have told you, Miss Breton is not an heiress. Mr. Sixsmith
left his property to his half-sister and Miss Breton will have to
earn her living at the end of three months from now."</p>

<p>"All my cock and hen! If you want plainer language&mdash;all
eyewash." The young man laughed loudly. "Look here. Mary. There's
some mystery about old Sixsmith's will. I've got a hunch that he
was framing something."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm out to discover&mdash;and to do that I want
your help."</p>

<p>"Old Sixsmith left only about six thousand founds, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>Mary nodded. It was useless to deny knowledge of a fact that
was public property. No doubt. Richard Kithner had obtained his
information from his father.</p>

<p>"Well, what became of the rest of his money?" Then, noticing
her look of surprise, "Oh, you're not going to tell me, like Dad
did, that he lost it in speculations. I've been making inquiries
and know different."</p>

<p>"In what way?".</p>

<p>"Well, six months ago he came to dad and put some house
property in his hands to deal with. Producing a bunch of
securities, something over a hundred thousand to support his fad.
Dad put in some money, too, and did the work, and they made quite
a killing. Two months later, old Sixsmith took a fly in oil, and
just cleared out at the top of the boom. Made another pile in the
old 'Comeback' liquidation, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What then?" Mary was interested, in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You know that about that time he invested a sum of money for
Miss Breton?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pin money! Bah!" The young man sneered. "That's all it
was. The old man called it that to dad. It was then that he told
dad that the girl was going to have the lot, if he could pass the
buck to his relatives&mdash;that's Mrs. Western and her son."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It's like this, girlie." Richard Kithner' bent forward over
the girl, impressively. "You're the king-pin in this game. Ivy's
taken a fancy to you. You know that! Well, then, you stand pretty
tor our purpose. You're in her camp, and you're joining hands
with me. See? You're where a clever girl can grow clover for
herself&mdash;and her pals. I'm on the outside; so others will
think. They won't think that we're in co. over this. You get the
information and pass it to me. I'll do the work, and we'll clean
up a bit."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I've got a line&mdash;no, I'm not telling you what it is, but
it's a whizzer. I'm playing it for all it's worth. In a few days
I'll know quite a lot&mdash;if you stand in with me I'll have the
whole story set. Then we'll beat the band&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?" In spite of herself the girl was growing more and more
interested.</p>

<p>"You'll get the full story of where and how Mr. Sixsmith left
his money."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you sufficient dope to go to the heiress and make
terms."</p>

<p>"What terms?"</p>

<p>"I haven't decided yet. Shall we say&mdash;half to be divided
between you and I? That do? Thought so. Then you shall tell her
where to find her fortune&mdash;the one old Sixsmith hid for her
from his relatives&mdash;and she'll give you half. See?"</p>

<p>"Sounds reasonable." Mary pretended to be reluctant. She hated
the man, but even then was loth to fool him. "Are you certain
that you will be able to discover the real facts?"</p>

<p>"That Ivy's the heiress? I'll bet on that! It's up to you. Get
me what I want, and within a fortnight you'll be fifty thousand
or more better off."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Get me the real photograph that was in the buhl box and a
copy of the letter. I'll do the rest. Now, is it a go?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Mary stood up suddenly. Richard Kithner extended his
hand, and, very reluctantly, Mary placed hers on his palm.</p>

<p>"Righto, partner!" The young man went to the door. "I'm off. I
don't want the heiress to catch you and me together now. By the
way, if you get a telephone message from 'Cousin Paul' you'll,
understand, won't you?"</p>

<p>He went into the hall, looking back with a leer at the
girl.</p>

<p>Mary waited a moment, then went to the door of the den,
calling Ivy softly. There was no response. She switched on the
lights in the room, and looked around. Ivy Breton had
disappeared.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; IVY FIND THE
"UNKNOWN"</h2>

<p class="first">THE development of the conversation between the
lawyer's son and heir and Mary had not surprised Ivy. She had
guessed that Richard Kithner was not making a social call on his
father's secretary. He had an ulterior motive, and now he had
shown that. He had come seeking information&mdash;more, he had an
ally in some only partially known scheme to hold her to ransom if
she wanted to solve the mystery of her godfather's will and
inherit the fortune she now was certain he had left to her. Mary
had said that during the time she had been with Kithner, Wales
&amp; Kithner, the young man had not paid her any attention; In
fact, he had shown antagonism towards her. Mary's summing-up of
Richard Kithner's character had prepared her for the line the
conversation had taken.</p>

<p>But she had not been prepared to find that Mary, the girl she
had chosen for friend and companion, to show the greater
knowledge of the mystery than she had let her know in her
conversations with her. Only that day, discussing the mystery,
she had stopped while speaking, claiming that certain knowledge
she possessed belonged to her office, and must remain secret. Now
she had to face a question.</p>

<p>Would Mary give her all the help she was capable of giving in
solving the mystery? Ivy could not answer her own question. She
would have to wait and see. One thing Ivy had now quite clear in
her mind. Her godfather had not been ruined when he died. He had
been a wealthy man, but for some purpose he had hidden his
wealth, leaving the cryptogrammatic letter and the photograph in
the buhl box as the only clues.</p>

<p>For what reason? Had he guessed when he was settling his
estate in preparation for death that directly he had passed on
his relatives would commence to squabble over what he had left
behind? Had he guessed that if he had named her his heiress he
would embroil her in a lot of trouble? If so, then he had evolved
the mystery of the buhl box, confident that her wits would baffle
and defeat those who sought to rob her; certain that her
quickness would solve the mystery he had surrounded the buhl box
with before his enemies.</p>

<p>If only she could discover the identity of those who sought
the secret of the buhl box. She knew only one&mdash;Jack Lorne.
Yet she was certain that at least three other persons were
interested. She stamped her foot, angrily. Three days had passed
and she was no nearer the solution of the mystery than when he
sat in the drawing-room and heard the old lawyer reading the
clause in her godfather's will leaving her the buhl box.</p>

<p>That evening she had learned one additional fact&mdash;that
Richard Kithner was interested in the photograph of the
"unknown." What did that mean? What could his interest be? He had
said that he intended to solve the mystery and hold her to ransom
for the secret. Had he spoken the truth? Ivy doubted it.</p>

<p>Jack Lorne and Richard Kithner! They were both interested in
the buhl box and its contents. Jack Lorne had seen the photograph
of the "unknown," Richard Kithner had not. He had asked Mary to
obtain it for him. Then the two men could not be in collusion,
for, if so, Jack Lorne would have shown Kithner the photograph
when he had it in his possession.</p>

<p>She had fallen so deep into thought that Richard Kithner's
sudden departure almost took her by surprise. She flew to the
door of the den opening on the driveway, carrying her hat, coat
and bag with her. She was standing in the shadows of the tall
hedge when the young man passed on his way down to the main road.
Ivy slipped out on the pavement, hugging the shadows. Richard
Kithner knew too much to be ignored. She must follow him;
discover whom he spoke to, and, if possible, what were the hidden
plans in his mind he had hinted at to Mary. If only luck would
favour her&mdash;just a little!</p>

<p>Kithner walked slowly down the road and at the corner stood
hesitant for some seconds. He turned quickly in the direction of
the city, as if moved by some sudden impulse. Two or three
cruising taxis who hailed him were waved aside. Ivy thought that
strange. Men of Richard Kithner's type do not walk unless
compelled to do so.</p>

<p>Keeping carefully in the shadows, Ivy followed the young man
to the main road. He had slackened his pace considerably and when
he came to the end of the block halted again. Now he looked about
him as if expecting someone to meet him. He looked at his watch
and switched his stick impatiently; then moved on very
slowly.</p>

<p>A man came out of the shadows, falling into step beside
Richard Kithner quite naturally. For some moments they did not
speak, then the stranger asked a question and Richard Kithner
impatiently shook his head. For some seconds they walked on in
silence; then exchanged a few brief questions and answers.</p>

<p>Ivy quickened her steps and drew nearer the two men. She must
know more of this second man. He was tall, a few inches taller
than Kithner, who was about the average height of man, and they
were of like build. Somehow he was vaguely familiar to Ivy, yet
she could not name him. Where had she seen him before? She was
certain that he was not altogether a stranger.</p>

<p>The two men came to an intersection and halted, waiting for
the crossing to clear. Ivy drew nearer, watching the men
intently. For some minutes they spoke together in low hurried
tones. Then the traffic was stopped and Richard Kithner, with a
wave of his stick, started to cross the road. The stranger turned
and came back towards Ivy.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, looking about her for some place in which
to hide. She knew that it would be foolish to turn back, for any
sudden movement on the partially-filled pavement would attract
the man's immediate attention. She could only walk on, keeping
her head averted, yet watching the man closely. He came nearer,
passing under the light from an electric standard&mdash;and Ivy
stopped, in surprise.</p>

<p>The man was Charlie Western! What was he doing in that quarter
of the city? Had he come there to meet Richard Kithner
immediately after his talk with Mary? That seemed probable. It
was absurd, in the face of Richard Kithner's actions within the
last quarter of an hour to believe that the meeting was
accidental. He had lounged down the road as if expecting to be
met. Charlie Western had caught up to him, and the two men had
quickened their pace, as if the meeting had been arranged.</p>

<p>Then Richard Kithner was acting with Charlie Western in trying
to solve the mystery of the buhl box! What interest had Mrs.
Western and her son in the box and its contents? The girl turned
and followed the man. She must find out where he went, and to
whom he spoke. Yet for a moment she doubted. Should she continue
on Richard Kithner's track. No, there had been something in his
manner, in the way he had parted from Charlie Western, that
showed that his work was finished for that night.</p>

<p>Again the girl's thoughts went to Mrs. Western and the buhl
box. The woman and her son had shown antagonism to her legacy
when the will had been read. At the time she had supposed it was
the miser instinct she knew existed in the woman. She had not
liked to see anything taken from the house that was to be her
property in three months' time. Now the woman and her son knew
that they could never hope to get one penny from the Sixsmith
estate.</p>

<p>Her telephone message to Mrs. Western that morning, that some
man had put in a claim for five thousand pounds against the
estate had shown them that the will under which they inherited
was valueless. The debts of the estate would swallow up its
assets, perhaps even the legacies to the servants. Failing to
obtain anything from Basil Sixsmith through his will, Mrs.
Western and her son had resolved to probe the legacy that Basil
Sixsmith had left his god-daughter.</p>

<p>Had they thought, like others, that the old man had not been
ruined when he died? That he had left his property&mdash;a
considerable amount&mdash;hidden, and that the key to the
hiding-place was contained in the buhl box?</p>

<p>The buhl box! How many strange figures had it gathered around
it within the past few days? Again Ivy went over the group of
people whom she knew were interested.</p>

<p>There was the burglar who had copied the photograph&mdash;</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to the girl. Could that burglar have
been Charlie Western? Now she remembered that the man appeared
very tall&mdash;and about the same build. He had not acted the
part of the burglar well. How had he got into the house?
Immediately on coming to her senses the following morning she had
tried to discover how the man had gained entry. All she had found
out was that the hall-door was on the latch. She had questioned
Alice and Faith. They were certain that no door nor window had
been unlatched or opened, during the night.</p>

<p>Then the man had gained entry to the house through the front
door. That would not be difficult, for the key was old-fashioned.
But, even then, he must have had some sort of key! Suddenly Ivy
remembered. Some four months before her godfather died, Mrs.
Western had appealed to him, asking that she and her son be
accommodated while their house was being re-decorated. Basil
Sixsmith had grumbled, but agreed.</p>

<p>Ivy believed that her godfather had supplied Charlie Western
with a door key during his residence in the house Had the man
returned it? For the moment Ivy laughed. If Charlie Western had
been the burglar!</p>

<p>The burglar had copied the photograph she had placed in the
buhl box, in exchange for the one her godfather had placed there.
The photograph he had copied had been of Richard Kithner, taken
many years before. She had recognised him when she had been
leaving Mark Kithner's offices&mdash;when he had passed her and
Mary in the doorway.</p>

<p>Had Richard Kithner then known that Charlie Western had a copy
of his photograph in his possession? Had he known that the man
suspected him of being the "unknown" who held the secret of the
Sixsmith fortune?</p>

<p>Ivy was certain that here she had solved one of her chief
problems. Now she was confronted with a new one. She must find
out what was the connection between Richard Kithner and Charlie
Western. She had to discover how much each knew of the other. Had
Charlie Western, on discovering the original of the photograph he
had copied, gone to Richard Kithner and demanded the solution of
the Sixsmith puzzle? If so, then the confusion between the two
men must have been great. What had resulted from that confusion?
Had the two men come to an understanding? Was Richard Kithner's
call on Mary the step in some scheme on which the two men had
agreed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Charlie Western, some fifty yards ahead of Ivy,
halted and hailed a taxi. For the moment the girl was undecided
how to act. She stood on the edge of the pavement, staring at the
young men entering the car.</p>

<p>"Taxi, miss?" Ivy started. She I had not seen nor heard the
car draw up before her.</p>

<p>"Yes!" She jumped into the invitingly open-door, "Follow that
taxi; the one just leaving up the road. Quick, please!"</p>

<p>The sudden jerk of the car as the driver accelerated threw her
heavily on to the seat. She scrambled up and peeped out of the
window.</p>

<p>Western's car was still in sight, and they were gaining on it
rapidly. Evidently, Charlie Western did not know she was
following him. For about a mile and a halt the two cars sped
rapidly through the streets. Then Western's car slowed and drew
in to the curb. Ivy's driver swung out into the road and came to
a halt some dozen or so yards ahead.</p>

<p>"Sit tight, miss." The driver half turned on his seat. "I
don't think they saw us." He paused for a moment. "Strange!
He's standing beside the car! Why doesn't he go up to the
house?"</p>

<p>Ivy also wondered what Charlie Western was doing. She knew
that he did not live in that house. The Westerns lived in quite a
different suburb. Was he waiting for anyone?</p>

<p>"Going to follow him further, miss?" The driver inquired
curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, it you have sufficient gas."</p>

<p>"Luck's in there, miss." The man faced her with a grin. "I'd
just loaded up when you stopped me. I'll go as far as he, and
perhaps further."</p>

<p>Again Ivy glanced through the rear window. The door of the
house, outside which Charlie Western's taxi had halted had
opened, and a girl came running out. The man went forward quickly
to open the gate for her. With a little laugh and a smile she
greeted him, then went on to the taxi. Immediately, Charlie
Western followed her. The car turned and headed for the city. Ivy
looked at her watch, It was barely nine o'clock. Her lips drew
together disdainfully. What did Charlie Western's actions denote?
Only some supper-dance assignment?</p>

<p>They were speeding down the long road citywards, the two cars
only a few yards apart. Ivy's driver cleverly jockeyed for
position, and presently was following immediately after the car
containing Charlie Western and the girl.</p>

<p>In that order they went into the city and through the business
section to where the bright lights blazed. The girl knew that she
had guessed right. Almost she knocked on the window to tell the
driver to turn the car and carry her homewards. Then, she
hesitated. She would still follow Western, on the hunch that had
brought her so far. She would see it through.</p>

<p>The cars turned from the busy streets into one lined with
warehouses. Now Ivy knew where they were heading. The "Palido"
nightclub was in this street. She peered out of the window. Only
a few yards ahead she could see the arch of coloured lights above
the restaurant's door. She knocked gently on the window. The man
turned his head and nodded.</p>

<p>As Charlie Western's car drew up before the door of the
"Palido," he slid to a stop immediately behind it; then motioned
to the girl to remain seated, leaning well back in the shadows.
Ivy watched Charlie Western alight and turn to help his
companion. They went to the brilliantly lighted entrance hall,
and a man came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>Ivy gasped. Immediately she recognised in the newcomer the man
of the photograph&mdash;the "unknown" whose photograph had been
in the buhl box!</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE PURSUIT
OF THE "UNKNOWN"</h2>

<p class="first">IVY crouched in the corner of the taxi, watching
the meeting between Charlie Western and the "unknown." It was
evident that they were not too well known; their greetings being
much too formal for any friendship to exist. After they had
exchanged a few words the "unknown" went to the taxi which
Charlie Western and his companion had just left.</p>

<p>The driver was on the alert, standing by the open door. The
"unknown" spoke a few words, then entered the car. Ivy leaned
forward, tapping on the glass. Her driver looked round, a broad
grin on his face. She pointed to the car ahead, and he
nodded&mdash;his grin broadening. Ivy coloured. The man must
think she was mad, following different men about the city at that
hour of the night. Yet she had no thought of going home. She had
found the "unknown," and before she could rest she must know who
he was and where she could find him again.</p>

<p>Back of her mind was a new-born idea. If she could follow the
man to where he lived, then she could wait her opportunity to
speak to him; tell him of her godfather's will and instructions,
and ask him what they meant. But what would he think of her?
Would he, like her taxi-driver, consider she was unbalanced? She
would have to risk that.</p>

<p>The taxi bearing the "unknown" went down the street and turned
the corner, heading for the G.P.O. Ivy's driver waited a few
seconds before following the quarry; then proceeded at a much
faster pace. He caught sight of the taxi again; pulling up before
the main entrance of the G.P.O.</p>

<p>The "unknown" alighted from the car leisurely, and strolled up
the steps. Now Ivy saw that he was not making for the big doors,
but for the entrance to the private-boxes corridors. She pushed
open the door of her taxi, bidding the man await her return.</p>

<p>She fumbled in her purse as she ran up the steps. Somewhere
she had the keys of her godfather's private box. Had she left
them at home? No, only that morning she had put them in her bag,
intending to go down to the box sometime during the day, to
discover what letters were there. The man was evidently not in a
hurry.</p>

<p>Ivy found him in one of the narrow corridor's between the
tiers of boxes, feeling for his keys. She looked up at the
direction boards. Her godfather's box was in the same corridor.
That was a gain. Now she could watch the man almost openly. She
went to her godfather's box and fitted the key in the lock,
letting down the steel door. There were half-a-dozen letters in
the box. The girl did not take them out. She opened her bag and
took out her powder-puff and mirror. Watching in the mirror she
obtained a fair view of the man and the box he was opening. She
marked it carefully.</p>

<p>For some moments he stood, scanning the letters he had taken
from the box. Some he put in his pocket unopened. Two he retained
in his hand. He closed the box and turned to the entrance. Ivy
snatched the letters out of her box and thrust them into her bag.
She followed the man towards the exit. When she came to where he
had been standing, she stopped and scanned the numbers of the
boxes. She found the one she had marked in her mirror. It was
numbered 751M.</p>

<p>If she could find out who rented that box she would have the
man's name and address. She turned towards the exit again, to
find that the "unknown" had passed out of sight. Fearing to lose
him, she ran to the covered terrace extending along the front of
the building. He was stepping into his car. Ivy ran down the
steps, motioning to her driver. He nodded, and as she jumped into
the car, swung the door shut, and sprang to his seat. The
"unknown's" car was disappearing round the corner, westwards. Ivy
lay back on the cushions, angry with herself. She had had the
"unknown" beside her, and had not spoken to him. Now she came to
examine herself and her impulses, she found that she had only
thought of tracking him. Never for a moment, as he stood before
his private box&mdash;and whilst she had been at hers&mdash;had
the impulse to speak to him come to her. She had only thought of
watching; discovering which box belonged to him. She had her
opportunity&mdash;and had thrown it away.</p>

<p>Now she was dependent on her taxi driver to follow him to some
extent where she could rectify her omission. She vowed that if
the man succeeded she would recompense him in a manner that would
make his wages appear insignificant&mdash;for that week at
least.</p>

<p>Who was this man, on whose track she was speeding? He appeared
to be about thirty-five, or perhaps a little more. Dark, and
somewhat fleshy. He was clad in full evening dress, with a light
overcoat over it, but wore no hat. His hair was thin and light.
His complexion was almost swarthy, and he was clean shaven. That
was the total of her observations, for, when they had stood in
the corridor of the private boxes, he had had his back to her
most of the time.</p>

<p>"Can you follow him?" She spoke to her driver. "I want to
speak to him. It is very important, I should have done so at the
General Post Office, but I forgot."</p>

<p>She knew her explanation was distinctly lame, even as she gave
it.</p>

<p>"Really, it is most important&mdash;so much depends on my
speaking, to him at once."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, miss." The man was evidently impressed by
her distress.</p>

<p>"What's 'is name?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Ivy confessed.</p>

<p>"Don't know?" the man echoed. "Then how am I to find him?"</p>

<p>"You saw him go up those steps."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that doesn't count now."</p>

<p>The man pointed to the taxi before them, now drawing up before
a massive building in a quiet square.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Ivy stared in dismay. She saw the "unknown" descend
from the car, pay off the driver, and walk into the building.</p>

<p>"Whose house is that?" she demanded imperiously.</p>

<p>"The Union Club, miss." The driver's grin broadened. "'Fraid
you nor I can follow him in there. It's for gents only, and
pretty exclusive."</p>

<p>"But you can go and ask the porter for the name of the man who
last entered?" expostulated Ivy.</p>

<p>"That's no good now, miss." The man nodded to the club doors.
Quite a group of people were entering the doors. "And, 'sides,
they ain't too free in giving members' names to people like
me."</p>

<p>Ivy almost stamped in vexation. Impatiently she ordered the
man to drive her home. Her evening had ended in disappointment;
and she missed her great opportunity. After a time she became
more cheerful. She had really accomplished something that
evening. She had found the "unknown;" she knew that he was a
resident of her city. That was important. She knew he frequented
the "Palido" night club, and she knew the number of his private
postal box. The last point was the best point she had scored, She
would write to the renter of the box, and ask for an interview.
Yes, that would be the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p>Alighting at the door of her house, she turned to pay off her
taxi-man. She tipped him liberally, for, after all, she had made
the mistakes of the evening, not him.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Fred Powers, miss."</p>

<p>"What time do you go on duty, Mr. Powers?"</p>

<p>"About five o'clock in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Then you have all day to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Except what I use up in sleep." The man grinned. "I'm on till
three in the morning, and sometimes later if I pick up an
after-dinner dance fare to a distant supper. Then I may get back
to the garage, if I'm lucky, about five or six in the
morning."</p>

<p>"I understand." Ivy pondered a moment: then turned again to
the man. "I live here. My name is Ivy Breton&mdash;Miss Breton.
Will you go home early to-night, and to-morrow do some work for
me? I will pay you well for it."</p>

<p>"Of course, miss." The man's face brightened. "But if you want
me to be early on the job the best thing for you to do is to hire
me and the cab for the time you want. It's an engagement I can
put down in the office."</p>

<p>Ivy nodded. It would be well to have the car as well as the
man. He could accomplish her commission better as a taxi-driver
than as Fred Powers, lounger.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "It is half past ten now. Go on with
your work until midnight; then turn in your car. Tell your office
that I want you on duty at mid-day to-morrow. That will give you
plenty of time for sleep. At noon, to-morrow, call for me here.
Your office is to book up all charges to Miss Breton. If they
want references, tell them I am the late Mr. Basil Sixsmith's
god-daughter and refer them to Mr. Mark Kithner, of Kithner &amp;
Kithner, solicitors. Is that plain?"</p>

<p>"Right, miss&mdash;and thank you. I'll be here to-morrow,
punctual."</p>

<p>Ivy watched the man drive away. She was planning rapidly. If
the taxi-driver acted as she required him to&mdash;and he
appeared resourceful and alert&mdash;before another night came
round she would be questioning the "unknown."</p>

<p>She turned and entered the house. In the big hall she looked
towards the library. A light shone under the door. She peeped in.
Mary was curled up in one of the chairs, fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, I'm so sorry!" The girl crossed the room and kissed
her contritely. "Wake up, Mary; it's bedtime!"</p>

<p>The girl yawned and stretched; opening her eyes dreamily, then
sat up.</p>

<p>"Ivy! Why, dear, wherever have you been?"</p>

<p>"Up and down the city&mdash;discovering the 'unknown.'"</p>

<p>"Then you found him?"</p>

<p>"I did." The girl sat down and pulled oft her hat, flinging it
on the desk. "Oh, dear! I've had such a time."</p>

<p>Then, quickly and eagerly, she started an account of her
adventures during the evening. Mary listened interestedly, asking
many questions. When Ivy had concluded her narrative the elder
girl frowned thoughtfully. "What a mix-up," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Richard Kithner, the man whose photograph you placed in the
buhl box in exchange for the 'unknown'. Charlie Western, the
burglar, copies that photograph and traces the original,
believing him to be the 'unknown'."</p>

<p>The girl laughed suddenly. "Ivy, I'd have given a finger to
have seen Richard Kithner's face when Charlie Western challenged
him to declare the secret of the Sixsmith millions."</p>

<p>"If there is any money at all!" said Ivy, more soberly.</p>

<p>"Of course there is!" Mary spoke indignantly. "I'm not going
to have that denied after to-night. I know my Richard Kithner,
dear. You don't think for one moment that bright bay wastes any
time unless he believes there is money in it for him."</p>

<p>"It's all such a terrible mix-up, Mary."</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of it&mdash;but you will find that it will
straighten out very soon now. To-morrow you will write a nice
little note to Mr. 'Unknown', asking him to call and hand over
your fortune."</p>

<p>"Of course he'll jump at the chance of doing that."</p>

<p>"Why not? Your godfather did not put that photograph in the
buhl box for nothing. He meant you to find the original man, and
ask him what his photograph and the note means. You do that
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and he will say: 'Yes, Miss Breton. Your godfather
left you a quarter of a million in good, hard, solid golden
coins. Hold out your pinny and I will pour them into it.'"</p>

<p>Mary laughed, then became thoughtful. "There is one thing I
don't like," she said slowly. "How did Charlie Western come to
know the 'unknown'?"</p>

<p>"Dance hall acquaintances,"' suggested the younger girl.</p>

<p>"Maybe." Mary laughed again. "Just fancy, Ivy. Charlie Western
chases Richard Kithner in mistake for the 'unknown', when all the
time he knows the 'unknown', but doesn't know him as the
'unknown' and&mdash;Oh, bother, what's a girl to do with such a
mix-up?"</p>

<p>"Go to bed." Ivy pulled the girl to her feet. "That's the best
thing I know of at present. Go to bed, dear, and let all the
'unknowns' alone until the sun shines again. After all, we
haven't done so bad."</p>

<p>"You haven't, you mean!"</p>

<p>"Greedy! What about you? If Richard Kithner hadn't come to
make love to you I shouldn't have been able to track him to
Charlie Western. Then Charlie Western wouldn't have been under my
eyes when he took that girl to a supper-dance and met the
'unknown' in the Palido's doorway. Go to bed, girl! You're
sleepy, or you would have seen long ago it is all your
fault."</p>

<p>The two girls went up the stairs together. Outside Mary's
door, Ivy said good-night, and went on to her own room. She was
tired&mdash;dead tired&mdash;but she wanted to sit and think.</p>

<p>At last she was on the track of the solution of the mystery
her godfather had set her. She flung her hat on the bed, and put
her handbag on the dressing table. For some time she sat
pondering; then undressed and slipped into a robe. When she
returned from the bathroom she felt happier and much refreshed.
She stretched luxuriously between the cool sheets; then threw
back the covers and jumped out of bed. What had she been thinking
of&mdash;to forget the letters she had taken from her godfather's
private post-box?</p>

<p>She caught up her bag and took it into bed with her, switching
on the reading lamp. She found that she had brought from the
private box seven letters. Six of them were addressed to Basil
Sixsmith&mdash;the seventh to herself. She placed the letters
addressed to her godfather on the bedside table and opened the
envelope that bore her name. Her fingers trembled as she pulled
out the single sheet of notepaper. The letter was written on
Union Club notepaper, and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Miss
Breton</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">I have only to-day heard the very regrettable
news of your godfather's death. May I be permitted to offer my
condolences. Mr. Sixsmith left with me, some little time ago, a
packet of documents of importance, with instructions to hand them
to you in the event of his not claiming them from me before his
death. The packet is in the hands of my solicitors, Messrs.
Tinker &amp; Tinker, of Hill Street, this city. I have telephoned
Mr. Tinker a request to hand the packet to you if you will be
good enough to call on him. He will take your receipt for the
same.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Harold Pender</span>.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash;
DECORATIONS</h2>

<p class="first">IVY went down to "Lorne, florists," the next
morning in a state of wild excitement, mixed with determination.
She believed that the end of her quest was in sight. Surely the
man who had written to her from the Union Club was the
"unknown."</p>

<p>Her midday hour was going to be a very busy one. She had to
meet Fred Powers and instruct him to watch the man she had traced
to the Union Club. But was that necessary now? The man had
written to her&mdash;or, rather, she believed it was the same
man. Then, during that lunch hour she wanted to get to the
solicitors and obtain the packet Harold Pender had referred to in
his letter. With those papers, no doubt, she could solve the
mystery of the buhl box and lay bare her godfather's cunning
problem.</p>

<p>Almost she was inclined to telephone to the taxi company and
rescind her instructions for the taxi and Fred Powers. Then she
decided that she would not. She would wait and see what happened.
She would let the driver go to the Union Club and watch for the
'unknown' while seated in his machine. He would have his flag
down, as if engaged, unless he saw the "unknown" coming towards
him. Then he would be disengaged&mdash;to carry the man where he
wanted to go about the city; to watch him and report to her his
movements, where he called and where he went.</p>

<p>What were the documents the man had mentioned in his letter?
Why had her godfather left them in his charge? His name was
unfamiliar, and she had thought she knew most of her godfather's
friends and acquaintances. He had been fond of having her with
him; proud of introducing her to everyone he met.</p>

<p>Ivy shrugged impatiently. She would have to wait until midday
before she learned facts. She moved about the shop, her eyes
continually seeking the hands of her watch. They seemed to move
with alarming slowness.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the morning had seemed so long that she almost
walked out of the shop in her impatience. She had arranged
everything for a busy hour. Mary was to meet the taxi-driver at
the house, and, instead of bringing the car down for her, was to
come in the taxi. When she came out of the shop she would find
them at the corner of Masters Street. In the taxi they would
drive down to Hill Street&mdash;to Harold Pender's solicitors. On
the way home she would give Fred Powers his instructions. He
would take Mary home and then go to the Union Club.</p>

<p>Mornings in the flower shop were mainly spent in arranging the
blooms and decorating the windows. Ivy was not considered
sufficiently experienced to take part in this work. She was
relegated to the position of very junior assistant to
everybody&mdash;to waiting on the experienced saleswomen.</p>

<p>Jack Lorne did not come to the shop until after ten o'clock.
He went direct to his office; and spent some time at the
telephone. At length he sat back, frowning&mdash;gazing through
the shop. Presently he caught Ivy's eye, and beckoned.</p>

<p>"Know much about arranging flowers, Miss France?" he asked
abruptly, when she entered his office.</p>

<p>"In what manner, Mr. Lorne?"</p>

<p>"Can you decorate a table for a dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Had much experience in that work?"</p>

<p>"I told you, Mr. Lorne, when I applied for work, that I was
not experienced in a professional sense. I have decorated many
dinner tables&mdash;when my people had money."</p>

<p>"Which means that they have lost it now?"</p>

<p>"I should not be at work it they had it still."</p>

<p>"Good!" Jack stood up, towering above her. "Get your hat and
things, we're going out."</p>

<p>"Where?" The girl did not move. Something told her that her
plans for mid-day were to be seriously disarranged.</p>

<p>"To the Union Club." Jack laughed suddenly. "Is it usual for
assistants to ask their employers where they are taking
them?"</p>

<p>"I believed that I was engaged to work in the shop." Ivy spoke
evenly.</p>

<p>Jack Lorne spoke quickly, just as she turned to the door.
"Wait a moment, Miss France. I have made a mistake. You are new
to the business, and I should have told you where I propose to
take you, and for what reason. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Ivy lifted her eyes to his, and smiled. She was
beginning to like Jack Lorne, in spite of the suspicions that
crowded around him in her mind.</p>

<p>By the time Ivy was ready for the streets a small motor car
stood before the flower-shop door, Jack Lorne at the wheel. He
motioned her to take the seat beside him and immediately drove
off.</p>

<p>"Here a the position, Miss France." Jack spoke suddenly as
they turned into the main street. "There's a dinner at the Union
Club to-night. The man who usually does their decorations has
been taken ill. They sent for me this morning, and asked if I
would take over the work. I said I would, in spite of the fact
that Miss Ames, who attends to these matters for you, is
otherwise engaged to-day. I had to find someone else, and I chose
you."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Ivy spoke cautiously.</p>

<p>Lorne had paused as if he required an answer. "The position is
this," Jack continued. "I want the club's work, and I can get it
if this goes through all right. I took the chance, although I
hadn't the faintest idea at the moment who to put on to it. Then
I heard of a girl who specialises in that sort of thing. But when
I telephoned her I found that she was engaged for the day. I
looked up from the telephone&mdash;and you were looking at me. I
thought then that you looked as it you had taste&mdash;so I took
a risk on you."</p>

<p>"You thought I had taste because I was looking at you?" The
girl spoke gravely. Then, as he suddenly turned to her in
surprise, she laughed. He laughed with her&mdash;and they found
that the barriers had tumbled down.</p>

<p>The car came to a halt before the doors of the Union
Club&mdash;the place to which Ivy had chased the "unknown' the
previous evening. Ivy descended from the car and waited for her
employer. He led her into the building to the head steward's
room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cantor, I want to introduce you to Miss France&mdash;one
of my most talented assistants." Jack spoke gravely, but his hand
on Ivy's arm closed slightly. "I am sure she will do your tables
justice."</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, miss," The stout, ruddy-faced man behind
the desk got up laboriously and came found to shake hands with
the girl.</p>

<p>"If you will come with me I will show you the banquet
hall."</p>

<p>He led them to a wonderful old room, ceilinged with a big dome
filled with coloured glass. Ivy looked about her with admiration.
What a wonderful setting for a big dinner, and in spite of Jack
Lorne's words she was beginning to think that the work before her
was big and important.</p>

<p>"I'll have my men lay the tables for you immediately, Miss
France," said the head steward.</p>

<p>"If you please&mdash;no."</p>

<p>The girl turned to face the two men, "I want the
things&mdash;the linen, the glass, silver, cutlery, and all that.
But I want to lay the table&mdash;do everything myself. I&mdash;I
can see something." She swung round, sweeping the room with her
glance. "Oh, this place can be made!"</p>

<p>"That wasn't in our agreement, Mr. Lorne." Cantor frowned.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;now." Jack spoke grimly. "From now on Miss France
has sole charge of this room, until she admits your waiters for
the banquet, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The head steward looked at the florist, startled.</p>

<p>"That's it!" Jack grinned. "I want the work, just because I
fancy these sort of jobs: but my representative has all the
say."</p>

<p>He turned to Ivy: "What do you want from the shop?"</p>

<p>"I will come back and get what I want&mdash;may I?"</p>

<p>"You're boss." The man turned at the door. "Say, you'll have
some running about to do, it you're taking over the full
management of this show. Drive a car?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave you mine. I can get a tram back to near the
shop. Get to it, girl, and&mdash;" he lowered his voice to a
whisper. "&mdash;don't let me down."</p>

<p>With the head steward he turned to the door. On the threshold
he looked back at the girl and nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>The sudden assignment to decorate the tables at the Union Club
for a big function had swept Ivy's resentment of her very
subordinate position at the shop from her mind. Here she was in
full control of a big work, with an army of men and girls to
carry out her orders. Almost she forgot her personal affairs. For
more than a quarter of an hour she wandered about the big hall,
watching the daylight effects on the coloured glasses of the
roof; switching on and off the grouped lights in the
room&mdash;waiting, thinking, to get the ideas forming clearly in
her mind.</p>

<p>At last she was ready. She went to the head steward's office.
"Mr. Cantor, has the club a permanent electrician?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss France. Do you want the lighting altered?"</p>

<p>"Yes, extensively." Then, noting the dismay spreading on the
man's face, she laughed. "I am not going to disarrange your
permanent fittings. All I want will be temporary and easily taken
away after the dinner is over."</p>

<p>Then she exclaimed, suddenly: "Come with me!" She led the man
into the hall and commenced to talk rapidly. Slowly the doubtful
look on the head steward's face gave way to one of
satisfaction&mdash;and he laughed.</p>

<p>"Do that, my girl, and the club will kiss you, all round. Now,
why the devil hasn't anyone thought of that before?"</p>

<p>Abruptly Ivy dismissed the man, ordering the electrician to be
sent to her immediately; to be followed by the club waiters with
the linen and silver. Half-an-hour later she ran out of the
building, jumped into the waiting car, and drove down to the
shop.</p>

<p>There she found her status had changed, almost alarmingly. She
was no longer the newest, the least experienced assistant. She
was the expert, issuing her orders rapidly and with
certainty&mdash;orders that had to be obeyed on the spot. She
collected what she required for immediate use and went back to
the club.</p>

<p>Half-way on the journey she suddenly drew the car to the curb,
and stopped. She sat back, laughing softly. A strange thought had
come to her. Would the "unknown" be among the guests at the
banquet that night? She believed he would. He had appeared to be
an important man at the "Palido." Was he equally important at the
Union Club? If so, then&mdash;if the "unknown" was one of the
guests at the banquet, then she held him in the hollow of her
hand. She had determined to be at the banquet when it started.
Probably Jack would be there also. That would not make any
difference. A slight alteration in her plans of lighting and
decorations, and&mdash;Again she laughed as she put her car into
gear, and drove on.</p>

<p>One o'clock came, almost before she guessed the hour. She went
to the car and drove down to the shop. Leaving the car in the
narrow street, with a request in the shop that it be there in an
hour's time.</p>

<p>Ivy walked up to Macquarie Street and found Mary and the
taxi-driver. In the taxi, she leaned forward, as the man carried
them rapidly to Hill Street, giving him directions&mdash;the
orders she had thought out the previous night&mdash;modified by
the happenings of that day. The man grinned broadly, and nodded.
"Goin' a bit outside the law, ain't you, miss," he said at
length.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Ivy taunted. "It's only a practical joke!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," the man bridled. "But what's behind all
this?"</p>

<p>"I told you&mdash;a joke."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;?" Ivy thought quickly. The man looked honest. She
would tell him&mdash;something.</p>

<p>"Mr. Powers," she spoke earnestly. "I told you my name last
night. Do you connect anything with it? No? Well, let me tell
you. My godfather brought me up to believe that I was to be his
heiress. He died suddenly, leaving me only a buhl box. In it was
the photograph of a man and a letter, instructing me to find that
man."</p>

<p>"The photograph of the man we traced to the Union Club last
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll help. The rotter! But, say," the man hesitated. "What
about the other fellow&mdash;the one who went to the Palido with
the girl?"</p>

<p>"He is trying to prevent me getting my fortune."</p>

<p>"And he knows this man at the Union Club!" Powers mused.
"Righto-o! I'm on it now. Go the limit, miss. You're my boss.
Worst that can happen to me is six months&mdash;and I'll do that
on my head for a pretty girl like you!"</p>

<p>Ivy was satisfied, catching at Mary's hand and squeezing it
hard. A few minutes later the taxi drew up before the offices of
Tinker &amp; Tinker, solicitors.</p>

<p>Ivy found everything prepared for her at the solicitor's
offices. Abel Tinker, the senior partner, had been advised of her
probable call, and had a large, well-filled envelope ready to his
hand.</p>

<p>"There's the packet in question, Miss Breton," he said
briskly. "You notice that it is sealed. That is the condition in
which my client received it from Mr. Sixsmith. Do you recognise
the seal?"</p>

<p>Ivy nodded. She took her godfather's seal from her bag and
handed it to the solicitor. He compared it with the wax
impression on the envelope.</p>

<p>"That's the seal, Miss Breton. Now I will ask you to give me a
receipt for the packet. You notice that it has not been opened,
so we can't check the contents. Are you prepared to give me a
blanket receipt for a packet containing unknown papers, deposited
with Mr. Harold Pender by Mr. Basil Sixsmith, unopened? I may say
that the instructions on the envelope permit us to take your
receipt in full discharge of the trust."</p>

<p>Again the girl nodded. Mr. Tinker drew a receipt and handed
the girl his pen. She signed the paper and picked up the
packet.</p>

<p>"Will you please thank Mr. Pender for me, Mr. Tinker," she
said, as she turned to the door. "Or shall I write and thank him?
It was good of him to take all this trouble for&mdash;for
godfather."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, Miss Breton." The lawyer smiled. "Suppose I
thank him when I see him, and you drop him a line. We men like
notes of thanks from young ladies."</p>

<p>With a chuckle at his own words, he escorted her to the door.
In the car Ivy handed the packet to Mary.</p>

<p>"Take this home with you, dear, and hide it. I can't have it
with me all the afternoon, and I don't want to leave it with Mr.
Kithner."</p>

<p>She turned to her driver.</p>

<p>"Back to Masters Street, Mr. Powers, please."</p>

<p>At the corner of Masters Street and Macquarie Street Ivy
alighted with Mary.</p>

<p>"You know what to do now, Mr. Powers," Ivy said. "When you
have had lunch, please go down to the Union Club. If you see me
about, please don't recognise me unless I give you some
sign."</p>

<p>The man nodded, saluted, and drove off.</p>

<p>Ivy took her companion down to the shop and there obtained
another load of flowers for the Union Club. Then she drove the
car to a tea-shop, where they had a hasty lunch. It was nearly an
hour later when Ivy reached the club again. After they had
lunched she had driven Mary home, then returned to the city. When
she entered, the banquet hall she found that the electricians had
completed their work.</p>

<p>"Great effect, miss." The head man went to the switchboard he
had established in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Have a look!" He depressed the switches, one after the other.
Ivy was delighted. She had visualised and planned a beautiful
scheme of lighting&mdash;something she believed to be original,
but nothing approaching what the electricians had realised from
her outline. Now, when she had accomplished the decorations of
the table, she would be able to give the diners a
surprise&mdash;and perhaps one of them a slight shock.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss France?" Ivy swung round to see Jack Lorne
standing beside her. "How is the work progressing. Mr. Cantor
tells me you are developing ideas."</p>

<p>In a few brief words Ivy described the design of decorations
she had originated, and the means she planned to carry them out.
Jack was delighted and unstinted in his praise. He left her,
wandering about the big, beautiful hall, scrutinising it
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Ivy turned to her work. She had much to do and little time to
accomplish it in. Then she intended, when she had finished with
the hall, to go home and dress. She intended to be at the
gathering of the diners, concealed behind the palms hiding the
switchboard: her fingers would depress the levers, ordering the
effects she had planned and created. Bound up in her work, she
was surprised to find Jack Lorne again beside her, looking down
on her with curiosity in his eyes.</p>

<p>She smiled up, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Miss France." The man spoke slowly and quietly. "What do you
know of Ivy Breton?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; A MINT OF
MONEY</h2>

<p class="first">THE girl's heart missed a beat. She stared up at
the man, unable to speak. Then she remembered what she had said
in the shop the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>She had told one of the assistants that she knew Ivy Breton.
Well, she did. Who could know her as well as she knew herself!
She had said that she had been at school with her. That was true.
Ivy Breton had never been at school unless accompanied by the
girl Jack Lorne knew as Muriel France.</p>

<p>"Well?" The cool tone, the level word, stiffened Ivy. She
turned to face the man.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Miss Breton." She turned again to her work. "I
suppose your brother reported to you that he had heard me tell
one of the girls that.</p>

<p>"He did." The man answered with a ghost of a smile on his
lips. "But you have not answered my question. What do you know of
Ivy Breton?"</p>

<p>"I know Ivy Breton." The girl's tones were icy. "It
happens&mdash;It may interest you to learn&mdash;that Miss Breton
is my friend."</p>

<p>"A fortunate girl." Jack's smile broadened. "Now, will you
please tell me all you know about her?"</p>

<p>"May I ask in what way Miss Breton interests you, Mr.
Lorne?"</p>

<p>"I went to see her yesterday."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" Ivy's fingers were working quickly among the
flowers. "And&mdash;previous to your visit?"</p>

<p>"I had heard of her."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Is more necessary?"</p>

<p>"Yet you have asked me to tell you all I know of my friend.
That is rather a big order, in view of the confidence you have
placed in me."</p>

<p>"I can assure you, Miss France, that I am only asking
information for Miss Breton's good."</p>

<p>"Yet you say you only called on her yesterday." Ivy paused.
"Was that the first time you had met her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You had no other communication with her?"</p>

<p>"I had telephoned her previously, asking for an
interview."</p>

<p>"What did she reply?" Ivy laughed; then, daringly: "Did she
tell you that she always obtained her flowers from 'Lorne,
florists'?"</p>

<p>The man laughed heartily. "She did not. I am afraid I forgot
to mention the shop. That was remiss of me. A good business man
never forgets a word in season&mdash;or out of it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mentioned something else you are interested
in?"</p>

<p>A quirk of mischief seized the girl's brain. "You may have
forgotten the flower shop, and mentioned&mdash;some other
business."</p>

<p>"What other business?" A dull flush spread on the young man's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"How can I possibly know?" Ivy laughed. "From the manner in
which you are cross-questioning me, shall I venture&mdash;a
detective agency&mdash;"</p>

<p>An involuntary movement showed the girl that her remark had
struck home. For a moment the man did not reply.</p>

<p>"And that telephone conversation was the first
communication&mdash;the first time you had come in contact with
Miss Breton?" Ivy's face was hidden by masses of flowers.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not quite."</p>

<p>"Am I to know&mdash;or is it so close a secret that it cannot
be mentioned in the midst of a vast, lonely banquet hall?"</p>

<p>"Miss Breton might not like me to mention it. You see&mdash;"
He flushed again.</p>

<p>Now Ivy blushed also. She knew that he was referring to her
attire on the night of the burglary. She was furious with
him&mdash;and herself. With an effort she steadied.</p>

<p>"Was the occasion so&mdash;so illegal?"</p>

<p>Again she found the crevice in his armour. He turned and
stared at her. "Miss France&mdash;" He paused, unable to frame
his sentence. "Have you seen Miss Breton lately."</p>

<p>"I see her often." The girl was thinking of the mirror in her
bag.</p>

<p>"Then she told you?"</p>

<p>"Ivy tells me everything&mdash;as <i>you</i> must if you want
to getinformation from me."</p>

<p>"And if the secret is not my own?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p>"That means you will not give me the information I have asked
for?"</p>

<p>The girl did not answer. What could she say? She knew that she
was beset by enemies, people who appeared inclined to go to any
lengths to deprive her of whatever her godfather had left her.
She had to walk warily, sifting the good from the bad as she
gained in knowledge. This man had asked for her
confidence&mdash;under her guise of friendship for&mdash;herself.
He was asking her to betray herself. What was at the back of his
mind? Were his intentions favourable to herself, or not?</p>

<p>Somehow she felt inclined to trust him. She could not think of
him otherwise than honest. She glanced up, almost furtively, into
his grave, troubled face. Yes, he would make a nice friend. Why
had not her godfather placed his photograph in the buhl box
instead of that of Harold Pender?</p>

<p>Again she flushed. Why had this man so much power to incommode
her? She felt herself helpless, distrait and weak of purpose when
near him. She wanted now to get away from him&mdash;from things;
or to throw all her burdens on his broad shoulders&mdash;and
rest.</p>

<p>Now she knew, and the knowledge brought the soft colour to her
cheeks, him. Why should she not? She knew that her one impulse
was to trust him. Why should she not? The business he was trying
to probe, for some undisclosed reason, was entirely hers. She
could do what she liked with her own affairs. There was no one on
earth&mdash;now&mdash;to say her nay. If she spoke openly to him;
told him all he wanted to know; answered his questions fully and
freely: what would he think of her. If she told him everything,
concealing only the one fact&mdash;that she was Ivy Breton, and
that she had obtained a position in his shop to probe his
secrets&mdash;what would he think of her? Would he believe that
she, Muriel France, was a good friend to Ivy Breton?</p>

<p>"Miss France&mdash;" Jack paused, then commenced again. "Miss
France, will you not trust me&mdash;take my word that I mean your
friend no ill?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"How can I? The secret is not mine."</p>

<p>The man turned abruptly and left the hall. Ivy bent to her
work again, the salt tears dimming her sight. Jack had asked her
to trust him&mdash;but he had not thought fit to trust her.
And&mdash;and he had so much to explain.</p>

<p>Why had he crept from her house, a thief in the night? True,
he had rescued her from another thief. But, had he? Could she
believe his statement, unsupported by any evidence? Some instinct
told her that she could&mdash;she must!</p>

<p>A few moments, and she flung the thought from her, devoting
all her mind, all her energies, to her work. The scene grew apace
under the nimble fingers. Through the long afternoon she
continued until, at last, she stood back, to gaze on a room
transformed. She went to the switches, now hidden behind a bower
of greenery and blooms, and threw on the lights&mdash;to see if
her work was good. Half an hour's further work, mainly performed
by the club stewards, and the room was cleared of all debris. Ivy
went out of the door and locked it. No one was to go in there
until she returned to the club. Then she would open the door to
the club steward and other such notabilities as he should have
gathered, and seek their approval.</p>

<p>The girl laughed slightly. She would show them much, but one
thing she would conceal. That would be revealed when she stood
within the hidden bower, her fingers on the switch. She knew
where the unknown would be seated. Plans of the seating at the
tables had been brought to her earlier in the day. One of her
last tasks had been to place the cards on the tables. Now she
could go home.</p>

<p>In her home lay the packet she had received from Harold
Pender's solicitors that day. What did it contain? Would she find
the secret her godfather's fortune!&mdash;the fortune she
believed he intended for her&mdash;in that packet? It were not
there, where would she find it? But what mattered the fortune, if
one really existed?</p>

<p>She had accepted the task of finding the "unknown" because it
had been her godfather's desire&mdash;the last command he had
laid on her. She had accomplished that task. That night she would
show Harold Pender his photograph&mdash;and demand from him the
truth. He would tell her everything&mdash;she knew that now. In
her hands were means for enforcing her wishes.</p>

<p>Mary and the car were waiting for her at the top of Masters
Street. She drove Jack Lorne's car down to the shop, and left a
report for him&mdash;that the work at the Union Club was
finished. To the report she attached a written message, asking
him to be at the club at a quarter to eight that night&mdash;to
meet her there. Again she added to her message, informing him
that, by arrangement with Mr. Cantor, she had locked up the
banquet room and had retained the key.</p>

<p>Then back to the car, and Mary.</p>

<p>The girls drove home almost in silence, the thought of the
packet to be examined obsessing them. Dinner was a brief, hasty
meal, and then they went to the library. Mary produced the
packet, and, with trembling hands, Ivy slit the envelope. From
the cover she drew out a mass of bulky papers, She unfolded the
first&mdash;and gasped.</p>

<p>It was a bond for one thousand pounds.</p>

<p>She placed it on the desk, and took up another&mdash;and yet
another. When she had opened the last one she sat back, staring
at the pile of papers. She took pencil and paper, and made a
rapid calculation. The pile of papers represented over one
hundred and fifty thousand pounds. And amid the mass of bonds and
script was no letter or message.</p>

<p>What was she to do? To whom did this money belong? She guessed
that it was part of her godfather's estate; a sum of money that
he had not chosen to have lying at the bank, for some unknown
reason. Had he set it aside for some purpose, trusting the secret
to one person&mdash;Harold Pender? Who did this money belong
to?</p>

<p>Certainly she had no claim on it. Mr. Tinker had told her that
the packet had been given to his client, Harold Pender, by her
godfather, as a trust charge, and unopened; that on the envelope
were written instructions that in the event of his death the
packet was to be placed in her hands, unopened.</p>

<p>Why had he done that? Surely her godfather had known that the
bonds and certificates had to go to his estate&mdash;that she had
no claim on them? Even it he had desired her to have some claim
on them, why had he not written some message or instructions to
that effect, and enclosed it with the securities? She could not
take them, conceal their existence from everybody.</p>

<p>She would have to hand them to Mark Kithner, and he would,
when the estate was settled, pass them on to Mrs. Western. Had
that been her godfather's intention&mdash;a test of her loyalty
and honesty? Ivy could not believe that. No, he had intended them
for her. Then, why had he not mentioned them in his will?
Whatever she might believe to be her godfather's intentions he
had, himself, foiled them. She could not honestly take the
script.</p>

<p>Yet she sat on, thinking; fingering the papers which
represented so much wealth. She drew pad and pencil to her again,
and made some rapid calculations. Some of the papers were share
certificates, inscribed to her godfather. Others were bearer
bonds that could not be traced, except by their numbers.</p>

<p>But did anyone know that her godfather possessed them? If she
gave up the certificated stock and kept the bonds, she would have
enough to keep herself in luxury for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>The temptation brought little beads of perspiration around her
eyes; it dampened the palms of her hands. She tried to think.
Why had her godfather placed this burden on her shoulders? Surely
he may have realised the thoughts that would come to her mind. He
must surely have known that his will stood; that under it she
must, honestly, hand the packet and the contents to his
estate.</p>

<p>On sudden impulse she bundled the papers and thrust them into
an envelope, then turned to the big safe. She opened it, and
thrust in the packet.</p>

<p>"That's the end of that, Mary!" she observed quietly. "I can't
take the money, can I?"</p>

<p>Almost she wished that the girl would deny her, but Mary shook
her head. "I'll take them to Mr. Kithner to-morrow."</p>

<p>A choke came in the girl's throat. "He must take
them!&mdash;and&mdash;do the proper thing. But it was cruel of
godfather, Mary, it was cruel!"</p>

<p>"Wait." Mary spoke suddenly. "Wait, Ivy. There may be a way
out for you."</p>

<p>"A way out? How?" Ivy swung round to face the elder girl.</p>

<p>"I think you should wait." Mary spoke with deliberation. "You
see, you have the money and nothing to show what were your
godfather's intentions. Wait a day or two, Ivy. The money has
come to you strangely, and perhaps it will be followed by some
message. Now, go upstairs and dress. You have to be at the Union
Club under the hour, dear."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; THE
FLOWER-GIRL</h2>

<p class="first">A KNOCK came at the door as Ivy was finishing
dressing. She called a reply, and Mary entered. "Ready, dear."
Then the girl added more quickly. "Get down to the telephone.
There's someone asking for you. He won't give a message."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Fred Powers. He seems to want you urgently. I tried&mdash;"
Ivy ran out of the room and down the stairs. In the library, she
snatched up the receiver. "Miss Breton here! Is that Mr.
Powers?"</p>

<p>"The same, miss. Thought I'd call you up to tell you that the
gent's at dinner, miss. First time I've had a chance of getting
away from him."</p>

<p>"Where is he? At the Union Club?"</p>

<p>"No, miss, At the Palido."</p>

<p>Ivy wondered. She knew that Harold Pender was due at the
dinner at the Union Club. Then why was he dining at the Palido?
She had placed his card before his seat at the club. Why did he
want two dinners on the one night?</p>

<p>She looked down at her wrist watch. It was a quarter-past
seven. A frown came on her brow. Here was something she could not
explain. She turned to the telephone again.</p>

<p>"What has Mr. Pender done since you picked him up, Mr.
Powers?"</p>

<p>"Got him soon after I went to the club." The man laughed
slightly. "I just managed to get my flag up before he got sight
of my car. He hopped in and told me to go to Tinker &amp; Tinker.
You know. The place I drove you to this morning. He stayed there
quite a while, and when he came out he had a sheet of paper in
his hand. He slipped it into his pocket as he jumped into the
car."</p>

<p>"He told you to wait?"</p>

<p>"He hadn't, miss, but I waited. I thought he might be
suspicious when he found me still there, and I made some excuse
that the engine hadn't been turning over right. He only grunted
and asked me if it was well enough for me to drive him to 'Lorne,
florists.'"</p>

<p>Ivy gasped. "Do you know what he wanted there?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He came out with a big box of flowers, miss, and put them in
the car. Told me to take them down to the Palido and leave them
there for him. Said that if I gave them the box they would know
what to do with it."</p>

<p>"Strange!" Ivy spoke the word to herself, but the man at the
other end of the line overheard her.</p>

<p>"Not so strange as you'd think, miss. There's plenty as buys
flowers and sends 'em by taxi to the Palido, and such-like
places. More'n likely they're to decorate the table."</p>

<p>"What happened then?"</p>

<p>"I had to leave him, miss. Couldn't get out of it. So off I
went to the Palido and gave up the flowers. Didn't worry me much,
for I had his name then&mdash;it was on the box, H. G. Pender.
When I handed in the flowers I went back to the Union Club. Got
word with one of the porters and found he wasn't there then. I
waited a time, and when the chap I had spoken to at the club came
out on a message, I hops up to the door and asked for Mr. Pender.
Of course, they said he wasn't in the club&mdash;I knew that.
Then I asked where I could find him, as I said I had a message
for him. They gave me his telephone number&mdash;said it was in
the directory&mdash;so I soon got hold of his full name and
address. Here it is, miss: H. G. Pender, The Aspley, Macquarie
Street. You know the place; the tall, white building, right in
the centre, overlooking the park. Swagger place, that!"</p>

<p>"But what makes you think he is going to dine at the Palido?"
asked Ivy.</p>

<p>"The box of flowers was addressed there, and in the corner was
written 'For Mr. H. G. Pender's table,'" the man answered
promptly. "There's more, miss. I went and hung about the Aspley.
He came out at last and jumped into a taxi and went down to the
Palido. That was just a quarter of an hour ago. Looks as if he
was stopping there."</p>

<p>"Where are you now, Mr. Powers?"</p>

<p>"In a tea-shop just opposite the Palido. Can keep an eye on
the place from here. He can't get away without my seeing
him."</p>

<p>Ivy was trying to think. What was she to do? Harold Pender was
booked to dine at the big dinner for which she had arranged the
decorations&mdash;yet the taxi-driver was assured that he was
giving a party at the Palido!</p>

<p>"You'll keep in touch with him, Mr. Powers." The girl spoke
urgently. "He mustn't get away from you. And&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
I must arrange some way for you to keep in touch with me. Wait a
moment!"</p>

<p>She had to go to the Union Club.</p>

<p>A glance at her wrist-watch showed that she had barely time to
get there to the time she had arranged. How could she be at the
club and yet keep in touch with this man?</p>

<p>It would be useless for him to communicate with Mary. She
would not know what to do. Suddenly she remembered. There was a
telephone in the banquet room at the Union Club. By chance, the
switchboard had been placed close to it.</p>

<p>If she remained behind the bank of flowers she would be out of
sight of the guests, yet close to the telephone. Yes, that would
do. She could make some excuse that she wanted to watch the
lighting effects through the evening. They&mdash;Mr. Cantor and
Jack Lorne, if he were there&mdash;would not object. She could
tell Mr. Cantor that she expected a telephone message. He would
have the call put through to her in the banquet hall. But, it was
evident that the telephone in the banquet hall was for the use of
the guests. Would it be connected with the club's switchboard, or
direct to the exchange? She had to chance that!</p>

<p>"Please keep careful watch, Mr. Powers, please." She spoke
urgently. "Let me know when you see anything of him again.
Telephone me at the Union Club. Ask for Miss France. I shall near
the telephone in the banquet hall. You will, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure, miss. Certain!" Ivy could almost visualise the man
nodding his head to give emphasis to his words. With a word of
thanks she hung up the receiver and sped to her room.</p>

<p>A few more minutes, and she was ready to leave the house.</p>

<p>A taxi was standing before the door, awaiting her. For a
moment she thought longingly of her own car, but she dared not
take it to the club. If Jack Lorne saw her getting out of a
private car he would wonder. Shop assistants could not rightfully
possess private cars. She thought her carefully-built plans had
crashed to the ground.</p>

<p>From the moment she had accepted the assignment to design and
create the decorations for the banquet she had believed that
Harold Pender would be one of the guests. Her belief had been
confirmed when she found his name on one of the cards given her
with the plan of the tables. She had built on his presence at the
banquet, planning to surprise him into some admission that would
give her a clue to the solution of the mystery in which she was
involved. Now she would have to find some other way. She stamped
angrily.</p>

<p>Why did the man want to make two dinner engagements for the
one night? He couldn't be a gentleman to accept an invitation to
a big dinner, and then give a party at the Palido on the same
night.</p>

<p>The taxi drew up with a jerk at the entrance to the Union
Club. Ivy jumped out and paid the man. As she turned to the
steps, a car came to a stop just behind the taxi.</p>

<p>"Miss France!" She turned to face Jack Lorne, "Good luck for
me, meeting you here. I'm consumed with curiosity."</p>

<p>She laughed, and mounted the steps to the club door by his
side. In the corridor, before the door of the banquet hall, Ivy
produced the key and flung the doors open. The place was shrouded
in darkness, through which was silhouetted the white of the
decorated tables.</p>

<p>Guided by the light of her torch, Ivy went round the room to,
the switchboard. She threw on the ordinary lights and then came
out into the room. Bill Cantor was standing in the doorway,
beside Jack Lorne. She glanced at the two men. They were slowly
scanning the flower-decked room, and a feeling of pride came over
the girl as she saw the expression on their faces. She had done
well&mdash;she realised that&mdash;but she had not expected the
indescribable atmosphere of awe that showed on the men's
faces.</p>

<p>Cantor suddenly left his companion and came to her.</p>

<p>"Splendid, Miss France." He shook hands heartily. "I've never
seen the room looking so well."</p>

<p>"May I echo that&mdash;heartily."</p>

<p>Ivy looked up into Jack's eyes.</p>

<p>"You have made a marvellous job of it&mdash;even without the
lighting effects Mr. Cantor tells me to expect. Now may we see
those?"</p>

<p>The men waited while the girl went behind the shielding bank
of greenery to the switchboard. A moment, and the lights in the
hall were extinguished leaving the place in darkness. Then, from
the roof came a soft glow of coloured lights&mdash;lights shining
through the great frames of many coloured glasses, casting
beautiful shadows over hall and tables. From the massed bank of
flowers on the tables other lights showed, white and coloured,
changing in hues and combinations as the girl's fingers played
with the switches.</p>

<p>Around the hall concealed lights came to life, forming a
veritable scene from fairyland. At last Ivy came from behind the
screen to face the two men in the big hall. Jack turned at the
soft rustle of her skirts, and for a moment looked at her in
silence. Then, with a strange, half-foreign gesture of homage, he
bowed. The stout, ruddy-faced head steward nodded quickly.</p>

<p>"You've struck it, Mr. Lorne," he said. "Miss France is a
wonder! I'll tell the world!"</p>

<p>The girl coloured with pleasure. She had been sure of her
work, but had wondered what the two men would think of it. A
woman would have seen the possibilities before her directly she
entered the hall&mdash;but men might not. She had not been too
sure of her critics.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cantor." The girl spoke suddenly. "May I remain in the
hall after the banquet starts?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" Yet the stout man spoke doubtfully. "You'll have to
take care you're not seen, though."</p>

<p>He walked over to where the switchboard was erected behind the
bank of greenery. "If you care to stay in here. Miss France,
you'll be able to get a fair view. That do? Good! Suppose you
want to see how the diners like your lighting effects?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. That was a good excuse.</p>

<p>"I can get out of that door later," she said, pointing to a
small door else to where they stood. "If your diners see
anything, it will only be the tail of my skirts."</p>

<p>"Don't let them see more." The stout man laughed. "If they
catch you and feel like I do about this decoration business, they
will want to stand you on the table and cheer you."</p>

<p>She made a mocking little curtsey, as sound of voices were
heard in the passage outside the main door, and fled to the
alcove. As she expected, Jack Lorne followed her. She switched on
the main lights in the hall, and waited, very conscious of the
man beside her.</p>

<p>Then Jack left her for a moment, to return dragging a
comfortable chair.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Miss France," he commanded. "You must be dead beat
after this big day's work."</p>

<p>Ivy subsided gratefully into the chair. She wanted to
relax&mdash;to think. Something had gone wrong with her plans.
Even now she was in trouble. Jack Lorne was with her, and any
moment Fred Powers might telephone her.</p>

<p>She could not let this man overhear what she had to say to the
taxi-driver&mdash;overhear what instructions she might have to
give the man. If she spoke too plainly, she might give away her
secret. In some way she must get rid of Jack Lorne. She glanced
up at him, her eyes shielded by her long lashes.</p>

<p>He was standing, half-turned from her, staring out over the
deserted banquet hall. How could she get him to leave her? She
glanced up anxiously at the telephone instrument, almost over her
head. At any moment it might ring to summon her. He would want to
answer it&mdash;and he must not. Perhaps he would leave her after
the banquet started.</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. It still wanted a few minutes to
eight o'clock. The guests were now due to arrive. At the
half-hour the banquet was timed to start!</p>

<p>Could she wait that time? If Harold Ponder stayed at the
Palido&mdash;yes. But would he? Had he been bound to entertain
his guests together at the Palido, and then, while they were
dancing, slip away to the more formal function at the Union Club?
That might be an explanation of his actions. Then, at any moment,
she might expect Fred Powers to telephone the news that the
"unknown" was on his way to the Union Club.</p>

<p>"Miss France." Ivy looked up, startled. "Have you thought of
what I asked you this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You mean about Miss Breton?" The girl shook her head. Then in
sudden impulse; "Why don't you tell me what you want to know? You
asked me to tell you everything. That was far too big an
order."</p>

<p>For a moment he waited, looking down at her. Suddenly he
smiled.</p>

<p>"Very well, I will take you at your word. I want to know it
Miss Breton is engaged to be married to her&mdash;no, he is no
relation of hers!'</p>

<p>"Miss Breton is not engaged to be married." Ivy spoke
impulsively, much startled. "Who told you that
absurd&mdash;rumour?"</p>

<p>"Is it a rumour?" Jack laughed shortly. "Look her, Miss
France, you say you are an intimate friend of Miss Breton's.
Well, you know that she expected to inherit a big fortune from
her godfather. She didn't, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is the first time I have heard that Ivy Breton expected
her godfather to leave her anything!" The girl spoke indignantly.
"You know Mr. Sixsmith had relations?"</p>

<p>"A half-sister who has a cub of a son." Jack snapped the
words.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and that Mr. Sixsmith had very little property to
leave when he died?"</p>

<p>Ivy carefully repressed any mention of the stocks and bonds
that had come into her hands that day.</p>

<p>"But Basil Sixsmith was a very rich man!" Jack stared in
astonishment. "Why&mdash;" he paused. "Look here. Miss France!
You've shown me that you can keep your counsel. I'll tell you a
secret. Mr. Sixsmith was a partner with me in my business. He put
in more than two-thirds of the capital."</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Just exactly what I have said." The young man flushed under
her steady regard. "That's why I want to know something about
Miss Breton. You see, she's really my partner now. When I got
beached through the death of my parents, old Kithner went to a
lot of trouble to get my affairs straight. There was a certain
amount of money free, after my father's estate was settled. I
wanted to try this flower game, but there wasn't enough capital.
Mr. Kithner introduced me to Mr. Sixsmith, and we went into
things thoroughly. In the end he offered to finance the business
on the lines I had laid down on condition that I took the
personal management of it. He added some further
conditions&mdash;things I hadn't dared to bring forward."</p>

<p>"What conditions?"</p>

<p>"He thought it was no good going into a shop and waiting on
the professional growers. He said that we had to have our own
nurseries. I had thought of that, but had cut out the idea from
my plans, for I knew that I hadn't enough capital to go into the
matter in that fashion. My capital was barely sufficient to open
a shop in the right quarter of the city. Well, Mr. Sixsmith made
me get out a lot of new plans, and in the end advanced all the
money I wanted. He had a deed of partnership drawn up,
and&mdash;and&mdash;well, that's the lot of it!"</p>

<p>"But Mr. Kithner should have placed Mr. Sixsmith's interest in
your business to the estate accounts&mdash;and he deliberately
told Mrs. Western and&mdash;Ivy&mdash;that there was only the
house and its contents, and the money in the bank."</p>

<p>"And so far as I was concerned, he was quite right." Jack
laughed. "You see, Mr. Sixsmith had no time for his half-sister.
To prevent her getting her fingers in my business, in the event
of anything unforeseen happening to him, he executed a transfer
of his interest in the business to his god-daughter, Ivy
Breton."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Ivy stared.</p>

<p>Then a noise at the door attracted her attention. She turned
to gaze down the room. Two men were walking into the hall, and
one of them was Harold Pender.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE SPECTRE
AT THE FEAST</h2>

<p class="first">FOR the moment Ivy hesitated; then turned to
face her companion.</p>

<p>"You were saying?" she questioned slowly. "I am so sorry, Mr.
Lorne; I am afraid I did not quite understand you."</p>

<p>Jack smiled. He had not missed her involuntary start, and
wondered what was the connection between the girl at his aide and
the two men who had just entered the banquet hall.</p>

<p>"I was trying to explain my interest in Miss Breton," he said,
patiently. "You see, she is my partner now, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;Ivy your partner!" The girl suppressed a desire to
laugh. She had never conceived a situation like this could
develop.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought Mr. Paul Lorne, your brother, was your
partner."</p>

<p>"I wish he was." Jack answered whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>"He is the best of fellows! I'd give my ears to have him with
me. But Paul's set on being a doctor&mdash;and he'll make a fine
one. He comes down to the shop sometimes to give me a hand."</p>

<p>"And you?" The girl looked at the man curiously. "Have you no
ambitions?"</p>

<p>"Is not 'Lorne, florists' a satisfied ambition?" he asked
gently, yet for a moment a light lingered in his eyes. "You know
the old quotation; 'To make two blades of grass grow where one
grew before.' Is not that worthy?"</p>

<p>"All work is worthy." Ivy glanced up the hall. It was now
filled with little groups of men chatting idly, waiting for the
function to commence.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are disappointed with me?"</p>

<p>A slight irritableness shook the man. "Miss France, you are
terribly direct. I will answer your question as I never thought
to answer that question to anyone. I have&mdash;had other
ambitions, but they had to be set aside. I had to follow the only
road open to me." He paused a moment. The girl nodded. "Does she
know this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No." The answer was spontaneous.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Sixsmith died I asked Mr. Kithner what was to be
done. He replied: 'Nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Then you are not willing to take his advice?" Ivy was trying
to accustom herself to the fact that a definite link existed
between herself and this man&mdash;a business link.</p>

<p>"I did, for a time." Jack hesitated. "Then I wondered if I was
doing right. I heard that Mr. Sixsmith had left her only a small
token&mdash;that he was supposed to have been a ruined man at the
time of his death. I knew that was incorrect, for 'Lorne,
florists' is now quite a valuable property. Not only the shop,"
he added, noting her look of surprise.</p>

<p>"You remember, Mr. Sixsmith had insisted that we had our own
nurseries. I can assure you that Miss Breton need not do a stroke
of work unless she wishes to. I have heard that she is looking
for a situation."</p>

<p>"I believe she has work." Ivy laughed silently. She looked at
the great hall, a monument to her skill as a decorator. "I think
that she has work that she likes."</p>

<p>"Will she continue to like it&mdash;stick to it&mdash;when she
knows that she is a partner in 'Lorne, florists'?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Ivy turned to the switchboard, her fingers seeking
the levers. "Wait, Mr. Lorne. I think they are about to commence
the dinner."</p>

<p>A tall, fine-looking old man, dressed in correct, if somewhat
old-fashioned cut evening attire, had moved to the head of the
main table, rapping on the linen with an ivory mallet. The groups
about the table broke up, the individuals sauntering to their
places.</p>

<p>"Sir Michael Nairne." Jack indicated the chairman to the
girl.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen." The chairman waited until there was silence. "I
bid you welcome to this board. I hope you will enjoy your dinner.
Afterwards, when the more serious business of the evening has
passed, perhaps some of our friends will have something to say to
you. I believe I have a message, myself."</p>

<p>As Sir Michael sat down, Ivy's fingers depressed the levers.
The lights in the great hall dimmed gradually. From high up
outside the domed ceiling, the lights streamed down through the
many coloured glasses, casting fantastic shadows on the tables
and the guests. Slowly the girl brought the lights to their full
strength, then with a quick manipulation, shut off the white
lights in the hall.</p>

<p>From amid the massed plants, foliage and flowers in the hall
and on the tables, little lights began to glow, adding their
radiance to the lights from the high roof. The tables became a
mass of sparkling points of light, some coloured, others taking
their colours from the lights that streamed down from
overhead.</p>

<p>Along the line of tables blossoms, banked and serried, moved
as it stirred by some interior convulsion. They changed
formations, opening out to reveal large crystal bowls of
sparkling water, in which gleamed yet more lights. From the bowls
jets of water sprang high into the air, to fall in bewildering
rainbows again into the bowls.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Jack turned to his companion, a light of admiration
in his eyes. "Miss France, you have accomplished wonders."</p>

<p>And so thought the guests at the banquet. For a moment guests
and waiters remained spellbound, then burst into spontaneous
applause.</p>

<p>"You like it, Mr. Lorne?" Ivy turned to face her unsuspecting
partner, a light in her eyes. "I wondered if you would
approve."</p>

<p>"Approve? Why, it's immense!" The young man could not restrain
his appreciation. "'Lorne, florists' owe you a deep debt of
gratitude. For the time, may one of the partners express it to
you?"</p>

<p>"Not both of them?" The girl questioned demurely,</p>

<p>"Both?" For a moment the young man hesitated, then grinned
broadly. "I can answer for the name&mdash;'partner,'" he added.
"You will have to answer for Miss Breton. I don't know her."</p>

<p>"Yet you called on her yesterday?"</p>

<p>"You know that?"</p>

<p>"I told you; Ivy tells me everything."</p>

<p>"And you reciprocate?"</p>

<p>"I try to," very demurely.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" he hesitated. "Now you have a secret to conceal
from her."</p>

<p>"Yes?" For the moment Ivy did not understand.</p>

<p>"'Lorne, florists.'" Jack laughed.</p>

<p>"Why should not Ivy know?"</p>

<p>"I want to tell her myself&mdash;presently."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>The man did not answer for a moment. The girl repeated
her question.</p>

<p>"What do you think she will do when she knows?"</p>

<p>He answered her question with another. "Why?"</p>

<p>Again he did not reply. Suddenly she turned to him. "Jack
Lorne, you are afraid that Ivy Breton might want to interfere in
the business."</p>

<p>"She might try to."</p>

<p>"Just because her godfather invested money in your business,"
she hesitated. "Do you think women are like that?"</p>

<p>"Some are."</p>

<p>"You've seen Ivy. Do you think she would interfere with
you?"</p>

<p>"She looks very capable," The momentary hesitation between the
last words did not escape the girl. She flushed indignantly; then
laughed. For the moment she had not realised that Jack was
referring to Mary Varney.</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;I think I can promise you that Ivy will not
interfere."</p>

<p>She spoke emphatically. "Mr. Lorne, is that half-share in your
business really and truly Ivy's? Doesn't it belong to the
Sixsmith estate?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kithner says not."</p>

<p>"Is he certain?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sixsmith signed a partnership deed with me when he placed
the money required for the flotation of the business in the bank
and approved the plans I had drawn up. Later, at his request, I
signed a new partnership deed, this time with Mr. Kithner, acting
as trustee for Miss Breton. The partnership with Mr. Sixsmith was
cancelled. Thus the matter came out of Mr. Sixsmith's estate. The
only interests in the business now exist between myself and Mr.
Kithner, until Miss Breton arrives at the age of twenty-five."
Jack spoke slowly and distinctly. "Do you understand now?"</p>

<p>Ivy nodded. Her godfather had not left her penniless; he had
not died a ruined man. But why had he scattered and concealed his
wealth so strangely? She had received that day stocks and bonds
representing a huge sum of money, from a man she believed to be
not more than a mere acquaintance of her godfather. Now Jack
Lorne had come to her and told her that she owned a half-share in
his business&mdash;the business in which she was working as a
paid assistant under the name of "France." She believed she could
take this partnership, but the money had to go to the
estate&mdash;it would revert to Mrs. Martha Western.</p>

<p>Strangely now, Ivy thought little of the money. Her triumph of
that night had set her life on a new plane. She now had work in
which she was interested&mdash;in which she had won immediate
success. She would go on with that work until she had proved
herself to the man beside her now until she had convinced him
that women were not all interfering busybodies. Then she would
tell him that she was Ivy Breton, his partner. Perhaps he would
then want her to continue with him&mdash;to continue working in
the business, as his partner.</p>

<p>"What is Miss Breton's share in the business worth?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>"About a thousand pounds a year." Jack, startled, looked down
at the girl. "Honour bright, Miss France! Not a word of this to
anyone until I give you leave."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered his look straightly. "I promise you shall
be the first person to tell Ivy Breton."</p>

<p>An imp of mischief was dancing in the girl's eyes as she
spoke. Jack Lorne should, indeed, be the first person to tell Ivy
Breton. He had told her, though he was entirely innocent of that
fact. And Ivy Breton, now that she knew, would do what she liked
with the information. Yet in many ways she was hampered by her
promise. Jack knew her as Muriel France&mdash;and Muriel France
must keep faith. In that she was as bound by her promise as it
she were not Ivy Breton.</p>

<p>But&mdash;Again the sparkle of mischief glowed in her eyes.
Jack Lorne would have to be punished for his remarks about Ivy
Breton. "She looked very capable!" Yes, Jack Lorne should find
her, indeed, capable; so capable that he would have to go almost
to his knees to retain her in the business.</p>

<p>Now Ivy was watching the tables in the centre of the hall. The
correct and severely garbed diners; the silent, swift-moving
shadows of waiters, flitting between the long rays of coloured
lights. Her time had almost come. Soon the serious part of the
dinner would be over. The cloths would be withdrawn, and the
waiters would retire. Then she could act.</p>

<p>She glanced from the man beside her to the telephone. Why had
not Fred Powers telephoned her? Had he left the duty he had
promised to perform for her and missed the "unknown" when he
left the night-club to come to the Union Club?</p>

<p>That was possible. If he had stayed at his post he could not
have missed the man, for Cann Street was not crowded at that hour
of the night. Few vehicles went down it after the warehouses were
closed. Practically the only traffic was to and from the Palido.
If Fred Powers had remained on guard, then he could have followed
the man anywhere. Yet he had not telephoned her. Had he deserted
her interests; left her to carry out her purpose alone?</p>

<p>But that did not matter now. The "unknown" was in that room,
seated at the table in the place she had prepared for him. Again
her glances wandered over the guests. The waiters were removing
the cloths from the tables. In a few minutes they would have
removed the remains of the feast and closed the doors behind
themselves. Then her opportunity would come. She would spring the
trick she had prepared for the man, and watch how he reacted to
it.</p>

<p>She had one danger to face. Jack Lorne was still in the hidden
alcove with her. What would he say if he discovered what she
planned to do? Would he try to prevent her; would he betray her
it she succeeded before he discovered her plans?</p>

<p>She could not help that. She had to act now as if he were not
beside her, trying all she could do to prevent him noticing the
few simple movements she had to make. She must act now, or
forsake all she had planned. Furtively her hand went to the
switchboard, to the row of little levers. She knew which one she
wanted, without looking round. She moved slowly backwards, until
she could reach the switchboard without turning, her eyes passing
alternately from her companion to the men around the table.</p>

<p>Jack was watching Sir Michael Nairne, who had just risen to
his feet. Now was her opportunity. She depressed the little
switch, and waited. For a few seconds nothing happened. Almost
she thought she had failed; then one of the diners sprang to his
feet with a startled cry. For a brief moment he stood staring at
the bowl of water before him; at the tall jet of water rising
from the bowl and falling back in rainbow hues on the coloured
lights in the water. Then, with another cry, he toppled forward
and sideways, rolling from the table amid a scatter of broken
glass and cries of alarm from his neighbours.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE TWO
MEN</h2>

<p class="first">IVY gasped, staring at the man on the floor with
horrified eyes. She had not expected anything like this. All that
she had wanted to do was to shock him into some
admission&mdash;to gain some explanation that might make towards
the solution of the mystery in which she was involved. Was the
man dead?</p>

<p>She threw over the switch and ran into the hall, to the man's
side; pushing through the crowd of guests who had gathered about
his prostrate body.</p>

<p>She knelt by him, feeling for his heart-beats through the
stiff front of his shirt. "Water, please, and a glass of
brandy."</p>

<p>Eager hands served her. She bent over the "unknown" again.</p>

<p>The bloodless, blue-lined lips told their tale. The man
suffered from a weak or diseased heart. The shock had overcome
him.</p>

<p>"Let me come, Muriel." A quiet voice at her side called her
attention from the man. The girl looked up into Jack Lorne's
face.</p>

<p>"Let him lie." She spoke softly, lifting the "unknown's"
head from the floor and slipping under it a cushion someone had
brought her.</p>

<p>"He will be better in a moment."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" One of the men in the clustering group
around spoke. "I never knew Pender to throw a fit before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know." Another, voice answered. "I can remember
one night, not so long ago, in the smoking room, when he went off
like that. Something in the newspaper upset him; went blue round
the lips, but didn't quite lose consciousness. It was quite a
while before we could get him round."</p>

<p>Ivy heard and flinched. What had she done? She had wanted
information, and had not hesitated to scheme anything to serve
her ends. Had she risked this man's life in her mad impulse? She
had acted in ignorance and&mdash;supposing he should die?</p>

<p>For some minutes there was silence in the big hall, broken
only by a few whispered words exchanged among the men in the
groups standing around. Ivy bent over the man, bathing his face
and hands, every now and then forcing a few drops of brandy
between his clenched teeth. At length, he opened his eyes and
looked up into the girl's face. For a moment he looked puzzled,
then smiled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, lowly.</p>

<p>"You fainted, Mr. Pender." The girl answered unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Why?" A long pause; then; "Oh, I remember. I thought I
saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you think you saw?" The girl bent closer to the
man.</p>

<p>"The buhl box&mdash;and&mdash;Basil&mdash;" The man's twisted
lips showed that he was still in pain. "Funny, that! I haven't
given the old box a thought for months."</p>

<p>"How are you, old man?" A man pushed through the group and
knelt beside him. "Better? Good-o! Think you can be moved? Very
well." He straightened and looked round the men nearby.</p>

<p>"Tom! Jim! Give me a hand to carry Harold to the library." Two
men stepped forward. They lifted the sick man and carried him
from the hall. Ivy made to follow. At the door she hesitated and
looked back.</p>

<p>Sir Michael Nairne had resumed the Chair, and was asking the
guests to take their place at the table again&mdash;speaking
sympathetically of the sick man, but obviously trying to smooth
over a disturbing incident and to restore the atmosphere of the
dinner to its former smoothness.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, her hand on the door-handle. Should she
leave the ball and follow the man? Every inclination led to that
action. But&mdash;on the table lay her secret, the means whereby
she had been able to react so strangely on the "unknown."</p>

<p>Dare she leave it unguarded? But what could she do it she
stayed in the hall? The guests were again around the table. She
could only watch and wait. She could not go to the table and
search the decorations, at that time. She would have to wait
until the end of the feast, and then devise some means of getting
into the hall alone.</p>

<p>There was another danger. Jack was in the hall and showed
signs that he intended to stay there. He might become suspicious
and search the alcove. He might examine the switchboard and find
the little switch which worked her apparatus. He might depress
it, and then her secret would be exposed to the diners. Then he
would tax her with treachery.</p>

<p>What excuse could she make to him and the others? She could
find no excuse for herself; now she had only a big
repentance&mdash;that her zeal to solve the mystery she believed
the "unknown" to hold the key of, had led her to work the man
harm. She turned to the door and ran back to the alcove. Jack was
not there. She went to the switchboard and found the wires
leading to the little switch.</p>

<p>Frantically she dragged at them, snapping them from their
connections, pulling them from their loose fastenings on the
wall. She managed to get them free, until the fastenings held
them to the floor. These were too firmly fixed for her. She
looked about her desperately, then quickly re-arranged the
greenery, bringing a few pot plants, to the wall, hiding the
coils of wires she had pulled from the switchboard. Now she would
be safe, until she could get to the table and remove the
apparatus she had concealed amid the flowers. She turned to go
from the alcove, then swung round at the sounds of the telephone
bells. Almost trembling, she went to the instrument and took down
the receiver. "Someone wants to speak to Miss France." The voice
of the switchboard attendant sounded terribly impersonal to the
agitated girl.</p>

<p>"Yes? I am Miss France. Will you please connect me."</p>

<p>A moment's wait, and a man's voice came across the wire. "Miss
France? Fred Powers speaking. I've got to tell you that Mr.
Pender has just left the Palido. He's taken a taxi and driven
off. Do you want me to follow? All right. Then I must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you said Mr. Pender had just left the Palido?"</p>

<p>Ivy gasped. "Why, he's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was standing against the door when he came out. I saw
him quite plainly. There! His taxi's moving. I'll telephone you
directly I discover where he pulls up. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>The connection was suddenly broken. For some moments Ivy stood
with the receiver to her ear, entirely dazed.</p>

<p>What had the man meant? Harold Pender had remained at the
Palido all that time? But for more than two hours he had been
sitting at the table before her. She was certain that she had not
been mistaken in the man. She remembered, after his falling to
the ground&mdash;while she knelt by him that men around her had
spoken his name. She would know him anywhere, for she had taken
particular notice of him when she had first seen him at the doors
of the Palido, and afterwards, in the private boxes corridor at
the G.P.O. What had happened? Had Fred Powers made a mistake?</p>

<p>Yet she could not believe that. She was certain that the man
was honest; she knew that he was intelligent and resourceful. He
had followed the man to the Palido and remained there, on watch.
He had seen the man come out and had immediately telephoned
her.</p>

<p>No, the taxi-driver had not been mistaken&mdash;but neither
had she. Yet somewhere there was a big mistake. She slipped from
the hall into the corridor and asked one of the attendants to
take her to the library. At the door she knocked gently. One of
the men who had carried Pender from the hall opened the door.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I came to see if I could do anything tor Mr. Pender." The
girl spoke quietly, though her heart was beating rapidly. "I was
with him&mdash;attending to him in the hall, you will
remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." The man stepped back, opening the door wider. "Will
you come in, please, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss France." Ivy murmured the name as she passed the man and
went directly to the lounge on which they had laid Harold Pender.
The men standing beside the couch moved back. For a moment she
stared down on the recumbent man. He looked up at her, smiling
weakly.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry to give you so much trouble." He spoke in a
whisper. "Silly of me to pitch over like that! My heart, y'know.
The doctor says it's a bit weak. Any shock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please lie still." The girl's slender hand restrained him as
the man made to sit up. She looked at the standing men over her
shoulder: "Have you sent for the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quayle did that, directly we got Mr. Pender in here."</p>

<p>"Then, if you please, I would like the room to be cleared."
Ivy spoke with an assumption of authority. "Mr. Pender is
suffering from a heart attack, and the quieter he is kept the
sooner he will recover. Will you please let me know immediately
the doctor arrives."</p>

<p>The man who had admitted her, and who was now standing by her
side, nodded. He beckoned his companions, and in silence they
went from the room. Ivy turned her attention to the man on the
couch, trying to make him more comfortable. "You feel better
now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Much better, Miss France. Awfully good of you to trouble
about me. I feel such an abject fool."</p>

<p>"What made you ill?"</p>

<p>"Seeing things." Pender laughed weakly.</p>

<p>"Seeing things? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Seeing the buhl box&mdash;and Basil." The man spoke almost
involuntarily, then laughed. "I thought I saw the buhl box and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;and my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The buhl box!" Ivy spoke partly to herself. "The buhl box!
What buhl box?"</p>

<p>"The one I used to own." The man lay back, his eyes half-shut.
"You know what a buhl box is&mdash;dulled gold, inlaid&mdash;a
queer sort of thing. Old-fashioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You used to own a buhl box." Ivy was startled. "Mr. Pender,
tell me about it. Perhaps if you talk, instead of thinking, you
will find that&mdash;that your fears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fears?" The man laughed lightly. "It was not fear, Miss
France. I thought I saw a buhl box, and&mdash;and a dead
man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Ivy bent closer to the invalid. "You say
that the buhl box used to belong to you. Then you gave it away?
To whom?"</p>

<p>"To a friend&mdash;to Basil Sixsmith,"'</p>

<p>"You gave the buhl box to Mr. Sixsmith?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ivy thought quickly. Her godfather had had the buhl box for
more than a year before he died. She had never asked him how he
had come by it, supposing that he had bought it when wandering,
as he often did, among the antique shops of the city. He had
bought it home and placed it on his desk.</p>

<p>He had always looked on it with particular regard. For what
reason? Could that regard have been tor the giver?</p>

<p>"Listen." She bent over the sick man. "You have called me Miss
France. That is not my name. I am Ivy Breton&mdash;Mr. Sixsmith's
god-daughter. Will you tell me, please: oh, please tell me what
is the secret of the buhl box?"</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! There is someone coming. Keep my secret, please. Here I
am Miss France. I will see you later and explain."</p>

<p>The door of the room had opened again, and a man in evening
dress entered. He came quickly to the side of the couch, moving
with a quick, almost noiseless step. He nodded shortly as the
girl made way for him.</p>

<p>"Old game again, Pender?" The doctor spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>"Same old trouble, doctor." Pender laughed weakly. "Heart went
back on me. Caught up while I was having dinner. Chucked a
faint&mdash;and all that!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" Dr. Unwin slipped his fingers around the man's wrist.
"Feel all right, now? Of course you would. Don't seem to have
been any damage done this time. Feel well enough to go home and
go to bed? I'll come in the morning and vet you."</p>

<p>He went to one of the tables and opened the bag he carried. A
few seconds, and he returned to the side of the couch, holding a
glass in his hand. "Drink this." He waited while the sick man
swallowed the draught, looking at Ivy inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I happened to be in the banquet hall when Mr. Pender
fainted." The girl answered the unspoken enquiry. "I&mdash;I am
responsible for the decorations. When he fell, I went to Mr.
Pender and have tried to look after him until you came."</p>

<p>"Miss France has been wonderfully good." Harold Pender was now
sitting up on the couch. "I am afraid I have been an awful
nuisance to her."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't be any longer." The doctor smiled. "Come on,
man! I'll take you home and see you to bed. Your man can bring on
your car."</p>

<p>Pender got to his feet with some difficulty, catching at the
doctor's arm. He turned to the girl, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, Miss France. You have been very good to me.
Don't forget your promise to come and see me. I know this doc of
old. He'll get me to bed, and keep me there for a week or two, if
he can. Kind of punishment for not obeying orders strictly, you
know." He gripped the girl's hand, then let it go and went slowly
to the door, holding to the doctor's arm. There he hesitated, and
turned. "Don't forget, Miss France. I shall expect you
soon&mdash;and congratulations on your decorations. They are
immense!"</p>

<p>Ivy dropped into a chair, amazed and repentant. Still she
could not understand. Somewhere, somehow&mdash;she had made a
mistake&mdash;a mistake that had almost cost a man his life.</p>

<p>Fred Powers had telephoned her that the "unknown" had left the
Palido at the moment the "unknown" had been carried from the
banquet hall of the Union Club in a fainting fit. What did that
mean? Had she made a mistake? Who had made the mistake? There
couldn't be two "unknowns".</p>

<p>Either she or the taxi-driver had been watching the wrong
man&mdash;and now she knew that she had not! Then Fred Powers had
been following the other man! If only she could get to
him&mdash;if she could see the man he had been following!</p>

<p>What had he said when he telephoned? That he was trailing his
man, and would telephone her again. Where&mdash;to the Union
Club! But he must know that the banquet would soon be over. No,
he would not think of that.</p>

<p>She glanced at her watch. It was only a little after ten
o'clock. Powers would believe that a dinner of this kind would
not terminate before midnight. There would be speeches, perhaps
many of them. She remembered that when Sir Michael Nairne had
opened the dinner he had referred to a list of speeches. Then she
would have to remain in the big hall until the end.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered one of the doctor's questions. He had
asked the sick man if he had his car at the club with him. Pender
had replied that the car was outside. But Fred Powers had
declared that the "unknown" had driven from the Palido in a taxi!
He had said that the man he had been following had taken a taxi
from the Apsley to the nightclub.</p>

<p>She shrugged impatiently. What a mix-up!</p>

<p>Ivy left the library and walked down the corridor to the door
of the banquet room!&mdash;the door close to the alcove in which
she had been all the evening. She opened the door slightly and
peeped in. Someone was speaking, and all eyes were turned in the
speaker's direction, She slipped into the room and went to the
alcove, to see someone sitting in her chair.</p>

<p>"Mr Lorne!"</p>

<p>"Miss France." Jack sprang to his feet. "How is your
invalid?"</p>

<p>"My invalid no longer." The girl laughed slightly. "I have
seen him taken home by his doctor, feeling very much like a
naughty little schoolboy caught in some forbidden act. From what
the doctor said, I believe Mr. Pender is subject to these heart
attacks."</p>

<p>"Awfully awkward, having one right in the middle of the
dinner." Jack stared up the room, frowning. "I did want things to
go right here, to-night. The Union Club means quite a lot of work
for 'Lorne, florists'."</p>

<p>"I don't think they can hold Mr. Pender's fainting fit against
our work." Ivy laughed uncertainly. "Mr. Pender congratulated me
on the decorations, just before the doctor took him away."</p>

<p>Jack Lorne did not answer. He appeared to be listening to the
chairman.</p>

<p>"If only he can get them settled again." Jack spoke under his
breath. "If only he can get them to forget&mdash;" Suddenly he
turned to the girl. "Miss France, what did Mr. Pender mean by
'the buhl box'? I saw a buhl box on Miss Breton's desk when I
called on her. She told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Ivy asked, colouring, as the man paused.</p>

<p>"She told me that it was in the buhl box that she had found
the photograph of the man her godfather had commanded her to
find."</p>

<p>"The photograph you took from her house the night someone
tried to chloroform her." Ivy spoke unthinkingly. "The photograph
you returned to her the next morning with your telephone number
scratched on the back!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! You know that!" The young man stared at the girl
in amazement. "What isn't there Miss Breton doesn't tell
you?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Ivy broke down, turning from Lorne with tears
streaming from her eyes; her throat choked with sobs. Almost
before she realised what had happened she was in Jack's arm, her
face buried against the silk lapels of his coat, utterly ruining
them. And he didn't seem to care one iota.</p>

<p>"Don't, Muriel, don't." His cheek was resting on her
hair&mdash;and she felt most absurdly happy: so happy that she
cried anew.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; "BIG
BOY"</h2>

<p class="first">FOR some moments Ivy rested passive in the man's
arms, then wrenched herself away from him, with flaming
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, how dare you!" she gasped. "I&mdash;I&mdash;" She turned,
snatching up, her cloak and bag. "I must go home, at once!" She
ran to the door, through the entrance, hall of the club, and out
on to the pavement. Jack followed her more slowly, his face
aflame. Ivy ran on, her eyes dimmed with tears.</p>

<p>A taxi drew up beside her, and she almost flung herself at the
door.</p>

<p>"All right, miss?" A familiar voice greeted her, "What's the
matter? That man annoying you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and, pulling open the door, jumped into
the taxi. The car moved on. Ivy turned in her seat and looked
through the little rear window. Jack was standing on the pavement
in evident distress. For a moment the girl sat passive, trying to
co-ordinate her ideas.</p>

<p>What was she to do? For the moment it seemed her world had
tumbled about her ears&mdash;preceded, though, by one glamorous
Incident. She could not go back to the shop. That place was
closed to her for ever. Jack had made her position there
impossible&mdash;or had not she? A quick blush stained throat and
cheeks. What had she been thinking of, to turn to him like that?
But she would have to go back to the Union Club, and that early
the next morning. She would have to clear away "that" which she
had placed amid the decorations on the table. She dared not let
the club attendants see that!</p>

<p>She could get to the Union Club, perhaps, without meeting
Jack. If she went down to the club early&mdash;made some excuse
to Mr. Cantor that she had mislaid something, he would let her
into the banquet hall. Someone from the shop could go to the club
later and clear away the debris, taking back to the shop what
belonged to 'Lorne, florists'.</p>

<p>"Mr. Powers!" She leaned forward, tapping on the glass slide
that separated from the driver. He turned his head, and she
motioned him to stop. He pulled in to the curb. In a moment Ivy
was out of the taxi, and swung open the front door. She slipped
into the seat beside the driver, motioning him to proceed.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me!" The girl had recovered her self-possession.
"Where is Mr. Pender?"</p>

<p>"At home." The man grinned broadly. "I trailed him all the way
there. Saw him get out and pay off the taxi."</p>

<p>"At the Apsley?"</p>

<p>"Sure." For a full minute the girl stared at the man in
amazement. What was he saying? Harold Pender had been at the
Union Club dinner. She had watched him from just before eight
o'clock until he left&mdash;a bare half-hour before she left the
premises herself. Yet this man was stating that he had spent the
evening at the Palido.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?" she questioned doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Sure? Of course I'm sure, miss." The man stared at her in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, miss?"</p>

<p>"Because I saw Mr. Pender at the dinner at the Union Club."
Ivy spoke emphatically. "He had a fainting fit during the dinner
and I attended him. Dr. Unwin took him home in his car, ordering
Mr. Pender's chauffeur to follow."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!"</p>

<p>The man looked so utterly amazed that the girl wanted to
laugh. "But&mdash;but, miss, I'll swear he went to the Palido,
and then to the Apsley in a taxi."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you did not make a mistake in the man?" Ivy
questioned.</p>

<p>Fred Powers shook his head. "I don't make mistakes like that,
miss. It ain't the first time I've had to follow someone. No, not
by a long chalk! We taxi-drivers get some queer jobs!&mdash;and
look out for them. They pay well. No, miss, I marked the man too
well the first time I saw him. Tonight he had on a dinner jacket,
and over it a black coat with silk facings, and he wore one of
them concertina hats&mdash;when he came out of the Palido he
carried it in his hand. I got a real good look at his face and
couldn't mistake him."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. She had watched Harold Pender and the
doctor leave the club. They had walked down to the entrance door
arm in arm. The doctor had paused just opposite the cloak-room
door and questioned his companion. Ivy had been too far away to
overhear the doctor's words, but his gestures were unmistakable.
He had asked Pender if there was anything in the cloak-room he
wanted. The man had shaken his head negatively. He had come in
his own car, wearing neither cloak nor hat.</p>

<p>For some time Ivy pondered her problem in deep silence.
Somewhere there had been a mistake. She roused herself with a
start, as the car pulled up before her own door.</p>

<p>"What about to-morrow, miss?" Powers asked as she alighted.
For a moment the girl deliberated.</p>

<p>"Do the same as you did to-day." She spoke with sudden
resolution. She must know the truth, and she could only get the
truth by constant watchfulness. What if the man she had been
watching at the Union Club was not the right man? Did the man
whom Fred Powers had trailed through the day possess the secret
she had set out to discover? Had she wasted her time running
after a chimera?</p>

<p>One of the two men must be the man she sought&mdash;she had
the photograph in the buhl box to convince her of that. She knew
that one of the two men&mdash;Fred Powers was convinced that it
was the one he had trailed to the Palido had spoken to Charlie
Western outside the Palido. They had traced him to the General
Post Office, and then to the Union Club. The next day the
taxi-driver had picked him up at the club and trailed him to the
Apsley. The circle was complete, except&mdash;</p>

<p>Two facts stood against her theory. The man at the Union Club
that night had confessed that he had known her godfather, and
knew of the buhl box. Dr. Unwin had taken him from the club to
his home in his own car, leaving Pender's car to follow. Where
had the doctor taken him? If he had taken him to the Apsley, then
the matter was still further complicated. She must discover where
her Mr. Pender lived, and at once.</p>

<p>He had asked her to call on him, telling her that Dr. Unwin
would confine him to his bed for a week, in all probability. She
ran up the steps of her house and unlocked the door. The hall was
but faintly illuminated by one light. It sufficed to guide her to
the library. There she seized the telephone directory.</p>

<p>Quickly her finger ran down the short list of "Unwins" in the
directory. There were two doctors of that name. One of them had
an address in Macquarie Street, the other lived at Edgecliffe.
She drew the telephone to her and dialled the Macquarie Street
number. There was no response. Then she dialled the Edgecliffe
number.</p>

<p>A long pause, and then a gruff "Yes&mdash;Dr. Unwin
speaking."</p>

<p>"Dr. Unwin?" Ivy forced herself to speak calmly.</p>

<p>"That is my name. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;this is Miss France speaking. You attended Mr.
Pender at the Union Club to-night. I was with him until you came.
Do you remember? Mr. Pender asked me to call and see him on
important business, and he forgot to leave me his address."</p>

<p>"So you rang me up at this hour of the night&mdash;or rather,
morning&mdash;to ask me for my patient's address!" There was
anger as well as laughter in the voice on the wire. "I must
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am so sorry!" For the first time Ivy realised what her
impulsive actions had led her to do. "But it's frightfully
important."</p>

<p>"It must be." Dr. Unwin was sarcastic, "Well, young lady, from
what I remember of you, I believe you to be healthy. A night's
puzzling over your troubles won't hurt you. In fact, it may do
you good&mdash;teach you not to act on impulse. My office hours
are from ten to twelve, and two to four. Good-night!"</p>

<p>The click of the receiver being replaced on its hook sounded
plainly over the wire. The girl flushed heavily. What had she
been thinking about to telephone for a man's address at that hour
of the night? What must Dr. Unwin think of her? She caught at the
telephone directory again.</p>

<p>Fred Powers had said that the man he had followed had a flat
at the Aspley, and that his telephone number was in the
directory. A few minutes' search, and she found it. She gave a
start as her eyes caught the name immediately above it. A man
named Pender lived at Edgecliffe.</p>

<p>Now she knew. There were two men of the same name&mdash;more
than that, they had almost identical initials. One of them was
named H. G. Pender, the other H. P. Pender. Which was which? All
the directory told her was that H. G. Pender lived at the
Apsley&mdash;and Fred Powers had told her that he had traced his
man there.</p>

<p>Which man was the Harold Pender who had written her at her
godfather's private box at the G.P.O? She believed that Harold
Pender was the man who had attended the dinner at the Union Club.
But against that was the fixed belief of the taxi-driver that the
man he had been tracking was the true Harold Pender. There could
not be two men of the same given and surnames. Either she or the
taxi-driver must be at fault.</p>

<p>With sudden impulse she went to the buhl box and touched the
spring. The lid flew back, and there, facing her, was the
pictured face of the man, who, for the time being, engrossed her
thoughts.</p>

<p>She examined the photograph carefully. It must be old: taken
some years before; but it was the man she had watched. She was
certain of that! A shrug, and Ivy replaced the photograph in the
buhl box and closed the lid. She went round the desk to the door,
to switch off the lights. A number of letters on the blotting-pad
caught her eyes. What were those letters? The last post of the
day had been delivered before she went to the Union Club.</p>

<p>There had been a letter for her, which had been brought to her
room. Where had those letters come from? Then she remembered.
When she fetched the letters from her godfather's private box the
previous evening she had placed them on the desk, unopened. She
had been engrossed in the one letter, addressed to herself, and
she had forgotten the others. She sat down at the desk again.</p>

<p>She was not feeling tired. Before she went to sleep she would
open those letters, and if there was anything in them that
required her attention, separate it from the others, which would
have to go to Mark Kithner. Casually, she slit the envelopes,
withdrawing the contents.</p>

<p>Some of them were bills. She placed these aside in two piles.
One or two of them she would pay from the money the lawyer held
in trust for her. Others, obviously, belonged to the estate. They
did not apply to the household, and only the lawyer's intimate
knowledge of her godfather's estate could deal with them.</p>

<p>Two she placed on one side, to consider later. She carried the
two letters to the big armchair before the dying fire, and sat
down to study them.</p>

<p>The first was interesting. It related to certain dealings in
stocks and shares, and was signed "Pender &amp; Pender." The
address bore the description "Stock and Share Brokers." Then both
the men who bore the name "Pender" were related to each other,
and had had dealings with her godfather, almost up to the day of
his death. The letter showed that. It related to some deal her
godfather was engaged in at the time of his death&mdash;and from
the tone of the letter it was a deal of some magnitude.</p>

<p>But she had in the safe in that room securities amounting to
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. That, in itself, was a
large fortune.</p>

<p>What, then, was this money of which "Pender &amp; Pender"
wrote? Had that deal been successful? If it had, then her
godfather's estate had been considerably augmented. If on the
other hand, it had resulted in failure, then there was a chance
that the securities in the safe would barely cover the loss. She
would have to know definitely, and soon; Ivy smiled wryly. She
had all the time of the day on her hands now.</p>

<p>She could not go down to "Lorne, florists" after what had
happened at the Union Club. But&mdash;what had happened? She had
broken down under the strain of the evening, following on a hard
day's work. Instinctively, she had turned to the man with her for
comfort. Again the hot colour flooded her face and neck.</p>

<p>Why had she turned to this man for comfort? He was not to
blame. The whole affair had been her fault.</p>

<p>She looked down on the second letter, puzzled. The handwriting
was familiar to her; yet the signature&mdash;the one
word&mdash;was strange. Where had she seen that handwriting
before? She knew it well, yet familiar to her; yet the
signature&mdash;for the time could, not place it. She turned to
the wording of the note. There was neither address nor date
heading the letter. It was not inscribed to any particular
person. The words contained in the letter were few, and, so far
as she could understand, hardly made sense:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The Big Boy will certainly overflow gushingly
within the next few days. I have everything prepared for that.
Big Boy is a winner, and if you are careful you can do well with
him. If you want more information, try&mdash;</p>

<p><br> There the scrawled lines ended; to be followed by a
single word written in capital letters. Was it a word, or a
series of capital letters? She could not decide. Certainly, as a
word, it read:</p><br>

<p class="cp"><i>NEWS</i>.</p>

<p><br> Again the girl turned to the writing. She was certain
that she had seen it before, and frequently. Realisation came in
a flash! That note had been written by her godfather! To whom had
he written that note, and how had it come in his private box at
the General Post Office?</p>

<p>She was certain that all the envelopes she had opened had been
addressed to "Basil Sixsmith."</p>

<p>She took up the waste-paper basket and turned it over on the
desk. There were only six envelopes in it. All of them were
addressed to Basil Sixsmith, and all of them had been posted in
the city. Why had her godfather written so strange a note to
himself? She tried to understand it, reading it again and
again.</p>

<p>Who was "Big Boy", and why should he "overflow gushingly"? She
laughed, almost hysterically. For long moments she sat, conning
the note. What did it mean? Almost she was inclined to throw it
away; yet she did not, knowing that her godfather had never acted
without excellent reason. The clock on the mantel chimed the
hour, and then struck two o'clock. Ivy looked up, startled. She
gathered the letters together, and placed them in a drawer of the
desk; then switched off the lights and opened, the library door.
The hall was in darkness.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated. Had she turned out the light in
the hall when she passed through to come to the library? No, she
could not remember doing that. Then, who had extinguished the
lights? A strange sense of fear came on her.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; MRS.
WESTERN TAKES A HAND</h2>

<p class="first">IVY had the feeling that she was not the only
person awake in the house. She could feel a presence near her; an
antagonism indefinite, but very real. She groped forward to find
the switches; then suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>She had heard a sound, the shuttling of feet, as it someone
with eyes more accustomed to the darkness was watching her. She
wanted to cry out; but a choked feeling held her silent. Again
she took a step forward towards the light switches, feeling
before her with both hands. She touched something soft&mdash;and
cried out.</p>

<p>Again came the feeling of someone near her. She turned and
fled up the stairs. Half-way up to her room she turned and looked
back. The hall was still in darkness. She listened, but could
hear no sound. Almost she wanted to return to the hall and switch
on the lights; to assure herself that she was alone on the ground
floor of the house. No, she would not go back. She had been
imagining things.</p>

<p>Turning she sped up the stairs to the door of Mary's room. No
light showed under the door. She turned the handle and opened the
door slightly. The room was in darkness. She thrust back the door
and went to the bed, softly calling the girl. There was no answer. She came to the bed and felt along the covers. Mary was
not in the bed&mdash;it had not been slept in!</p>

<p>With a little cry she fled to the door and flooded the room
with light. Where was Mary? She looked around the room. The girl
had not made any preparations to retire to bed that night. There
was no disorder in the room. She opened the wardrobe door.
Immediately she saw that Mary's coat and hat were missing.</p>

<p>Then Mary had gone from the house! Where? For long moments Ivy
stood staring at the peg on which Mary's coat had hung. Mary had
left her home! What did that mean? A feeling of indescribable
loneliness came over the girl. Mary had left her! For what
reason? She was alone in the big gloomy house&mdash;and in it
were indescribable terrors!</p>

<p>She ran down the corridor to the door of her godfather's room.
It had not been used since he had been carried out of it at the
start of his last earthly journey. For a moment she hesitated,
her hand on the handle, then pushed open the door. The room was
silent and vacant. Glancing fearfully towards the bed on which he
had been lying when she had last entered the room, she ran to the
old bureau.</p>

<p>In one of the top drawers was an old-fashioned revolver,
loaded. A moment, and she had found the weapon. She snatched it
up and turned from the room. At the head of the stairs she
stopped and listened. She could not hear a sound in the house,
and crept down a few stairs. Again came the feeling that she was
not alone; that near her hovered some malignant presence.</p>

<p>On the last step she paused, waiting. Gathering up her
courage, she sped across the hall to the light switches and
pressed them. No beam of light answered her actions. She
shuddered. What had happened to the lights? It was impossible for
all the globes to have broken!</p>

<p>For long minutes she waited, her fingers still on the
switches. If she waited, kept entirely still, perhaps she would
learn something&mdash;see something&mdash;that would explain the
mystery that now shrouded the house. She stared round the wide
hall, careful to make no movement. A faint light flowed in at the
windows, sufficient to throw thin, ghostly shadows around. From the window at the head of the stairs streamed a single, broad ray
of light, flooding the stairway down which she had come.</p>

<p>How foolish she had been! They&mdash;if anyone had been in the
hall&mdash;must have seen her come down the stairs. They would
have had time to hide&mdash;to watch for her to make some
move.</p>

<p>The stillness was becoming intolerable. Very silently and
slowly she moved from the switches towards the library door.
Immediately she entered the room her fingers found the light
switch and pressed it. The globes in the room remained dark. With
a sudden little run she reached the desk&mdash;to collide with
something soft, yet firm, and to fall to the ground.
Instinctively she retained her grip on the revolver.</p>

<p>Lying quiescent, she waited. Now she knew that there was some
tangible presence with her in the room. From where she lay the
desk out off sight of the farther side of the room.</p>

<p>Cautiously she raised herself, catching at the edge of the
desk. Slowly she searched the shadows. There was a strange
darkness in the corner of the room, near the big safe. Raising
herself until she was on her knees, she brought up the revolver,
resting the muzzle on the edge of the desk. She waited a moment,
summoning all her resolution; then pressed the trigger firmly.
The explosion of the cartridge was followed by a ringing sound.
Almost as if it had been a signal, the lights in the room came
on.</p>

<p>Ivy sprang to her feet, staring wildly into the corner of the
room where the safe stood. She could see no one, yet part of the
floor was cut from her vision by one of the big chairs.</p>

<p>Physically sick, she staggered, forward. Had she shot someone?
What was that darkness on the floor, just beyond the edge of the
desk? No, there was no body on the ground; there was no one in
the room with her. She searched around her carefully, then went
to the safe. The safe was open!</p>

<p>For a moment she stared at it, unbelievingly. When had the
safe been opened? Who had opened it?</p>

<p>She knew that she had locked it when she had placed the
securities in it. Now it was open. She caught at the heavy steel
door and pulled it back. Something dull and round was on the
paint. She gazed at it curiously, not understanding for a moment;
then laughed. The bullet from her revolver had impinged on the
safe door, spattering it with lead. A rapid search of the
interior of the safe showed the girl that the packet of bonds and
shares had disappeared. Where had they gone to?</p>

<p>The securities which represented her godfather's fortune had
disappeared! She laughed gigglingly. She had
recovered&mdash;received&mdash;the money strangely; it had
disappeared&mdash;and the money! The two facts hummed through her
brain. Mary and the money! The money&mdash;and Mary!</p>

<p>No, she could not believe that Mary had taken the money. But
where had the girl gone to? What had happened to her? It was
unlike Mary to have gone from the house without a word. Mary was
not in the house&mdash;and the person who had stolen the money
was!</p>

<p>She knew that now. She knew that when she had entered the
library on first returning home she would have noticed if the
safe had been opened. She was certain that then it had been shut
and locked. There was no possible doubt. The safe had been fast
when she left the room to go upstairs. It had been opened before
she came down&mdash;and her purse, with the keys of the safe in
it, had been on the desk. She had heard no movement in the house.
Ivy laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>Almost she felt that she was being hunted; shadowed by some
weird spectre. Then her whole nature blazed into revolt. She
would not be driven or tortured. Someone should suffer; suffer
bitterly for this!</p>

<p>In sudden resolution she dashed into the hall, to stare
aghast! All the lights were on. For the moment she gazed around
her, too amazed to move; then her eyes fell on the big gong. A
moment, and she seize the big gong-maul, and was beating on the
bronze with all her strength. The dull rumble rang through the
hall, growing louder and more penetrating to the world without
the four walls of the house. Still she thrashed at the gong,
finding some salve for her mental wounds in the welter of noise
she was creating.</p>

<p>"What on earth, girl!" A woman's voice came from way up the
stairs. With a gasp of astonishment, Ivy turned. Halfway down the
stairs was Mrs. Western holding on to the banisters.</p>

<p>"You!" Anger flamed in the girl's eyes. Now she was facing
flesh and blood; something that was not the gruesome, intangible
horror born of some alien presence, bred, of her-imaginations.
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Ivy!" The woman came down the stairs, hands outstretched. "My
poor child."</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" Instinctively the girl drew back, raising
the heavy gong-maul. "Keep back, I say! Keep back!" She turned
swiftly. Someone was thundering on the front door of the house.
She made a step towards it, then hesitated. Mrs. Western came
down the stairs and stood in the hall.</p>

<p>"Give me that, Ivy." The woman spoke commandingly. "You poor
dear! No wonder your brain is affected by all that you have gone
through. My poor brother&mdash;oh, how can I say it! He was
failing&mdash;failing when he died!"</p>

<p>Deliberately, but with a quick, stealthy movement, the woman
seized the maul-stick the girl still held. Then, with it in her
hand, she walked to the front door and opened it. A constable
strode into the hall.</p>

<p>"What's the matter here? What's all the noise about?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, constable." Mrs. Western's voice had lost none of
its purr. "It was my fault, really. I should have kept better
watch over her."</p>

<p>The man looked from the woman to the girl, lifting his
eyebrows. Mrs. Western nodded, and touched her forehead
furtively.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor girl!" The smooth, silky voice purred on. "I should
have known better; but she has been so reasonable the last couple
of days. And she was so devoted to my poor brother."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sixsmith's house, ain't it, ma'am?" The man looked around
him.</p>

<p>Ivy was staring from the woman to the man in horror. What was
Mrs. Western trying to infer? Why was she there, in that house,
at that hour of the night? Impulsively, she went forward.</p>

<p>"I want you, officer." She spoke imperiously. "This house has
been robbed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Western nodded. Her fat shoulders went up in an
inimitable shrug. She turned to the girl, every line of her ample
body expressing resignation and patience.</p>

<p>"Come with me, dear." She tried to place a maternal arm about
the girl, but Ivy evaded her. "Poor dear, she is quite bad
now."</p>

<p>"Please! Please!" The girl caught the constable by the arm.
"Oh, you don't believe me! But I can show you. Tell her to go
away! She has no business here. This is my house&mdash;not hers.
I didn't know she was here until she came down the stairs just
now. How she got in I cannot understand. Oh, take her away! Sand
her away, and come with me! I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Show me what, miss?"</p>

<p>"The safe."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Someone has burgled it."</p>

<p>The man glanced at Mrs. Western.</p>

<p>Again the woman shrugged and shook her head. "There has been
no one in the house this evening, constable."</p>

<p>She hesitated, then continued; "I thought that my niece was
better, and late this afternoon I went out. I shall never forgive
myself&mdash;but Ivy was so much better, and my business was
really important. When I arrived home I found that she had
disappeared. You can see. She had dressed and gone out. Where on
earth she has been to, I cannot even guess."</p>

<p>"You wicked woman!" The girl flashed round, almost
inarticulate with anger. "You have stolen my god-dad's
money!"</p>

<p>"There! There! Hear her!" The woman's show of patience was
admirable. "And everyone knows that my poor, dear brother died a
ruined man." The constable hesitated, looking from the girl to
the woman. He shrugged.</p>

<p>"The young lady says there's been a robbery. Perhaps I'd
better look into that before I go," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, officer." Mrs. Western was most gracious. "Now,
dear!" She turned to Ivy. "Where did you say the robbery had
taken place?"</p>

<p>"You opened god-dad's safe." A feeling of utter helplessness
came over the girl. "You took out a packet of securities that was
there. Why, you've stolen more than a hundred and fifty thousand
pounds!"</p>

<p>The woman laughed shortly, a note of anger in her voice.</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand pounds! Poor dear! Why, my child, Basil
never left a hundred thousand pence!" She hesitated a moment.
"And you say the safe in the library has been opened?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd better have a look, ma'am."</p>

<p>The constable walked further into the hall. "Just to make
certain things are all right."</p>

<p>"Of course!" Mrs. Western had recovered her former sweetness.
"This way, officer." She led to the library door, and stood aside
tor the constable to precede her into the room. Ivy followed the
constable closely. Once inside the library, her eyes went to the
safe. She gasped and staggered. The safe door was fast shut!</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; THE
DEVIL-TAMER</h2>

<p class="first">"LOOKS all right!" The policeman spoke
doubtfully. He went across the room and tugged at the handles of
the safe. "It's locked, miss."</p>

<p>Ivy was staring at the safe. She knew that it had been open
when she had come into the library. It had only been partly open
when she had found it, and she had pulled the doors fully back,
while searching for the packet of securities. Now it was shut and
locked.</p>

<p>Yet, on the face of it still remained the mark of the bullet
she had fired in the dark. She went to the safe and I touch the
splatter of metal.</p>

<p>"What is this, constable?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Looks like lead. Someone must I have fired a bullet at the
safe."</p>

<p>The man scratched his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That is entirely right." Ivy smiled wanly. "I fired that
bullet. When I came in here the room was in darkness. Something
brushed against me and threw me to the ground. I dragged myself
up by the edge of the desk, and thought I saw someone at the
safe. I had my&mdash;Mr. Sixsmith's revolver with me, and fired.
The bullet struck the safe door, making the mark you see."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;there was no one there; the safe wasn't open."</p>

<p>The man showed his perplexity. "Didn't you switch on the
lights when you entered the room?"</p>

<p>"I tried to but the lights had been cut off."</p>

<p>"Then how did you discover that the packet of securities had
been stolen."</p>

<p>The man crossed the room, and picked up the old-fashioned revolver lying on the desk, close to where the girl was standing.
"The lights came on when I fired the revolver."</p>

<p>Mrs. Western laughed titteringly; a laugh of absolute
disbelief. "Ivy, you had better come upstairs with me. You are
upset, dear. Let me take you to your room. When you have had a
good night's rest you will be much better."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think I am mad!" The girl spoke wearily. "I shall be
if this goes on much longer."</p>

<p>"There, there, dear!" The lady tried to take the girl round
the waist. "I'll look after you."</p>

<p>"I want to know what you are doing here?" Ivy turned on the
woman, passionately. "You have no right here. This is my
house."</p>

<p>Mrs. Western's shrug was eloquent. The constable caught the
significance, and nodded, "Well, there's nothing for me to do
here." The man spoke stolidly. "Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but
you'll have to look after her better than that. Why, she almost
woke up the whole neighbourhood!"</p>

<p>"I wish I had!" the girl exclaimed passionately. "If only
I could have!"</p>

<p>She swung around and faced the man scornfully. "Can't you see
that she is fooling you? Oh, you men!"</p>

<p>She turned and ran from the room, leaving Mrs. Western to get
rid of the police officer whatever way she chose. At the top of
the stairs she paused, drawing back into the shadows of the
window curtains, watching. She watched the woman, followed by the
police officer, come into the hall; and drew deeper into the
shadows. A sound above her caught her attention. She looked up.
Charlie Western was looking over the banisters, only a few yards
from her, peering down on the scene in the hall. What was that
man doing in the house? Ivy knew that the Westerns were working
some plan to take possession of the house, and herself. That
night she had played directly into their hands. They had told the
police officer that she was mad&mdash;that her godfather bad been
mad. She, in her temper, had played the part they had cast her
for. In some manner they had gained admission to the house, and
had taken possession of it.</p>

<p>But where was Mary? From all appearances she was out of the
house. Yet at any moment she might return&mdash;walk. Into some
trap prepared for her&mdash;as she herself had done. Ivy watched
Charlie Western furtively, shielded from his observation by the
thick curtains of the window embrasure. She heard the sound of
the hall door opening and shutting, and the deep bass "Thank
you!" of the constable. Then came the tap-tap of high heels
passing over the polished boards of the hall. The stairs creaked
under the weight of the woman as she ascended.</p>

<p>"All right, mother." Charlie bent over the banisters.</p>

<p>The woman laughed. "Where's that girl&mdash;I'd like to shake
the nonsense out of her!"</p>

<p>"I thought she was down here with you."</p>

<p>"She ran out of the library when she found she couldn't fool
that policeman." Mrs. Western laughed. "I thought she came
upstairs. Oh, she's all right! All the windows and doors are
fastened. She can't get out with those iron shutters fastened and
locked. Basil was a fool over burglars."</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't come up here past me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she did, and you didn't notice her. More than likely
we shall find her in her room."</p>

<p>"You'd better go and see, then."</p>

<p>"What for? The little fool's safe; probably crying her eyes
out because she couldn't persuade that policeman to put me out of
my own house. Let her be, she can't harm us. Who's got the
packet?"</p>

<p>"What packet"</p>

<p>"The one Mr. Kithner went to the safe to get."</p>

<p>"Oh, he took it away with him. That was best, for if anyone
found it in the house&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Western was doubtful. "The girl says there's a hundred
and fifty thousand pounds in it. And Basil never mentioned it in
his will. Only left me the house and the furniture, and a pile of
debts to cover that; I wonder where the girl found the
money?"</p>

<p>"In the safe."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think that. She wouldn't have kept it a secret
for so long if she had. Of course, it belongs to the
estate&mdash;that's me." The woman's voice had a whining
tone.</p>

<p>"And me!"</p>

<p>"Of course, Charlie, dear." There was a long pause while the
lady struggled up the remaining stairs. "How is&mdash;you know,
Charlie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quiet, now."</p>

<p>"You fool&mdash;to leave her alone!"</p>

<p>"She's tied up securely&mdash;I saw to that. She can't do
anything." The man laughed gratingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're certain&mdash;" Mrs. Western had gained the
upper floor. "I'll have a look at her, and then I'll go to bed.
All this excitement is not good for my poor heart."</p>

<p>"But a hundred and fifty thousand gold boys are; eh, mother!"
Charlie laughed&mdash;a laugh echoed by his doting mother.</p>

<p>"Say, Charlie." The woman's voice came faintly to the
concealed girl, as the couple passed down the corridor. "What's
going to be the end of all this?"</p>

<p>"Only that Richard will find out who the man is whose
photograph is in the buhl box and get from him old Sixsmith's
secret. Then we'll put Miss Ivy in a nice place where she'll grow
a bit madder than you made her out to that policeman to be;
unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what, Charlie dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless she likes to be Mrs. Western, junior." The voices
sounded very faint now.</p>

<p>"But, Charlie, I can't have you throwing yourself away on a
girl like that!"</p>

<p>The voices faded into the distance. For a moment Ivy remained
behind the curtains; then laughed uncertainly.</p>

<p>She knew that she could not get out of the house. Her
godfather had a peculiar fear of burglars, and had fitted the
lower windows and the doors with a series of automatic locks,
worked from his bedroom. Once the locks were set the iron
shutters over the windows and the doors were safe for the night.
To touch these was to spring a burglar alarm. And Mrs. Western
was going to her room, to see that she was safe for the night!
What would the woman do when she did not find her there? She
would probably make a search through the house. What had happened
to the maids, Faith and Alice? Were they confined in their rooms
at the top of the house, or was one of them the prisoner to whom
Charlie Western had referred?</p>

<p>Ivy came out of her shelter and ran up the stairs. She must
manage to get to that prisoner in some way. She came to the
corner of the corridor and peered around it. Mrs. Western and her
son were standing before one of the doors&mdash;the door exactly
opposite her godfather's room. They were talking earnestly. The
man turned the key in the lock and entered the room, followed by
the woman.</p>

<p>Ivy believed that this was the room in which the prisoner was
confined. She must manage to get into that room. She must find
out who was the prisoner, and in some way release her! What
a fool she had been to drop the revolver in the library. If only
she had it with her, now! She would have gone to that room and
held up the two scoundrels, freed the prisoner, in some way found
help! But where could she find anyone to help her, because the
woman would be able to persuade them that she was mad&mdash;as
she had persuaded that policeman.</p>

<p>First, she must discover the identity of the prisoner. Very
softly she crept along the corridor, taking advantage of the
night shadows to shield her progress. She came to her godfather's
room and opened the door carefully, sliding in through the
narrowest possible space. Closing  the door carefully, she went
to the bureau. Had her godfather possessed a second revolver? She
searched wildly, though thoroughly, but could find no weapon. She
returned to the door and opened it slightly. The door of the room
opposite was shut.</p>

<p>She listened, and could hear the murmur of voices within the
room. But only Charlie Western and his mother were speaking.
Probably the young scoundrel had tied and gagged his prisoner. At
length the door handle moved. Ivy narrowed the crack of the door
behind which she stood as much as possible. She listened
intently, for she dare not open the door sufficiently wide to see
anything.</p>

<p>Charlie Western came out, followed by his mother, both of them
speaking in whispers. Then: "Suppose I must have a look in at
that pauper."</p>

<p>Mrs. Western spoke. "You'd better come with me, Charlie. I
thought she was going to be violent, downstairs."</p>

<p>"You're afraid of her," the young blackguard sneered.</p>

<p>"Yes." The woman spoke candidly. "That girl is stronger than I
am. I am afraid of her."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll come!"</p>

<p>There came the sounds of their steps receding down the
corridor.</p>

<p>Ivy waited a moment, then pulled open the door. She looked
across the corridor. They had left the key in the lock of the
door opposite. A moment, and she had the door unlocked, the key
withdrawn, reinserted in the look within the room, and the key
turned.</p>

<p>Again the girl waited. A long moment, and Mrs. Western came
into the corridor again, speaking stridently.</p>

<p>"Charlie, you will have to search the house for that wretched
girl!"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn her! You say she can't get out of the house, so
what's the use?"</p>

<p>"You don't know her. She might burn us in our beds."</p>

<p>"They're not our beds yet, old dear." The man chuckled. "For
the time we've only pre-empted them."</p>

<p>"They will be ours in three months."</p>

<p>"Three months, less three days." Again the man laughed. "Say,
mother, you'd better have a look at that apparatus Basil
installed. I suppose the girl knows how to work it. If she does
and gets into his room&mdash;well, good-bye to our little
stunt."</p>

<p>The woman laughed.</p>

<p>"Charlie, I think you'd better find that girl," she urged
again.</p>

<p>"All right! I'm a devil tamer. I'll find her, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, Charlie?"&mdash;plaintively.</p>

<p>"Nothing." The man chuckled evilly. "You'd better keep out of
this. You know what old Sixsmith wrote you."</p>

<p>"But he didn't put it in his will, as he threatened."</p>

<p>"He didn't&mdash;so far as we know, We haven't seen the will
yet, and that old devil of a lawyer is quite capable of leaving
something out to save his and the girl's ends, Anyway, I'm going
to play safety&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Charlie, dear?"</p>

<p>"Best for you not to know." Then, abruptly: "You go to the old
man's room and see that the apparatus is all right, and lock the
door, or take the key to bed with you. You're sleeping there,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Charlie, dear?"</p>

<p>"Just what I've said. I'm playing safe. After to-night Mistress
Ivy Breton won't want to squeal. Why, because there won't be any
Miss Ivy Breton to squeal. There'll be a girl so anxious to get
to the registrar that she won't even spare the time to kiss her
new mother-in-law."</p>

<p>A cold shiver ran down Ivy's buck. The man was unutterably
evil. She leaned her face against the door. Good God, that he did
not come to that room! She pressed her ear against the panel,
listening to the heavy footsteps of the woman coming nearer and
nearer&mdash;to hesitate, stop and turn to the door opposite. If
she had stayed in that room&mdash;</p>

<p>Would the woman have called to her son? That filthy beast:
inhuman, gold-stained and utterly carnal! Again, the girl
shuddered. She turned and faced the room. Somewhere in that room
was the prisoner the two scoundrels had mentioned. She must find
and release her.</p>

<p>A quick glance round, and Ivy went to the bed. On it lay a
long bundle. She turned down the top end, and looked into Mary's
agonised eyes.</p>

<p>"Mary?" The girl gave a little feeble moan, writhing in her
bonds.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear!" Ivy was tugging at the knots fastening the
handkerchief in the girl's mouth. A few seconds, and she released
them.</p>

<p>"Ivy!" For a second the elder girl lay on her side, crying
silently; then, when the younger girl had succeeded in releasing
her hands, threw her arms about her neck.</p>

<p>"Mary, they haven't harmed you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so." The girl stretched her cramped limbs.
"No, I'm all right. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western is in god-dad's room&mdash;the room opposite
this. Charlie is searching the house for me."</p>

<p>"What if he comes in here?"</p>

<p>"There are two of us now. I think we can take care of Master
Charlie."</p>

<p>Ivy spoke with some resolution; yet her heart was downcast.
She was searching the room for some weapon, but it was one of the
guest chambers of the big house and contained nothing of value
for offence or defence. Mary sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing
life into her numbed limbs.</p>

<p>Suddenly she hobbled over to the door, and listened at the
panel. She half-turned, beckoning to Ivy. Together the two girls
stayed at the door, listening. A man's footsteps sounded along
the corridor, to halt outside the door of the room opposite.</p>

<p>They heard a loud knock.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Charlie, dear?" Mrs. Western's sounded
faintly through the two closed doors.</p>

<p>"I can't find that girl anywhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, let her be. We'll find her in the morning."</p>

<p>"But I want her to-night." Again came the evil chuckle. For
some seconds there was silence.</p>

<p>"Is that other girl safe, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. You've got the key, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I left it in the lock."</p>

<p>"It isn't there now." Then, with sudden illumination. "You
fool! You've let those two girls get together."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>The woman's voice was very faint. "Ivy's got in with Mary
Varney. Now there'll be hell to pay! But I'll get her out!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; A NIGHT OF
TERROR</h2>

<p class="first">FOR long minutes there was silence: the two
girls crouching close to the door, terror in their hearts.</p>

<p>They could hear Charlie Western tramping up and down the
corridor. Once they heard the look of the door opposite click,
followed by a gruff command: "Get into your room, damn you?"</p>

<p>Then slow and careful footsteps came to their door. Someone,
they believed the man, was standing close to the panel,
listening; the girls believed they could almost hear his heavy
breathing. Then followed another spell of silence, followed by a
heavy rapping on the wood of the door.</p>

<p>"Miss Breton!" The man's voice was soft and silky. "Are you
there. Miss Breton?"</p>

<p>For a moment Ivy did not reply: then:</p>

<p>"I am here. What do you want?" Charlie Western did not answer.
Ivy thought she could hear a low chuckle. The handle of the door
was slowly turned, and the woodwork creaked under a sudden
pressure applied to it.</p>

<p>"So you are there?" The man's voice held a satisfied note. "I
want to speak to you. Will you unlock the door, please?"</p>

<p>The girls remained silent. Again a long pause, and then the
restless feet of the man beat on the floor of the corridor
outside the door. Suddenly the steps turned, and the girls heard
them retreating towards the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Where has he gone?" Mary breathed the question in Ivy's
ear.</p>

<p>The younger girl turned&mdash;then burst out laughing at sight
of her. companion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, if you could only see yourself! You do look funny!"
Mary ran to the mirror to give a little gasp of horror. She was
in her outdoor things, her hat pushed rakishly to the back of her
head, her hair tangled and tousled, her dress crumpled and
torn.</p>

<p>"You look as if you had been in a street fight."</p>

<p>Ivy could not control her laughter. "It wasn't much
better."</p>

<p>Mary's skilful fingers were rapidly repairing the damage. "Oh,
Ivy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What happened?" The younger girl came and sat on the foot of
the bed.</p>

<p>"Did you go out?" Mary nodded. "I had a telephone message from
Mr. Kithner&mdash;or, rather. I thought it was from him. He
wanted me to go down to the office about some matters that seemed
to be in a muddle. That was about an hour and a half after you
left the house. I got ready and went. There was no one at the
offices, and the place was in darkness. There was no one in the
building."</p>

<p>"Richard Kithner?"</p>

<p>"I think so. You know his voice is very similar to his
father's."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I was worried and angry&mdash;but I never suspected what had
happened. I came straight home and went up to my room. Just as I
got to the head of the stairs that man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Charlie Western."</p>

<p>"I think it was him. He caught hold of me. Then another
man&mdash;I think he was Richard Kithner&mdash;helped him to bind
and gag me. They carried me to this room and flung me on the bed.
He told me they would make me&mdash;and&mdash;and
threatened&mdash;oh, Ivy, they threatened unspeakable
things."</p>

<p>"You poor dear!" Ivy thought for a few minutes. "I wonder what
they did with Faith and Alice?"</p>

<p>"I think they are locked in their rooms, upstairs."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The younger girl was plainly astonished. "How do
they expect to get away with it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. No, that is wrong. I think I understand.
Charlie is&mdash;" She paused and looked at her companion
significantly.</p>

<p>"I won't!" Ivy spoke viciously. "Oh, I heard him. I know what
he and his mother propose to do. But&mdash;I won't marry him! I
won't&mdash;whatever he does!"</p>

<p>"It is the only way we can get out of it. It you get
free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's one thing I am going to do." Ivy laughed. "Go on,
dear."</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Western came in and sat on the bed, and dropped
butter and oil all round me. Ugh! She's awful; worse than the
men. She told me that you had become insane&mdash;that the doctor
had been called to you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Ivy was astonished. "You knew where I
was&mdash;at the Union Club."</p>

<p>"They told me you had been taken ill there, and had been
brought home. Then, when you recovered consciousness, you were
entirely mad. Mrs. Western told me that she had only just arrived
at the house, and I thought there was something in that, for she
was still wearing her coat and hat."</p>

<p>"What were the men doing while she was up here with you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Mary hesitated. "I think they were down in the
library. Richard Kithner said something about the safe, as they
went out of the door."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;how did they open the safe?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Again the girl hesitated. "You told me that
Charlie Western had lived here for some time. He may have got
hold of a key of the safe&mdash;or taken a mould of it,
perhaps."</p>

<p>Ivy nodded. The supposition was quite probable. Charlie
Western had used his stay in the house to get hold of a key of
the front door. Then she remembered. When she had first gone to
the library she had placed her bag on the desk. In her bag was
the key of the safe. She had left it there. In fact, it was there
at that moment. The safe must have been opened between the times
she first left the library and her return. That would explain the
unknown person she had bumped against in the dark.</p>

<p>"I think I understand." Ivy spoke slowly, "Richard
Kithner telephoned you to go down to his father's offices, making
believe that he was his father. That would be about half-past
nine. I suppose you told Faith and Alice that you would take a
key and let yourself in when you returned?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, Mrs. Western and her son came. More than likely they
did not arrive until the maids had gone to bed. I know they like
to go to bed early. Then the Westerns locked them in their rooms
and tried to find the securities. They couldn't find them and
waited for you to come back. Oh, it was easy&mdash;so
easy&mdash;and we fell into the trap they set."</p>

<p>Mary nodded, miserably. "I let you down, dear," she said. "But
I never thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who would have thought they would have done such a thing?"
Ivy laughed mirthlessly. "But now they have the bonds and shares;
what more do they want?"</p>

<p>"To safeguard themselves." The elder girl spoke with
conviction.</p>

<p>"By forcing me to marry&mdash;that?" Ivy made a grimace.
"Well, I won't&mdash;that's definite. So there you are! Now, what
are we going to do?"</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence. What could the girls do?
They were locked in a room in the upper part of the house, with
no chance of communicating with the outside world. In the
corridor, without the room, prowled a man, utterly unscrupulous.
He had found the money he had come in search of. Now he had to
safeguard himself&mdash;and there was only one way of doing that.
He had to force Ivy to marry him. If only she could get out of
that room, with Mary. She could do that&mdash;true. She had the
key in the lock, inside the door. But outside the room she had to
get down to the telephone. What could she do there?</p>

<p>Ivy's face flamed. She knew what she would do&mdash;try and
get in touch with Jack Lorne; call him to her aid. He would deal
with these scoundrels effectively. But where would she find
him?</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered. Jack had said that he would be at the
shop early that morning. He expected a truckload of stuff to come
about six&mdash;for the truck would have to go out to one of the
nurseries for another load that was required that day. She looked
at her watch. It was just four o'clock. She had about two hours
to wait&mdash;two hours in which to plan how to get down to the
library. She settled herself on the bed more comfortably. She
must find a way.</p>

<p>The sound of steps in the corridor brought her alert. They
stopped at the door, and there was a long wait. Ivy guessed that
the man was waiting at the panel. She motioned Mary to silence.
He must not know whether they were in the room or not. Again came
the hard knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Neither of the girls answered.</p>

<p>"Miss Breton!" The smooth, oily voice held a rough edge. "Oh,
come on, I know you are in there with the other girl. Open the
door and let's talk things out. Come on, don't be a fool! We've
got the money. If you're sensible, you can have a share."</p>

<p>Charlie Western was offering her a share of the securities he
had found in the safe! Why? Ivy tried to think.</p>

<p>If she was right in her interpretation of her godfather's
will, then the money belonged to him and his mother. She had no
claim to any part of it. What did the man's offer mean? Were they
afraid she would prosecute them when she got free? Prosecute
them, for what? True, they had told the constable she was mad, in
that wild scene in the library. There must be some other reason
for their action;&mdash;for this man's offer. He was lying, of
course, or&mdash;</p>

<p>She strove to remember the wording of her godfather's will.
There had been legacies left to persons who had served him. She
had been left the buhl box and its contents. She had been given
the use of the house and furniture for three months; then it was
to go to Mrs. Western! How could that be interpreted? Mr. Kithner
had told Mrs. Western that the house and its contents were the
residuary part of the estate, and that the testator's debts would
have to be paid out of their sale.</p>

<p>Then everything in that house, except her personal belongings
and the buhl box belonged to Mrs. Western. But could she claim
the securities that had only been brought into the house the
previous day? Had they not been given to her, Ivy, by her
godfather's definite instructions?</p>

<p>"Come on, Ivy; don't be a fool! I shan't harm you!"</p>

<p>A long pause; then the man flamed to sudden anger.</p>

<p>"Well, stop there, if you want to. You'll can't get out, and
you'll get nothing to eat while you keep that door fastened.
You'll come out soon enough, and I'll be waiting for you."</p>

<p>Impatient steps went down the corridor, and a door slammed,
loudly. Still the girls waited. Again Ivy looked at her watch.
The hands were slowly approaching five o'clock. Only an hour to
wait; and in that time thy had to get out of that room and down
to the library. For another half-hour the girls waited in the
bedroom; then Ivy softly turned the key in the look. She believed
that the time had come. She opened the door and peeped out. There
was no one in the corridor.</p>

<p>Very softly she crept to her godfather's door and tested the
handle. The door was locked. How could she secure that door, if
only for a time? She laughed quietly as she returned to the room
where Mary waited. Tearing one of the sheets into strips, she
wound a strong rope, then beckoned to Mary to follow her.</p>

<p>In the corridor she secured the rope to the door of the room
in which Mrs. Western slept, then shut the door of the room they
had just left, and strained the other end of the rope round the
handle. Now Mrs. Western was a prisoner. Beckoning Mary to
follow, Ivy went to the head of the stairs. There she hesitated.
If only she could find the room where Charlie Western lay she
would fasten that door in a similar fashion. But it would be
dangerous to delay and search. They must go down to the library
at once and telephone for help.</p>

<p>The house was as silent as a tomb as they crept down the
stairs. In the library Ivy glanced about her, quickly. She gave a
gasp of relief to see the revolver lying on a corner of the desk.
She picked it up and turned to the door, locking it.</p>

<p>Again she glanced at her watch. It wanted twenty minutes to
six o'clock. She dialled Jack's number, and waited. If only he
were at the shop! The steady buzz-buzz of the bell alone came
over the line. There was a movement in the hall outside the
door.</p>

<p>Someone was creeping down the stairs. The handle of the door
was softly tested. A muttered oath came through the door. Another
glance at her watch, and again she dialled the florist's number.
For long minutes there was only the buzz-buzz of the bell coming
over the line. Then followed the click of the connection. Almost
at the same moment something heavy shook the door on its
hinges.</p>

<p>"Quick, Jack! Quick!"</p>

<p>Her words were followed by another crash at the door. One of
the panels split from top to bottom.</p>

<p>"You'll lock yourself up, will you?" The voice outside the
door was thick and full of passion. "I'll get you out, my girl,
and then look to yourself. You'll do what I want, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack&mdash;it's Ivy&mdash;Muriel France speaking. Come to Ivy
Breton's house. Oh, quick, quick! He'll get in if you don't make
haste!"</p>

<p>"Muriel, is that you?" Jack Lorne's voice came over the wire,
anxious and hoarse.</p>

<p>"Where are you? At Miss Breton's? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk! Come quickly. Mary and I are in the library,
and Charlie Western is going to break the door down. Oh, come and
save us! He's going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>A rapid series of thuds pounded on the split panel,
splintering it from top to bottom. Another couple of blows, and
part of the wood fell into the room. A face&mdash;Ivy hardly
recognised it as Charlie Western's&mdash;peered in at the
opening. The girl sprang to her feet and seized the revolver.</p>

<p>"Keep back, or I'll fire!"</p>

<p>"Ivy, you daren't!" Mary was crouching at the younger girl's
feet, behind the desk.</p>

<p>"You'll kill&mdash;kill him!"</p>

<p>"Kill him? The beast! I wish I could!" The girl was sobbing
with excitement.</p>

<p>"Kill me? Would you?" Again the man crashed his weapon at the
door. "Just you wait until I get my hands on you!"</p>

<p>"Charlie! Charlie, dear! What on earth are you doing?" A
high-pitched female voice sounded from above.</p>

<p>"Your fault!" The man turned on his mother with a snarl. "I
told you to watch those girls, and you let them get down here. Go
upstairs, I tell you! Keep out of this! That girl's got a gun,
and she's mad!"</p>

<p>Again the door shivered under a hall of blows. Ivy raised the
revolver, her face white and strained. Very deliberately she
pointed the weapon at the door, and pulled the trigger. The sound
of the explosion filled the library; the acrid smoke made the
girls cough.</p>

<p>Something heavy fell in the hall, outside the room. Thunderous
knocking came on the front door. For a moment Ivy could not
understand. Then realisation came, and her face cleared. She
laughed hysterically as she ran to the door.</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack! I want you! I want you!" She flung open the door,
and with a little cry fell unconscious across the threshold.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX. &mdash;
ELUCIDATION</h2>

<p class="first">A WEEK had passed since that night of terror in
the old Sixsmith house. Ivy was beginning to look back on it as a
bad dream. Jack had come to her rescue. She had placed her
burdens on his shoulders, content that he would assume them for
always.</p>

<p>There had been little trouble after Jack had forced his way
into the house. Mrs. Western and her son had been sent to their
home, instructed to remain there on pain of criminal action being
taken against them.</p>

<p>Mark Kithner had come to the house later in the morning; to
stand and look down at the pale, wan girl, lying on her couch,
shaking his head and trying to apologise for his son. Ivy had
laughed up at him. What did the troubles of the past days matter?
She had sailed her life's barque into a safe harbour, how safe
she hardly dared whisper to herself.</p>

<p>Mary had come and gone, flitting in and out of the gloomy old
house like a bright, chattering butterfly. She was the only thing
Ivy could find satisfactory in the mystery and disillusionment
that had followed the reading of her godfather's will. She had
found the girl worn and dispirited in the old lawyer's office,
and had brought her to happiness&mdash;to a realisation that life
held more for women than work; that they are the beauty of the
earth and sky, the comforters and mothers of the menfolk, whose
duty it is to accomplish the work of the world. Mary had learned
her lesson. A grub had developed into a chrysalis; a chrysalis
into a butterfly&mdash;no, something more&mdash;a girl who
promised to develop into a lovely woman. Ivy was proud of her
work and planned to bring it to a logical conclusion.</p>

<p>Jack and the lawyer had bidden her not think nor talk of the
past. She was to rest and get well, for before her was one more
mental strain. When that was to happen she did not know. They
would tell her nothing.</p>

<p>One thing she knew, and that more from guesswork than
knowledge. There was to be another meeting of the legatees and
relatives of Basil Sixsmith. At that meeting the old lawyer would
again read the will and explain what the testator had intended.
Ivy hoped nothing from the second reading of the will. She was
content with matters as they stood.</p>

<p>Her godfather had been a wise man&mdash;a very wise man. He
had made her a partner in "Lorne, florists". She was to be Jack's
partner. He had explained that very carefully to her; explain
that in the business she held equal authority with himself. She
had not cared, but had listened&mdash;listened with a little
smile on her face, a big laugh in her heart. Men were
babies&mdash;and so very, very foolish!</p>

<p>As if "Lorne, florists" mattered now. As if it mattered
whether she had named the "unknown"&mdash;H.P. Pender. He had
sent her repeated apologies, because he had not been able to call
on her on account of the restrictions the doctor was imposing on
him. In his messages and notes he had named her "sister
invalid"&mdash;but she did not feel herself an invalid. She had
never felt happier, more healthy, in all her life. And yet she
had not solved the mystery and the problem her godfather had set
her. She did not want to&mdash;now. If she felt later that she
must know&mdash;then she would ask Jack, and he would tell her.
She was content for it to be so.</p>

<p>MARK KITHNER had come to her one evening, grave, careworn, yet
with his habitual courtesy&mdash;old-fashioned and likeable. He
had been solicitous regarding her health. She had laughed at him,
assuring him that she was quite well; that only the
old-maidishness of the menfolk surrounding her&mdash;supported by
Mary in their assumption of authority&mdash;kept her on the
couch.</p>

<p>He had laughed, in spite of the pain that furrowed his brows.
Ivy knew what lay behind those grave eyes the pain of his broken
faith in a son who had only escaped becoming a criminal because
of the failure of his associates to carry out their plans.</p>

<p>She had wanted to try and comfort him, but could not find the
words. She was sorry, very sorry. In her long talks with Jack she
had said so, not uncertainly. She had insisted that no one was to
suffer for the past. Everyone was to be free&mdash;to try to be
happy in a world that, to her, appeared to hold only
happiness.</p>

<p>A formal note from Mark Kithner had followed that visit. In it
he had, with formal courtesy, asked permission to call a meeting
of all interested in the Sixsmith estate, in the library of the
testator's house. He had stated that it would be a larger one
than when the will had been originally read. That she would have
to allow herself to be questioned on certain matters he did not
specify.</p>

<p>Just as formally&mdash;in mocking humour&mdash;she had replied
that the house was only hers for just over another two months,
and that her permission appeared unnecessary, yet was freely
given.</p>

<p>Jack had come to the house early on the day of the meeting. He
had arrived just as the luncheon gong sounded; yet the gathering
had been appointed for half-past two of that afternoon. He had
said that he was vitally interested in the reasons for the
meeting.</p>

<p>"Through me?" asked Ivy impertinently.</p>

<p>"As your future guardian," he had replied.</p>

<p>"Partner and guardian?" She looked at him provokingly.</p>

<p>"Woman!" He laughed. "Do you know that a male guardian to a
woman is only a legal anomaly. A woman attains her own way
always&mdash;and the younger she is the easier she gets it."</p>

<p>"Mercy," Mary cried. "What shall I entitle my novel, when I
write it? 'The Woman-Hater Married'?"</p>

<p>"I thought that women-haters were only created by being
married," retorted the young man.</p>

<p>"Or through fear of being married," interposed Ivy.</p>

<p>Then the maid had come to inform them that Mr. Kithner was in
the library, awaiting them.</p>

<p>At the door of the room, Ivy hesitated. The solicitor sat at
the big desk, bundles of papers before him. By him was a lounge
chair&mdash;vacant. Close to the door sat two men, bearing the
obvious marks of detectives. On straight uncomfortable-looking
chairs were Richard Kithner, Mrs. Western and Charlie Western,
his arm and shoulder heavily swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>Mark Kithner came to meet the girl at the door, and led her to
the seat by his own chair. Jack followed with Mary, finding a
seat for the girl close to Ivy, then lounged against the wall
immediately behind the girls. "We are awaiting the two Mr.
Penders," the solicitor announced, as he sat down.</p>

<p>As if answering, to their names, the maid opened the door and
ushered in the two men. Ivy rose to her feet, then sank back with
a gasp of astonishment. The two Penders were almost exactly
alike.</p>

<p>Carefully she scrutinised them, feature for feature. There was
hardly a difference between them; yet when they stood side by
side she could see that her Mr. Pender was the one she had
frightened at the Union Club. The one whom the taxi driver had
followed was the real Harold Pender, the man of the photograph.
She jumped to her feet again and went across the room&mdash;to
"her" Mr. Pender.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady!" Gratefully he took her strong young
arm.</p>

<p>"Have you forgiven me, Mr. Pender?" she asked in a low voice.
"Your illness is all my fault. It was wrong&mdash;very foolish
and wicked!"</p>

<p>"I have forgiven you." He laughed down at her. "But I will
forgive you all over again if you will tell me how you worked the
trick."</p>

<p>The girl went to the desk, and took from one of the drawers a
small, black box. "This is the secret."</p>

<p>She smiled slightly as she opened the end of the box. In it
was a small but powerful electric bulb. She took this out, and
from beyond it a glass slide&mdash;a photograph of the buhl box,
on which a photograph of her godfather had been imposed.</p>

<p>"So that is my enemy." Pender took the box and studied it.
"Really, a miniature magic-lantern."</p>

<p>"One of my godfather's toys&mdash;he was fond of them." The
girl laughed gently. "The lens will throw the image on to any
reflecting substance."</p>

<p>"A sheet of water, for instance." Pender smiled as he turned
to greet the lawyer; then found a seat next to his brother.</p>

<p>FOR A LONG moment there was silence in the room. Then Mark
Kithner commenced to speak:</p>

<p>"Under instructions from my late client, Basil Sixsmith, I
have again called a meeting of the legatees under his will. My
instructions provided for a meeting to take place on the last day
of the three months of Miss Breton's residence here; or, in the
event of certain happenings taking place. Mr. Sixsmith saw
clearly. The events he foresaw took place within a week of his
will being read for the first time."</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to explain that, Mr. Kithner?" asked
Jack.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western." The lawyer turned to the lady. "You received a
letter from Mr. Sixsmith the day after his death. Have you that
letter with you now? I asked you to bring it to this
meeting."</p>

<p>"I tore it up," Mrs. Western answered shortly.</p>

<p>"A pity." The lawyer commented. "Still I can explain its
contents, Mr. Sixsmith, after stating fully his intentions
contained in his will towards you and his god-daughter,
explicitly informed you that if you made any attempt to upset his
will, legally or otherwise, you would create your own
punishment."</p>

<p>"Tush!" Mrs. Western laughed. "He left me the house and its
contents. That was all he had to leave except his debts."</p>

<p>"There is some further property in our hands belonging to Mr.
Sixsmith," Harold Pender continued. "And certain securities."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" The lady laughed again. "That was what that
girl was talking about to the constable the other night. He
thought she was mad."</p>

<p>"On your suggestion." A grim smile played round the legal
lips. "Perhaps Mr. Pender can instruct us regarding the missing
securities?"</p>

<p>The younger of the two brothers rose to his feet, resting his
hand on his elder brother's shoulders. "My firm, Pender &amp;
Pender, were Mr. Sixsmith's brokers. We transacted a large amount
of business for him. Some time ago he entrusted a packet of
securities to us, with instructions to hand the packet to Miss
Breton, if, within three months of his death, she produced
authority for us to do so."</p>

<p>"But I did not produce the authority," exclaimed. Ivy.</p>

<p>"Acting on the advice of Mr. Kithner and our own solicitors,
we decided to hand the securities to you immediately after the
will had been read. For that purpose I wrote and asked you to
call and receive them from Mr. Tinker."</p>

<p>"But she did not produce the authority&mdash;you did not carry
out Mr. Sixsmith's Instructions!" Charlie Western exclaimed
suddenly.</p>

<p>"We believed, and our solicitors supported us in the belief, that we held a certain discretion," Harold Pender answered
briefly. "At the present moment Miss Breton is in charge of the
securities. We have no doubt that she will deal with them
honestly."</p>

<p>"If Iv&mdash;Miss Breton cannot produce the authority, then
the securities belong to me." Mrs. Western brightened
considerably. "I thought you claimed that Mr. Sixsmith did not
leave any property other than this house and its contents."</p>

<p>The solicitor spoke dryly. "I have evidence that the
securities exist."</p>

<p>Harold Pender interrupted. "The bonds are registered against
Mr. Sixsmith's name in our books; the shares cannot be dealt with
without the transfers we hold."</p>

<p>"Then where are they?" The woman laughed shortly. "If that
girl got her hands oh them&mdash;" she shrugged. "Fortunately my
son took possession of them and gave them to me."</p>

<p>The solicitor looked almost pleadingly at the girl. She smiled
and nodded. From among the papers on the desk Mark Kithner took a
packet and handed it to Ivy. "Is that the packet you received
from Mr. Abel Tinker, Miss Breton?"</p>

<p>Again the girl nodded. "Then, if you will produce the
authority, Miss Breton, I will formally hand them over to
you."</p>

<p>"But I haven't got it." The girl looked surprised.</p>

<p>"He was very interested in an oil prospecting company named
'The Big Boy.'"</p>

<p>"'The Big Boy?'" Ivy exclaimed. "Why, god-dad wrote such a
funny letter about that."</p>

<p>She went to the desk, and from a drawer produced the strange
letter she had found in her godfather's, private box at the
G.P.O., handing, it to the solicitor. He studied it for a moment,
in evident bewilderment, then slowly read it aloud.</p>

<p>"May I see that note, please?" Mr. Herbert Pender went to the
desk. "I think I can help Miss Breton here."</p>

<p>He took the note and studied, it carefully, then turned to the
desk and picked up the buhl box. With it in his hand, he went to
where the girl sat.</p>

<p>"Miss Breton," he said with a little smile. "Will you look at
the front of this box? See if you can make out any letters among
the ornamentations."</p>

<p>For some seconds Ivy studied the strange box. Then she looked
up.</p>

<p>"I think I can see letters," she said, doubtfully. "Yes, there
is a letter in each corner. Here is an 'N'. In this corner is an
'E'. Why, they are arranged and lettered like the four points of
the compass."</p>

<p>"And this note." Herbert Pender took the strange letter, and
handed it to Ivy. "Have you studied the signature?"</p>

<p>"NEWS." The girl spelt the signature. Suddenly enlightenment
came. "Why, here are the four points of the compass again."</p>

<p>"Then press the letters in the corner of the box in the order
named in the letter."</p>

<p>At the girl's look of astonishment, he added: "Remember, I
told you I once owned this box." The girl obeyed, then stared at
the box. Nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"Now open the box." The man smiled reassuringly. Ivy touched
the spring, and the lid flew back. She gave a cry of
astonishment. The bottom of the box had come up in two sections,
revealing a lower, secret compartment. In it was a folded paper.
She took it out and opened it.</p>

<p>It was an authority for her to receive a packet of papers
deposited with Messrs. Pender &amp; Pender, and signed by her
godfather. She handed it to the lawyer. He read it, and passed it
to the broker.</p>

<p>"I think that is sufficient authority for you, Mr. Pender," he
said quietly, "Please remember, in this matter I am acting for
Miss Breton."</p>

<p>"Quite sufficient." Harold Pender went and sat beside his
brother again.</p>

<p>"My mother will contest that." Charlie Western was on his
feet. "That is a deed of gift and is voided by the giver's death
within a twelve-month."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Western may do as she pleases," Mark Kithner frowned.
"It is my duty to again read the Will."</p>

<p>"What's the good?" Mrs. Western exclaimed. "We all know
it."</p>

<p>"I don't think so." The solicitor smiled. "I had to remind
you of the letter you received from your half-brother in which he
warned you not to interfere with Miss Breton or this house within
three months of his death. He told you that any action of yours
would bring its own punishment. It has."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then continued:</p>

<p>"Acting on written instructions I received from the testator,
on the former occasion I read only part of the will. I omitted to
read a clause that would only become operative it Mrs. Western
disregarded an injunction her half-brother had laid on her. As
Mrs. Western is satisfied that she remembers the will I read, I
take it that I need only now read the clause I formerly
omitted&mdash;the clause which now comes into operation following
Mrs. Western's and her son's peculiar behaviour in this house a
week ago."</p>

<p>For a long minute there was silence while the solicitor found
the will and opened it.</p>

<p>Then he read: "And I further declare that if at any time
during three months following my death my half-sister, Martha
Western, or her son, Charles Western, by themselves or by their
agents, dispossess or attempt to dispossess my god-daughter, Ivy
Breton, of the free use and comfort of my house and its contents
aforementioned, then I revoke any and all monies and goods I have
bequeathed to them in this, my last will and testament, and
direct that my god-daughter, Ivy Breton, above-mentioned, shall
become my sole legatee and executor. I ask her that from the
estate that she will receive, to pay such legacies as I have
bequeathed to persons who have served me during my life time, and
which are set out in this document."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?" Charlie Western strode to the desk, his
face white with passion.</p>

<p>"The will is exact." The solicitor looked up with a little
smile in his eyes. "You and your mother have twice attempted to
dispossess Miss Breton of her free use of this house and its
contents. By this will, therefore, your mother forfeits all
interest in the house and contents, which revert to Miss Breton.
Is that clear?"</p>

<p>For a moment lawyer and man stared at each other. Then Charlie
Western swung round and jerked his mother to her feet. With a
sneering laugh he dragged the woman to the door. There he turned,
speaking furiously.</p>

<p>"We're going to fight this," he shouted. "I'll see to that. If
you think you can get away with that sort of thing&mdash;well,
you won't."</p>

<p>At a sign from the lawyer the two men at the door followed
the Westerns out of the room. As the door closed, Kithner turned
to the girl with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"A very unpleasant afternoon, Miss Breton," he said. "Now, may
I be the first to congratulate you on your inheritance?"</p>

<p>"But why did godfather do this?" The girl was perplexed.</p>

<p>"Because he was well aware of his half-sister's character. He
knew that if he willed his property to you direct, she would
contest the will; that you would be caused quite an amount of
trouble and annoyance. But he knew that if he left matters as he
did that either she or her son would put themselves in the wrong
so thoroughly that when his real intentions became known, neither
of them could possibly complain."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, then added: "But I don't think that
even Basil Sixsmith thought those two would go to the lengths
they did, or he would have taken another course."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who was the burglar?" Mary asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"The burglar was Charlie Western," Jack answered.</p>

<p>"But there were two," Mary protested. "And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Me," Jack laughed. "I saw Western come in at the door and
followed, curious to know what he wanted in my partner's house.
He came to the library and copied the photograph and letter. As
he was leaving the room he heard Ivy come down the stairs, and
hid. When she came out of the library carrying the photograph he
sprang on her. I took her from him and knocked him down.
Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you took the photograph and letter." Ivy looked up at
the young man, laughing. "And I took you for burglar."</p>

<p>"I sent them back to you," Jack protested.</p>

<p>"Not the letter. I found that on your office floor."</p>

<p>"Then it got out of the parcel while I was packing it." Jack
grinned. "So that's the end of all the mystery."</p>

<p>"Not quite," the girl faced him seriously. "There was a man
who telephoned me claiming that god-dad owed him five thousand
pounds, who was he?"</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Charles Western." Kithner's face was troubled. "I
think he can explain that. The whole matter was, my dear, that
they were trying to frighten and worry you. Thank God, they
didn't succeed."</p>

<p>"I'll take care they don't get another chance." Jack spoke
grimly.</p>

<p>"And who will take care of you?" Ivy looked up, smiling. "My
partner, of course." Very quietly, the others went from the room.
Mary Varney was the last to leave and she turned in the doorway,
looking back with wistful eyes on the two, utterly engrossed in
each other. A little smile came of her lips. She was a worker;
romance had little to do with her life. But, she was beginning to
understand. Work is good; very good&mdash;but there are even
better things, in Life.</p>
